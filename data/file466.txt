4660122 the results of the survey so far show that although most companies understand the importance of having business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place there seems to be a knowledge gap when it comes to understanding the technologies that are currently available to deliver reliable and fast recovery in the event of a system failure these days it is not enough to blindly trust that backups are being completed properly businesses and the regulatory environment in which we all exist demand fast and reliable recovery time objectives for it systems such is the pace at which a modern company transacts business these days that those who are without their it for any great length of time are losing serious money customers are also becoming a lot more aware of the information that companies hold and are getting less and less forgiving about delivery disruption let alone the thought of their sensitive data being transported in a an unencrypted and readable format
4660123 this change in causes of data loss can possibly be attributed to improvements in software and hardware resiliency in the last two years which has reduced the number of hardware and software failures affecting computers changing the way these threats need to be addressed in business continuity and disaster recovery plans moving forward

4660131 just imagine the collective impact of say 6 bits pilani campuses and 10 alumni founded colleges after 5 years without doubt this will help make bits pilani as probably the biggest brand for engineering education in india
4660132 we are working on a common structure guidelines and use of a common name which will also help strengthen bits pilani brand obviously these colleges will not use bits name and will be at locations where bits pilani does not plan to open a campus these colleges will take complementary role to bits pilani in all aspects and potential areas for collaboration and cooperation will be soon explored

4660142 lenders have been lambasted from all sides the financial services authority has accused them of treating customers unfairly and not helping people through their difficulties and the citizens advice bureau accused them of aggressive behaviour and using court action as a first rather than last resort
4660143 if lenders had provided more affordable mortgage ppi policies that match my prices i suspect more people would be able to keep their homes although not all those struggling to make repayments have lost an income due to redundancy it is a key factor homeowners who lose their wage could wait up to nine months for any government help in meeting their mortgage payments as support has been delayed from six months if they had ppi they would receive back to day one payments and have their mortgage repayments met for up to a year
4660144 i worry far more families than this will be affected which is why lenders must act now and stop offering cover that is at least four times more expensive than mine
4660145 this cover wont solve everyones financial problems but it will at least help those who do face the threat of redundancy lenders have a duty of care to make this insurance affordable and easily accessible

4660184 personally i think norton is one of the most annoying programs ever created and its so hard to deal with
4660185 windows live onecare seemed to be over engineered and it created serious problems for us it seemed to randomly change the network settings on certain pcs without our knowledge and other so called brand name products were just as bad
4660186 our pcs are used for point of sale pos customer support and accounting so its vital that theyre fully protected pretty much every aspect of this business is dependent on our computers being up and running at all times a virus infection would effectively shut down the business
4660187 with a relatively small number of pcs hard costs are not a big issue for us
4660188 but soft costs like my time are extremely important so we really wanted to find an anti virus solution that would provide solid protection without needing a lot of administrative attention
4660189 through word of mouth i heard that some other small businesses were running avg and were very pleased with it
4660190 i decided to give it a try and contacted walling data online to talk about the product whether it would meet our needs and what pricing and licensing options wed be looking at
4660191 i sent walling data an email to get a price quote and we were happy with it
4660192 so i placed the order they helped us to deploy the software and it was all very quick and easy
4660193 i have had to take advantage of the free support a few times for minor things

4660195 because we dont have a dedicated it department to handle software problems i was very happy to discover how easy avg was to manage
4660196 we have also found that avg doesnt have any impact on pc performance most of the time you dont even know its there and the price is fantastic

4660250 its so bad that we could lose it really fast
4660251 the processing is unravelling farm infrastructure is unravelling plants are closing and we see the loss of farms
4660252 we need to change really quickly we dont have any time to study this anymore we need to do something

4660278 we will never ever surrender give up our freedom and territory we will definitely get rid of these invaders for good i am totally convinced of that
4660279 the west made a great miscalculation people underestimated the threat
4660280 saakashvilis public statements are aimed at domestic consumption they are for the georgia public to listen to and in terms of rhetoric the russians are doing the same

4660282 resolving a territorial dispute over south ossetia and abkhazia will be much harder
4660283 weve been very concerned that both sides have not been following the geneva conventions and supporting international humanitarian law here
4660284 its quite shocking that in the year that 107 countries have agreed to ban cluster bombs that the russians are using them in this conflict now
4660285 clearly we need to have some international body come here and do some credible investigation
4660286 just to look at statements of casualties the russians are claiming 2 000 dead in south ossetia our investigation has shown 44 at this point so we really need to have someone discern what the truth is

4660291 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4660292 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century

4660295 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4660296 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4660297 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4660298 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life

4660354 i had no idea it was so difficult for multiracials
4660355 i think most people in the united states assume that individuals are in one and one only racial group
4660356 its the younger generation that is becoming more aware that these lines dont make sense
4660357 i dont think this is something he can simply say through words if he says im biracial or im half white

4660365 many people have periodontal disease the reason why they have missing teeth compounding the problem is the fact that very few people have access to quality dental care because of a severe lack of dentists in many parts of the world
4660366 these dental cripples cannot tolerate dentures because they are uncomfortable and inconvenient dental implants can help these people lead normal lives again just as they have helped over a million people worldwide
4660367 these people are doing a good job in advancing this new technology and changing the face of dentistry i have learned a lot from them and my patients will certain benefit from this as well
4660368 i look forward to the day when oral implantology will be included in the curriculum of dental schools here we cannot ignore advances in dentistry

4660374 the practice of medicine by unlicensed persons or the application of treatments which are not generally recognized as appropriate by the profession

4660381 even after one receives a default notice one should contact the lender and open up discussions
4660382 este es un partido muy complicado el m s dif cil que nos pudo haber tocado en turno es jaguares por todo el ambiente que rodea porque ellos juegan de local obviamente est n necesitados de ganar y eso los hace sumamente complicados de vencer
4660383 ellos recuperan adem s para ma ana a itamar batista y a oscar rojas va a ser dif cil y tenemos que tomarlo con toda la seriedad debida no hay que caer en excesos de confianza
4660384 pienso que s se tiene que ganar ahora que somos locales no podemos desperdiciar ning n punto
4660385 la disposici n desde que calentamos como que sal amos medio floj n pero ahora veo bien al equipo y no tengo duda que vamos a hacer un buen partido y haremos bien las cosas
4660386 es un reto importante para demostrar que podemos con el l der general no son invencibles hemos trabajado bien y creo que ser un buen partido
4660387 la verdad es que lo primordial y lo que necesitamos hoy por hoy es ganar despu s de las dos derrotas en las que ca mos necesitamos volver al triunfo para acomodarnos en el torneo
4660388 generalmente cuando hay derrotas existen errores y la idea es que eso no se acumule sino sacarnos de encima y sobre todo tener buen funcionamiento creo que el equipo debe de mejorar much simo en muchos aspectos pero obviamente el hecho de no recibir goles va a ser bueno
4660389 esto reci n empieza pero habla liderato de que es un equipo que hace buen trabajo llevan un par de a os siendo de los equipos m s regulares est n en liguilla por ah tienen gente grande que quiz no tiene mucha din mica pero que tiene mucha experiencia que maneja los partidos y eso les da muchos frutos
4660390 tenemos que apoyar a m xico hay que apoyar este primer partido tenemos que provocar un ambiente propicio para que se pueda ganar el partido y as conducirnos de una buena manera tendremos la posibilidad de seguir luchando para estar alg n d a en la selecci n
4660391 estaremos en nuestro pa s es el primer partido y es importante ganarlo esperemos que sea el tiempo id neo el que tengan para ganarlo
4660392 no estoy en contra de los naturalizados para naturalizarte es porque se quiere al pa s lo bueno lo malo porque aceptan estar en la ciudad donde se vive por la idiosincrasia porque te gust la vecina en su amabilidad eso es querer a un pa s eso es querer naturalizarse porque se quiere al pa s
4660393 s creo que si te naturalizas para jugar al futbol no est bien desde ese punto de vista no estoy de acuerdo
4660394 es un equipo muy completo es muy fuerte pero nosotros vamos con la mentalidad de ganar
4660395 hemos trabajado muchas llegadas por afuera sobre todo los centros para ser m s contundentes algo que nos ha faltado y traernos los tres puntos teniendo una actitud ganadora
4660396 a ellos a los panzas verdes les faltan jugadores pero siempre es un rival fuerte todos cuentan hemos visto como trabajan y los tenemos estudiados
4660397 trabaje los centros para ser m s efectivo para que lleguen los delanteros y metan los goles
4660398 nos han perjudicado en los ltimos partidos no digo que adrede pero si nos ha costado desde la liguilla hubo arbitrajes complicados esperamos que ahora esta gente sea m s capaz
4660399 ha sido una semana en la cual las llamadas a la casa se dividen poquito mi pap es chivas cien por ciento pero nosotros estamos en necaxa y defenderemos a la instituci n con todo lo posible y hasta con lo que no est a nuestro alcance para poder ganar y sumar tres puntos es un escenario que queremos aprovechar
4660400 durante esta semana mejor ni nos hablamos ya luego del resultado nos preguntamos c mo nos fue y nos saludamos y punto todo esto es parte del juego s que mi pap quiere el triunfo de chivas l es chivas pero tambi n entiende que yo estoy de este lado y tambi n quiero el triunfo
4660401 la motivaci n siempre es importante s que aunque no haya ese premio econ mico mis jugadores saldr n a dar todo en el campo de juego pero bueno si hay ese plus es bienvenido pero este equipo se mueve m s por otras cosas que por ese estimulo econ mico extra
4660402 important simo vamos a tratar de aprovechar ese aparador que aunque sabemos que la mayor a de gente ir apoyando a chivas creo que nos podremos hacer notar y convencer todav a m s a la gente de que estamos para cosas importantes
4660403 sal por la ma ana y si la informaci n se distorsion un poco fue porque ped yo encarecidamente que fuera de esa forma pues soy hijo nico tengo una madre mayor y no s c mo fuera a tomar la noticia

4660455 mommy mommy why has daddy got so few hairs on his head
4660456 im not saying there are gravesites on that side of the fence but the probability is probably high
4660457 the big concern was that they were encroaching on gravesites although they were on private property
4660458 some survey work was done in that area and did not show any plots
4660459 im sure the survey is accurate as far as the property ownership goes the fence line but that survey didnt include any underground testing

4660509 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
4660510 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
4660511 i think not im terribly sorry its not going backwards it is actually recognising that we are with nature not against it we have gone working against nature for too long
4660512 look at indias green revolution it worked for a short time but now the price is being paid
4660513 i have been to the punjab where you have seen the disasters that have taken place as result of the over demand on irrigation because of the hybrid seeds and grains that have been produced which demand huge amounts of water
4660514 the water table has disappeared they have huge problems with water level with pesticide problems and complications which are now coming home to roost
4660515 look at western australia huge salinisation problems i have been there seen it some of the excessive approaches to modern forms of agriculture
4660516 if you are not working with natural assistance you cause untold problems which become very expensive and very difficult to undo it places impossible burdens on nature and leads to accumulating problems which become more difficult to sort out

4660543 saya bersumpah dengan nama allah di masjid wilayah persekutuan mengikut cara dituntut agama islam seperti dinasihatkan dan tunjuk ajar para ulama serta mufti saya diliwat anwar ibrahim
4660544 dengan ini saya mencabar anwar supaya bersumpah dengan cara sama untuk menafikan dakwaan saya tidak benar
4660545 saya menyembunyikan diri selama ini kerana ingin mengumpul kekuatan sebab difitnah serta ditohmah dan hari ini jumaat adalah hari terbaik untuk melafazkan sumpah
4660546 but they mean home and we dont want to lose our homeland
4660547 up to this point i had to do some work by hand but from now on the apparatus should work entirely on its own
4660548 of course breakdowns do happen i really hope none will occur today but we must be prepared for it the apparatus is supposed to keep going for twelve hours without interruption but if any breakdowns do occur theyll only be very minor and well deal with them right away
4660549 whether the commandant has already explained the apparatus to you
4660550 is our previous commandants invention i also worked with him on the very first tests and took part in all the work right up to its completion however the credit for the invention belongs to him alone have you heard of our previous commandant no well im not claiming too much when i say that the organization of the entire penal colony is his work we his friends already knew at the time of his death that the administration of the colony was so self contained that even if his successor had a thousand new plans in mind he would not be able to alter anything of the old plan at least not for several years and our prediction has held the new commandant has had to recognize that its a shame that you didnt know the previous commandant
4660551 im chattering and his apparatus stands here in front of us as you see it consists of three parts with the passage of time certain popular names have been developed for each of these parts the one underneath is called the bed the upper one is called the inscriber and here in the middle this moving part is called the harrow
4660552 the name fits the needles are arranged as in a harrow and the whole thing is driven like a harrow although it stays in one place and is in principle much more artistic youll understand in a moment the condemned is laid out here on the bed first ill describe the apparatus and only then let the procedure go to work that way youll be able to follow it better also a sprocket in the inscriber is excessively worn it really squeaks when its in motion one can hardly make oneself understood unfortunately replacement parts are difficult to come by in this place so here is the bed as i said the whole thing is completely covered with a layer of cotton wool the purpose of which youll find out in a moment the condemned man is laid out on his stomach on the cotton wool naked of course there are straps for the hands here for the feet here and for the throat here to tie him in securely at the head of the bed here where the man as i have mentioned first lies face down is this small protruding lump of felt which can easily be adjusted so that it presses right into the mans mouth its purpose is to prevent him screaming and biting his tongue to pieces of course the man has to let the felt in his mouth otherwise the straps around his throat would break his neck
4660553 its a specially prepared cotton wool thats why it looks so unrecognizable ill get around to mentioning its purpose in a moment
4660554 now listen both the bed and the inscriber have their own electric batteries the bed needs them for itself and the inscriber for the harrow as soon as the man is strapped in securely the bed is set in motion it quivers with tiny very rapid oscillations from side to side and up and down simultaneously you will have seen similar devices in mental hospitals only with our bed all movements are precisely calibrated for they must be meticulously coordinated with the movements of the harrow but its the harrow which has the job of actually carrying out the sentence
4660555 then was he in his own person a combination of everything was he soldier judge engineer chemist and draftsman
4660556 our sentence does not sound severe the law which a condemned man has violated is inscribed on his body with the harrow this condemned man for example
4660557 it would be useless to give him that information he experiences it on his own body
4660558 but does he nonetheless have some general idea that hes been condemned
4660559 then does the man also not yet know how his defence was received
4660560 but he must have had a chance to defend himself
4660561 be forever feeble and thoughtless and mindless and simple little people mind you keep your eyes focused upon the television set and of course sit

4660579 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4660580 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4660581 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4660582 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4660583 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4660584 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4660585 i was shocked at the end it was kind of a little bit of a delayed reaction
4660586 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i had lost the race right there but i guess that was the difference in the end
4660587 i was starting to hurt for the last 10 metres it was my last individual race and i just wanted to finish as strong as i could

4660589 thecall is a fast not a festival thecall is a solemn assembly not a conference
4660590 there will be no advertised bands and no promoted speakers as our purpose is not to promote any man or ministry
4660591 we believe that our nation is in a critical hour and in desperate need of revival while our societys moral compass continues to erode the faith of our nation is becoming increasingly secularized
4660592 if you havent got the cash tough you cant buy it
4660593 i dont think anything that went on in these chambers affected him
4660594 his entire life as best i can tell is one in which hes always been a thoughtful listener and questioner but hes never stepped up to the plate and taken full swings
4660595 self determinism as opposed to paternalism strength in numbers his concept of community development
4660596 a case of the nerves both at the plate and on the mound
4660597 these guys are more nervous now than they were on the baseball field i promise
4660598 i started watching them really when shaun alexander came there but now hes gone
4660599 and walter jones is one of those guys you always emulate as a tackle he makes it look so easy then you get out there and its a little harder than he makes it look
4660600 ohio stadium where i played in college is loud but im sure pro stadiums are much louder
4660601 you just have to watch the ball or do whatever you have to do to get off on the count
4660602 it is a loud stadium that just goes to their fans my ability to focus and lock in is going to really have to shine in this game
4660603 its really hard for the tackles because if were not going on a silent count they have to look at the ball and worry about blocking the defensive end at the same time
4660604 i would tell the younger guys to stay focused and get a good jump on the count we just finished camp so they should have the rhythm of the quarterback down that should allow them to anticipate the snap count instead of being late off the ball
4660605 i just want to be part of this team a part of this season and help this team win in any way possible
4660606 we need another perfect one to get him in that top six shoot off

4660608 after what happened its unlikely ossetians and abkhazians will ever be able to live together with georgia in one state
4660609 russian forces need to leave georgia at once this is no longer 1968
4660610 there was no way i could stand in the sun any longer
4660611 we were led to believe that together with the u s we could stand up to the russians it turned out to be an illusion
4660612 we are calling on the west to stop this russian aggression
4660613 dont let them attack tbilisi remember what the russians did to the chechens we deserve peace
4660614 we told the world this is about starting an invasion
4660615 the entire responsibility for the conflict for cruel actions committed lies on the shoulders of the georgian leadership
4660616 russia will respect any decision on future status of south ossetia and abkhazia that reflects the breakaway republics wishes
4660617 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4660619 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4660620 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4660621 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4660622 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4660623 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4660647 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4660648 the verbal assurance that president dmitry medvedev gave that russian military operations had stopped clearly was not honoured
4660649 yes ideally we would like a vote formalizing the ceasefire this weekend
4660650 but well take as long as it takes we are not going to push for a vote if we know that the russians will veto the text which does not mean we have to give in to all their demands there has to be hard bargaining
4660651 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4660652 moscow must honour its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4660653 never ever will georgia reconcile itself with the occupation of even one square kilometre of its territory
4660654 i just ran the first 50 meters then i looked around to make sure i was safe and i shut it off
4660655 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could

4660661 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4660662 some uw counseling directors indicated that without an infusion of additional funds it will be difficult for their institutions to effectively address the future challenges
4660663 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog

4660687 vuoi dire che dovr ascoltare stairway to heaven al contrario
4660688 io ho conosciuto uomini che hanno dedicato la loro esistenza a cercarle a immaginarle a tentare di comporle ho visto le loro facce spaurite i loro occhi persi nel vuoto ho palpato la loro passione le loro speranze il loro dramma e adesso ti dico che essi non hanno sprecato le loro vite

4660805 i grew up watching ed mcmahon i think hes a terrific guy
4660806 even a man who hadnt had such a great career shouldnt have this happen to them in their later years im doing my best but this is a very difficult situation
4660807 lets just see what the deal is and what were offered
4660808 in a typical deal the person who buys it is doing it as an investment because its a good piece of property
4660809 so they expect the person living there to cover the carrying costs the insurance the gardening the utilities the taxes when a persons in trouble they dont even have the money to even do that so a lot of them go very sour
4660810 youre acting as a child protecting your parent theyre hoping itll be a good investment but if not its going to be there
4660811 ethics is how we behave when we decide we belong together
4660812 they jump on me and say they miss me and they was happy to see me
4660813 i like to settle down im kind of a family guy
4660814 either you can do it or you cant surely it doesnt take two to five years to get this resolved
4660815 people say we were coming and steal their jobs people say we were coming and do crimes i say most of the people they just come to work a lot of people like to stay
4660816 responded and apparently it isnt good enough that he posted his birth certificate
4660817 they say they want it because they claim he is not a citizen of the united states its pretty ridiculous
4660818 and whether it shows through depends on how much force was put into it
4660819 potentially if you have that number you could break into the system
4660820 to see if they could try and resolve the issue with the people who were asking questions
4660821 they responded and apparently it isnt good enough that he posted his birth certificate
4660822 they say they want it because they claim he is not a citizen of the united states its pretty ridiculous
4660823 there is not one shred of evidence to disprove politifacts conclusion that the candidates name is barack hussein obama or to support allegations that the birth certificate he released isnt authentic and thats true no matter how many people cling to some hint of doubt and use the internet to fuel their innate sense of distrust
4660824 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4660825 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4660826 the third pillar of a spiritual relationship is the silence
4660827 in some relationships the partner will not bear the silence
4660828 in the west the current ideal is that the people of free will form a relationship with each other and i am very close to this ideal
4660829 could a couple brought together by the parents achieve similar conditions
4660830 imagine you were a member of a small group of thirteen people
4660831 just say to yourself he twelve wherever you are and whenever you hear me you need me and i need you one way of love brings us together at the door of happiness hatred could be our fall
4660832 thus would perhaps humanity failed on hatred faile in the early hours if there were not the capacity in each of us to show the other the way love

4660834 the no 1 issue is lets get the long term tax credit in place now so that my friend john doerr in silicon valley can put money into renewable energy and create jobs
4660835 al gore wants to go to the batteries and thats fine with me but we are not going to make a big cut in 10 years without natural gas
4660836 natural gas is a bridge to batteries and hydrogen it will give you 20 years until you get the right battery and hydrogen technologies
4660837 america faces a choice a continuation of the bush cheney mccain approach that perpetuates the failed policies that have produced soaring prices or a comprehensive bipartisan strategy that develops new and traditional sources of energy
4660838 not in favour of traditional marriage and i pray that we wont get stuck with him
4660839 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4660840 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
4660841 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
4660842 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4660843 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4660844 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
4660845 one of the things that gets my goat are statements that ive heard that the debate is over
4660846 its my understanding that the earth has warmed up and cooled down hundreds of times
4660847 in general conservative really doesnt fare well in any kind of statewide election
4660848 the classic example is brett schundler who even though he came out of jersey city and was really non partisan every time he ran he couldnt shake the conservative label in new jersey politics in the last 20 or 30 years the conservative label has been really the kiss of death
4660849 the fact of the matter is that assemblyman dohertys opinion has no bearing on the reality of global warming
4660850 he can believe that jesus had a pet dinosaur if he wants but it doesnt make it true there is practically no credible dissention within the scientific community about the facts that doherty refuses to accept this is not a conservative or liberal issue nor should it be he is simply on the wrong side of reality
4660851 some of the things we voted on today are merely diversionary theyre trying to divide people
4660852 i think new jerseys got a tremendous number of irish and italian catholics and im proud to be irish catholic
4660853 people vote for many reasons or no reason whatsoever other than hey that guy has a similar background to me the republican party needs to run some people with ys or vowels at the end of the name i think that would produce some better results
4660854 mars is being hit by rapid climate change and it is happening so fast that the red planet could lose its southern ice cap writes jonathan leake scientists from nasa say that mars has warmed by about 0 5c since the 1970s this is similar to the warming experienced on earth over approximately the same period since there is no known life on mars it suggests rapid changes in planetary climates could be natural phenomena the mechanism at work on mars appears however to be different from that on earth one of the researchers lori fenton believes variations in radiation and temperature across the surface of the red planet are generating strong winds
4660855 4 he is more concerned about running in the 2008 republican primary for us senator then in caring and working for his district that he now represents maybe for only a few short months
4660856 do you mind taking one of me and my mother in law
4660857 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4660858 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4660859 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4660860 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4660861 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4660862 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
4660863 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
4660864 what do you want your look to say to people
4660865 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4660866 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4660867 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4660868 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4660869 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4660870 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4660871 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
4660872 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4660873 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4660874 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4660875 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4660876 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4660877 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4660878 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4660879 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4660880 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4660881 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4660882 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4660883 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4660884 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4660885 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4660886 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4660887 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4660888 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4660889 north pole may be ice free for first time this summer
4660890 we dont need three presidents and thats what you would have if hillary was picked barack hillary and bill
4660891 garbage collectors would inspect san francisco residents trash to make sure pizza crusts arent mixed in with chip bags or wine bottles under a proposal by mayor gavin newsom
4660892 jimmy i dont want you playing with the williams boys anymore their family doesnt recycle
4660893 we now live in a society where sunday church attendance is down but people wouldnt dream of missing their weekly trek to the altar of the recycling center
4660894 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4660895 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4660896 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4660897 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4660898 yes i can say that they patched the most serious of the vulnerabilities but i cannot confirm that they have patched or havent patched the other two
4660899 if you look at our timeline youll see that there was some disagreement about whether the two bugs were security bugs
4660900 a 170 check is not worth maine families being cold this winter if opponents of a special session to invest surplus funds into liheap are concerned with costs they should join republicans in support of saving the taxpayers over 31 000 each day a special session is held
4660901 id be remiss if i didnt say hello buddy cianci mayor of providence
4660902 i want you to know i was wearing my rhode island democrats t shirt when i was exercising this morning put that in the paper
4660903 i get amused when i see that stern faced young man from colorado extolling the merits of assault weapons
4660904 i didnt see any donkeys although we heard a weird sound when we first got in here
4660905 they must have you know seen me coming but they all hid somewhere
4660906 i dont care if you have jesus christ in the van
4660907 no i know if i needed to get out id make my way out just as i made my way in you have to see the possibilities
4660908 if my opponent had been there at the moon launch it would have been called a risky rocket scheme
4660909 if hed been there when edison was testing the light bulb it would have been a risky anti candle scheme
4660910 and if hed been there when the internet was invented
4660911 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
4660912 i dont think the people of the city of detroit should be represented by a person wearing prison clothes or wearing a tether
4660913 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4660914 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4660915 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4660916 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4660917 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4660918 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4660919 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4660920 why it makes a difference public figures on their faith
4660921 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4660922 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4660923 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4660924 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4660925 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4660926 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4660927 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4660928 it felt like history in the making one of those landmark films that people will be talking about for ever
4660929 we were always frustrated that people saw cg computer generated imagery as a genre as opposed to just a medium that could tell any kind of story we felt like we widened the palette with
4660930 i dont have much of a political bent and the last thing i want to do is preach i just went with things that i felt were logical for a possible future and supported the point of my story which was the premise that irrational love defeats lifes programming and that the most robotic beings ive met are us
4660931 its a wake up call telling people that the stewardship of the planet is a simple human responsibility but also that its a humans responsibility to live their life themes are not just topical theyre universal if you dont take action and you dont take responsibility and you dont exert your humanity you can lose it thats a timeless message but its not one you see in hollywood movies every day
4660932 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4660933 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4660934 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4660935 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4660936 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4660937 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4660938 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4660939 the vice presidency is the most important decison i can make before i become president this will be my final councelor in the white house
4660940 that is about as lucrative a program as ive ever heard of
4660941 you wouldnt be able to find that anywhere in corporate america or elsewhere
4660942 i lose more money than i make during the session our work is a 365 day a year job so there has to be recognition of that
4660943 we must take that last long jump to universal availability
4660944 if you believe it is a priority why wouldnt you fully fund it
4660945 i think just about every other state in the union offers it
4660946 it is outright unacceptable that the daniels administration turned its back on the states most vulnerable hoosiers of low income children adults and seniors opting instead to forge ahead with another attempt to privatize more of indiana all under the guise of savings
4660947 ive been going over jills plan and im tremendously impressed
4660948 why is the size of your premium determined by the size of your business thats just not right im going to make it possible for small businesses to negotiate lower insurance rates like big companies
4660949 jon stated stay out all night sleep all day because that is what i would be doing by saying this jon really emphasized taking advantage of every day
4660950 how it was lived thats what matters in our memory and in the world to come
4660951 you have in my view achieved the highest level of citizenship raised a good son
4660952 i think that its a very significant statement by speaker nancy pelosi last night that to use her words the house can have a vote on more domestic drilling this represents evidence that the democratic leadership is hearing from the american people is hearing from many democrats in the congress who would like an opportunity to vote on more domestic drilling and i welcome it but i still believe congress should not wait until this fall or sometime around christmas after the elections to give the american people more access to american oil
4660953 it would be better to give less of a raise and have jobs than give bigger raises and then in a year have to cut
4660954 should the assessing duties of the elected township assessor in the township be transferred to the county assessor
4660955 porter county is not an island its not a gulag
4660956 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4660957 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4660958 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4660959 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4660960 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4660961 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4660962 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4660963 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4660964 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4660965 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4660966 whatever you do dont substitute oo especially evoo or your cake will taste like olives
4660967 the first paper i ever gave on climate change was trying to disprove that increases in greenhouse gases could be causing these observed trends in temperature
4660968 i was a sceptic the starting point was that this cant be happening what we actually found was the more and more we looked the more and more agreement there was between greenhouse gas increases and warming in the lower atmosphere and cooling in the stratosphere which is the pattern under climate change
4660969 i become frustrated because there is no requirement to be truthful in an opinion piece
4660970 it is amazing to me that rather than going to csiro the national academy of sciences in the us the australian academy of sciences or other scientific organisations from around the world that are all consistently providing the same evidence a significant proportion of the federal shadow cabinet and many others in the liberal party and national party and other interest groups are collecting information not from reputable sources but from websites which may or may not be funded by a right wing lobby group or a fossil fuel company which says there is a conspiracy but im not surprised people like to hear information that confirms their underlying beliefs
4660971 if you dont believe them you really should go read what the original scientific papers say
4660972 i had this dilemma first of all when i was approached that its stupid because they are not going to listen and they dont care but then i thought about it a little more
4660973 its better to be engaged and try to do it from the inside as part of the process than to snipe from the outside and to be ignored
4660974 it is probably becoming more reasonable to say the state government is no longer burying its head in the sand but it might just be looking in the other direction when some important decisions need to be made
4660975 i am very very concerned that it will have negligible impact for the first five to 10 years
4660976 we were effectively tossing coins and finding nine out of 10 are coming up heads and thats over 29 000 coin tosses
4660977 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4660978 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4660979 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4660980 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4660981 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4660982 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4660983 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4660984 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4660985 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4660986 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4660987 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4660988 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4660989 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4660990 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4660991 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4660992 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4660993 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4660994 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4660995 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
4660996 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
4660997 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
4660998 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
4660999 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
4661000 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
4661001 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
4661002 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4661003 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4661004 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4661005 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4661006 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4661007 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4661008 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4661009 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4661010 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4661011 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4661012 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4661013 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4661014 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4661015 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4661016 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4661017 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4661018 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4661019 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4661020 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4661021 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4661022 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4661023 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4661024 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4661025 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4661026 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4661027 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4661028 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4661029 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4661030 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4661031 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
4661032 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
4661033 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
4661034 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
4661035 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
4661036 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4661037 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4661038 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4661039 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4661040 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4661041 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
4661042 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
4661043 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
4661044 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
4661045 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
4661046 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
4661047 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
4661048 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
4661049 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
4661050 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
4661051 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
4661052 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
4661053 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
4661054 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
4661055 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4661056 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4661057 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4661058 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4661059 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4661060 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4661061 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4661062 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4661063 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4661064 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4661065 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

4661067 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4661068 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4661069 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4661070 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4661071 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4661072 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4661073 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4661074 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4661075 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
4661076 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
4661077 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
4661078 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
4661079 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
4661080 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
4661081 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
4661082 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
4661083 regarding the old rss icon mozilla would like us and other users of it to sign an agreement on the use of the feeds icon we fully respect their rights to the icon and will not use it as long as this isnt sorted out
4661084 option 1 and thats what she was arguing against at least as i understood it
4661085 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4661086 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4661087 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4661088 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4661089 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4661090 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4661091 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4661092 hed be a good man on a boat during a storm
4661093 obama does better against mccain with hunters and especially fisherpeople than did his two democratic predecessors vis a vis bush
4661094 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4661095 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4661096 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4661097 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4661098 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4661099 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4661100 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4661101 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4661102 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4661103 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4661104 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4661105 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4661106 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4661107 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4661108 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4661109 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4661110 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4661111 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4661112 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4661113 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4661114 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4661115 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4661116 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves

4661119 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4661120 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4661121 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4661122 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4661123 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4661124 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4661125 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4661126 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4661127 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4661128 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4661129 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4661130 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4661131 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4661132 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4661133 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4661134 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4661135 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4661136 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4661137 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4661138 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4661139 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4661140 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4661141 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4661142 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4661143 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4661144 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4661145 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4661146 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4661147 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4661148 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4661149 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4661150 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4661151 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4661152 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4661153 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4661154 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4661155 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4661156 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4661157 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4661158 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4661159 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4661160 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4661161 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4661162 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4661163 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4661164 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4661165 jackson browne a woman beater has been druggy musician objects to a war hero using his song
4661166 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad
4661167 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4661168 wow all the leftists disparaging the service record of one of our war heros amazing not surprising though
4661169 isnt it funny whenever someone scores a point against the republicans the only response they can make is to trash the character of the person scoring
4661170 the suit claims that use of the song violates the lanham act by falsely implying that browne is associated with or endorses the mccain candidacy the suit also claims the commercial violates brownes right of publicity under california law

4661229 hal utama yang perlu ditekankan pada wanita yang mengalami penderitaan ini adalah bahwa jika persetubuhan menyakitkan pasti ada sesuatu yang tidak beres dalam diri mereka
4661230 dewasa ini kita mengetahui bahwa hampir selalu ada yang tidak beres secara fisik ketika seorang wanita mengalami persetubuhan yang menyakitkan saya mengatakan secara konservatif paling tidak pada 80 dari semua kasus yang pernah dilaporkan
4661231 sering terdapat masalah masalah psikologis di seputar masalah fisik yang mendasari dan tidak diragukan lagi bahwa terapi psikologi yang membangun dapat sangat membantu namun jika seorang pasien menggambarkan rasa sakit pada saat penetrasi hampir dapat dipastikan bahwa sumbernya bersifat fisik
4661232 wanita harus siap menghadapi kenyataan bahwa banyak dokter yang tidak benar benar menguasai ilmu pengetahuan kontemporer sehingga jika masalahnya berkaitan dengan dispareunia nama ilmiah untuk persetubuhan yang menyakitkan dan mungkin memerlukan usaha yang besar untuk mendapatkan diagnosis yang benar
4661233 saya menganjurkan dengan sangat agar wanita mengawali proses penyembuhan dirinya dengan memeriksakan diri ke ahli kandungan namun jika ini tidak membantu mereka harus tetap mencari bantuan profesional lainnya sampai mendapatkan jawaban yang memuaskan

4661257 cand copilul plange cum sa l linistim descoperind cauzele plansului sau
4661258 ha sido un partido emocionante dif cil hab a comenzado jugando de manera incre ble
4661259 i think mccain has to have a running mate that clearly connects with social conservatives in the party that is where he is lacking so if he picks a pro choice running mate i dont see how he can win this race
4661260 im not going to say people will stay home but there is a core of voters whose level of enthusiasm influences people further from the core so if mccain picks a pro choice running mate the strength of turnout on election day is not going to be there for him
4661261 it doesnt matter im a believer that john mccain cant win the race but that obama has to lose it this is not a knock on mccain i dont know of any republican candidate who can overcome the democrats in this environment without the democrat disqualifying himself
4661262 but mccain has to remain an acceptable alternative if voters do disqualify obama santorum continued
4661263 so his vp choice has to be safe somebody who cant disqualify mccain at the same time he cant tick off conservatives the answer long story short hes got to pick a safe conservative republican there are probably ten members of the u s senate and some governors who are conservative who have solid records who are good people who would not stir controversy
4661264 surely mccain and his advisors know that the choice of ridge or any other pro abortion politician would cost him the election
4661265 the religious and social conservative base of the gop would be completely dispirited they would vote for mccain but thats about it
4661266 i think that the vice presidential choice that john mccain makes is probably the most important choice hes going to make in this entire campaign because he has no room for error no margin for doubt
4661267 if he picks a pro choice running mate it will confirm the unease and the mistrust that some evangelicals and dont forget this social conservative catholics feel about mccain
4661268 if he picks a pro life running mate it will help to ease their concerns and confirm to them that while he may not have been their first choice he may not have been their second choice that its better to vote for a third class fireman than it is to allow a first class arsonist to become president
4661269 probably governor sarah palin of alaska because shes a person of strong faith
4661270 shes a virtual lifetime member of the national rifle association she would ring so many bells and i just think it would help with independents because shes a woman shes a reform governor i think that from what i hear that would be the choice that would probably ring the most bells along with mike huckabee of course whos a southern baptist
4661271 i think mitt romney would be an excellent choice there are people in the evangelical community who would have a problem with his mormonism i am not one of them
4661272 i mean im very clear that i do not believe mormonism is a christian faith but that does not disqualify someone from being president or vice president

4661357 that was mainly because of the number of guys that are banged up we didnt want to overwork the guys that are healthy
4661358 we worked primarily on a few different simulated situations today
4661359 we had a four minute drill where the offense took over for the last four minutes of a game and we needed a couple of first downs to run out the clock to win the game we worked on third and six seven eight nine and 10 we played overtime as the third overtime where if a team scores they have to go for two to seal the win we finished with goal line

4661397 the soaring prices of oil on the global level during these last six years have reminded us of the importance of safeguarding energy security in our homeland
4661398 were raising the energy supply capacity through accelerated energy diversification the utilisation of non fuel oil alternative energy including new and renewable energy such as micro hydro geothermal and biofuel
4661399 in addition to tapping renewable energies we must effectively save energy thus far we have been a nation that splurges on the use of energy

4661403 if you look at projected rates of acidity for the year 2100 we are finding a 25 percent reduction in fertilization
4661404 we were completely surprised because people had been looking at the effect of acidification on calcified structures of marine animals but there was no evidence to suggest it was affecting non calcified structures like a sperm or an egg
4661405 it is widely believed that seawater is chemically well buffered but these results show that the acidification process already well underway may threaten the viability of many marine species
4661406 the paper has looked at the projected rates within the next 80 years but we have actually looked at higher acidification values and we have had mortality of the animals
4661407 what we have now is evidence that the worlds marine life is far more sensitive to ocean acidification than first suspected and that means our oceans may be very different places in the not too distant future
4661408 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the field guides

4661410 although finding an unknown species like the olive backed forest robin was not the goal of the project it is definitely a reminder that the world still holds surprises for us

4661485 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4661486 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4661487 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4661488 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4661489 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4661490 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4661491 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4661492 its my first elvis week im a little ashamed to say that but it is
4661493 we watched it on the computer last year and i finally said i have to be part of that
4661494 but when we come down here we rarely see people we know yall need to come out
4661495 i have a velvet elvis but because of the rain we couldnt bring out all of our good stuff
4661496 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4661497 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4661498 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4661499 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4661500 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4661501 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4661502 vou voltar a estudar sen o meu pai vai me dar porrada
4661503 in europe wagons are considered the sportiest body style here its the predecessor to the minivan
4661504 we like to think were on the front end of change
4661505 its a nice addition to the line but dont expect huge volumes for it
4661506 its a small percentage of our sales but a very loyal customer
4661507 youve got the dollar store little caesars then you have all the other stores across the street there are a lot of businesses around
4661508 its going to affect us negatively the economy has already slowed down shipping as it is
4661509 if they went to mervyns they might stop by here in case they need to mail something or a make a copy
4661510 but if they dont have a reason to come to the area then they wont
4661511 no decisions have been made concerning the closing or consolidation of any stores
4661512 cvs caremarks acquisition of longs drug stores is not expected to close until the fourth quarter of this year
4661513 prater and mccarran used to be the only game in sparks but now there are more opportunities
4661514 were looking at new options to re tenant that target building
4661515 but mccarran will never lose its impact its the ring road around reno and sparks and the traffic always remains strong theres just a challenge in the dynamics now
4661516 we have steady business id say 70 percent of the people who come in are regulars
4661517 im sure the closing will hurt us but im hoping it wont affect us in a significant way
4661518 i think the business will still be here because you still have all these stores here
4661519 a lot of kids that are coming in are saying did you see michael phelps
4661520 and a lot of the girls are saying michael is so cute
4661521 it certainly happens every four years but this particular year is the biggest that i can remember
4661522 this is just a hunch that most programs in most states will see that 5 percent to 11 percent increase in their swim team programs its phenomenal
4661523 its been wonderful how the olympics has created that interest for us naturally
4661524 the u s olympic splash bash parties provide us a real opportunity to share our sport and to bring the excitement of the olympic games to kids across the nation
4661525 we know that there is no better promotion for the sport of swimming than having our u s athletes successfully compete on an international stage our hope is that kids across the nation will catch on to the olympic buzz and will be inspired to join their local swim teams

4661528 it makes you marvel at what these athletes will do we were thinking what must it be like to plummet from that height how can we capture the sensation
4661529 one of those lovely problems that keep you up at 4 a m building things in your mind

4661540 we dream of a paraguay with social justice without hunger

4661542 i just want him to get rid of the corruption and the inequality
4661543 i was shocked at the end it was kind of a little bit of a delayed reaction
4661544 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i had lost the race right there but i guess that was the difference in the end
4661545 i was starting to hurt for the last 10 metres it was my last individual race and i just wanted to finish as strong as i could

4661547 the formation of dead zones has been exacerbated by the increase in pollution fueled by riverine runoff of fertilizers and the burning of fossil fuels
4661548 from 1970 to 1990 the hypoxic zone on the northwestern continental shelf of the black sea has expanded to 40 000 square kilometers 15 500 square miles
4661549 however since 1989 the loss of fertilizer subsidies from the former soviet union reduced nutrient loading by a factor of two to four with the result that by 1995 the hypoxic zone had gone
4661550 climate change also has the potential to expand naturally occurring omzs oxygen minimum zones into shallower coastal waters damaging fisheries and affecting energy flows in the same way that eutrophication driven hypoxia does

4661590 the fire started just above the foreground here where you can see on the ridge there between burnt creek and home sweet home
4661591 about eight days ago a lightning strike the fire spread to the north and south there came over on the north side of that ridge we had it pretty well contained with hand lines all the way around with a limited number of folks on the ground
4661592 this is going to be a good test on our lines today because its a few degrees warmer than it was thursday
4661593 its drier the relative humidity has dropped a little bit weve got more wind from a different direction more of an easterly component that we havent had
4661594 jasmim vai ficar uma fera s deixo se voc me ajudar a fazer uma surpresa pra quando ela voltar uma reforma coisa assim
4661595 one of the greatest honors i think ive ever had
4661596 even if youre not on the cover you look at your rankings and stats and always question them
4661597 huh this guy is faster than me i aint never lost to this guy
4661598 when i was overseas in march people noticed me just because of the madden cover
4661599 tell you what new little trick nuances what attributes you had the way they used you
4661600 lost a lot of money broke a lot of controllers probably broke a playstation 2
4661601 my little brother to this day owes me 2 500 push ups
4661602 it was ugly for me personally thats not how i hope to feel
4661603 my body wasnt handling it it was just a bad day
4661604 it was a good night for us and i am proud of the effort we gave
4661605 i cant do this again there is no way i can get through this again
4661606 the proposal in favour of pushpa kamal dahal prachanda as the prime minister was supported by 464 votes
4661607 if that lawyer does not files the deed i am not going to close on it
4661608 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4661609 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4661610 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4661611 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4661612 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4661613 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4661614 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4661615 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4661616 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4661617 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4661618 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4661619 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4661620 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4661621 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4661622 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4661623 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4661624 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4661625 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4661626 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4661627 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4661628 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4661629 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4661630 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4661631 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4661632 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4661633 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4661634 who are open to doing something on the production side
4661635 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4661636 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4661637 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4661638 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4661639 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4661640 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4661641 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations

4661646 troops are increasingly faced with the task of clearing urban areas and we need to find ways to use improved technology to help them in this difficult and dangerous work
4661647 whether operating in combat peacekeeping or other roles they need to be aware of potential danger or developing situations in the vicinity we are looking for systems with a high degree of autonomy that can detect threats and meet a complex set of objectives
4661648 this is the culmination of a long journey and will be a really exciting event
4661649 it is also a very different way of doing business and bringing out the talent we have in science and technology
4661650 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4661651 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4661652 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4661653 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4661654 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4661655 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4661656 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4661657 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4661658 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4661659 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4661660 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4661661 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4661662 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4661663 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4661664 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4661665 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4661666 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4661667 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4661668 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4661669 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4661670 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4661671 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4661672 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4661673 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4661674 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4661675 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4661676 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4661677 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4661678 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4661679 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4661680 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4661681 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4661682 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4661683 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4661684 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4661685 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4661686 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4661687 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4661688 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4661689 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4661690 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4661691 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4661692 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4661693 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4661694 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4661695 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4661696 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4661697 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4661698 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4661699 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4661700 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4661701 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4661702 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4661703 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4661704 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4661705 el se or sabe librar de la prueba a los que viven entregados a l
4661706 no tengan miedo a nadie ni se asusten sino honren a cristo como se or en sus corazones
4661707 dejen todas sus preocupaciones a dios porque l se interesa por ustedes
4661708 cu dense para que no sean arrastrados por los enga os de los malvados ni caigan de su firme posici n antes al contrario conozcan mejor a nuestro se or y salvador jesucristo y crezcan en su amor
4661709 cu dense para que no sean arrastrados por la no fe por la desesperanza por el desaliento por el sin sentido de vivir por la depresi n por la rebeld a que les viene de sus heridas no sanadas no se dejen arrastrar por lo que sienten en su interior y que a n no saben c mo asumirlo c mo sobrellevarlo pero si leen la palabra del se or y se dejan educar por su esp ritu divino aprender n todo cuanto necesiten para ser felices y fuertes
4661710 en tiempos antiguos dios habl a nuestros antepasados muchas veces y de muchas maneras por medio de los profetas ahora en estos tiempos ltimos nos ha hablado por su hijo mediante el cual cre los mundos y al cual ha hecho heredero de todas las cosas l es el resplandor glorioso de dios la imagen misma de lo que dios es y el que sostiene todas las cosas con su palabra poderosa
4661711 en una ocasi n estando jes s a la orilla del lago de genesaret se sent a apretujado por la multitud que quer a o r el mensaje de dios jes s vio dos barcas en la playa estaban vac as porque los pescadores hab an bajado de ellas para lavar sus redes jes s subi a una de las barcas que era de sim n pedro y le pidi que la alejara un poco de la orilla luego se sent en la barca y desde all comenz a ense ar a la gente cuando termin de hablar le dijo a sim n lleva la barca a la parte honda del lago y echen all sus redes para pescar sim n le contest maestro hemos estado trabajando toda la noche sin pescar nada pero ya que t lo mandas voy a echar las redes cuando lo hicieron recogieron tanto pescado que las redes se romp an
4661712 lleva la barca a la parte honda del lago y echen all sus redes para pescar
4661713 feliz el hombre la mujer que no sigue el consejo de los malvados ni va por el camino de los pecadores
4661714 sino que pone su amor en la ley del se or y en ella medita d a y noche ese hombre esa mujer ese joven esa joven ser como un rbol plantado a la orilla de un r o que da fruto a su tiempo y jam s se marchitar n sus hojas todo lo que haga le saldr bien con los malvados es decir con todo lo negativo que engendra la mente del ser humano no pasa lo mismo pues todo esto ser como paja que se lleva el viento el se or cuida el camino de los justos es decir de aqu llos que le buscan de coraz n sinceramente pero el camino de aquellos que no quieren poner su confianza en el se or los llevar al desastre
4661715 cuando les prediqu no us palabras sabias para convencerlos al contrario los convenc haciendo demostraci n del esp ritu y del poder de dios para que la fe de ustedes dependiera del poder de dios y no de la sabidur a de los hombres la sabidur a de dios es algo que no han entendido los que gobiernan este mundo presente pues si lo hubieran entendido no habr an crucificado al se or de la gloria pero como dice la escritura dios ha preparado para los que lo aman cosas que nadie ha visto ni o do y ni siquiera pensado estas son las cosas que dios nos ha hecho conocer por medio del esp ritu pues el esp ritu lo examina todo hasta las cosas m s profundas de dios qui n entre los hombres puede saber lo que hay en el coraz n del hombre sino s lo el esp ritu que est dentro del hombre de la misma manera solamente el esp ritu de dios sabe lo que hay en dios y nosotros no hemos recibido el esp ritu del mundo sino el esp ritu que viene de dios para que entendamos las cosas que dios en su bondad nos ha dado as explicamos las cosas espirituales con t rminos espirituales el que no es espiritual no acepta las cosas que son del esp ritu de dios porque para l son tonter as pero aqu l que tiene el esp ritu puede juzgar todas las cosas y nadie lo puede juzgar a l pues la escritura dice qui n conoce la mente del se or qui n podr instruirle y pablo termina diciendo sin embargo nosotros tenemos la mente de cristo

4661758 well i believe its as easy as going to the streets and loving on them
4661759 we just go we pray we walk around meet the people living on the streets we go to their camps and love on them
4661760 i think i speak for all of us pastors here when i say that we cant just go thats too unorganized and not well planned how about we hold a week long evangelism conference targeting the poor or maybe we could have a luncheon after church and promote it as being food for the poor
4661761 it just means everyone had a good time the weather was hot enough they were getting thirsty dancing and sweating it off and needed some refreshment
4661762 they drank a lot of beer but nobody got out of sorts there was no issue with the police

4661769 it was pretty deafening because everybody was shouting at the top of their lungs
4661770 we took a very businesslike approach to the race our start is typically fast but what we did really really well today was the middle 1 000 metres we owned it
4661771 in the last 500 to go we could see we were being challenged but we held on and were happy with the result
4661772 you know what were hoping for but we cant say that
4661773 she deserves it because shes worked hard to get where she is

4661778 these people are running out of places to go and basic necessities
4661779 the tigers are keeping them in harms way and the government is not doing enough to ensure they receive essential assistance
4661780 these measures seem designed in part to use civilians as a buffer against government forces a serious violation of international humanitarian law the ltte has also engaged in forced recruitment
4661781 both sides to this long conflict have again shown that they will jeopardise the lives of thousands of ordinary people in the pursuit of military objectives

4661806 we note this in light of a decision announced today in beijing wherein china will raise the consumption tax on high emission passenger vehicles and will cut the consumption tax on low emission passenger vehicles as part of efforts to conserve energy this is simple this is elegant and this is wise from september 1st onward the consumption tax rate on passenger vehicles with engines larger than 3 liters to 4 liters will rise to 25 from 15 while that on cars with engines of more than 4 liters will go to 40 from 20 on the other hand the consumption tax rate on passenger vehicles with an engine size of 1 liter or less will fall to 1 from 3 the communists seem to understand economics better than washington and we applaud beijing for this simple elegant and proper way to adjust demand downward

4661812 you spend and entire week of your life and put yourself into it and that you are going to start over again yeah its frustrating nobody likes to have a mistrial but no decisions are made unanimously these are the most important decisions and our law requires they be made unanimously so we know its difficult to get twelve people to agree on a single thing so we can come to expect it although it certainly frustrates you
4661813 me hab an ofrecido el cargo el comandante departamental el cnl wilge obleas me hab a dicho que me iba a entregar el cargo pero luego viene una contraorden de la paz y no pude asumir
4661814 yo creo que con ello ha hecho el rid culo yo le pido al prefecto rub n costas que no siga con estas actitudes violentas
4661815 lo que ha ocurrido hoy en santa cruz es el inicio de lo que parece ser un plan una escalada de actos violentos que ya lo han anunciado algunos dirigentes c vicos para el martes 29 de la pr xima semana convocando a un paro y dijeron que lo haran respetar por la fuerza de la violencia
4661816 los discapacitados fueron utilizados como punta de lanza de una movilizaci n y por detr s de ellos ven an los c vicos diputados de podemos y unionistas
4661817 estaban azuzando la violencia para agredir a una de las instituciones m s importantes del pa s como es la polic a nacional
4661818 por lo que cualquier intento de neutralizar agredir o reemplazar a una instituci n como la polic a nacional ser un intento destinado al fracaso
4661819 a partir de este momento jos luis paredes se pone a disposici n del prefecto del departamento para colaborarlo en todo lo que sea necesario alejandro te hago entrega del despacho y estoy seguro que la paz est en buenas manos
4661820 seguiremos de cerca la gesti n prefectural para que se concluya lo que hemos iniciado como la carretera a cochabamba los aeropuertos en apolo de ixiamas y la carretera al norte vamos a exigir su realizaci n

4661825 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4661826 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4661827 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4661828 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4661829 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet

4661841 she is an inspiration to me not a distraction shes my inspiration to do well in my job
4661842 suddenly in july we received a windfall of people who came to silver strand to get drunk and thats not the business were in

4661851 my personal point of view the lawsuit was a complete waste of time because the incident didnt rise to any kind of level i fly all the time ive seen a lot worse than that happen on airplanes
4661852 we gave the truth to the jury we are happy we had an opportunity to try our case
4661853 i cant believe what happened im so happy it wasnt like the 400 i knew id won its absolutely unbelievable

4661857 it was a great experience we really enjoyed ourselves but the whole time we just kept saying how we wish our kids could experience that
4661858 i was actually in awe that i would even have the opportunity to go to europe
4661859 its not exactly something that you get offered every day being someone from the bronx being that it costs so much youre not always able to experience something like that
4661860 theyre here until like eight oclock at night and then theyll go and try to fundraise money they put in that extra work that makes them so much more than teachers
4661861 you really want them to have the connection that was a big point of it for us
4661862 around my block theres always a bunch of not good stuff happening its not fun
4661863 and i go and i am like wow theres so much more than just this
4661864 these are bronx kids and they dont have the advantages people have and for them to be able to see that theres a bigger world is important

4661867 the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
4661868 the beauty of the second amendment is that it will not be needed until they try to take it
4661869 the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
4661870 three portions of that text merit special focus the introductory language defining the amendments purpose the class of persons encompassed within its reach and the unitary nature of the right that it protects
4661871 without identifying any language in the text that even mentions civilian uses of firearms the court proceeds to

4661883 a tropical depression could form at any time within the next day or so
4661884 were just holding up at the moment pending on the weather updates before taking any action
4661885 any decision to advise the public depends on the authorities on each county
4661886 the national hurricane center indicates that this system does not have a well enough defined center of circulation to be considered a tropical depression environmental conditions are favorable for development and i expect the national hurricane center to classify this system a tropical depression at some point today or at the very latest on saturday
4661887 all indications are this morning that this system is very very close to being classified as a tropical depression
4661888 it will be interesting to see how this affects this system down the road what is interesting is that even though several tracking models track this system over the mountainous parts of northern hispaniola it still ramps the storm up to a very strong hurricane once it is in the bahamas
4661889 one model even forecasts it to track into the northwestern bahamas early next week and stall there for 36 hours or so before tracking back to the west and tracking over south florida on wednesday night and thursday morning before tracking into the gulf of mexico and tracking west northwest across the entire gulf of mexico before coming ashore on the central texas coast on august 28 13 days from now

4661912 toen ik dat hoorde werd ik furieus ik ga ervoor zei ik tegen mezelf
4661913 toen ik een 1 achter mijn naam zag staan dacht ik wel wow ik kwam hier naartoe om zoveel mogelijk te winnen de score is nu zeven uit zeven ik weet niet wat ik moet zeggen

4661920 i feel better about this week than i have maybe since the first week when we came out just our approach and guys working hard and guys being out there and fighting through the adversity and pain and all that stuff its been really good that way
4661921 weve got a great lineup of speakers and case studies that will help engineers tackle everyday problems they might encounter
4661922 as consumers drive the want for cars to become more robotic and greener learning how to integrate complex electrical mechanical and computer systems is even more critical
4661923 an engineer with practical knowledge that they can apply outside of their core concentration has a leg up in these challenging economic times having a broad set of skills is virtually a requirement to any notion of employment security
4661924 if the track surfaces relaxation time or time it takes to reorient itself on impact is too fast itll seem jarring to the athlete if its too slow itll feel like running in sand
4661925 the super x performance optimally designed geometries allow for the greatest deformation and subsequent energy return with the most consistent response
4661926 do you think his wife and kids in the back really appreciate your advances
4661927 i want to rip off your jaw and piss down your mcmuffin hole
4661928 i was shocked at the end it was kind of a little bit of a delayed reaction
4661929 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i had lost the race right there but i guess that was the difference in the end
4661930 i was starting to hurt for the last 10 metres it was my last individual race and i just wanted to finish as strong as i could
4661931 i hope that people start noticing that ifpi gets more and more into bed with the police its really disturbing that one side of an ongoing fight gets more authority without a legal basis
4661932 this decision sends out a clear message that the pirate bays activities are illegal under italian law the pirate bay facilitates the mass infringement of copyright across music film television and games its very name shows the contempt its operators hold for the creators of legitimate content
4661933 will it become a hurricane and will it affect north carolina
4661934 due to the proximity of land up through the hispaniola area and cuba this will likely not intensify as it heads through the weekend early next week
4661935 its when it merges into the gulf of mexico that it could intensify
4661936 the consensus of most models is a track over florida
4661937 but if the track is a little farther to the right and it heads into the bahamas and stays in the atlantic it could intensify into a hurricane and pose a threat to north carolina thats why were going to watch it closely in the coming days
4661938 what we see thursday or friday will ultimately depend upon the track of fay
4661939 will it bring remnant rainfall or will it be a hurricane at the coast
4661940 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4661941 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4661942 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
4661943 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
4661944 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4661945 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4661946 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4661947 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4661948 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
4661949 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4661950 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4661951 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4661952 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4661953 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4661954 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4661955 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4661956 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4661957 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4661958 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4661959 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4661960 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4661961 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4661962 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4661963 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4661964 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4661965 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4661966 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4661967 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4661968 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4661969 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4661970 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4661971 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4661972 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
4661973 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
4661974 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
4661975 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4661976 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4661977 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4661978 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4661979 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
4661980 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4661981 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4661982 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4661983 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4661984 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4661985 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4661986 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4661987 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4661988 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4661989 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4661990 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4661991 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4661992 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4661993 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4661994 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4661995 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4661996 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4661997 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4661998 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4661999 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
4662000 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4662001 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4662002 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
4662003 this is a very hard situation for which we were absolutely unprepared
4662004 theres a huge amount of people coming in and its impossible to deal with it
4662005 they said the formula is gone that it was already given away
4662006 i have a hysterical feeling im so worried about not being able to feed her

4662019 it was a little bit of pressure miller said smiling
4662020 the boys came out a little tight south dakota coach steve nolan said
4662021 a case of the nerves both at the plate and on the mound
4662022 these guys are more nervous now than they were on the baseball field i promise mcguire said his son hit third and went 1 for 2
4662023 i stopped making serves said roddick who won the event last year
4662024 im very happy to win another match del potro said
4662025 saturday ill have a chance to play another semi so i want to enjoy this moment
4662026 hes playing like hes top 10 as hot as he is isner said
4662027 i thought if i was moving when he served it would disturb him a little bit
4662028 in the beginning he came out really strong haas said
4662029 when i got the break back i was just thinking to myself lets make him earn the first set
4662030 he seems like the man to beat right now haas said
4662031 my head is tired but i want to win more matches he said
4662032 i looked around to make sure i was safe and i shut it off
4662033 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4662034 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4662035 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4662036 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4662037 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4662038 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4662039 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4662040 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4662041 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4662042 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4662043 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4662044 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4662045 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4662046 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4662047 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4662048 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4662049 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4662050 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4662051 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4662052 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4662053 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4662054 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4662055 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4662056 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4662057 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4662058 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4662059 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4662060 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4662061 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4662062 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4662063 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4662064 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4662065 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4662066 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4662067 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4662068 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4662069 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4662070 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4662071 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4662072 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4662073 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4662074 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4662075 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4662076 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4662077 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4662078 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4662079 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4662080 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4662081 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4662082 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4662083 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4662084 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4662085 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4662086 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4662087 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4662088 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4662089 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4662090 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4662091 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4662092 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4662093 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4662094 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4662095 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4662096 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4662097 i was so disgusted when i first found out about it
4662098 now im just angry angry that someone would do something like this
4662099 its not good for the whole city and the whole state
4662100 i just dont understand what goes through someones head that can do something to would try and destroy something that was built with such love and care by the community

4662108 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4662109 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4662110 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4662111 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4662117 gt decided not to run against him after very nearly defeating him as an independent in 2005 the only remaining major party renegade still in the hunt is ballajura mp john dorazio contesting the new seat of
4662118 the first is that theyre simply not ready when the election was called the liberals did not even have advertising concepts in the can for former leader troy buswell let alone a leader who had only been elected the previous day the second is that they are woefully underfunded and olympic period television advertising is extremely expensive labor is said to have booked significant airspace during the olympics for about 250 000 liberal television advertisements are not expected to hit the airwaves until the olympics are over giving them roughly 10 days to establish their message before the media blackout comes into effect at midnight on the wednesday before the poll
4662119 if you couldnt make things work with eight years of boom whats going to happen now that things are slowing down prices are rising and interest rates are up
4662120 gt first negative ads which fascinatingly pursue the theme of liberal party sexism not conventional election campaign fodder but well worth a run under the present extraordinary circumstances
4662121 the blue collar component of the wa electorate is half that of sydney melbourne and adelaide and 50 per cent less than brisbane
4662122 a large non english speaking background electorate so richly supportive of labor in the east
4662123 some labor mps are simply paranoid about the barrett factor more particularly the dirt he may have
4662124 on the question of which leader was more capable of handling the states economy mr carpenter led mr barnett by 12 percentage points 49 to 37 however voters believed the opposition was a better party to handle the economy and taxation matters than labor
4662125 but steve there has been a massive shift back to labor from the last westpoll i bet they didnt couch the latest results in those terms though
4662126 1 the liberal party is capable of achieving an unlikely victory in the west australian election while its new leader is closing the gap on premier alan carpenter a new poll shows 6 a month ago mr carpenter led mr buswell 57 percentage points to 12 points but this weeks poll had support for mr carpenter on 44 points ahead of mr barnett on 31 points
4662127 a month ago mr carpenter led mr buswell 57 percentage points to 12 points but this weeks poll had support for mr carpenter on 44 points ahead of mr barnett on 31 points

4662153 if you were trying to promote yourself as anderson cooper are you gay first and foremost or are you anderson cooper if he does agree to talk about it well then you cant talk about anything else and no one wants to talk about anything else which is understandable theyve got someone prepared to talk about it so theyre like little kids every journalist just wanting to know more and more and more and as youre talking about it youre draining everyone of interest in you then people start thinking oh my god hes such a bore i wish hed shut up about being fucking gay these fucking fags and then you trigger another phobia which is this impression that gay men and lesbians never stop going on about it

4662175 the ones that i saw were small around 85 cm tall but it was getting dark and it was difficult to see them properly
4662176 i dont know what they are but they appear to be some sort of hybrid of chimp or orangutang without a tail
4662177 i have climbed the dhaulagiri white mountain massif four times and every time i saw footprints of the yeti
4662178 in 1971 one of my expedition members saw one of these creatures
4662179 it was only 15 metres away from him and watching for about 40 seconds
4662180 it was about 150 cm tall and stood on its hind legs like a man its head was covered with long thick hair and he was certain it was not a bear or a monkey
4662181 animals had definitely visited the cave and there were more of the footprints in the snow around the mouth of the cavern
4662182 the footprints that i saw were similar to the one photographed by british explorers eric shipton and michael ward in 1951
4662183 the ones i found were smaller and thinner more like a human foot with an arch between the heel and the toes
4662184 there are no animals that leave that sort of track

4662217 one that is continuing even after he admitted last week that he had an affair with ms hunter but denied that he fathered her child
4662218 emerged through public records and interviews with people close to mr edwards and ms hunter which suggested that their affair went on longer than mr edwards admitted and that the effort to conceal it by mr edwardss inner circle was much more extensive than has been reported
4662219 is significant because its source was edwards oneamerica political action committee whose expenditures are governed by u s election laws willfully converting money from a political action committee for personal use would have been a federal criminal violation
4662220 my guess is that there is a simple reason why the mainstream media is unable to confirm the edwards hunter affair during these past weeks because very few people knew what had been going on edwards staff didnt know elizabeth edwards didnt know the group may have been as small as three edwards hunter and her pal bob mcgovern one of those in my view and not edwards sold the information
4662221 we have exclusive photographic evidence pictures videos hard proof to further incriminate edwards he doesnt at this point know what we have which is why im asking that we dont reveal too much yet and which we will use unless and until he acknowledges paternity
4662222 we have been discussing this issue with new york and other regulators since we announced last week our plan to purchase our retail clients ars auction rate securities and we thought we were making progress

4662273 a sus hijos y secuaces entregar a la muerte con lo cual sabr n todas las iglesias que soy el que escudri a los ri ones y los corazones y dar a cada uno de vosotros seg n sus obras
4662274 escudri a los ri ones y los corazones y da cada uno de nosotros su merecido

4662279 if i were a chicken id want some privacy when i was laying an egg
4662280 so you think we have modest chickens who will lay more if they have pretty privacy curtains on their boxes
4662281 okay but if the curtains dont work its curtains for those birds
4662282 if i was my child in this situation what would i be thinking
4662283 it would be great for football if someone could gatecrash the big four this season and if anyone is going to do that it has to be spurs
4662284 manager ramos has made some brilliant signings and shown real imagination and forward thinking
4662285 he has brought in flair players like luka modric and giovani dos santos who will perform in the tottenham tradition and will also really capture the imaginat
4662286 we never walk into a theme park and pay the rack rate we save money by clipping coupons finding coupons anywhere we can
4662287 whether you visit the parks web site directly or the local visitor and convention bureau you can often time save money by purchasing more than one park at a time taking advantage of park hopper passes
4662288 sometimes there are add on options that you can get for cheaper parking sometimes
4662289 you can take advantage of memberships with different organizations whether its places like aaa or even your employer
4662290 if you plan to visit a park over and over again youll use it so many times that it reduces the cost each time you visit
4662291 my suggestion is you have a hearty meal before you visit the theme park and then take advantage of the offerings of kids meals because those tend to be plenty of food and more value oriented
4662292 for example sunscreen film videotape those things are a bit more costly inside the park
4662293 it was difficult as he was a new manager coming in and didnt know me
4662294 i was injured when he arrived and the first impressions were probably not good as managers like fit players
4662295 it took a while for him to understand the problems i had and how we had to deal with the situation
4662296 he probably never had a player the way i played last season playing a game then missing one as the knee wasnt right
4662297 he cant wait to go to old trafford and play for united
4662298 he has never spoken publicly on the situation out of respect for tottenham
4662299 but he does not want to miss out on the start of uniteds season and he feels that was his only option left
4662300 this will allow us to fully test the services through iphone for about six months before it reaches india
4662301 so even though the iphone will be available in india from august 22 it will only be 2g capable and not 3g ready till 2009
4662302 we plan to completely replicate the technology used in the us and europe in india for vodafone 3g is not new we have excelled in it
4662303 something else were very proud of polar express 4 d thats my bra size in addition to

4662305 we have lost some people down four or five percent from market and what weve done before but still doing better than most
4662306 i do it all from bluegrass to mountain music to accapella to rock n roll im even gonna do dance record before you know it
4662307 sometimes you just know its like a song or great idea you just know it when its a hit thought everything feels it at the same time
4662308 with carl crawford and evan longoria going down simultaneously i thought id make one last vain attempt to reach out to tampa bay and to no avail
4662309 thats because major league baseball has been successful in their pursuit in blackballing barry out of the game
4662310 bonds attorneys dont want to draw out a bunch of other negative things rehash the old ones and raise the possibility of new ones if the union brings a collusion charge
4662311 im not sure what jeff borris is trying to accomplish by saying he sent me a text message

4662314 i was there i was there when horus slew the emperor
4662315 i was shocked at the end it was kind of a little bit of a delayed reaction
4662316 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i had lost the race right there but i guess that was the difference in the end
4662317 i was starting to hurt for the last 10 metres it was my last individual race and i just wanted to finish as strong as i could

4662325 it scraped me right down to the marrow of my bones it nearly killed me
4662326 weve known for a hundred years that most training is highly specific
4662327 training on one kind of memory does not necessarily have any kind of impact on other kinds of memory
4662328 i am ready to take face drogba etoo and the other stars of europe
4662329 indeed the mere thought of facing them is a very intriguing challenge we will see who will win
4662330 i believe that a concentrated juve like the one against artemedia is a bad match for any team even for real barcelona and chelsea
4662331 i was finished in the view of the supporters now around me its quite different i feel the confidence of my teammates the coaches and even the public
4662332 that baptistas transfer does not mean our squad is complete there are still a few things that need fixing
4662333 there is a great rush to judge goalkeepers in rome and it risks ruining their career before it has even started
4662334 artur was criticized during the last few games but held up under the pressure and gave a great response on the field
4662335 the manager used to play he used to be a bad loser and we used to fight on the pitch when manchester united played liverpool
4662336 on the pitch all i care about is succeeding but i dont think i have ever been bad to a referee in the whole of my career i have only ever had three red cards i think i only had five yellow cards and that was because referees watched me

4662342 thats fine youre going to retrain me but you can retrain me for anything but if nobody is hiring retraining doesnt do me any good
4662343 actually i like it because if this many people are looking for jobs potentially because they dont have one and now theyre going to finally get one or they dont like the job theyre in and those jobs are going to open up when they leave
4662344 are a lot of people apply for the same positions youre applying for

4662347 its with a heavy heart that i wanted to let you know we helped our sweet coco bean across the bridge today the last few days had been rough for her and as we lay curled together on the bed last night i knew the time had come to let her go my heart has broken into pieces but im trying to remember all the wonderful happy times we had together she loved everybody and was typical boxer through and through sending along a picture from last years trip to the outer banks she always loved the beach and when we got there she spun and spun in the sand then raced off to the water to chase crabs i hope shes chasing them now

4662405 i want to see how we use the bullpen we are going to skip that spot but the next one will pitch before the day off we are going to try to skip as many as we can im pretty sure we will hopefully it will work out for us

4662413 if he passes his test today and he feels better saturday then ill have him available to pinch hit and then ill start him on sunday
4662414 were doing fine its not like we need to rush him back by any stretch of the imagination weve lost one game since hes been out you love his offense in there and we want him in there because hes one of the leagues elite offensive players but lets make sure hes all right for the long haul im not taking any chances rushing him back
4662415 you dont get a chance to sit back and reflect very often
4662416 but coming to a place like this really makes you appreciate it

4662461 after every olympic games we review the team agreements every one of the paragraphs in that agreement is in there for a specific reason

4662463 the expression disrepute is a very broad context and its a little bit like in the eye of the beholder
4662464 i dont even know if the question was asked of celotti as to whether he realised or appreciated the situation in the document
4662465 whilst we obviously would have preferred that matt would have disclosed the position he competed for australia in the olympic games in his weight category and no doubt performed absolutely to his best on behalf of australia and australian olympic team and we certainly wont begrudge him that
4662466 i dont know if there was another athlete in his category who would have otherwise qualified but that athlete presumably will be disappointed
4662467 it may be that this is the end of the matter
4662468 we may want to inquire further as to whether judo did know about it but it certainly appears as though they did not and we would always prima facie take the word of our member federations

4662578 blind or sighted we are no different the only difference is that one can see when theres light while the other can see in darkness thats all

4662592 what is the point in having a good education when most of the jobs available for us are selling lottery tickets or being telephone operators we want more options and we can do more if society gives us a chance

4662614 for me sometimes i was more worried about schemes making sure the guys got lined up properly knew how to adjust

4662678 we were looking for a fast reliable inexpensive database technology for data storage
4662679 mysql was impressive in all these respects but also provided excellent support in many languages and helpful frameworks its integration into our social community based on ruby on rails came off without a hitch

4662692 mysql is at the very foundation of helping us manage our growth as a business
4662693 i think most people probably recognize mysql for their low cost platform and better total cost of ownership over the traditional proprietary databases however it is mysqls technical expertise and business insight into what it actually takes to support high growth high volume businesses that really set them apart lots of companies talk about managing explosive growth but very few understand how to actually do it in this context they really are second to none

4662729 when some people come to families anonymous for the first time they have trouble accepting the fact that addiction to mind altering substances is a disease all they can think of is the horrible way the addicted person has been treating family and friends it is difficult for family members to recognize disease when all they have seen is hostility contempt lies and even stealing but all of this is part of addiction the disease that causes its victims to choose drugs over people until we accept addiction as a disease we remain stuck at the level of hostility and contempt we feel the need for revenge we want to punish the addict for what he or she has done to us as i begin to work through my resentments in fa i come to see how they damage my peace of mind my spirituality and the well being of family relationships i will be far better off when i react to my addicted family member without punishment or negativity then i will be free to grow myself today i will accept addiction as a disease and lay my feelings of hostility aside

4662805 saya diuji allah dengan cacat kaki ini seumur hidup saya
4662806 saya lahir dalam keadaan seperti ini mungkin banyak orang akan pesimis mengha dapi keadaan yang demikian tetapi sejak kecil saya telah memohon sesuatu pada allah saya berdoa agar saat orang lain melihat saya tak ada yang diingat dan disebutnya kecuali allah
4662807 ya agar mereka ingat allah saat menatap saya itu saja
4662808 di antara mereka ada yang membawakan sebelah tongkat saya ada yang memapah ada juga yang menunggu di atas
4662809 saya bahagia karena mereka menyebut nama allah bahkan ketika saya berhasil menamatkan kuliah keluarga kerabat atau teman kembali memuji allah alhamdulillah allah memang maha besar begitu kata mereka
4662810 kita tahu terkadang orang normal pun susah mendapatkan jodoh apalagi seorang yang cacat seperti saya ya tawakal saja
4662811 dan lagi lagi saat walimah saya dengar banyak orang menyebut nyebut nama allah dengan takjub allah itu maha kuasa ya maha adil masya allah alhamdulillah dan sebagainya
4662812 lalu saat saya hamil hampir semua yang bertemu saya bahkan orang yang tak men genal saya menatap takjub seraya lagi lagi mengagungkan asma allah ketika saya hamil besar banyak orang menyarankan agar saya tidak ke bidan melainkan ke dokter untuk operasi bagaimana pun saat seorang ibu melahirkan otot otot panggul dan kaki sangat berperan namun saya pasrah saya merasa tak ada masalah dan yakin bila allah berkehendak semua akan menjadi mudah dan alhamdulillah saya melahirkan lancar dibantu bidan
4662813 semua orang melihat saya dan mereka mengingat allah allahu akbar allah memang maha adil kata mereka
4662814 subhanallah maha besar engkau ya robbi yang telah memberi pelajaran pada saya dari pertemuan dengan hambamu ini kekalkanlah persaudaraan kami di sabilillah selamanya amin
4662815 one of the proudest achievements of modernity is its investment in freedom of every kind personal moral and economic at our most hopeful and most arrogant we feel being modern means having arrived at a point where constraint can be routed or at least reduced as far as possible
4662816 at this rate reconstruction will last 10 years and a generation of our citizens of our children will be raised in inequality because they live in huts and have nowhere to study
4662817 over de hele wereld zien we dat kranten meer en meer plaatselijke content aanbieden
4662818 o vietate handicapata de hotie avand numai un sfert de plaman
4662819 nu privesc emisiunile de televiziune cel putin in romania unde acestea sunt pur si simplu dezgustatoare prin slugarnicie sub cultura si un gen de suprarealitate unde nu se poate identifica aproape nimic din viata cotidiana de la noi
4662820 daca vorbim punctual nici macar in turcia nu exista mall uri in mijlocul orasului caci galleries la fayette din paris sau el corte ingles din barcelona nu sunt mall uri dar la noi sunt si intentia unora este sa le intinda pana chiar in preajma ateneului sub privirile prostite ale unei majoritati ce isi pierde vremea cu privitul la televizor video un interviu in imagini
4662821 vom avea o re asezare nu o prabusire in domeniului imobiliarului pentru locuinte caci intr o tara unde sunt atat de multe cereri si atat de putina oferta inca multa vreme de acum inainte foamea de case nu va fi indestulata
4662822 strainii care cumpara aici pentru a face o afacere vin in ideea unui profit mai mare decat la ei si dintr un anumit punct de vedere nu gresesc in imediat caci a castiga 11 12 pe an fata de sapte opt procente este de preferat atunci cand mentalitatea nu este aceea de pe dambovita unde milionul de dolari pare un mizilic

4662826 we merken bij onze lezers een enorme behoefte aan nieuws uit hun eigen dorp hun eigen straat zelfs
4662827 in tijden van een overaanbod aan gratis informatie moeten kranten zoeken naar dat soort nieuws waar mensen nog voor willen betalen achtergrond en duiding bieden is een optie maar regionaal nieuws is dat ook lezersonderzoeken tonen aan dat lokaal nieuws het publiek erg interesseert we zien ook dat jonge lezers die voor kranten moeilijk te bereiken zijn erg ge nteresseerd zijn in regioberichtgeving even belangrijk als die interesse van het publiek is dat andere media vooral de audiovisuele dat soort informatie minder kunnen aanbieden kranten kunnen hun netwerk van regionale correspondenten uitwerken en gebruik maken van de hype rond de user generated content
4662828 maar het vreemde is dat zij die regio informatie vooral gratis aanbieden op hun website
4662829 wat het laatste nieuws doet houdt w l steek zij behouden het businessmodel van een betalende krant de strategie van het nieuwsblad is voor mij tot op heden een raadsel als ze hun lezers gewend maken aan dat groot gratis aanbod regionaal nieuws hoe denken zij daar dan in de toekomst een versterking van hun potentieel lezerspubliek van te maken
4662830 de beslissing om dat nieuws gratis op de website te plaatsen is al genomen voor ik aan het hoofd van de krant kwam
4662831 we hebben momenteel vijftig hyperlokale websites we zijn begonnen met de grootste gemeenten en zullen in de toekomst uitbreiden naar 75 tot honderd gemeenten die sites genereren een enorme trafiek we tellen elke dag 250 000 tot 300 000 unieke bezoekers onze site heeft die van het laatste nieuws vorige week voorbijgestoken dat is interessant voor adverteerders
4662832 onze strategie is dubbel we hebben plannen voor de krant waarmee we tegen de zomer klaar willen zijn het nieuwsblad telt nu zestien regionale edities het volk twaalf maar we zouden er toch minstens twintig willen dat moet allemaal nog goed bekeken worden want voor de verdeling is dat niet evident kijk maar naar de problemen die het laatste nieuws momenteel op dat vlak ondervindt
4662833 de aantrekkingskracht van dat hyperlokaal nieuws zie je bijvoorbeeld aan het succes van de krant van west vlaanderen al jaren een topper
4662834 wij staan lokaal sterk genoeg in elke gemeente beschikken wij over medewerkers uit het verenigingsleven of onderwijzers die voor ons schrijven en ik denk dat het laatste nieuws die lokale verankering niet heeft
4662835 wij liggen met onze knowhow en ons netwerk zo ver voorop dat we zeker niet angstig zijn een nationale speler die op de regionale markt komt is altijd zwakker dan de regionale speler het gevecht in onze regios gaat vooral om de tweede positie en de concurrentie zal zich vooral afspelen tussen het laatste nieuws en het nieuwsblad
4662836 ooohhh tough break vern elwood has been training all his life for this moment and to see it all go overboard in one instant is heartbreaking

4662840 meaning you are not eating anything fattening would you think they were just referring to the food that is being served
4662841 no you dont have ample hips it was just the pants you wore yesterday
4662842 my god you are thin i always saw you sitting so i never realized how thin you are
4662843 do you like to be thin because it is ok to be thin
4662844 you are thin not skinny 5 and the reason i dont call people thin is because some people are insulted when you tell them you think they are thin they say why do you think i am too thin and because many times i associate thin as being too skinny thin usually isnt in my vocabulary
4662845 you cannot go by definition of thin but by the person let me explain in other words lets say a girl by the name of donna is blonde when you look at the definition it doesnt say donna is blonde it says blonde is a color same applies to thin you are thin i said you are definitely think absolutely thin i said it about six times again you are absolutely and definitely thin i will repeat it again
4662846 i thought you would be a size 10 because my mother is a size 12 my mother in law is a size 16 my friend cheryl is a size 10 and another friend is a size 12 my sons girlfriend who is 19 years old is a size 3
4662847 if you take karate you can look like her too
4662848 well it is better than every one telling you that you are fat
4662849 did you gain weight i mean before you were too thin but now you are perfect
4662850 i dont think you are a size 10 all i am trying to do is make a comparison between the body and the sweater i could have easily said size 50 body in a size 52 sweater or a size 100 body in a size 102 sweater
4662851 you are not extra extra large you are not extra large you are not large you are not medium and has never been medium you are small and has always been small you are a size 5 and if a size 5 is large than you are a size 1
4662852 i had a dream about the beatnicks i dreamt that john and steve from the group liked us and we hung out with them however steve the one you were with said i only like girls with plump legs and i told steve you have plump legs and then i woke up

4662877 im off to the shop to get a diet coke
4662878 as for things coming back to bite you in the ass not sure if this applies but for what its worth ive also made my fair share of crappy decisions lol and they sometimes try to resurface but my opinion is you are always changing changing with the times with yourself as you personally learn amp grow becoming what life demands of you and becoming what you demand of yourself so with all this change theres no way you can stress too much over a bad choice you prolly didnt know and it sounded good at the time but just move on you arent the same person you were 20 mins ago much less the same person you were when you made that choice so its like someone else made that choice not you dont sweat it move on and just do the best you can and as long as you accept yourself for who you are then that will always be enough press on keep going amp eventually youll find the right path with your wealth of trial and error learned knowledge sometimes thats what it takes and you know youll appreciate whatever it is when you get it

4662995 just as nightfall does not come at once neither does oppression in both instances there is a twilight and it is in such a twilight that we all must be aware of change in the air however slight lest we become unwilling victims of the darkness
4662996 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
4662997 you know a long time ago being crazy meant something nowadays everybodys crazy
4662998 a very popular error having the courage of ones convictions rather it is a matter of having the courage for an attack upon ones convictions
4662999 i have examined all the known superstitions of the world and i do not find in our particular superstition of christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology millions of innocent men women and children since the introduction of christianity have been burnt tortured fined and imprisoned what has been the effect of this coercion to make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites to support roguery and error all over the earth
4663000 a human being is part of a whole called by us the universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty
4663001 of all the enemies to public liberty war is perhaps the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other war is the parent of armies from these proceed debts and taxes and armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few in war too the discretionary power of the executive is extended its influence in dealing out offices honors and emoluments is multiplied and all the means of seducing the minds are added to those of subduing the force of the people the same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes and the opportunities of fraud growing out of a state of war and in the degeneracy of manners and morals engendered by both no nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare
4663002 in the end the party would announce that 2 plus 2 made 5 and you would have to believe it it was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later the logic of their position demanded it
4663003 i do not believe in the creed professed by the jewish church by the roman church by the greek church by the turkish church by the protestant church nor by any church that i know of my own mind is my own church
4663004 all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit
4663005 i do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise they have the same right to their belief as i have to mine but it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe
4663006 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
4663007 let your boat of life be light packed with only what you need a homely home and simple pleasure one or two friends worth the name someone to love and someone to love you a cat a dog and a pipe or two enough to eat and enough to wear and a little more than enough to drink for thirst is a dangerous thing
4663008 we are all born ignorant but one must work hard to remain stupid
4663009 a thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity stability and beauty of the biotic community it is wrong when it tends otherwise
4663010 living is a constant process of deciding what we are going to do
4663011 the founders of our nation were nearly all infidels and that of the presidents who had thus far been elected washington adams jefferson madison monroe adams jackson not a one had professed a belief in christianity
4663012 among all our presidents from washington downward not one was a professor of religion at least not of more than unitarianism
4663013 undoubtedly all men are not equally fit subjects for civilization and because the majority like dogs and sheep are tame by inherited disposition this is no reason why the others should have their natures broken that they may be reduced to the same level
4663014 there are plenty of good reasons for fighting but no good reason ever to hate without reservation to imagine that god almighty himself hates with you too wheres evil its that large part of every man that wants to hate without limit that wants to hate with god on its side its that part of every man that finds all kinds of ugliness so attractive its that part of an imbecile that punishes and vilifies and makes war gladly
4663015 i am diogenes the dog i nuzzle the kind bark at the greedy and bite scoundrels

4663047 ik wist natuurlijk dat een finale heel moeilijk zou worden maar ik wilde er toch zo dicht mogelijk bij zitten dat is dus niet echt het geval
4663048 the market is showing huge growth in terms of units sold but this is coming at a price
4663049 price cutting has left several vendors struggling to turn a profit and the economic climate isnt helping meanwhile they have to continue to finance research and development to ensure they have the right feature set to attract future new buyers and those who will soon be considering upgrading from the systems they already have
4663050 we expect to see the rise of not just navigation but an array of map enabled and location based services lbs on mobile phones in the coming quarters
4663051 lbs in various forms have been talked about for years but consumer awareness and acceptance of the benefits of personal navigation combined with improvements in positioning technologies and the rising number of gps enabled devices in consumers hands are all helping to provide a strong foundation for this market to develop
4663052 there will be a shake up in business models as pnd vendors in particular have to address the mobile phone threat and the shift toward business driven by connected dynamic services
4663053 carrier and channel relationships will need to change and develop alongside consumer propositions and payment models putting a phone inside a pnd may give you a new product but it doesnt give you a strategy
4663054 today many owners are not making full use of their smart phones features
4663055 concern over usage costs is still a big barrier though wider availability of flat rate data plans will help and usability still needs to improve for certain applications on many devices people are also wary of draining their battery and not being able to make calls battery life isnt helped by having gps and wi fi turned on nor by having a large bright screen for navigation or web browsing but there is clear demand for those features and applications and advances in battery technology would enable quite substantial changes in usage patterns with all the service revenue benefits that would bring
4663056 something that stood out in the latest survey was that those who already owned a portable navigation device pnd showed only a slight preference toward paying to have these services on their pnd rather than on their mobile phone
4663057 there is already quite high acceptance in principle that even key driving related location services would be delivered to the phone

4663061 as precedent a similar windfall tax was levied when labour came to power in 1997 on the unearned profits of the newly privatised utilities and raised 4 5 billion similarly in 1981 the conservative government levied a windfall tax on the main clearing banks justified on the grounds that increased interest rates led to substantial unearned profits in 2008 the spike in the price of oil has today lead to substantial unearned profits for the main oil and energy companies we therefore call on the government to levy a windfall tax

4663100 we hope that election of the prime minister removes the last barrier to speedy formation of a government constructive action on key issues facing nepal and a start on the difficult but necessary task of drafting nepals new constitution
4663101 the united states will continue its strong support for peace democracy human rights and development in nepal we look forward to working with the new government of the federal democratic republic of nepal and building upon the historic ties between our peoples

4663105 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal under the leadership of prachanda the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4663106 the integration of the peoples liberation army into the nepal army will see lots of arguments and counter arguments the way they deal with the army is very crucial
4663107 the maoists will try to bring in populist and radical economic reforms but financially they will have lots of constraints

4663122 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
4663123 one officer asked me in english what were my views of tibet
4663124 i told him i was a journalist and didnt have any views
4663125 one of our chinese staff asked why they arrested me and an officer said didnt you see

4663138 the obsession with northern ireland and particularly policing on the east coast of america was something we identified very quickly as needing to be dealt with
4663139 the work we did in the states for the past six years has been unravelling 35 years of a very one dimensional interpretation of policing the republican agenda and turning that into an accurate description of what policing actually was
4663140 its not the content of the conversation thats important but that the conversation takes place
4663141 there will come a point when speaking to the unspeakable will happen and the role of the police is to create the conditions where people realise this terrorism aint going to work
4663142 an awful lot of people who are so called al qaeda are actually radicalised young disenfranchised british
4663143 the more you can get into those communities and build confidence in them the more chances you have of making them see the crazy way theyre going
4663144 because of that there are fewer customer calls and inquiries coming in
4663145 right now we dont know if its one individual or five individuals
4663146 theres still a lot of decisions to be made about that and even who those individuals would be
4663147 very confident that we can land new business at this particular site as well as the business as a whole
4663148 using tools such as the chambers webbased job search engine and community job fairs and work with the state of arkansas to minimize this decisions impact to the hot springs economy
4663149 we believe that accent is fully committed to finding solutions to this issue and has a strong desire to remain in hot springs
4663150 the hot springs facility has consistently remained one of accents top performing centers and an outstanding place to work gcedc and the chamber share accents commitment today to protect and preserve those jobs for this community
4663151 when you look at what you need to maintain your business customer care and support is certainly one of the top things that all companies should be focused on
4663152 so we believe there definitely is a demand for it its just unfortunate that we are being negatively impacted at this point but we are definitely hopeful and positive that well be able to find new business
4663153 he actually rode it like a slide down and fortunately he wasnt injured but the impact is we now have a very large piece of the old bridge down on the ground and the track hoe on top of it well need to figure out how to break that up into smaller pieces and get it off the road
4663154 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4663155 the verbal assurance that president dmitry medvedev gave that russian military operations had stopped clearly was not honoured
4663156 yes ideally we would like a vote formalizing the ceasefire this weekend
4663157 but well take as long as it takes we are not going to push for a vote if we know that the russians will veto the text which does not mean we have to give in to all their demands there has to be hard bargaining
4663158 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4663159 moscow must honour its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4663160 a significant part of georgian territory remains under foreign military occupation
4663161 never ever will georgia reconcile itself with the occupation of even one square kilometre of its territory
4663162 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4663164 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4663165 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4663166 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4663167 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4663168 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4663169 we had passion and more determination than they did today

4663184 youve got to look at the environment he was put in with the red bulls the last time i looked he had a couple of championships
4663185 yo who the fuck is this who the fuck is grabbin me
4663186 on the inside where they can be watched rather than on the outside where they can cause trouble without it being detected until their effects are felt
4663187 the practice was called yellow journalism it was called yellow journalism because the materials used to make the newspaper were basically garbage and the odds of it being true were the odds of the knicks going to the playoffs bullshit
4663188 avoid expletives also the stories had an element of truth
4663189 little difference between tutored students and those who were eligible but did not receive tutoring
4663190 because we sell the program to a school and it is up to them to maintain fidelity which doesnt always happen therefore that data tends to be unreliable
4663191 this is kaplan day we will do the observation another day
4663192 to be closer to the new york city department of education
4663193 so that teachers who may be new or not the greatest or smartest teachers in the world can follow the script and still give a great lesson
4663194 but nclb has not been the driver of kaplans rapid expansion
4663195 good schools succeed for many reasons but bad schools fail for all the same ones
4663196 since many of you are young and intelligent many students will see you as bercool its important to remember to keep a safe distance to remain berprofessional let them know you could be working toward your ph d but youre not youre here teaching them
4663197 are you saying there are things in the kaplan prep book we arent already doing with our classes
4663198 you guys are doing a great job in your classes
4663199 but this book will help you translate the content and help your students bridge that knowledge performance gap
4663200 we can just pick and choose lessons exercises and questions from the book we can work it in
4663201 were supposed to be teaching sat curriculum once a week we didnt pay all this money for this program for it not to be done right
4663202 enrique has been missing class and sleeping when hes here
4663203 the kids tell me hes joined a gang ive been asking around
4663204 i know but they say he got kicked out because he missed a chapter meeting so thats why hes been back in school lately
4663205 well you know what i mean i mean hes too lazy to even be in a gang
4663206 kids ask me why manny isnt up on the wall of fame with greenspan kissinger and javits
4663207 some say its discrimination i tell them no the reason manny isnt up there is because manny didnt graduate youve got to have a diploma to get on the wall
4663208 she can even zoom in then shell ask is that you theres no arguing with the tape if the kid tries to deny it its over hes out
4663209 so why are we just getting around to it now
4663210 how many of my calculators do you have at home now ryan
4663211 you get a point for a correct answer you lose a quarter point for an incorrect answer and you dont lose anything for skipping
4663212 mr samuels the math teacher youll be working with tomorrow said hed be up here too ill introduce you
4663213 its really no different from any other kind of writing apart from the fact that its very hard to write an original story about sex
4663214 an editor youve worked with in the past might say we need 1 200 words in a couple of days
4663215 afraid she was going to have to get on the phone and start begging folks
4663216 she and the rest of the group seem to understand
4663217 now think about tropical plants you have seen in the caribbean
4663218 what do those plants look like in the middle of winter
4663219 they got flowers and some even got fruits hanging down
4663220 we said that the plants in new york drop their leaves and the ones in the d r do not
4663221 we said that this is because it gets cold here and it does not get so cold there right
4663222 so what does this tell us about how these plants are adapted
4663223 the plants in d r are adapted to the warm weather and the ones here are adapted to the cold
4663224 yes so why does the cell need to be unlocked
4663225 if you see the word homeostasis in the answer choices
4663226 so if i see that word homeostasis its probably right
4663227 but lauren wanted me to remind you that we need to give the students the final diagnostic exam
4663228 i wont be there on test day to give you this help
4663229 are almost guaranteed to coarsen the mentalities of children and to manufacture restlessness and discontent
4663230 its not about the work you show its about getting the right answer
4663231 but id probably get an apple if i was you
4663232 pay nah it doesnt work like that you dont need to pay its free
4663233 he wants some apples not the ones that are all banged up not the mushy ones get him the good ones
4663234 halfweg heb ik twee slechte balken gesprongen en dan verlies je een pak plaatsen
4663235 zon 400 500 meter verder versnelden ze en kon ik niet volgen mijn opwarming ging nochtans heel goed ik had in het begin van de wedstrijd ook een beetje schrik omdat het te traag ging ik dacht zelf over te nemen maar toen ging de zuid afrikaan naar de kop en hij liep een goed tempo maar eigenlijk was het nog te traag om voor de plaatsen van de tijdsnelsten te gaan er stond echter te veel wind en ik ben blijven zitten
4663236 ik wist natuurlijk dat een finale heel moeilijk zou worden maar ik wilde er toch zo dicht mogelijk bij zitten dat is dus niet echt het geval
4663237 t he contest is named after 19th century author edward bulwer lytton writer of the much parodied opening it was a dark and stormy night
4663238 theirs was a new york love a checkered taxi ride burning rubber and like the city their passion was open 24 7 steam rising from their bodies like slick streets exhaling warm moist white breath through manhole covers stamped forged by delaney bros
4663239 with them being more visible i would definitely feel safe
4663240 were just trying to deliver a higher level of customer service to our visitors
4663241 we have not been hurt at all right now were kind of smiling
4663242 we showed up at the facility unannounced today the doors were wide open and we managed to shoot for several minutes until a denver sheriffs captain asked us to leave
4663243 each of these fenced in areas is about five yards by five yards
4663244 theres a lock on the door how long those arrested will be kept here is not known
4663245 if 300 people are taken to denvers temporary detention facility within a short time frame processing those persons at the rate of 30 to 50 per hour would take at least 6 to 10 hours
4663246 during the republican national convention in new york city in 2004 nearly 1 100 people were arrested in a four hour period if a similar situation occurred in denver it would take at least 22 to 36 hours to process those persons
4663247 very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp
4663248 at the temporary facility denver will of course also be required to provide for detainees basic human needs such as adequate food and drinking water access to toilets and facilities for washing and access to medical care if necessary
4663249 detainees must also be allowed the opportunity for bodily movement including release from handcuffs or flexicuffs
4663250 denver must establish a system to ensure that detainees are assured of access to medically necessary prescription medications they may be taking some arrestees will need prescription medications that are in the possession of family members who were not arrested denver will have to arrange a system to receive the medications from family members and then deliver them to the appropriate prisoner failure to deliver appropriate and necessary medications could result in serious deterioration and damage to a detainees health
4663251 this facility will not be used for long term detention
4663252 arrestees who are processed at this facility will be there for no more than the few hours it requires for processing water bathrooms medical staff and phones will be available to them the facility will be fully staffed to ensure its safe and secure operation
4663253 you have a suspicious substance that was found in a hotel room in conjunction with person being a foreign national and we have a lot of questions and that is why we are assisting
4663254 having the bible in one hand and a bread in the other hand is not a correct thing kill them kill them kill them that is my massage sic
4663255 the protesters goal is to block delegate access leaving the hotels on the six bridges leading to st
4663256 anarchists plan to cut off the arena from entering delegates
4663257 they already know that people are against the war people are against pollution and global warming and racism
4663258 we dont think the political elite will stop because we ask nicely
4663259 and so we advocate a strategy of direct action in this case not letting them hold the convention
4663260 the rnc welcoming committee says property destruction is not part of their plans but they wouldnt rule it out either
4663261 this account has been suspended either the domain has been overused or the reseller ran out of resources
4663262 crash the convention we didnt get an invitation but were showing up anyway this party will be what we make of it together we can derail the purely ceremonial show of this repressive system and remake it with our own hands and according to our own visions
4663263 due to a unique corporate anarchist confidentiality agreement the exact number of tasers or documentable evidence of this new order will not be disclosed
4663264 convention delegates and attendees should feel free to enjoy their five star hotels three course meals and gentlemans clubs without fear of protest or disruption after all if they follow the law and dont start any illegal wars or anything what should they have to worry about
4663265 in the event of a true disaster itll make sure were prepared
4663266 and that baby is not going to wait for decontamination so we need to figure out what wed do right away
4663267 if you have a drill that goes perfectly no one learns
4663268 it familiarizes our guys with the inner workings of denver
4663269 they get a good idea of how the city is laid out and how to work with different agencies
4663270 its all in preparation for anything that could possibly happen with the global war on terrorism
4663271 i waved at one of the copters and someone waved back
4663272 at 10 30 p m i did turn on my air conditioning fan to drown out the choppers because it was a little noisy
4663273 unfortunately if its a small inconvenience to those people who are not sleeping that well at night flight ops do stop at 11 p m so in my mind its a small inconvenience to pay for freedom
4663274 but absolutely not for special operations command we have nothing to do with the democratic national convention
4663275 they gave us the heads up that they were going to be conducting the exercise
4663276 advance notice was given to the denver civil authorities we were here as guests
4663277 it would be up to local authorities to send it out
4663278 a lot of acts of terror take place in times of political change and theres an awareness of that
4663279 so were looking at when our political employees leave who acts in their place in case of an incident
4663280 there have been a lot of efforts to rethink the organizational structure
4663281 but i would caution against doing any reorganizing anytime soon
4663282 one of our biggest strides is defining the difference between headquarters and the components
4663283 i think its wistful to think that it wont happen by 20 years
4663284 to turn over to a local district judge decisions of national security and life and death that should be made by the president and congress is the most extraordinarily arrogant and destructive decision the supreme court has made in its history
4663285 he applauded this court decision this court decision is a disaster which could cost us a city
4663286 i knew the footprints thing was cgi but the swap of the little girls is beyond the pale years from now one girl has a video record of the event the other has the memory of not being cute enough
4663287 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4663288 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4663289 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4663290 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4663291 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4663292 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4663293 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4663294 challenging market conditions in our industry obviously have impacted five stars second quarter neither five star nor its customers are immune from negative economic factors affecting in particular the housing and home improvement industries disciplined management has always been a hallmark of five star and that culture now serves the company well in adapting to these conditions we have taken a number of steps to reduce overhead protect margins and manage working capital i have great confidence in our seasoned operating team as we work through this downturn
4663295 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4663296 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4663297 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4663298 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4663299 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4663300 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4663301 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4663302 to work with the national railroad hall of fame to locate publicly owned property downtown on which the national railroad hall of fame can construct their facility the scope and scale of which will be determined as the hall of fame completes its feasibility studies and initiates its national fundraising efforts
4663303 the general intent is at that point we would be ready to say ok we need this much space and we know the size of the building
4663304 that may be property the city already owns it may be property the city may acquire
4663305 in the event the hall of fame is unable to find property on its own we would work toward trying to find some city owned property to help located the hall of fame on
4663306 this evil is danger for everybody not just for us
4663307 we will of course respond in just the same way we have responded there should be no doubt about this
4663308 home prices in the u s are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
4663309 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
4663310 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
4663311 mr greenspan has been criticized for contributing to todays woes by keeping interest rates too low too long and by regulating too lightly he has been aggressively defending his record in interviews in op ed pieces and in a new chapter in his recent book included in the paperback version to be published next month mr greenspan attributes the rise in house prices to a historically unusual period in which world markets pushed interest rates down and even sophisticated investors misjudged the risks they were taking
4663312 theres no credible argument for bailing out bear stearns and not the gses
4663313 give them enough that they can do anything but not enough so they can do nothing
4663314 the fund will be invested in high quality bonds and other fixed income securities including us treasury federal agency mortgage backed asset backed and corporate securities the fund may also have a limited portion of assets in high yield and foreign bonds including emerging market debt
4663315 the enemy of a good plan is the search for a perfect plan
4663316 government funded free food in every grocery store consisting of four items dried beans powdered milk and a couple of other similar basics and even a daily multi vitamen thrown in no eligibility workers little administration etc amp every american would be eligible and get these items free
4663317 an individual households food stamp allotment is equal to the maximum allotment for that households size less 30 percent of the households net income
4663318 queensland has looked overseas for innovations that will help us improve health care delivery in the face of a worldwide shortage of doctors
4663319 physicians assistants will extend the capacity of our highly skilled medical workforce
4663320 we need to provide the best possible training for junior doctors and for doctors to gain experience they must have opportunities to see patients and do procedures
4663321 we are concerned if physician assistants are increasingly used they could be substituted for doctors in some of these roles and the training of junior medicos compromised
4663322 intelligent input darlin why dont you just have another beer then
4663323 id rather be with your friends mate cause they are much fitter

4663325 old people considering leaving us your money in your will
4663326 there arent enough wierdos like her here to make a place like that work
4663327 there arent enough wierdos like her here to make a place like that work
4663328 i just broke down and cried i felt down at once
4663329 he was awesome he was such a great kid weve got to be strong and get through it
4663330 i was thinking it wasnt real it didnt seem possible that he would do something like that he wasnt that kind of kid
4663331 straight a student friends with everyone people looked up to him people wanted to be him
4663332 hes always going to be on our minds were going to play for him and that will make us stronger as a team
4663333 whoever the next president is he will have significant difficulties to deal with in the us russia relationship
4663334 senator obamas view is that we need to review all aspects of our bilateral and multilateral arrangements with russia in order to assess where they ought to go from here
4663335 if russia is going to take the position that not only is it not interested in integrating in that fashion but it is not going to allow its supposedly sovereign and independent neighbors to do so that calls into doubt the entire premise of us european and western international relations with russia
4663336 i dont think there is much difference between the candidates on this question and its going to be a huge challenge for the next administration
4663337 a mccain administration would be directly and overtly adversarial to russia but i think that you can overstate the differences between the two candidates on this subject
4663338 the russian government desperately wants the west to treat it as an important and respected great power
4663339 we can and should withhold that treatment no diplomatic business as usual
4663340 reports from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and air force reserve hurricane hunter aircraft indicate that the low pressure area over the mona passage became a tropical storm as it moved into the eastern dominican republic
4663341 the center of fay will cross hispaniola tonight and saturday and pass near or over eastern cuba saturday night and sunday
4663342 i grew up watching ed mcmahon i think hes a terrific guy
4663343 even a man who hadnt had such a great career shouldnt have this happen to them in their later years im doing my best but this is a very difficult situation
4663344 lets just see what the deal is and what were offered
4663345 in a typical deal the person who buys it is doing it as an investment because its a good piece of property
4663346 so they expect the person living there to cover the carrying costs the insurance the gardening the utilities the taxes when a persons in trouble they dont even have the money to even do that so a lot of them go very sour
4663347 youre acting as a child protecting your parent theyre hoping itll be a good investment but if not its going to be there
4663348 i love to show them off i want people to know this is not just something you get in jail that you dont have to be a criminal to get a tattoo
4663349 theres a lot of people who do come out without tattoos that are curious we offer them real cool temporary tattoos and sometimes they come back the next year with real ones
4663350 its almost harder to find someone who doesnt have one
4663351 pretty much the people i looked up to were sleeved tattooed from shoulder to wrist
4663352 why does anyone do anything for most of us its just good fun for some people its a rite of passage for others its sport
4663353 of course it hurts every single time you have to appreciate how hard we push to do what we do
4663354 they distribute their weight equally among the hooks and the number of hooks are determined based on the persons body weight
4663355 the hooks go through the entire layer of skin and skin is tough

4663358 and you cant divorce the law from the truth the ten commandments can help a judge know the difference between right and wrong
4663359 reliance on the truth of the ten commandments or on the truth found in the bible
4663360 absolutely it can arise in many different ways but one of the areas where this comes up most frequently is in making child custody decisions without some guiding principles how do you decide what is in the best interest of the child i often use this example and i havent seen anybody publish it yet if you had a child custody case in which the parents appeared otherwise equally able to parent the child but one was a christian or a jewish person and the other was a satanist who do you give the child to the answer to that question is a religious answer you seldom have that extreme but you have variations of that issue that arise in child custody cases that is just an extreme example but the principle comes up in all kinds of situations of the law
4663361 mckathan dropped to his knees and prayed aloud during a court hearing in february and told the 100 people in the courtroom that he was not afraid to call on the name of jesus christ witnesses said and ordered all to join hands and pray
4663362 no matter how hard conservative apologists for the christian right try they cannot locate endorsements of religion god theism or christianity in the constitution at no point does the constitution exhibit anything less than a fully secular godless character the american constitution was a novel experiment in the creation of a secular government on the basis of popular sovereignty and democratic principles all of this would be undermined by the christian right

4663364 for the same reason dr seuss counsels his readers to sing with a ying or play ring the gack these things are fun and fun is good
4663365 from my own point of view the fact of the third reich alone makes obsolete forever any question of christian superiority except in technological terms
4663366 the future historian will rank him as one of the heroes of the nineteenth century
4663367 one of the bravest grandest champions of human liberty the world has ever seen
4663368 freedom was what he preached he wanted the shackles off everywhere
4663369 his life and work have been an inspiration to the whole earth
4663370 depth and complexity of living nature still exceeds human imagination
4663371 how would the rest of nature respond if it were suddenly relieved of the relentless pressures we heap on it and our fellow organisms how soon would or could the climate return to where it was before we fired up all our engines how long would it take to recover lost ground and restore eden to the way it must have gleamed and smelled the day before adam or homo habilis appeared could nature ever obliterate all our traces
4663372 it makes just as much sense to think of agriculture as something the grasses did to people as a way to conquer the trees

4663386 crap baseball who wants to watch baseball i wanted something exciting like soccer
4663387 if we knew he wouldnt play we wouldnt have sent him
4663388 the guys made a lot of big plays behind me asdrubal cabrera especially ive told him about it four times since the game ended
4663389 its too early to think of those things but cliff has had as good a year as anybody
4663390 it looked like he lost his feel you turn the page on this hell bounce back
4663391 with the ball in the air i dont know why the guy was running but i thank him for that
4663392 maybe he thought it would drop all i know is that figgins is so fast i had to get off the mound and try to make a play
4663393 i always play hard but with cliff i bear down more because i know he gets groundballs
4663394 any time you have runners in scoring position against him you have to make it count

4663407 more than 300 works of art paintings sketches sculptures and other pieces by such artists as pablo picasso john singleton copley alberto giacometti giorgio morandi and eugene boudin were discovered after the death of the apartments occupant william m v kingsland
4663408 one bizarre side note a mover hired by the public administrators office to transport the contents of kingslands apartment to a warehouse was charged for stealing two picasso sketches each valued at approximately 30 000 and it turns out that was not the first time those two sketches had been stolen sometime before they ended up in kingslands collection they were stolen from a new york art gallery around 1967

4663428 shes like all earth mama with her 10 000 kids and her womens bible
4663429 tis not right a woman going into such places by herself
4663430 that chick hilary swank played in that hbo movie the suffragist
4663431 its a global problem not just a russian or u s problem
4663432 all models are wrong and increasingly you can succeed without them
4663433 he spent more time talking to me than to einstein
4663434 for me he was the last titan the only physics superhero still standing
4663435 he rejuvenated general relativity he made it an experimental subject and took it away from the mathematicians
4663436 some people think wheelers gotten crazy in his later years but hes always been crazy
4663437 you can talk about people like buddha jesus moses confucius but the thing that convinced me that such people existed were the conversations with bohr
4663438 he was trying to fight against the idea that the laws of physics could lead to a singularity
4663439 teaches us that space can be crumpled like a piece of paper into an infinitesimal dot that time can be extinguished like a blown out flame and that the laws of physics that we regard as sacred as immutable are anything but
4663440 geons black holes amp quantum foam a life in physics
4663441 we are no longer satisfied with insights only into particles or fields of force or geometry or even space and time
4663442 today we demand of physics some understanding of existence itself
4663443 standing like moses on the top of mount pisgah looking out over the promised land that his people will one day inherit
4663444 i know i was transformed as a scientist by him not just by listening to him in the classroom or by his physics idea i think even more important was his confidence in me
4663445 if theres one thing in physics i feel more responsible for than any other its this perception of how everything fits together
4663446 i like to think of myself as having a sense of judgment im willing to go anywhere talk to anybody ask any question that will make headway
4663447 i confess to being an optimist about things especially about someday being able to understand how things are put together
4663448 and here s another clue for you all the walrus was paul
4663449 its based on a novel by a man named lear
4663450 she has withdrawn from the olympics and will not be traveling to beijing
4663451 i had no idea it was so difficult for multiracials
4663452 i think most people in the united states assume that individuals are in one and one only racial group
4663453 its the younger generation that is becoming more aware that these lines dont make sense
4663454 i dont think this is something he can simply say through words if he says im biracial or im half white
4663455 i think what he will do is tell his story again at the convention in a way that says this is not a story about race this is a story about america
4663456 the visibility of barack obama may lead more people to identify with multiple races
4663457 oh i was lonely oh can we play in the rain
4663458 me parece que se alarm mucho al pueblo con una onda tropical hoy quer a llevar a mi gente a pi ones y cuando llegu al mediod a hac a un sol perfecto el gobierno exagera

4663471 i was just doing a pedicure and mr johnson came in and asked if his stylist had had her baby yet
4663472 you dont ever think anything like that about somebody until it happens
4663473 he just kept to himself sit with his hands not really say much just a quiet type of person
4663474 he didnt need a haircut or to check on the status of her
4663475 he wanted to know if she had had it and that was it which was a little different
4663476 total control over dates of business travel with at least two weeks notice prior to travel

4663479 graduation prom everybody wants to see the senior year so its gonna
4663480 she has withdrawn from the olympics and will not be traveling to beijing
4663481 kids causing trouble because so many of them didnt have enough to do
4663482 because i cant go a whole year without the library
4663483 using the public computing space for nothing more than entertainment
4663484 weve been personally served a lien notice that theyre filing a lien on the house were responsible for aks debts
4663485 they started construction on this about three years ago and now there are about 300 homes up here and they are upscale homes
4663486 ive already been told they are going to finish those other eight homes i believe jody petty and his associates are
4663487 im just shocked trying to take it step by step
4663488 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4663489 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4663490 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4663491 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4663492 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4663493 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4663494 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4663495 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4663496 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4663497 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4663498 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4663499 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4663500 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4663501 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4663502 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4663503 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4663504 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4663505 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4663506 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4663507 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4663508 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4663509 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4663510 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4663511 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4663512 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4663513 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4663514 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4663515 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4663516 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4663517 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4663518 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4663519 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4663520 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4663521 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4663522 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4663523 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4663524 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4663525 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4663526 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4663527 the usa is busy with its own missile defense system it does not intend to defend poland at this point poland lays itself open to attack giving the usa a permission to deploy the system the country may become an object of russias reaction such targets are destroyed in the first instance
4663528 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4663529 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4663530 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4663531 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4663532 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4663533 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4663534 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4663535 he said you know im agnostic on the science and im agnostic on the politics
4663536 and were looking at them now the coast guard we welcome their presence
4663537 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4663538 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4663539 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4663540 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4663541 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4663542 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4663543 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4663544 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4663545 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4663546 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4663547 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4663548 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4663549 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4663550 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4663551 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4663552 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4663553 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4663554 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4663555 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4663556 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4663557 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4663558 this is a planning took where all things are going
4663559 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4663560 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4663561 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4663562 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4663563 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4663564 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4663565 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4663566 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4663567 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4663568 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4663569 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4663570 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4663571 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4663572 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4663573 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4663574 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4663575 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4663576 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4663577 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4663578 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4663579 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4663580 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4663581 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4663582 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4663583 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4663584 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4663585 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4663586 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4663587 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4663588 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4663589 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4663590 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4663591 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4663592 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4663593 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4663594 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4663595 estamos retomando estos actividades como campa a para impulsar en diferentes pocas del a o la oferta nacional de nuestro producto bandera y mostrar a la poblaci n y a los demandantes externos la calidad del pisco
4663596 este incremento se da precisamente luego que las autoridades p blicas decidieron promover a nivel nacional la competencia entre los productores del pisco lo que se traduce en el significativo crecimiento de la producci n
4663597 este a o buscaremos que m s productores artesanales expongan sus productos se convocar a compradores importantes de estas producciones y tambi n a los consumidores
4663598 oh great here we go again someone else preaching about the evils of the meat eater
4663599 at a time when world records seemed to have hit the ceiling of whats physically possible to wrestle out of the human organism phelps has been the man who managed to push the limits with his magnificent performance
4663600 any average adult human being needs some 2 500 daily calories to live a life without excesses
4663601 of course when youre in the presence of a monster like michael phelps those parameters can go to hell

4663609 he carried the torch for bud when he left san jose state

4663611 the country is more or less saturated with the gospel
4663612 you need to get help i received all those things at san jose

4663621 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4663622 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4663623 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4663624 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4663625 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4663626 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet

4663632 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4663633 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4663634 i knew i gave it all i had to give
4663635 it makes it sweeter knowing ive been through injuries and some doubts its definitely been a long journey
4663636 it couldnt be better with usa placing first and second
4663637 i knew i couldnt because its the olympics and making up six tenths is kind of a dream
4663638 i knew i gave it all i had to give
4663639 it makes it sweeter knowing ive been through injuries and some doubts its definitely been a long journey
4663640 it couldnt be better with usa placing first and second
4663641 i knew i couldnt because its the olympics and making up six tenths is kind of a dream

4663644 when the fair starts i hope the sun shines that it doesnt rain anymore no hailstorms thatd be good
4663645 ill tell you the weather can affect your fair in such a way that your revenues will drop tremendously it affects the carnival revenue the food revenue beer sales
4663646 we sort of like rain about 8 oclock at night we have em trapped in here when it rains
4663647 it depends on the weather whether its worth it or not
4663648 this is a standard response by management in labor negotiations they hope this threat will stampede our membership to take a bad deal the risk that actors may not receive increases retroactively is more than offset by the long term damage that would result from a premature deal that eliminates residuals for work done for new media and reused on new media or from allowing signatory producers to produce non union
4663649 that no non union work shall be authorized to be done under any sag agreement and
4663650 that all work done under a screen actors guild contract regardless of budget level shall receive fair compensation when reused

4663657 dieser trend wird sich voraussichtlich weiter fortsetzen und auch auf regionen wie afrika indien und zentralamerika bergreifen

4663666 rejuvenated georgian president cites us ties as a turning point in conflict
4663667 during a private dinner on july 9 ms rices aides say she warned president mikheil saakashvili of georgia not to get into a military conflict with russia that georgia could not win she told him in no uncertain terms that he had to put a non use of force pledge on the table according to a senior administration official who accompanied ms rice to the georgian capital
4663668 one of defiant support for georgia in the face of russian pressure
4663669 we are also very grateful for your support for our peace plan for the conflicts and for your unwavering support for georgias territorial integrity
4663670 the hospital like any other business is going to try to recoup its cost by charging other people more
4663671 transitional government that could then prepare for an election so that we could get back to a democratic path
4663672 recently in the positions of a number of council member states we have seen an ever more obvious attempt to take the council beyond its chartered prerogatives and beyond maintaining international peace and security
4663673 american troops would join the polish military at least temporarily at the front lines facing east toward russia
4663674 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people
4663675 poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4663676 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4663677 the usa is busy with its own missile defense system
4663678 it does not intend to defend poland at this point poland lays itself open to attack by giving the usa permission to deploy the system the country may become an object of russias reaction such targets are destroyed in the first instance
4663679 the deployment of new anti missile forces has as its aim the russian federation
4663680 therefore any fairy tales about deterring other states fairy tales that with the help of this system we will deter some sort of rogue states no longer work
4663681 it is inconceivable that the americans were unaware of georgias mobilization and intentions it is also inconceivable that the americans were unaware that the russians had deployed substantial forces on the south ossetian frontier us technical intelligence from satellite imagery and signals intelligence to unmanned aerial vehicles could not miss the fact that thousands of russian troops were moving to forward positions
4663682 particularly from the lips of the permanent representative of a country whose actions we are aware of including with regard to civilian populations in iraq and afghanistan and serbia
4663683 the days of satellites and spheres of influence are behind us
4663684 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4663685 the fighting which broke out over the weekend between russia and georgia has brought israels intensive involvement in the region into the limelight this involvement includes the sale of advanced weapons to georgia and the training of the georgian armys infantry forces

4663689 nintendo has experienced phenomenal growth in the region over the past few years growth that has even surpassed what we have seen in the united states
4663690 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4663691 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4663692 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4663693 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4663694 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4663695 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4663696 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4663700 el inicio de lo que parece ser una gran escalada de actos violentos que ya han anunciado algunos dirigentes c vicos
4663701 est en contra de lo que quiere el pa s
4663702 respetamos la demanda regional de autonom a pero no creemos que a t tulo de autonom a se puedan justificar actitudes de violencia como las que hoy se desarrollaron en contra de la polic a y de la sana convivencia entre los bolivianos
4663703 en vez de velar por la seguridad ciudadana han incrementado los niveles de violencia
4663704 cualquier intento de agredir o reemplazar a esta instituci n est destinada al fracaso
4663705 varios parlamentarios de la oposici n que estaban usando la violencia y agrediendo
4663706 creemos que ste es el momento en el que las nacionales y departamentales debemos hablar con madurez
4663707 las agresiones llevadas a cabo hoy por instrucciones del ministro rada
4663708 nos hemos reunido con la polic a ante su ofrecimiento de entregar esa instituci n y subordinarla a mi autoridad como comandante general del departamento tal y como lo establece la constituci n pol tica del estado
4663709 no permitiremos la militarizaci n ni caeremos en las provocaciones de los masistas los partidarios del movimiento al socialismo el partido de morales que una vez m s quieren causar luto en nuestro pueblo
4663710 demos o pontap inicial estamos na rea do conhecimento e o empresariado de ponte dos carvalhos soube aproveitar bem a oportunidade capacitando se para a disputa no crescente mercado
4663711 el fondo de esta controversia es el rechazo a la pretensi n por parte de diputados locales y l deres pol ticos de incrementar el dinero que se entrega a los partidos lo considero excesivo bajo las nuevas condiciones que regulan las contiendas electorales
4663712 el mundo ha observado con gran preocupaci n c mo rusia ha invadido un estado vecino soberano y amenazado un gobierno democr ticamente elegido
4663713 esencial que ee uu y otros pa ses libres garanticen que una democracia asediada permanezca soberana segura y unida
4663714 rusia ha puesto sus aspiraciones en riesgo al llevar a cabo acciones en georgia que son inconsistentes con los principios de estas instituciones
4663715 para comenzar a reparar las relaciones con ee uu europa y otras naciones y para comenzar a recuperar su lugar en el mundo rusia debe actuar y poner fin a esta crisis
4663716 pay attention to what you hear with the measure you use it will be measured to you and still more will be added to you for to the one who has more will be given and from the one who has not even what he has will be taken away
4663717 thousands of people already feel comfortable coming to national community church because theyve been to the theaters before we are familiar to them
4663718 many of the 40 50 people who set up and tore down really struggled to find their place of ministry because their team had been disbanded
4663719 on the other hand if you are totally dependent on your foyer to build relationships you may be in trouble anyways
4663720 people dont have to be afraid of going in because they already know what to expect theyve been there before
4663721 you can only step through doors god opens for you some churches rent some buy but whether renting is a pro or con is really only limited gods direction i have been in both scenarios both rental properties and multimillion dollar facilities all had their unique challenges but it was what god provided
4663722 when the facts change i change my mind what do you do sir
4663723 el fondo de esta controversia es el rechazo a la pretensi n por parte de diputados locales y l deres pol ticos de incrementar el dinero que se entrega a los partidos lo considero excesivo bajo las nuevas condiciones que regulan las contiendas electorales
4663724 podr n venir descalificaciones amagos y reacciones de todo tipo s que habr molestia por esta decisi n entre algunos liderazgos del estado sin embargo estoy seguro de que no habr el rompimiento del di logo y de los acuerdos por jalisco que he sostenido con estos grupos
4663725 sin embargo los montos que se han establecido en la reforma no corresponden a la realidad del estado por ello invito al congreso a revisar la manera en que se est calculando el financiamiento
4663726 excesiva cantidad de recursos que se pretende destinar a los partidos pol ticos afecta el presupuesto estatal
4663727 la controversia tiene fundamento en la constituci n en el que se afecta seriamente el presupuesto y que se violenta el esp ritu de la constituci n federal que fue precisamente para disminuir lo que se otorgaba a los partidos
4663728 recibimos en su comunicado de la cedhj una solicitud para que se suspenda temporalmente en tanto se resuelve el fondo del asunto en el sentido de si se est n o no violando los derechos de las personas

4663734 ils estiment que la tradition dit que le proph te mahomet sest battu contre les juifs et que par cons quent ils doivent continuer les combattre jusqu la mort
4663735 im a little confused as to the medias portrayal of glenn spagnuolo and the members of re create 68 as violent extremists
4663736 the controversy seems to stem from re create 68s refusal to disallow the right to self defense to its members re create 68s explanation of this refusal is clear there will be people protesting with re create 68 arm in arm with their children and elders in large part these will be representatives of communities which have most suffered from the never ending betrayal of the democrats to attempt to deny them the right to defend themselves is to deny a fundamental human right
4663737 cynthia mckinney green party candidate for president and rosa clemente green party candidate for vice president are not participating in any recreate 68 activities both candidates and the green party of colorado are refuting this announcement and are stating that neither candidate nor the green party of colorado are in any way associated with recreate 68 nor will any of their candidates be speaking at or attending any event nor are they in any way associated with the group recreate 68
4663738 everybody fuck around and make noise on their instrument until we decide to end the track
4663739 bring out the real fun turn on the real drums
4663740 entirely different world where sounds are played out in vivid colors right before your very eyes
4663741 whagh the ramones started punk not the sex pistols or any other band whagh i hate you

4663744 we wanted to be like insert hugely famous band here but different
4663745 four heavyweight 12 vinyl discs two cds a dvd and hardback book all housed within an embossed hardback box
4663746 look compared to god youre evil but even so you know how to be good to your children when your son asks for bread you dont hand him a rock to eat god does even better than that
4663747 its like really scary to know that were around here too and we can get our things stolen too
4663748 you know to think that someone could just knock on my door and just do whatever they think they can do to us and its very scary
4663749 the suspects were able to gain entry into these peoples homes through unlocked doors unlocked windows open garage doors and those things

4663752 weve moved on as a nation without a shadow of a doubt and theres still a couple more chances to go i think beckys got a good chance of winning a second gold if she does theyll make her a dame
4663753 i know what i want but i dont know where to start
4663754 have you got a pet right heres a gun its shoot the dog or win an olympic medal which one too late the dog shouldve been dead by now
4663755 even the likes of australia may have to revise their long range forecasts for london 2012

4663757 let c 5 in 5 4 let x 2 in c x
4663758 they used mass indiscriminate measures to collectively punish the entire population
4663759 we are not close to deploying the peacekeeping forces but we are looking at a variety of options the political presence of the u n what you could do in terms of maritime activities what you could do in terms of strengthening amisom the african union mission in somalia and considering under what circumstances one might do peacekeeping
4663760 the security situation in many parts of somalia and particularly mogadishu remains complex volatile and unpredictable
4663761 due to the complexity of the conflict shifting alliances and extremist activity the situation in south and central somalia can change daily making any location that is safe one day potentially dangerous the next
4663762 and in a strange way that lack of connection i had felt with jenny over recent months was widening further there was even more of a great gulf beginning to open up ahead placing a divide in time and space between us too
4663763 game may or may not continue depending on weather and other factors
4663764 we want to put our punters and kickers in front of a crowd and see how they perform
4663765 that will be a big priority weve also got to get some tackling work done and of course see how the quarterbacks do under pressure
4663766 the canadian radio television and telecommunications commission crtc approved the category 2 pay television service on wednesday allowing northern peaks to become
4663767 i think as canadians there is a bit of a tiredness in seeing all american stuff
4663768 i was just about to start dinner and i didnt want to leave poor jason here all by himself we are working on the church newsletter and then planning the annual summer carnival after dinner we have so much work to do i certainly hope we can get it all done
4663769 so jason you must be new to town i havent seen you before did you just move to calgary
4663770 well i am only here for a couple of months
4663771 i am very excited to be involved in all these church activities i am quite grateful for all the help your mother is providing in showing me around
4663772 your mother tells me you are not much of a church goer
4663773 is that because you are not a believer or perhaps you may have other reasons
4663774 to be honest i really dont share moms views on the church one bit although i am a believer i feel that the church these days is nothing more than a excuse to pick a mans pocket and offers nothing to those who really need it the most
4663775 take our last minister at the church the old reverend green for instance he was there for over fifty plus years before retiring and really did absolutely nothing aside from living high on the hog off all of his parishioners donations during his dirty reign of corruption
4663776 well ive met the elder reverend green and his wife just this past week
4663777 they are good simple living people and he is very well regarded within the church they certainly are not living beyond their means let me tell you
4663778 jason can i tell you a secret about the old reverend green there were rumours going around years ago when i was just a kid that the old reverend was pretty fond of the boys if you know what i mean
4663779 if these allegations held any truth why were they not brought forward at the time amp thoroughly investigated
4663780 no one has spoken of this since nothing was ever proven just a lot of talk amp rumours
4663781 i heard you made a rather large donation to the church yourself a couple of years ago
4663782 has your opinion of our church changed so much since then
4663783 i am surprised the church saw any of the donation my understanding is that young reverend green has a thing for the prostitutes its nice to see that not all of my money was used in such a vile and ungodly manner
4663784 dinner will be served in about 15 minutes but let me first introduce you to jason banks he will be joining us for dinner jason is the new reverend at the church temporarily filling in while young reverend green is on his two month sabbatical this summer
4663785 both these young fellas look like they are roasting in this house lets open up a window and go out on the patio for a cool drink before dinner
4663786 i had been mulling over many topics to discuss however after talking with your son he gave me some very good feedback so i think it will be on the truth and giving of yourself to the church a topic which truly can touch an entire community
4663787 i am really looking forward to your first sermon here i am sure there will be a huge turnout tomorrow as well to welcome you
4663788 i imagine you wont be attending the sermon boy being a saturday night im wagering you will be out on the town tonight late spending all your money and then sleeping it off all day sunday
4663789 ill be at reverend banks sermon tomorrow front and center to welcome him to our community
4663790 anyway i cant afford to go out tonight now once i write another cheque to the
4663791 hurry up get dressed and get upstairs we have a family emergency
4663792 she is out shopping or at church or something i cant recall where she said she was going i am too shaken up right now charlie has gone missing
4663793 joe is a retired rcmp officer he has expert knowledge in tracking down runaways project charlie begins now
4663794 by the looks of you it is obvious you are still hung over from your late night you shouldnt operate any vehicle in your state so i want you to start checking all the back alleys on foot theres a chance charlie may still be close by albeit slim since he has been missing for hours
4663795 its time for a little break from all this searching and maybe a bit of lunch
4663796 i already paid for it and was sitting right there
4663797 i thought you had left as you had paid your bill and disappeared
4663798 your food has been thrown in the trash already which by the smell of you and that animal seems to be where you two have just come from
4663799 i am so glad youre home safe and sound i have been so worried about you
4663800 i know i am going to have a shower right now
4663801 i was speaking to poor old charlie here we will have to give him a bath right away wont we old man
4663802 i will barbeque you up a nice t bone steak its the very least i can do for you
4663803 i was speaking to poor old charlie only the best for our charlie if youre hungry boy i think there is some leftover baloney in the fridge
4663804 i am going to have a quick shower and then go back to bed it has been a rather stressful morning
4663805 well keep your door closed im calling the boys back and we are going to be having a little celebration party and it may get a wee loud
4663806 you like alison right uncle she really is pretty and lots of fun you should ask her to go out
4663807 when she comes back in the room you listen and learn how to pick up a beautiful woman from your expert of an uncle
4663808 you must forgive me for staring at you amp being so forward but you radiate such a strong confidence and beauty that i cannot help myself it is unusual for me to come across such a breath taking woman that not only has outer beauty but inner beauty as well mikey here has just told me how much fun he has had today with you looking after him
4663809 may i thank you for taking such good care of my nephew by taking you out for dinner and drinks this evening
4663810 well arent you just the charming man i would love to go out this evening if you are as wonderful a man as your adoring nephew mikey tells me you are
4663811 like shooting fish in a barrel i still have the charm sweet
4663812 it is a treat to see such a beautiful and kind girl looking after my nephew instead of that man hating dirty old one eyed dried up lesbian that usually is over here babysitting i couldnt bear to lay eyes on that hideous monster today
4663813 that woman you just called a hideous monster is my mother
4663814 i cant believe you would speak about anyone with such disrespect let alone my mother who has a disability youre disgusting
4663815 you dont think i was serious do you haha of course i knew ms hershel was your mother i was just joking those are phrases i use all the time just to get a laugh they are meaningless monster haha
4663816 look at the cat over there in the corner sleeping what a lazy old lesbian
4663817 something wrong in your head i wouldnt spend a moment with you if you were the last man on earth
4663818 a lesbian is a female homosexual who prefers the company of other females instead of to males
4663819 but why dear why do we need another cat we already have whiskers she is a female cat and is still quite young
4663820 i dont want her to be lonely because uncle says shes a lazy old lesbian and doesnt like males
4663821 whiskers is not a lesbian and even if she was we would all still love her all the same
4663822 calling a childs pet cat a lesbian are you completely nuts what would possess you to even suggest this
4663823 if you put it that way it does sound somewhat crazy but let me assure you that those words have been taken completely out of context
4663824 well thats ok then mommy i was worried whiskers would grow up to be a man hating old lesbian like ms hershel and then look like a monster like uncle said about her today
4663825 mommy do you think alison is a lesbian she wouldnt go out with uncle even though he told her that he was joking about her mother looking like a monster
4663826 deliberately trying to make me look bad by getting dad such an overly extravagant gift i mean i dont even own a gps who does she think she is
4663827 your grand kids doug and me i truly hope you like it it is a gps a global positioning system that will give you vehicle directions and tell you the location you are at all times within north america
4663828 it is very much appreciated but i think i may be a little too old to learn this new age stuff
4663829 well of course this is the perfect gift for you simon
4663830 this will tell you how to get to a specific destination by the fastest route as well as give you directions if you are unsure of where you are driving my friend dorothy james got one last christmas and she uses it all the time
4663831 i have been driving in this damn city for over 50 years and i think i have a pretty good idea where everything is
4663832 it will optimize your trip and tell you the fastest routes to go it is also good for all over north america and not just here in the city of calgary
4663833 ive travelled all over canada and the u s without ever once needing directions
4663834 you kids must remember all the summer holidays when we drove out to the lake or down the coast and all over never once did i need a map
4663835 go straight 15 feet and turn left and proceed 3 feet to arrive at your destination of the kitchen haha sis seems to think you are getting a little old amp need directions everywhere you go
4663836 dad i bet john wayne never used a gps for his horse
4663837 so how is that gps thingy working out for you dad
4663838 finally figured it out and been driving all over town
4663839 i dont like to say this because i know how much of an effort your poor sister put into this fine gift but i must be honest it just wasnt something i could use so i put it away back in the box
4663840 i had it turned on when i was driving over to old petes place on monday the damn thing kept telling me to turn left across the busy intersection at the lights when if you go only one block further you can easily make the turn without a problem and arrive right away at his back door in the alley
4663841 ive been going over to old petes place for years and my route is the better route without a doubt
4663842 the little map was too small to see sitting on the dash and really what do i need a map for anyway i know all these roads like the back of my hand
4663843 how long have you been driving in this city fifty odd years or so id bet
4663844 the voice on the thing it was some annoying females voice can you imagine that a female giving me directions in my own city of fifty years ridiculous telling me to turn at the intersection by old petes place never heard the likes i never took directions from your mother in over fifty years and im sure not about to start taking it from some strange woman inside this gps now
4663845 this is way better than tv i couldnt have made this stuff up any better than how dad just closed off the conversation
4663846 what are you going to do with this damn thing if you put it back in the box already we may as well get rid of it i can take it if you like and are sure you are not going to use it
4663847 but you are a little too late in asking your mother told me she could really use it herself so if your sister does not mind
4663848 i would love mom to have it since i know she would get a lot of good use out of it
4663849 yes i can really use this for all my church and charity work when i am doing all the driving i may have told you that dorothy james got one last christmas and she uses it all the time
4663850 i dont know if i can honestly say that london is my favorite city
4663851 being a born and bred scot id never admit to it anyway but it is the place that i met your wonderful mother so i have very fond memories of it
4663852 im sure there will most certainly be an impact to the pubs and prostitute industry as they will experience a noticable upward swing in business once you arrive
4663853 you actually seem to be gaining weight since little emily was born
4663854 you are the only new mother that seems to put on pounds after a child is born what has it been now 6 7 weeks
4663855 this is rather odd i better push the envelope a wee bit further
4663856 i forgot to complement you on your new look that moustache you are starting to sport is really quite becoming
4663857 well old simon ill join you if you break out your good stuff and not the cheap rot gut that you offer your usual guests
4663858 boy you are still not too old for me to knock some manners into you
4663859 you will address me as either dad father sir or something equally as appropriate do you understand am i making myself clear
4663860 now come out to the garage with me and you can help me change the tire on the car before you go home
4663861 i assumed it was gone years ago as i had not seen it for so long
4663862 i figured us men would have a few drinks the women are all sad and teary eyed that you are moving overseas too emotional these women
4663863 i always told you i was saving this bottle for a special occasion if you recall well i cant think of a more special occasion then this since we may not be seeing each other for quite some time after you leave
4663864 shut up boy i have a toast to make tonight save your blubbering for the women
4663865 may the road rise up to meet you may the wind be ever at your back may the sun shine warm upon your face and the rain fall softly on your fields and until we meet again may god hold you in the hollow of his hand
4663866 just stop amp think for a minute what would jesus do
4663867 i cannot tell you what your jesus would do but i will certainly tell you what your simon will do
4663868 simon i will not tolerate such actions this gentleman for good or for bad is now a guest in our home and i will not allow you or anyone else to assault him in any way what he needs to be shown is a bit of kindness and understanding
4663869 you come along with me into the house and we will get you some nice clean clothes and something good to eat
4663870 if he tries any funny business use this on him boy
4663871 ive been looking forward to those chops all day where are they
4663872 you mean you gave that damn hobo my good pork chops
4663873 what does a guy like that need to eat my pork chops for anyway
4663874 dont fret so much simon let me make you a nice baloney sandwich
4663875 japs you cant call them that any more you know they dont like it
4663876 they just called them japs in this old movie im watching cant call them that now though not without being branded a racist or hatemonger or something equally stupid
4663877 it really is a rather outdated amp rude expression i dont think too many people even use it these days
4663878 we buy dozens of jap oranges every christmas they dont mind being called japs when we are buying their oranges or when were buying their cars for that matter
4663879 there is no reason to insult them i mean the war has actually been over for at least sixty years
4663880 old pete went into safeway last week and asked one of the clerks for some of that sweet jap sauce they use for cooking the idiotic clerk called poor pete a racist and refused to serve him and just walked away then when pete complained at customer service they actually did nothing
4663881 was pete looking for just plain old teriyaki sauce and suddenly decided to call it that sweet jap sauce to the clerk
4663882 well i cant be sure what the hell he was looking for
4663883 but this foolish clerk was apparently some kind of asian and found poor old petes remarks offensive for some reason have you ever heard anything so damn foolish in your entire life poor old pete you know him he wouldnt offend a flea
4663884 well dont say i didnt warn you boy if you still insist on calling them that just be prepared for the consequences
4663885 i mean to say that i have never used that offensive expression in my life and i can never imagine a time when i would
4663886 im originally from aberdeen in scotland and you dont see me taking offence every time someone calls me a scot or even calls me scotty for that matter its ridiculous thats what is wrong with the world these days boy everyone taking offence at the slightest slip of the tongue and then were scared to even speak for fear it offends someone bloody ridiculous in my day you called a spade a spade and that was the end of it
4663887 speaking of irony the last time someone called me a scot was some old guy a few years ago in a pub and guess what
4663888 well i think their behaviour is just terrible where are the adults in these poor young girls lives
4663889 well you know that all these girls britney paris and lindsay are huge stars and role models for every young girl in the world
4663890 they have thousands of teen and pre teen girls wanting to be just like them in every way and unfortunately it is a monkey see monkey do world for most of them
4663891 its only my personal opinion but i bet that in a few years all of these young girls will turn into booze swilling pill popping dirty crack whores where promiscuity is the norm and not the exception it is just lucky for all our sakes that there is no young girls in our family or we should all really be worried sick
4663892 what a damn foolish thing to say to a new mother
4663893 there will be no dessert for any of us now thats for sure
4663894 what the hell do you mean fired you cant fire an entire department you damn bloody limey idiot
4663895 these are just poor people who are actually down on their luck they have fallen between the cracks
4663896 tap water is so full of germs and bacteria i feel so much healthier drinking this 2 00 store bought filtered from a glacier high in alaska water
4663897 no one is that petty and ridiculous to do such a stupid thing as that
4663898 i believe every word of it since i know how trivial and juvenile you can be it certainly comes as no surprise to me whatsoever would you like me to come down to that office of yours tomorrow and vouch for you
4663899 that wont be necessary but thanks for believing in me i think
4663900 looks like all this travel didnt diminish your appetite much
4663901 the boy here is moving into old man schmidts place once they get it all fixed up for him you remember the guy dont you that old nazi
4663902 he lived there a pretty long time you know you may see his ghost goose stepping around the apartment from time to time in the dead of night
4663903 mr schmidt actually passed away in the hospital he had been there a few weeks from what i had heard but i am pretty excited about moving in since they are really going to fix up the place and everything will be brand new
4663904 certainly have been taking their sweet time in fixing up the place how long has it been now so far 3 weeks
4663905 ive only just been back in canada for the one week they are also planning on repainting the apartment too so it will probably be a little while longer
4663906 well if you dont see old man schmidts ghost one day maybe you will run in to hitlers ghost over there
4663907 if you do see hitlers ghost one night give him a message from me
4663908 can you please at least pretend to be a civilized human being once in awhile especially when you have guests over
4663909 youve gone and broken your poor mothers favourite antique ornament she is going to be furious
4663910 what i saw was you getting me out of the doghouse with your mother
4663911 last week i accidentally broke that damn ugly vase she had sitting in the kitchen and she has been angry all week with me this was her favourite ornament in the entire house and now you and your clumsy ways will make her forget all about that ugly vase i broke she is really going to hate you let me just call her in here so she can survey all your damage
4663912 that clumsy boy of yours threw the remote control at me for no apparent reason and look what he has done
4663913 i honestly think he did it on purpose if i didnt know better not an accident at all from the looks of it look at our lovely ornament destroyed i know it was your favourite and mine too
4663914 nothing to worry about son i know you are leaving in under two weeks and this is the time when family should enjoy one another and not be squabbling over something silly like broken glass dont give it another thought
4663915 it appears that you are just ringing up the charges with all the items you are breaking around this house this last couple of weeks your feeble attempts at denial amp blaming your children or the dog will no longer be tolerated you are going to start making amends for your ways beginning tonight you can take us all out to dinner at that new steak house over by the mall you know the one the brand new and very expensive steak house
4663916 thanks for the offer for dinner but i am being taken out for drinks by my staff at work
4663917 but being that i will probably be drinking quite a bit i wont be driving so perhaps dad can give me a ride to the pub on your way out to dinner
4663918 your father would love to give you a ride we can all have a nice chat on the way and your father will even give you a little money for taxi fare to get home later tonight since you wont have your car isnt that right simon
4663919 for 2006 which i was both pleased and honoured to accept on behalf of the hard working folks in my group as i was the only one there from calgary representing our division they displayed a photograph of my entire team on the overhead projector for all the others to see
4663920 i dont know who you paid off to win that award mate but there is no way in hell that you won it fairly
4663921 no group made up of a bunch of coloreds stupid women and amp canadians are going to win anything unless they bribe someone that i know to be a amp fact
4663922 whether he was drunk or not forgetting where i was i instinctively took a step forward in order to meet his challenge and was about to introduce my foot to his crazy bigoted head
4663923 are you sure you are ok with it dad its not too heavy for you is it
4663924 im in a might better shape than you are boy looks like you gained a few kilos around that gut of yours since i saw you last
4663925 well dad it really does look like you are in pretty good shape these days yourself
4663926 i have been on a strict exercise regime and in the best shape of my life look at my stomach flat as a washboard
4663927 you will find it is as tight as a drum im all muscle these days
4663928 ahh no dad i am not going to punch you
4663929 give me your best shot i wont even flinch that is guaranteed
4663930 i am exhausted from my long flight and really want to get home and see mom and just relax
4663931 we arent going anywhere until you give me your best shot as weak as that probably will be
4663932 look over there that guy is beating up some poor old man
4663933 he was on my flight and looked like he was going to steal my laptop
4663934 my boy was just being a wee over zealous is all it was ill straighten him out when we get home
4663935 you damn fool i wasnt ready youre just bloody lucky i am in good shape or the cops would have hauled you off to jail for assault
4663936 punching a man when he is not ready its disgraceful
4663937 you insisted i hit you and i didnt think you werent ready for it
4663938 you didnt think that has always been your problem you could have killed me punching me like that when i wasnt prepared that is exactly how houdini died you know
4663939 why the hell are you talking about my dentist at a time like this
4663940 hitting a poor man when hes not ready bloody disgraceful
4663941 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognised border
4663942 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4663943 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each
4663944 it is also a very stupid selection for a name
4663945 i really dont care what name you give to the kid whatever you name him i will still be calling him fitty
4663946 you really need to be more responsible especially at your age we already had two children when your father was your age it brings a person a sense of responsibility
4663947 why do i need to get married and have kids soon i will have little fitty to hang out with
4663948 he says he is going to be calling the baby fitty mom what should we do
4663949 if you have nothing to say it is best to say nothing
4663950 its a story about community and collaboration on a scale never seen before its about the cosmic compendium of knowledge wikipedia and the million channel peoples network youtube and the online metropolis myspace its about the many wresting power from the few and helping one another for nothing and how that will not only change the world but also change the way the world changes
4663951 never ever will georgia reconcile with the occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory
4663952 we support georgias sovereignty we support its independence we support its territorial integrity we support its democracy and its democratically elected government
4663953 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4663954 playing one ethnic group off against another in the caucasus has been standard russian policy ever since czarist times
4663955 overextended militarily diplomatically and economically the american policeman has been loudly lecturing the rest of the world while waving an inreasingly unimpressive baton
4663956 is there a human desire to read about inhuman self
4663957 usually differed from the experts who had not been there
4663958 you always have some foolish odd amp strange reason to hate all of our neighbours and you are the most anti social person on the block
4663959 ill go introduce myself but im telling you right off the bat that i wont like them i am not looking for any bloody new friends im far too old for that but if it will get me a moment of peace and quiet ill agree to it just to be safe though im taking the boy here with me in case i start to doze off talking to them
4663960 im sure it will be very good for you to meet some new people it will be a very nice change indeed
4663961 now go with your father and please make sure he stays out of trouble
4663962 i am so relieved to finally have some white neighbours for a change the last place we rented was like living in downtown calcutta with all the damn foreigners running around like rats and their stench was dreadful
4663963 i just saw a bunch of negroes in that blue house down the street on the corner thats always trouble in my experience probably just waiting for nightfall before the break ins begin
4663964 well it aint going to happen to me amp donna ill be puttin on the best damn deadbolts money can buy on all them doors amp getting a good security system those damn people can look elsewheres if they want to rip off someone theyll learn let em go after their own kind we need a good neighbourhood watch or something around here to discourage them people
4663965 you certainly should talk with my wife about all these matters
4663966 why the hell did you let him get away with those statements for or didnt you hear them
4663967 im not deaf yet boy i heard every ignorant amp asinine words that those two spoke quite clearly
4663968 you see boy there are many ways to skin a cat and i need to make sure your old mother learns a lesson here today as well
4663969 she is continually demanding that i be nice and meet new people even when i know there is no need to she forced me to go out and meet these bigoted new neighbours against my better judgement so she probably wouldnt believe me if i told her what they said figure i was making it all up just to avoid talking to them
4663970 no she needs to hear all this first hand and perhaps she will stop forcing me to meet every damn new neighbour that happens to move in around here
4663971 ive been married to your mother for 52 years i think i know her pretty well by now
4663972 the point of the matter is she will be taught a valuable lesson and my life will be much more peaceful as a result
4663973 by my estimations your mother should be back in here in about ten minutes in a sour mood but definitely much the wiser
4663974 i have never met such horrible racist people in all my born days you wouldnt believe what they just said about poor old mary and joe barnes it was just shocking filthy small minded racists is all they are and i certainly told them just as much i am surprised you didnt notice it
4663975 but you know my hearing is not as good as it once was so i really miss a lot of what people are saying i better wear that hearing aid a bit more often i was actually just telling the boy that earlier today believe it or not
4663976 you are very fortunate indeed if you missed what these terrible bigots were saying today let us have nothing more to do with them ever again
4663977 strutting around the store in his fancy blue smock with that pen and clipboard who the hell does he think he is anyway
4663978 i think he believes he is the manager since that is exactly what the tag on his vest says he is just giving direction to a staff member what is wrong with that
4663979 he will see what is wrong with that soon enough
4663980 perhaps you can at least help carry all these parcels to the car for me i am sure you can get even with your little childhood enemy later
4663981 maybe i can convince john to loan me his taser and i can shoot that goof crenshaw in the middle of the store
4663982 him shaking and wheezing in the middle of the lingerie aisle rolling around on the floor that would be priceless
4663983 isnt john your cop friend who is up for a promotion
4663984 do you honestly believe he is going to lend you his taser gun to further some petty feud and get both of you arrested and him undoubtedly fired
4663985 maybe i should just wreck his car in the parking lot with my aluminium bat
4663986 wouldnt that be great to see the expression on his rodent like face when he came out to the car after his shift to see it in a twisted pile of rubble
4663987 well it is easy to shoot down all my ideas but i havent heard you come up with even one suggestion yet
4663988 thats because youre obviously insane and have way too much time on your hands
4663989 but if i must indulge your madness how about this one you could get him fired by making up lies and start a letter writing amp comment card campaign sending complaints and accusations about him to his regional managers
4663990 thats not exactly what i was looking for since revenge usually doesnt involve a letter writing campaign and then waiting patiently 6 8 weeks for some kind of result which may or may not occur but thank you for your input
4663991 theres nothing like eavesdropping to show you that the world outside your head is different from the world inside your head
4663992 i was hoping for at least six inches this weekend but i think at best it was only four i was just so disappointed
4663993 well how do you think me and sara felt we got nothing absolutely nothing this weekend and we have both been waiting so long
4663994 i will not tolerate this kind of talk in my department or for that matter in this building it is extremely inappropriate in the workplace as well as very disrespectful to others if it were all males talking about this raunchy topic each of you would no doubt be up in the human resources office complaining about the degrading sexual overtones going on well let me tell you there will be no double standards here
4663995 i am especially appalled and disappointed with you being involved in this kind of talk i mean a woman of your er maturity should certainly be above all this
4663996 the girls were talking about their weekend ski trips what you heard them referring to was the amount of snowfall they all received they each went to three different hills in the rockies and were just talking about it now thats what you heard
4663997 the simple fact of the matter is you just cant keep a secret never could youll just have to wait till christmas and see the evidence being that you just told me what you had purchased for mom and dad and i didnt even ask you
4663998 in fact i heard dad mentioning the ballet just the other day in passing
4663999 no one in their right mind would pay good money to watch those wet nappy wearing nancy boys twirling around
4664000 its okay uncle i dont think having a new brother or sister is a big deal at all i would rather hear more about this big tv it looks so cool
4664001 the bloody coupons i got from that canadian tire store is whats the matter just look at them
4664002 they cheated you i bet should have given you twice as many coupons right
4664003 you think for one minute if they tried to cheat me i would let them get away with it for someone with a university education you are quite the daftie look at the picture on it theyre using a picture of a scotsman on their coupons
4664004 this picture on the coupon is just their fictional mascot for the store named sandy mctire
4664005 this is nothing more than racist propaganda that is depicting all us scottish people as chiselers and penny pinchers an outdated old stereotype which needs to be stopped let me tell you
4664006 this is harmless just a silly old mascot that i think they have been using on their coupons for the past fifty years or so
4664007 well it is the first time ive ever seen it
4664008 and i dont like it your mother use to do all the shopping around here before i retired and i never had time to go wandering around stores doing shopping like a man of leisure i was at work earning money to keep you lot in food and clothing
4664009 i really dont think they are out to intentionally insult anyone thats just crazy they would lose business
4664010 being born in aberdeen i think i can speak on behalf of every scotsman here in canada and say that this is an offensive depiction of all of us and we are not going to take it
4664011 just a couple of weeks ago you told me the japanese were way too unreasonable and that the problem with the world was everyone was far too sensitive with these kind of comments
4664012 its one thing to make a passing comment to someone that is harmless however it is an entirely different matter when you center a national advertising campaign around outdated and ridiculous stereotypes about people and then proceed to take it a step further by printing coupons to distribute why its scandalous now enough chitchat boy youre going to help me to type a complaint letter to these people
4664013 correct any of my grammar with no spelling mistakes i dont use that damn spell checker thingy much anyways doesnt ever seem to work for me
4664014 you should be thanking me for taking the time to write a letter remember even though you were born here in canada you are still half scottish
4664015 well right now dad i really think i would be more thankful if i were half drunk
4664016 win them over to your point of view with your quick wit and charm
4664017 im the one dictating this you just type what i tell you to and save your silly wisecracks for someone else
4664018 now they can put their racist propaganda where the sun dont shine this will put them on notice
4664019 simon here is the latest flyer from canadian tire they have that big stainless steel gas barbeque you have wanted for ages now on sale at 30 off that discount along with all the coupons we have saved up will make it a very good deal if you still want it
4664020 my my this is a good deal a very good deal indeed
4664021 well no need to throw out the baby with the bath water a deal is a deal
4664022 let this be a good life lesson for you boy
4664023 never write a letter or speak out of turn when you are angry calmer heads will always prevail
4664024 basrawis realised what a nightmare literally that was theyre not going to put themselves back through that period of violent extremism
4664025 they have got better things to do now with their lives and i do not see basra coming back under militia control those days are passed
4664026 we will continue to reduce the number of british troops in iraq
4664027 of course future decisions will be based as i have always said on the advice of our military commanders on the ground
4664028 but just as last year we moved from combat to overwatch we would expect a further fundamental change of mission in the first months of 2009
4664029 malisa the last eight and a half months have been amazing pause at some point in there i realized that not only do i like you i love you
4664030 and id like to spend the rest of my life with you
4664031 what we dont want is we dont want our fire fighters making that choice training or fuel we dont want to see them out fundraising again just to put fuel in their vehicles

4664066 he was just a part of it and we were part of it whether he wins eight medals or not it wasnt going to be our responsibility
4664067 after what happened its unlikely ossetians and abkhazians will ever be able to live together with georgia in one state
4664068 russian forces need to leave georgia at once this is no longer 1968
4664069 there was no way i could stand in the sun any longer
4664070 we were led to believe that together with the u s we could stand up to the russians it turned out to be an illusion
4664071 we are calling on the west to stop this russian aggression
4664072 dont let them attack tbilisi remember what the russians did to the chechens we deserve peace
4664073 we told the world this is about starting an invasion
4664074 the entire responsibility for the conflict for cruel actions committed lies on the shoulders of the georgian leadership
4664075 russia will respect any decision on future status of south ossetia and abkhazia that reflects the breakaway republics wishes
4664076 while it is early days to say what the security situation is going to look like in georgia longer term the events of the past few days deal a blow to the u s s plans to support existing and new oil and gas routes that bypass russia
4664077 what happened in georgia has come on the back of other events in russia that have increased market concerns

4664082 only then after the reorganization was complete and the states capacity to protect the national interests in this strategic sector was reaffirmed would western firms be invited to participate in the russian market
4664083 russia knows they are providing huge amounts to natural gas to europe that they have a stranglehold on europe
4664084 there is no question in my mind that russia is going to play its energy card as much as it can
4664085 there are certainly very strong parallels between the development of russias domestic policy and its projection of influence over the other former soviet countries
4664086 russia has always felt it would like to exert a high degree of control over the development of the oil and gas industries of both central asia and the caucasus as well as its own
4664087 russias energy objective is to monopolize all caspian energy flows to europe so that it can then blackmail europe and force political changes to european policy
4664088 what is really at stake is the unrestricted access of caspian oil to world markets
4664089 if as a byproduct of the conflict in georgia people become more wary in the future of expanding the capacity of the export corridor through georgia then there will be no tears shed in moscow

4664136 whereas the highly centralized system of government has brought about a spotty development of the nation where preferential treatment has been given to localities whose officials are friendly with or have easy access to an incumbent administration

4664148 there has been an effort to keep all the social problems in one neighbourhood and i do not think that serves the people who have those problems very well
4664149 we find that when they can move outside the downtown eastside a lot of problems go away

4664151 before anyone could be harmed a solution even short term needed to be found
4664152 it was a public relations disaster to have 40 people in tents just a couple of blocks from gm place where olympics events will be happening
4664153 no one is being pushed out of any area because of the olympics
4664154 certainly you cannot handle all their addiction and mental health issues in the downtown eastside some people would do better if they were given opportunities we are not going to take them and force them to go anywhere but certainly the options have to be there for them
4664155 were certainly open to helping anyone who wants to do that

4664168 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4664169 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent

4664288 i immediately felt comfortable with my car and i was able to push hard from the outset by choosing the soft compound pirelli tyre i knew i would have to adapt my driving style and be on my guard all the time especially where there were changes in the amount of grip available it also gave my confidence a big boost though and i made the most of that to pull out an early gap on dry asphalt its not easy to build up big leads so i was naturally pleased to see that we were 15 3 seconds clear at the end of the first loop
4664289 japanese and mongolian scientists have recovered the complete skeleton of a 70 million year old young
4664290 it is a great help that we can warn a driver if the tyre pressure is falling during a race the new version runs at an even higher sample rate than before
4664291 mosport is a fantastic circuit of the old calibre which is steeped in history and happens to be one of my favourite circuits all the corners are very fast the track is very challenging for a driver the audi r10 tdi is very good at mosport even though you feel the high weight in the fast corners
4664292 detroit has an excellent layout and would be a fantastic race track if the tarmac asphalt was a little better there are not only the typical street circuit 90 degree corners but also interesting varied sections where one curve follows another and where the line must be perfect
4664293 many of americas top ranked capacity eaters made the pilgrimage to clearfield pa falling woefully short of completing the big burger in the three hour time limit on january 12th 2005 a day that will go down in competitive eating history a 19 year old 115 lb college freshman named kate stelnick walks in and completes the burger in 2 hours and 54 minutes
4664294 if you dont finish your vegetables were going to make you dennys beer barrelled belly bruiser by yourself and if you dont finish it all they use you to make the next burger
4664295 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
4664296 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
4664297 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
4664298 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
4664299 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
4664300 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy
4664301 this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy a new era of technical politics has begun
4664302 new book out and making the move to open access
4664303 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
4664304 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
4664305 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future
4664306 they are characteristics of the spirit mood language and process of science they are operative wherever evidence of social change can be found
4664307 a new kind of person one who is an actively inquiring flexible creative innovative tolerant liberal personality who can face uncertainty and ambiguity without disorientation who can formulate viable new meanings to meet changes in the environment which threaten individual and mutual survival
4664308 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
4664309 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
4664310 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
4664311 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
4664312 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
4664313 it was a shit of a run race for him today it really put him in a pressure spot but luckily he was able to overcome it
4664314 he went from being in a beautiful spot half way through the race to being in a very awkward one on the way the race picked up and he couldnt go forward with the pace
4664315 and all of a sudden hes back and hes had to chase hard before the turn but hes good enough to keep going and get up
4664316 it was just one of those runs that was a bit awkward
4664317 hed pulled up really well from the other day and i thought running today wouldnt hurt him
4664318 i was very soft on him during the week because of the back up so he should improve even further
4664319 if i didnt run today it would have been four weeks and that would have been a bit too much for him
4664320 the idea with with him is in weaker company while i havent got him really fit when i say fit i mean race hard fit if i can bump his ratings up and then give him an ease up and come into the spring
4664321 hopefully then with his rating going up i can get into the better races
4664322 im not sure yet as to a major spring goal im just hoping he keeps stepping up and he vindicates the faith ive got in him as a stayer
4664323 hes never really had a good crack in his life in his first preparation he cracked his pelvis after a few runs
4664324 he was out for a long time and came back and had a good preparation and beat master oreilly
4664325 when he came back last preparation it was just a total bloody disaster for him
4664326 so hes never had a real fair dinkum go so this one looks like it will be it as long as he stays upright
4664327 for years the cartoons of s harris have added humor to innumerable magazines books newsletters ads and web sites
4664328 stevesie news is based on a new form of artificial
4664329 we had been talking about getting married since we got together
4664330 ever since i met him i felt like were a strong unit that would be a great foundation for a family
4664331 were very settled in and cozy were like hobbits in our little place
4664332 han r v ldigt k nslig ven n r man spelar singel mot honom
4664333 we didnt intend to live together but when bruce had a minor stroke in 2007 i told him he was coming home with me and hes been there ever since
4664334 in january he had surgery and i suddenly realized that legally i couldnt get in to see him in the hospital because im not his wife
4664335 i realized how much i love this man so we thought we might as well do the honorable thing
4664336 couples may also struggle with my money your money our money there are the adult children and whether or not they support their parent remarrying
4664337 and theres the lifestyle issue of compromising and living in someone elses space or with someone elses routine when they have been on their own
4664338 their values tend to come from the fifties when couples dated and then married even though many have adult children who lived with their partners some still struggle with the issue for themselves
4664339 so he said just in case we ever go there wed better get married
4664340 i spent 48 years with my first wife who had certain likes and dislikes now i have a wife who is the complete opposite and it worked out when youre older and set in your ways you have to expect adjustments
4664341 the older we get the deeper our habits so we have to make an adjustment if all goes well and youre an unofficial couple its a personal question if both would feel like coming out to society with a social ritual of marriage
4664342 the symbolism has a different meaning for the older generation it can make them feel like theyre at the beginning of a new life marriage is a renewing experience
4664343 we need each other and meet each others needs i didnt need to be married for that to be true yet once we took our vows i felt we had more of a commitment than when we were significant others and now that we both have health issues its comforting to know well be there for each other
4664344 for one thing were not as inexperienced and perhaps a bit less in the clouds about marriage we no longer have a sense of life going on forever we become aware of the importance of companionship in later years our whole lives are no longer ahead of us so relationship decisions take on greater import hopefully weve come to realize that a partners interpersonal traits are more important than surface qualities
4664345 they should allow chaplains perhaps one from each country to be in the village this is important because for many of us athletics is not only physical and mental but spiritual
4664346 make every effort to live in peace with all men and to be holy i
4664347 were bombarded with images every day of what we should want to look like and it sets an unrealistic expectation
4664348 you cant think your way through this let go listen to my voice let it guide you
4664349 i think it was her fathers birthday that night when we were on that balcony and she was just sitting there talking about her dad
4664350 so what was my job not to say a lot but to listen to her talk about her dad
4664351 here are a sister and a brother in the olympic village greatest athletes in the world but theyre missing their dad
4664352 didnt do well did bad i did terrible it was devastating
4664353 and before it was over his head was on my shoulder he was crying but he had put his shades on although i knew his pain knew his burden knew his failure he still didnt want me to see him cry
4664354 ive never been in a place where they were so celebrated but under so much pressure
4664355 you were not just representing your school your family or your town you were on a worldwide stage and if they didnt have it together mentally physically and spiritually it would be very tough for them to make it
4664356 believe it or not some of them thats where they got close to god because they realized that this was a dream come true and they could not make it on their own
4664357 it came through a lot of prayer a lot of hard work a lot of times when they could have been injured and they were not and someone else was
4664358 so far john mccain and barack obama have both maintained a cordial but removed relationship with the family but neither man has shown any interest in rocking the familys boat
4664359 i knew the footprints thing was cgi but the swap of the little girls is beyond the pale years from now one girl has a video record of the event the other has the memory of not being cute enough
4664360 i remember when i first got the script where joans roommate came to the office and shes just been fired
4664361 and i remember going wait a minute i dont know how to play this scene joan is being really nice
4664362 i dont think a woman at that time would be office manager and running the whole place if she wasnt driven
4664363 and joan could go out and find a husband quite easily shes an attractive smart successful woman but shes not pursuing that shes doing things that are safe to a certain degree because she cant marry a man whos already married
4664364 as she talked about it you could tell that the memories were coming up in her and that her body was tensing up
4664365 you could tell that watching the show for her was certainly bringing up a lot
4664366 its the initial reading that really takes you by surprise then you just settle in and play the part
4664367 i have women coming up to me and saying i love your character
4664368 thats another side of her and i respect that in joan she says and does things that i would never allow myself to do sometimes i think theyre nuts and sometimes i admire the actions she takes
4664369 she was playing she knew what they were doing on the other side of that mirror
4664370 she was taking the control back instead of being the victim she wasnt being trampy she was being confident and sexual that was one of my favorite scenes it was one of the best revealing moments for joan and i also just love the dynamic of men and women on either side of that glass i think it sums up a lot about mad men in particular what goes on in the office
4664371 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4664372 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4664373 i think the russian behavior over the last several days is generally concerning not only to the united states but to all of our european allies
4664374 not currently here at the mortuary we have to wait for a funeral and then the church basement ladies bring in tater tot hot dish and jell o mold
4664375 the city pulled its voting machines from here because the building gets too hot yet now theyll put people in there who use those machines to vote
4664376 there are no toilets there theres no water no fire suppression the city should be ashamed it needs to stop criminalizing protests
4664377 the leadership of the u s which gives orders to georgian authorities is to blame for the caucasus burning
4664378 the president of the u s the imperialist george bush i am absolutely certain was the one who gave the order to georgian forces to burn towns and villages and to kill innocent people
4664379 i do not have any trust in this legal farce
4664380 i think he thinks this circus has gone on long enough
4664381 at the same time you are my enemy we really dont accept this kind of logic
4664382 spray and pray charge everybody lets go speed speed speed
4664383 after all the effort that we put in to get somebody a fair trial and then to say no matter what we did it didnt matter i dont see that as a positive step
4664384 a s recently as last week i think it was the senator made a comment in south dakota regarding his wife entering some buffalo chips contest which is this topless deal and if she were to enter she would probably win it and thats not not n o t not the type of expression that a presidential candidate or anyone for that matter who is a follower of the christian faith ought to make
4664385 i dont know if that is a perfect case in point but it surely does help to juxtapose the dna of senator obama if you would versus the dna of senator mccain
4664386 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have cfr crash equipment standing by in st louis
4664387 we have senator obama on board the aircraft and his campaign
4664388 taught me values i still carry with me he has just always been an incredible person
4664389 ive never seen anything improper at all never heard anyone else even suggest there was a problem whatsoever
4664390 youve never at least in the evidence i have in front of me acted out
4664391 nobody was ever in jeopardy of me losing control and doing anything to them because those kids were like my sons and daughters
4664392 some people will think i got that job to have a pool of kids that was never ever my intent
4664393 all i can say is admiral farragut academy is a very tight knit community
4664394 we are a family and we were very saddened by the news of someone that was a member of our family its certainly difficult to process
4664395 it really is an extraordinary case in that he was there 14 years and there is no evidence of any contact
4664396 there was never any overtures toward a kid thats remarkable
4664397 hes very remorseful and his depression for example is part of that
4664398 im so happy that im not going through that computer any more that is over i self destructed myself
4664399 was my life i still miss it so much i know i cant go back
4664400 era a prova da minha vida o melhor momento que eu passo na minha vida foi sensacional acho que se tivesse que voltar no tempo e mudar alguma coisa n o mudaria nada para chegar aqui
4664401 muito bom n o tem sensa o melhor do que ver o n mero 1 na frente do seu nome agora sou um campe o ol mpico era um sonho meu de crian a nunca imaginei que chegaria onde estou hoje
4664402 o in cio do que parece ser uma grande escalada de atos violentos que j anunciaram alguns dirigentes c vicos
4664403 a cessa o dos atropelos ao povo de santa cruz
4664404 respeitamos a demanda regional de autonomia mas n o acreditamos que a t tulo de autonomia se possam justificar atitudes de viol ncia como as que hoje aconteceram contra a pol cia e da saud vel conviv ncia entre os bolivianos
4664405 em vez de velar pela seguran a cidad aumentaram os n veis de viol ncia
4664406 qualquer tentativa de agredir ou substituir esta institui o est destinada ao fracasso
4664407 v rios parlamentares da oposi o que estavam usando a viol ncia e agredindo
4664408 acreditamos que este o momento no qual nacionais e departamentais devemos falar com maturidade j que o pa s n o quer conflitos enfrentamentos nem viol ncia
4664409 as agress es levadas a cabo hoje por instru es do ministro rada
4664410 n s nos reunimo com a pol cia perante seu oferecimento de entregar essa institui o e subordin la a minha autoridade como comandante geral do departamento como estabelecido pela constitui o pol tica do estado
4664411 vou voltar a estudar sen o meu pai vai me dar porrada
4664412 when i was at the wharton school of business id watch him every night
4664413 i will admit it was quite bizarre to direct my wife in how to make love
4664414 i hadnt realized how much my chemistry with him since titanic would still stick
4664415 its great to discover we can just slip right into it like muscle memory
4664416 when she heard i had this audition she told me you know what
4664417 im kind of used to it because every film ive done before im always making love to a beautiful woman or running around naked
4664418 a romano lo denunci por estafas contra el pami en el a o 2004

4664420 era proveedora del hospital franc s entre el 2003 y el 2007 y le vendi 6 millones de pesos en medicamentos
4664421 look all relationships end you either split up or one of you dies so why not enjoy it
4664422 well why do i have to have such a complicated life
4664423 its because you send out complicated vibrations simplify your vibrations and your life will simplify itself you know what your problem is you always want guarentees
4664424 no no they dont and the result is you let the first guy you showed interest to in ages leave without knowing if your going to see him again wouldnt the chance of being let down be better than the guarentee of not knowing
4664425 lots of hetrosexual couples stay together for the wrong reasons children mortgages
4664426 david and pat came by here last night and they said it makes me look 10 years younger
4664427 did you do that because i told you to be careful on those stairs

4664430 why do you waste your money on that silly lottery
4664431 because i think i would enjoy getting a check for a couple hundred million dollars
4664432 a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
4664433 a penguin in your hand is worth two penguins in the bush
4664434 a bird in your hand is worth one bird in the bush
4664435 one bird in your hand is worth two bushes in the white house
4664436 i had no idea it was so difficult for multiracials
4664437 i think most people in the united states assume that individuals are in one and one only racial group
4664438 its the younger generation that is becoming more aware that these lines dont make sense
4664439 i dont think this is something he can simply say through words if he says im biracial or im half white
4664440 i think what he will do is tell his story again at the convention in a way that says this is not a story about race this is a story about america
4664441 the visibility of barack obama may lead more people to identify with multiple races
4664442 towards an irreversible path of economic decline and moral decadence
4664443 we have tried people power twice in both cases it fell short maybe its time to try prayer power
4664444 this is as real as youre standing right where you are sir
4664445 when you punch in bigfoot on the internet the first name that comes up is tom biscardi
4664446 canadas housing market is running into some seriously foul weather amid the weakest affordability in nearly two decades
4664447 while we still doubt that canada will stage an instant replay of the trauma in u s markets even a mild version would be bad news
4664448 we find that house prices play an important role in household spending decisions for several countries
4664449 the link is stronger in countries like australia canada the united states and the united kingdom
4664450 the apparent overvaluation of house prices in several advanced countries is an ongoing concern since a significant downturn in prices would have adverse effects for consumer spending and the aggregate economy
4664451 as it indicates that the extent of the cooling in the canadian housing market may have accelerated in july
4664452 however since the declines were mostly in the western cities where prices were not too long ago appreciating at a double digit pace we remain confident that the extent of the slowdown nationally will remain measured
4664453 fundamentals remain different than those in the real estate market in the united states
4664454 activity has posted a small gain in every month since then but sales remain below where they stood at the end of 2007 which was a record year
4664455 a lot of patients wont go out because they are embarrassed by those movements
4664456 suppressing those movements means a lot to people with huntingtons disease
4664457 for the first time there is a treatment that can help patients with this disease gain some quality of life
4664458 no se trata solo de padecer una injusticia sino conocer de otras y sentirlas como si fueran propias
4664459 its not the camera that takes the photo its the photographer
4664460 ive been able to come back into my daughters life and that was an adjustment anyway because im an alcoholic and its the first time weve really been able to share i dont stay here anymore
4664461 every now and then ill stay if we have something early in the morning we have to do
4664462 the agreement says that on oct 1 well probably get another overnight and that will stay in place until the end of the year or the end of the conservatorship i do understand that my baby made this monster but when she was down people took advantage
4664463 its not the camera that takes the photo its the photographer
4664464 arturo xxx a sus rdenes real fuerzaebria cuarto botell n de infanter a
4664465 its probably the hardest race of the championships to be honest the first race of the games
4664466 to come away with that sort of time and feeling like i did during it im pretty happy
4664467 its very surprising to go from riding four 16s at the worlds to whatever he rode here
4664468 it just felt like another ride for me it didnt feel fast didnt feel slow it was quite weird to be honest
4664469 i kept well away from the atmosphere when i first arrived here i had a bit of a look around but i warmed up downstairs well away from the hype
4664470 wed seen the earlier times they werent overly quick so i knew what i had to do
4664471 its really a waste of time riding a 4 15 if you can qualify in second place with a 4 18 today is basically where it counts
4664472 to come in from worlds ranked seventh and to make fourth fastest time is a great confidence booster it was by no means perfect though ive got more in the tank
4664473 a medals never out of the question if we all step up who knows what could happen but were just all happy that we made the final and well take it from there
4664474 everybody stepped up and showed a lot of guts and we couldnt have wished for anything more out of the heat swim
4664475 for sure the teams going to have no problem coping with that
4664476 its an honour to swim in a team with these guys theyre great guys and when it counts everybody mans up
4664477 its an amazing feeling seeing corney touch third and gibbo dive in the water we were all going crazy cheering him on
4664478 you dont have any energy but something like that brings out the best in you
4664479 sam tries to focus on lindsay but its never enough
4664480 lindsay has to be the center of attention or shell flirt with other guys to make sam jealous
4664481 shell be with the next guy who catches her eye she cant help it
4664482 i will come into him and dine with him and he with me
4664483 assuredly i say to you i do not know you
4664484 its just lamentable thats all i be able to utter through it
4664485 he was very affected in the london pray to dispose it
4664486 caran se tu quer escuta isso de mim ta bom vc venceu descisto
4664487 are manipulating the weather so far weve beat the rain record all the way back to 1879 and of course theyre screwing it up
4664488 they jump on me and say they miss me and they was happy to see me
4664489 i like to settle down im kind of a family guy
4664490 either you can do it or you cant surely it doesnt take two to five years to get this resolved
4664491 people say we were coming and steal their jobs people say we were coming and do crimes i say most of the people they just come to work a lot of people like to stay
4664492 the obsession with northern ireland and particularly policing on the east coast of america was something we identified very quickly as needing to be dealt with
4664493 the work we did in the states for the past six years has been unravelling 35 years of a very one dimensional interpretation of policing the republican agenda and turning that into an accurate description of what policing actually was
4664494 its not the content of the conversation thats important but that the conversation takes place
4664495 there will come a point when speaking to the unspeakable will happen and the role of the police is to create the conditions where people realise this terrorism aint going to work
4664496 an awful lot of people who are so called al qaeda are actually radicalised young disenfranchised british
4664497 the more you can get into those communities and build confidence in them the more chances you have of making them see the crazy way theyre going
4664498 you worry about them you know its thrilling to say the least im amazed at how calm she is
4664499 we were about 12 and she was 6 and she passed us all the time
4664500 she dissed him right back its neat to see shes an equal
4664501 in a way this was a practice run coming in fourth at the olympics is absolutely incredible
4664502 i couldnt be more proud of her i think its a really kind of an incredible emotional experience for her you want to do well for your country its so much about the medals at this point im absolutely incredibly proud of her overall the entire olympic team is just so awesome
4664503 nothing too crazy oh yes ive been there with her
4664504 but i cant tell you how awesomely cool it is to be here
4664505 you always heard about the little girl who swam really fast
4664506 just to watch the look on her face she just looks so happy its a dream come true
4664507 sure it is about sport but we will also take the chance to showcase the creative capital that london is
4664508 we can bring a massive level of creativity and britishness in the very best sense of the word and fun lets have a bit of fun with this
4664509 there are lots of things i think we can do which are quite instinctive to us anyway what does the world know about us were actually quite good at partying lets turn it into a giant party
4664510 the very best around at arranging pop concerts and directing
4664511 they looked at that and thought thats really good but we can do something as good set in a different context
4664512 they were more pumped up because it was so good i think they were quite excited by the challenge
4664513 this is amazing its fantastic its clearly been choreographed to within an inch of its life
4664514 but my judgment is youll not see another games like this again
4664515 you cant build the velodrome there its where my allotment is
4664516 it wont continue to go in this direction it wont at london and it wont at chicago or wherever is next
4664517 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4664518 a lot of the opinion flood persists in ignoring completely the local and regional factors in favour of an instant resort to high geopolitics
4664519 as if south ossetia and abkhazia which lie at the heart of what has happened do not in themselves even exist
4664520 but i am surprised by this i did not think the numbers would go down as significantly
4664521 but all you have to do is walk around the neighborhoods around here and see all the boarded up houses and given the tough economy my principals have told me many families are moving away to the south or the west or where they have relatives
4664522 i see two or three foreclosed homes on every street
4664523 many of these families drive without licenses and when the state police started stopping people earlier this year and bringing them to court people got scared also the economic situation in the state is grave the cost of food and gasoline and everything is going up many of these people earn just 6 an hour so all of this has created a situation where they cannot maintain their lives here
4664524 i dont think the executive order was signed in order to force people to leave the state although that could very well be a consequence of it
4664525 if so i say thats great congratulations to the governor because we are gaining something here in rhode island if its forcing some people to leave
4664526 likes watching funny as hell tv shows check is willing to play the most nerdy of nerdy games with me check

4664531 yes this is nice i am not contained within a little box on the road with other boxes i am out in nature i am a part of it
4664532 growing marijuana in homes continues to be a community safety problem
4664533 well ive made thirty bucks now i will go read a book
4664534 i thought i could win the pace was quick and it was starting to get hot and i made a major mistake i started thinking about tuesday and i let that become a reason that its ok not to gut it out
4664535 it was a big mistake and ill be thinking about it for a long time
4664536 there was a point in the middle of the race where i thought this could go really well or really bad
4664537 i guess if a really bad day is 10th thats fine but i dont race to be 10th in the olympics
4664538 i have so much stuff left right now which is the worst feeling because im not laying on the track regret is the worst feeling im not saying i would have done any better but i definitely did not risk it and that was my only goal for the race was to risk it
4664539 i feel like i let a lot of people down
4664540 my son was perfectly healthy when he went in there
4664541 there is not a day that goes by that this doesnt disturb me just because you are incarcerated doesnt mean you dont deserve medical care
4664542 we are always exploring ways to enhance our operation which includes keeping our employees and inmates safe
4664543 despite our best efforts some inmates are successful in committing suicide in our facility
4664544 we have supporters from all walks of life from people who live in indiana all the way to the west coast and the east coast
4664545 they show their support in a lot of different ways
4664546 obviously more of this water will be traversable in more parts of the year so we want to find it before hollywood
4664547 its very exciting its like an indiana jones adventure its searching for a lost under water tomb
4664548 our objective is to find and protect the wreck because they are in danger of being found by people who dont have the know how and the same intention and preoccupation that we have
4664549 for the first time in over 160 years i feel that the witnesses of the franklin tragedy events have a chance to really contribute to an important search party
4664550 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4664551 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4664552 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4664553 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect
4664554 our goal in south asia is to seek a peaceful stable and prosperous neighbourhood
4664555 we wish all our neighbours well we welcome the strengthening of democratic forces in our neighbourhood especially in bhutan nepal and pakistan
4664556 and to bring a lasting and honourable peace in our region
4664557 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take the terrorists and those who support them are enemies of the people of india and pakistan of friendship between the two countries and of peace in the region and the world we must defeat them
4664558 whatever resources are required will be provided whatever manpower is required will be provided we are firm in our resolve to meet the challenge of terrorism
4664559 the challenge of communalism of extremism and of terrorism cannot be won by a nation divided
4664560 in this hour of crisis divisive politics will lead us nowhere i appeal to all political parties to keep the long term interests of jammu and kashmir in view and come together to find a permanent solution to the problems of the state
4664561 reports from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and air force reserve hurricane hunter aircraft indicate that the low pressure area over the mona passage became a tropical storm as it moved into the eastern dominican republic
4664562 the center of fay will cross hispaniola tonight and saturday and pass near or over eastern cuba saturday night and sunday
4664563 what worries me is that mccains eagerness for more conflict in the world pushing russia and china into a corner is not in the best interests of the united states it may be moral it may be exciting it may provide the great national purpose mccain thinks we all need to feel but it ignores the hard trade offs involved and perpetuates the whole with us or against us bluster of the last eight years we need more of that more enemies less diplomacy more conflict count me out
4664564 so placing the position on gay rights on a higher level than abortion rights can only be explained by bigotry it seems to me or in mccains case a perceived need to cater to bigotry
4664565 two isaf service members died as a result of wounds suffered during an ied strike and small arms fire attack on their patrol in eastern afghanistan today
4664566 today is a day of pride and it will be written with golden letters in the history of the nation
4664567 under the leadership of prachanda the main agenda of the new administration would be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation and for which we will publish a common minimum program very soon
4664568 we look forward to working with the new government of the federal democratic republic of nepal and building on the historic ties between our peoples
4664569 the election of pushpa kamal dahal as the prime minister ends a period of uncertainty and paves the way for government formation
4664570 while im in here i should really take care of x too
4664571 we didnt intend to live together but when bruce had a minor stroke in 2007 i told him he was coming home with me and hes been there ever since
4664572 in january he had surgery and i suddenly realized that legally i couldnt get in to see him in the hospital because im not his wife
4664573 i realized how much i love this man so we thought we might as well do the honorable thing
4664574 couples may also struggle with my money your money our money there are the adult children and whether or not they support their parent remarrying
4664575 and theres the lifestyle issue of compromising and living in someone elses space or with someone elses routine when they have been on their own
4664576 their values tend to come from the fifties when couples dated and then married even though many have adult children who lived with their partners some still struggle with the issue for themselves
4664577 so he said just in case we ever go there wed better get married
4664578 i spent 48 years with my first wife who had certain likes and dislikes now i have a wife who is the complete opposite and it worked out when youre older and set in your ways you have to expect adjustments
4664579 the older we get the deeper our habits so we have to make an adjustment if all goes well and youre an unofficial couple its a personal question if both would feel like coming out to society with a social ritual of marriage
4664580 the symbolism has a different meaning for the older generation it can make them feel like theyre at the beginning of a new life marriage is a renewing experience
4664581 we need each other and meet each others needs i didnt need to be married for that to be true yet once we took our vows i felt we had more of a commitment than when we were significant others and now that we both have health issues its comforting to know well be there for each other
4664582 for one thing were not as inexperienced and perhaps a bit less in the clouds about marriage we no longer have a sense of life going on forever we become aware of the importance of companionship in later years our whole lives are no longer ahead of us so relationship decisions take on greater import hopefully weve come to realize that a partners interpersonal traits are more important than surface qualities

4664588 that equals out to about a medal and a half for each hour he spent in combat there were infantry guys grunts on the ground who had more than 7 000 hours in combat and i can tell you that there were times and situations where im sure a prison cell would have looked pretty good to them by comparison the question really is how many guys got that number of medals for not being shot down

4664647 when the partisans of russia speak of the disinterestedness with which she withdrew her protecting troops from constantinople and from hungary let us here also mark the ominous exactness of the parallel between her and rome while the ancient world yet contained a number of independent states which might have made a formidable league against rome if she had alarmed them by openly avowing her ambitious schemes romes favourite policy was seeming disinterestedness and moderation after her first war against philip after that against antiochus and many others victorious rome promptly withdrew her troops from the territories which they occupied she affected to employ her arms only for the good of others but when the favourable moment came she always found a pretext for marching her legions back into each coveted district and making it a roman province fear not moderation is the only effective check on the ambition of such powers as ancient rome and modern russia the amount of that fear depends on the amount of timely vigilance and energy which other states choose to employ against the common enemy of their freedom and national independence

4664658 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
4664659 in view of the many incidents we call on the international olympic committee to intercede on behalf of the chinese citizens who are in danger because of the position they have taken during the olympic games
4664660 it is the duty of the olympic movement in its entirety to ensure respect for the spirit of the olympic truce
4664661 since the origins of the olympics tradition has required that peace should prevail during the games
4664662 during the truce period the athletes artists and their families as well as ordinary pilgrims could travel in total safety to participate in or attend the olympic games and return afterwards to their respective countries the international olympic committee ioc decided to revive the ancient concept of the olympic truce with the view to encourage searching for peaceful and diplomatic solutions to the conflicts around the world

4664690 uno de los casos m s interesantes de celos vampirescos lo experiment el investigador ocultista franc s eliphas levi abate constant
4664691 durante su estancia en londres trab levi amistad con un joven duque en cuya casa estaba invitado casi cada d a hac a poco que el duque se hab a casado con una joven y extraordinariamente bella princesa francesa y por cierto que contra el deseo de su familia protestante ya que la joven era cat lica practicante
4664692 el duque como pudo comprobarlo levi hab a llevado durante largos a os una vida un tanto fr vola por no decir libertina teniendo mucho tiempo por amante a una joven italiana bailarina de ballet hasta que por fin la dej puesto que en realidad s lo amaba por entero a su esposa
4664693 cierta tarde enferm la duquesa por lo que tuvo que guardar cama los m dicos diagnosticaron un principio de embarazo pero luego se mostr que la debilidad que padec a deb a tener por origen otra causa y a pesar de que el duque llam a consulta a los m s famosos m dicos de londres stos se vieron ante un enigma fueron empleados los m s diversos remedios m s sin xito alguno
4664694 frecuentaba tambi n el palacio del duque un anciano abate franc s que conoc a ya a la princesa de par s y quien hall especial agrado en conversar con eliphas levi sobre problemas metaf sicos por los que l tambi n se interesaba desde d cadas y no s lo te ricamente
4664695 escuche querido amigo desear a hablar de algo con usted
4664696 cree usted que se halla bajo el influjo de alg n poder oscuro
4664697 bien en tal caso no debemos perder tiempo le agradecer a que media hora antes de la medianoche viniese a mi domicilio para una conjuraci n en compa a
4664698 tras esta conversaci n eliphas levi tom un coche de punto y se traslad a su domicilio donde hubo de lavarse afeitarse y mudarse de ropa de cabeza a pies pues los esp ritus de la zona media que eran los que pensaba invocar el abate exig an de sus conjuradores la m s escrupulosa limpieza tambi n el traje deb a estar de acuerdo con su naturaleza no soportaban ning n tejido animal por lo que quedaban descartados los de lana as como los zapatos de piel
4664699 debido a que la casa del abate se hallaba al nordeste en hampstead heath y eliphas viv a en la plaza russel o sea que era considerable la distancia entre ambos lugares eliphas debi hacer su aseo a fondo con cierta prisa si quer a estar a la hora convenida con el abate a unos cuarenta minutos antes de la medianoche lleg a hampstead heath el abate en persona todo de blanco le abri la puerta y lo condujo por una elevada escalinata a un aposento que se hallaba a un extremo del corredor del primer piso aqu los ojos de eliphas debieron primero acostumbrarse a la oscuridad llamitas azuladas y temblorosas desped an un incienso oliendo a mbar y almizcle
4664700 a la incierta luz eliphas observ una gran mesa circular que se hallaba en el centro de la habitaci n y plantado sobre ella el crucifijo invertido s mbolo del falo
4664701 es mi criado cuchiche el abate ya sabe usted que es indispensable la cifra de tres para estas conjuraciones comience usted con la primera invocaci n
4664702 el ceder pues as la invocaci n al amigo era muestra de que consideraba a eliphas como maestro de primera categor a en la magia y la tal suposici n era en verdad justificada si alguien pod a ejecutar con xito con frente despejada y sin temor puro coraz n y una voluntad fortalecida por numerosas pruebas las milenarias ceremonias de la magia sagrada era este hombre que en el reino de los esp ritus ejerc a tanto dominio como en el de sus criaturas encarnadas y adeptos
4664703 entre el velo de humo eliphas tendi la mano instintivamente a la izquierda all deb a hallarse el recipiente con el agua bendita que deb a haber sido sacada en una noche de plenilunio de una cisterna y vel ndose orando sobre ella durante veintiuna noches ahora hizo una aspersi n a los cuatro ngulos de la habitaci n el abate hac a de ac lito y ondeaba el incensario en el humo comenzaron a forjarse raras figuras y al mismo tiempo les pareci como si un fr o helado brotara del suelo y les llegara hasta la punta del pelo dificult ndoles la respiraci n
4664704 eliphas levi profiri ahora con m s fuerza las palabras de invocaci n s bitamente parecieron retirarse las paredes de la habitaci n y como si se abriese un abismo ante ellos amenazando engullirles infinito y astral brillaron resplandores de destellante luminosidad y se cubrieron los ojos para no ofender por una mirada indiscreta al esp ritu invocado con voz recia pregunt levi la causa de la enfermedad de la duquesa mildred no recibi respuesta los vahos del humo se espesaron de tal modo que amenazaban con privar los sentidos precipit ndose a la ventana eliphas oy s bitamente una voz la cual aunque era fuerte y resonante parec a salir de lo m s profundo de s mismo y llenar todo el espacio de su alma lo que la voz le grit era tan espantoso que sus piernas se negaron a moverse y se qued como petrificado en el mismo sitio en que estaba
4664705 el abate fue ahora quien se precipit a su lado junto a la ventana pero sus manos temblorosas sin fuerzas no lograron abrir el pasador el criado que hab a asistido pasivamente a la invocaci n yac a desmayado en el suelo
4664706 eliphas sali por fin de su entumecimiento y rompi el cristal con el crucifijo absorbiendo con fruici n en compa a del abate el aire fresco de la noche especialmente l que ba aba por decirlo as su febril cabeza en la h meda niebla
4664707 as que ha o do usted la respuesta del esp ritu
4664708 el abate dej caer la cabeza como abrumado en gesto de asentimiento s musit apenas perceptiblemente
4664709 al decir estas palabras se acerc m s a la l mpara de manera que el resplandor de sta cay de lleno sobre l
4664710 levi sinti como si su coraz n se aligerara en muchas arrobas el abate parec a no obstante m s abrumado y se hab a dejado caer sobre un sof contra anse convulsivamente sus hombros y escond a el rostro entre las manos
4664711 se trata de la pobre mildred cada hora consume su vida
4664712 levi no supo que responder y se cerni un silencio denso que cort el abate al levantarse y caminar con pasos un tanto vacilantes de un lado a otro de la sala cueste lo que cueste debo obtener una respuesta a cualquier precio prom tame amigo m o que no me abandonar
4664713 una vaporosa determinaci n se le a en la mirada del anciano para tranquilizarle eliphas respondi
4664714 le di mi palabra de ponerme a su disposici n como mago y puesto que el objetivo no ha sido logrado a n mantengo la palabra dada
4664715 entonces qu dese aqu dentro de doce horas efectuaremos otra conjuraci n invocar a los esp ritus de la zona baja
4664716 eliphas se sobresalt se hab a vuelto loco el viejo usted qu dijo usted un hijo de la iglesia quiere entrar en contacto con los esp ritus infernales no eso no est ni siquiera en la intenci n de la devota duquesa renuncie a ello no arriesgue su alma
4664717 hab a tal glacial decisi n en las palabras y ademanes del abate que eliphas sinti que toda r plica ser a vana y contra su voluntad aunque por lealtad a la palabra dada acept el requerimiento de su amigo
4664718 qued se como hu sped en la casa y tras la extraordinariamente tensa y fatigosa conjuraci n anterior durmi tan pesada y profundamente que se despert tarde en la ma ana
4664719 el d a pas en las debidas purificaciones y plegarias por la noche eliphas recibi la ropa apropiada para el servicio del diablo y los requisitos como ya antes hab a manifestado el abate que aunque le asistir a como ac lito no tomar a parte activa en la invocaci n visti se tambi n con el ropaje prescrito
4664720 el abate haciendo acopio de todas sus fuerzas pregunt por la dolencia de la duquesa
4664721 eliphas vio entonces como el abate se tambaleaba y se desplomaba al suelo
4664722 eliphas tom en brazos su magro cuerpo y lo llev al dormitorio donde desnudando al anciano le puso en la cama yendo luego a buscar al criado que trajese alg n reconfortante al volver se encontr con que el abate hab a vuelto en s por completo m s su aspecto era el de un hombre abatido que parec a haber envejecido muchos a os
4664723 s lo s respondi eliphas que es una palabra griega que significa rana
4664724 no tard en venir el criado con vino y bizcocho pero el abate rechaz todo alimento eliphas tom algo e intent arrancar de su desesperado letargo a mi amigo mas fue in til que pretendiera reanimarlo y con el coraz n oprimido se traslad a su domicilio
4664725 al d a siguiente fue a informarse de c mo se encontraba el abate y la duquesa
4664726 mildred iba cada vez peor el m dico de cabecera daba por descontado su bito
4664727 tambi n el abate se hallaba en grave estado se negaba a todo alimento no respondi al principio a las preguntas del amigo y le manifest despu s que pensaba poner fin a sus d as mediante la inanici n hondamente entristecido se despidi levi preocup ndole mucho las tr gicas consecuencias del pecaminoso conjuro
4664728 durante las dos tardes siguientes se sumi de nuevo en sus acostumbrados estudios y mientras le a el enquiridi n de le n iii se detuvo en un punto en el que por medio de la clave de trithenus se descifraba del escrito esot rico kabal stico lo siguiente
4664729 como un rel mpago atraves la mente de eliphas y sin cerrar siquiera el libro se puso el sobretodo y lanz se a trav s de las calles de londres que se iban sumiendo en el crep sculo vesperal
4664730 me conoce usted lo bastante para saber que soy de su confianza cr ame pues que no se ha perdido a n toda la esperanza
4664731 inmediatamente puso levi manos a la obra y comenz a levantar el entarimado del umbral pero la madera se resisti a sus temblorosos dedos sac su navaja del bolsillo cuya hoja rompi en su fren tico intento
4664732 al d a siguiente fue recibido como un salvador en el palacio del duque de manera pasmosa y en absoluto incomprensible para los m dicos el estado de salud de la joven duquesa hab a mejorado a tal punto que pod a ya hablarse de una franca superaci n de la crisis
4664733 healed as having to be earned and while he also cites lincolns we need to be on gods side
4664734 you know i just cant wrestle tonight sure theres a packed house out there and they all paid to see us perform but im still in shock about what a crazed man did to his family over a year ago
4664735 this is important because even if the liquor license were to go away we want this individual out of this business because he clearly has created an environment that is bad for albuquerques kids
4664736 ajority of sweepstakes promotions are open to sweepers who are eighteen years of age or older there e change and deal with it before the next change arrived but these periods of stability are getting he central purpose of business activity

4664738 so i get this email from strang communications this week the title of it
4664739 bill johnson who with pastors john arnott and ch ahn represents bentleys apostolic
4664740 this is an obvious tragedy both for todd and shonnah and the move of god in lakeland
4664741 they had problems a couple of years ago and i got involved at that time to lend support and give counsel to todd and his staff in talking with todd i was led to believe those issues were now in order obviously they werent
4664742 we are all of one heart in that we want to see their marriage restored and just as important see their hearts get healed from these points of weakness that have been there for years
4664743 none of the revival alliance members sweeps things under the carpet and ignore or deny tragedy
4664744 neither do we think great anointing is a replacement for character we will now work hard to bring healing and restoration considering it a privilege to stand with a brother in trouble regardless of who is at fault
4664745 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4664746 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4664747 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4664748 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4664749 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4664750 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4664751 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4664752 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4664753 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4664754 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4664755 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4664756 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4664757 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4664758 the obsession with northern ireland and particularly policing on the east coast of america was something we identified very quickly as needing to be dealt with
4664759 the work we did in the states for the past six years has been unravelling 35 years of a very one dimensional interpretation of policing the republican agenda and turning that into an accurate description of what policing actually was
4664760 dear old president bush who i visit once a year to tell him about policing and that its working
4664761 its not the content of the conversation thats important but that the conversation takes place
4664762 there will come a point when speaking to the unspeakable will happen and the role of the police is to create the conditions where people realise this terrorism aint going to work
4664763 an awful lot of people who are so called al qaeda are actually radicalised young disenfranchised british
4664764 the more you can get into those communities and build confidence in them the more chances you have of making them see the crazy way theyre going
4664765 all orks is equal but some orks are more equal dan uvvas
4664766 i came into the tunnel and the chinese wang hao was catching and i just had to put it in and soon as i did that it just started to come up i was struggling to hold it in as soon as i crossed the line i just had to let it all out
4664767 with six people trapped on a mountain plateau it could either have gone one of two ways
4664768 despu s de seis a os fallar es algo que no le gusta a nadie pero me ha tocado fallar en el peor momento en los juegos ol mpicos
4664769 hasta el kil metro 10 he ido bien con la t ctica que hab amos dicho robert korzeniowski su entrenador y yo y adem s fresco del 10 al 12 he cambiado porque bamos a cuatro minutos pelaos e hice 7m53s hasta ah todo bien luego 7m5s y poco antes del minuto 14 jefferson ha cambiado muy fuerte he intentado seguirle e irle cogiendo progresivamente pero no pod a
4664770 cuando no puedes no puedes luego ya me daba casi lo mismo ser sexto que octavo porque te quedas un poco bloqueado no obstante he luchado hasta el final porque tambi n ven a el irland s al lado y era un s ptimo puesto que despu s lo valoras un poco m s

4664777 but the fact remains they are untested and we have doubts whether pakistan could deliver on those plans
4664778 getting eight teams around to training and games in two centres is a massive logistical exercise and with the current situation there i dont know if the military could handle it
4664779 our guys listened patiently and asked some very pertinent questions i thought but i didnt get the impression that any of them were convinced about the safety of the situation
4664780 i would not be surprised if some ethnic minorities in china were offended by this but they are also accustomed to it
4664781 in the west we are obsessed with authenticity in such matters but its different in china id guess many chinese would not have a problem with it
4664782 i see nothing wrong exactly with where the children are from it is a tradition in china in terms of giving a performance
4664783 i think the fear for many is does harmony and unity ultimately mean assimilation and surrendering their own identity and autonomy

4664799 early on he was getting the ball up a little bit but he settled down and made some unbelievable pitches when he had to
4664800 im close its just that the abdominals are tough youve got to be careful with them
4664801 i was trying to bounce a breaking ball and left it over the middle
4664802 i probably could have handled it a little better youve got to make your pitches after that
4664803 for the lord gives wisdom and from his mouth come knowledge and understanding
4664804 trust in the lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding in all you ways acknowledge him and he will make your paths straight do not be wise in your own eyes fear the lord and shun evil

4664807 let your eyes look straight ahead fix your gaze directly before you make level paths for your feet and take only ways that are firm

4664809 the evil deeds of a wicked man ensnare him the cords of his sin hold him fast he will die for lack of discipline led astray by his own great folly
4664810 if you have been trapped by what you said ensnared by the words of your mouth then do this my son to free yourself press your plea with your neighbor allow no sleep to your eyes no slumber to your eyelids free yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter like a bird from the snare fo the fowler
4664811 there are six things the lord hates seven that are detestable to him haughty eyes a lying tongue hands that shed innocent blood a heart that devises wicked schemes feet that are quick to rush into evil a false witness who pours out lies and a man who stirs up dissension among brothers

4664819 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof

4664830 in the following 11 business days depositors withdrew more than 1 3 billion from their accounts
4664831 prepared to take measures that would help prevent the collapse of indymac or minimize the damage should such a failure occur

4664834 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective
4664835 a guy came from the left side of me and pointed a gun at me and asked me for all my valuables
4664836 i gave him 20 and a cell phone and he said get in the back of my car and keep quiet
4664837 this one guy who felt that it was ok to violate us and disrespect us and get into our own personal space he thought it was ok and it just needs to stop

4664847 the ads are less an effort to get votes than make a point and get it covered by the national media while obama has the attention of the nation
4664848 no doubt the obama campaign will do the same now
4664849 every week i come out here and do whatever i want to do

4664861 i had no idea it was so difficult for multiracials
4664862 i think most people in the united states assume that individuals are in one and one only racial group
4664863 its the younger generation that is becoming more aware that these lines dont make sense
4664864 i dont think this is something he can simply say through words if he says im biracial or im half white
4664865 i think what he will do is tell his story again at the convention in a way that says this is not a story about race this is a story about america
4664866 the visibility of barack obama may lead more people to identify with multiple races

4664878 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4664879 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4664880 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4664881 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4664882 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4664883 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4664887 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4664888 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4664889 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4664898 we started strong and were no 3 on the qualifying sheets
4664899 and we were excited because we felt like that run had plenty of room for improvement we came back in the evening and probably went a little over center with the tune up and just didnt turn in the pass we were hoping for
4664900 dropping from third to ninth was a bit of a disappointment but the good news is we have two sessions tomorrow where we can improve and thats exactly what we plan on doing at least we know our limits with this track
4664901 we all saw last year how every point meant so much so if we can make up even one more spot before the playoffs begin it will be fantastic
4664902 our cars running great right now we just need to clean it up a little tomorrow and well be ready for race day
4664903 this is the exciting time of the year for all of us and the guys are really feeling it everyone is getting pumped up and were ready to get after it once the playoffs start but right now we need to focus on achieving the best starting position we can earn and that quest will start sunday right here at maple grove raceway
4664904 ive had a good holiday but its fun to be back on the bike again today has started very well and i am very happy with my bike and with our tyres it seems the bridgestones are working very well here so far the new asphalt is good much better than last year and the grip improved throughout the day so i think that they have done a good job casey is strong again here so it looks like being a hard race but we have made a good start tomorrow it seems it could rain which is a pity but we have found a good setting today so hopefully even if it is wet then we will be in good shape on sunday we have some small engine modifications here to try but mostly we will wait until monday to try the new parts when we will have an important test
4664905 its good to be back in action weve made a good start and been fast all day weve tried quite a few different things and some different tyres with the aim of collecting as much information as possible in case it rains tomorrow of course we hope it doesnt but there is a chance it will be wet and so we wanted to make as much of today as we could so that we are prepared its been a positive day and we hope that we can continue like this
4664906 i am feeling very good physically and i only feel pain when i walk to the bike in the garage once im on it i am fine i am feeling confident but i need half a second more in order to be at the front the main problem is in the front tyre i am worried because the first michelin is in seventh and this isnt great it is clear that we all need to work together to improve this we are working very closely together with michelin and yamaha and we are trying to find a better way for us here this weekend it is very difficult at the moment to fight for the podium in the dry and in the wet we dont know yet my main aim this weekend is to finish in the top seven the new asphalt is better than last year so this is a good thing one more thing i want to say one of my mechanics juanito has just become a grandfather and so i want to say congratulations to him
4664907 we are quite lucky that jorges physical condition is good better than we expected and in fact its the least of our problems today our biggest issue is the confidence in the front end we dont have enough grip and jorge cant go into the turns fast enough furthermore the bike is understeering at full lean and therefore were losing a lot of time in the corners from the morning session we were able to improve our package but it wasnt enough to enable us to fight at the top tonight we will work closely with michelin to analyse data in order to help each other to improve our front grip problem
4664908 the new engine is awesome although it feels a little bit different than what ive been running what i had was obviously developed to the maximum and it was real smooth and real linear with the power delivery the new motor has a bit of a different feel but it is faster its a little bit peaky but its not hurting us at all so thanks to yamaha for rolling that over here to tech 3 we got some electronics stuff too so that is helping calm things down its just a little bit more aggressive on the throttle which the way im having too ride this bike is actually good at the moment with some of the small issues i have got with the front tyre the only way i can ride is brake as hard as i can and almost back it in like a supermoto and as soon as i get full lean angle i just roll to maximum throttle opening because i cant carry lots of momentum with 250 lines like i need to i need to get the rear to come round to steer the bike the rear tyre feels fantastic and im really happy with that i did 15 laps on a rear without any problems and good and consistent grip but the front tyre that i normally use and that i love it is good but only for a short distance ill sit down with my guys again tonight and talk things through with michelin to see if we can improve again tomorrow
4664909 it looks a little bit worse than it actually is because we have moved in a good direction with the set up and the new engine is fantastic so a massive thanks to yamaha for giving the team and me this level of support it just feels stronger and you seem to be getting through the gearbox a lot more progressively and it keeps on pulling once you get into fifth and sixth gear you see the red gear change light flash up a bit quicker than usual and up the hill you can certainly feel the bike is still pulling and it is a big improvement we have just got a lot of hard work to do with michelin now the track is cleaning up a little we are getting more life out of the tyre and the grip level is not so bad but we can still make it better and i am staying positive and trying to work as hard as i can with michelin when i ran off i just braked a bit too late down the hill i thought i was going to be able to stay on it but it high sided me in the gravel it was only a small tip off but then the chain fell off so i had to put that back on i cleaned it all off and i went quicker on the last two laps even with that but with the front tyre we are just trying to find a combination between having out and out grip and the endurance you can go as soft as you want to find some grip but you have also got to finish the 22 laps

4664918 la cr nica cinematogr fica que se cumple por la v a de cualesquiera de las modalidades del periodismo es a fin de cuentas un resultado m s de la apreciaci n del cine pero de aquella a la que no le basta el mero disfrute sino que se ha impuesto como tarea la valoraci n explicaci n y conclusiones de la obra f lmica confrontada
4664919 d cese fr volamente de la cr nica que es un art culo de prensa sobre temas de actualidad
4664920 sin embargo este personaje el cronista cinematogr fico no se contenta con la mera relaci n de hechos ordenados en el tiempo que perfilan a esta o aquella pel cula en su primera y m s superficial lectura
4664921 es quiz a partir de los 50s y los j venes escritores franceses de los cahiers du cinema que el cronista cinematogr fico es entendido como un cr tico de arte que debe ir m s all de circunstancias anecd ticas para centrar su atenci n en los qu s y porqu s capaces de cualificar o demeritar los valores de la obra f lmica para aplicarle a partir de ah un juicio concluyente de su estatura art stica
4664922 la cr nica de cine incluso utiliza desde hace ya a os palabras como discurso estructura ruptura atm sfera etc t rminos que sin duda se adaptan al acercamiento que es posible conceder al cine en nuestros tiempos
4664923 pero en fin es un hecho que en el presente la cr nica cr tica cinematogr fica es una especialidad del periodismo no siempre lastimosamente ejercida por especialistas lo que con demasiada frecuencia deja a miles de lectores o escuchas expuestos al azar de un chiripazo de un desconcierto lastimoso y hasta del humor involuntario fruto de la falta de preparaci n frente al propio medio
4664924 as para manejar la valoraci n f lmica es por supuesto imprescindible ser un observador cuidadoso y saber escribir pero tambi n y centralmente entender de cine de su teor a y lenguaje de sus dinamismos e historia de sus recursos y sintaxis
4664925 resulta dif cil establecer de manera absoluta cual si se tratasen de infalibles ingredientes y pasos de una receta de cocina cu les son las caracter sticas de la cr nica cr tica cinematogr fica
4664926 a n as me atrevo a algunos rasgos de la cr tica f lmica que yo entiendo
4664927 me parece que la buena y verdadera cr tica no es aquella que vuelca conceptos de bueno o malo como juez de la obra de arte que valora sino la que establece con claridad y fundamento por qu bueno o por qu malo a fin de que quien lee o escucha el juicio aunque no lo comparta lo respete como fruto de un esfuerzo anal tico
4664928 la cr tica cinematogr fica no ha de develar el argumento de la pel cula como recurso para resolverla porque no es as como se resuelve una obra que el p blico ya vio o est por ver
4664929 el ejercicio cr tico no se hace para rega ar
4664930 puesto que en lo general el cine carece por su car cter ampliamente popular de las pretensiones dificultosas del gran arte la cr tica cinematogr fica debe mantener un tono acorde de sencillez no culterano con muy poco o nada de r gida y almidonada intelectualidad y eso s pleno de chispa y frescura
4664931 aunque ya est claro que la cr nica cinematogr fica no debe adolecer de juicios de valor quien escribe debe asumir con buena conciencia que esos juicios por muy definitivos que le parezcan se entregan al lector o audiencia cuando mucho como sugerencias sin duda bien intencionadas para que cada cin filo construya su propia pel cula y en ese proceso ratifique o rectifique su percepci n de la misma o incluso desde su propia situaci n ratifique o rectifique por acertados que parezcan los enunciados del cronista
4664932 perm taseme ahora una idea que muchos comparten a n y cuando sea dif cil de comprobar no enfrenta igual la pel cula el cronista de cine que el cin filo com n sin tal responsabilidad
4664933 el espectador llega a la pel cula a divertirse despu s de trabajar el cr tico llega a trabajar tal vez despu s de divertirse
4664934 el cin filo privilegia en la pel cula lo que pasa el cronista privilegia adem s o debiera en teor a c mo pasa lo que pasa
4664935 el cin filo mientras ve se ocupa tan s lo de la obra que tiene enfrente el cr tico en cambio la valora tambi n en funci n de referencias te ricas gen ricas y filmogr ficas previas construy ndole as un marco de juicio mucho m s amplio
4664936 finalmente un poco en broma y un poco en serio tampoco puede objetarse esta otra diferencia entre el cin filo com n y el cronista uno paga por ver el otro cobra por ver no mucho por cierto sin que siquiera sea condici n que quienes le leen o escuchan concuerden con sus opiniones
4664937 my girl 2 with jessica and carole marie i didnt care that they were chick flicks i got to hang out with two of the coolest people ever and even better i got free dr pepper
4664938 idk what i said doesnt he realize that people are sad that the person left them but happy that the person is now in heaven
4664939 god created us so we had to eat and drink and he created the earth so we have to work to get food and water so that means god created us so we have to work it kind of stinks its all about original sin or something isnt it
4664940 it isnt adam and eve had to work before the fall work isnt punishment its reward
4664941 well thats the obvious question and the answer is going to sound cheesy but hear me out its about god
4664942 god so i should work because god wants me to work so its a guilt thing
4664943 no not at all guilt should not be a motivation work exists for a lot of reasons god worked he created the earth and the cosmos we work to participate in the god life to imitate god thats also why we take a sabbath work is one of the ways we engage in life one of the ways we participate its important the bible says that whatever we do whatever work we do we do it unto the lord to please him just like i do the things i know honor or please my wife
4664944 so i get up in the morning and do work for god
4664945 right if you work for yourself you are going to be let down or you are going to work too much because i am trying to redeem myself or something you are going to be let down god is the only motivation i have found where the law of diminishing returns doesnt apply i get joy in knowing him and he makes sense of my life my family my money my work and work is a good tool it is the means to a god end not the end itself
4664946 set your mind on things above not on things on the earth
4664947 when anyone hears the word of the kingdom and understands it not then comes the wicked one and catches away that which was sown in his heart this is he who received seed by the wayside
4664948 those beside the road are those who have heard then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart so that they will not believe and be saved
4664949 your word have i hidden in mine heart that i might not sin against you
4664950 nazi scum adolf hitler staged the olympics in an attempt to display aryan supremacy and show the world the athletic prowess of the german athlete but black african american athlete jesse owenz had other plans earning four gold medalz and showing how athletically inept those fucking nazi skumz really were
4664951 i am touched by the overwhelming support it is no longer just a by election it is a lot more than that
4664952 this is not just any by election it is about the next malaysian leader
4664953 permatang pauh voters have a heavy burden they are deciding the destiny of the country
4664954 apparently the aircraft was coming in for a landing or a touch and go pretty standard sort of exercises
4664955 it may have been hit by a gust of cross winds the nose landing gear collapsed and the aircraft came to a grinding halt
4664956 unfortunately today we are looking evil in the eye it is very strong very nasty and very dangerous
4664957 never ever will succumb my small nation of georgia it is an unprovoked attack to kill georgian democracy and together we will repel it
4664958 talk to the villagers these invaders are 21st century barbarians you are dealing with people who despise everything human everything nice everything modern and everything european
4664959 queensland has looked overseas for innovations that will help us improve health care delivery in the face of a worldwide shortage of doctors
4664960 physician assistants will extend the capacity of our highly skilled medical workforce
4664961 we need to provide the best possible training for junior doctors and for doctors to gain experience they must have opportunities to see patients and do procedures
4664962 we are concerned if physician assistants are increasingly used they could be substituted for doctors in some of these roles and the training of junior medicos compromised
4664963 we have seen steady and material deceleration in googs organic revenue growth
4664964 yep im ready for the litter of kids bring em in hook em horns
4664965 it is a terrible poignancy that donnettes sons birthday will now coincide with the day his mother died she gave her life in service to our city
4664966 a superhuman effort by 30 strangers who lifted the vehicle off her body miraculously saved her baby before she died
4664967 we did not really communicate we all just started lifting we lifted it up and someone pulled her out
4664968 after the president has said that as commander in chief he is ultimately responsible for contractors on the battlefield it is disappointing that his administration has been unwilling to make that interest clear before the courts
4664969 the apparent lack of interest from the united states fortifies our conclusion that the case does not yet present a political question
4664970 restricts accountability and oversight opens the door to corruption and abuse and in some instances may significantly increase the cost to american taxpayers
4664971 100 billion dollars is a very large amount of money in fact iraqs gdp was just over 100 billion dollars in 2007 but what staggers my imagination is how sober adults would be willing to divert such vast sums of americas financial resources to the bank accounts of private firms whose dealings are opaque to taxpayers and for the most part held unaccountable
4664972 i think advocates of unaccountable privatisation are beginning to reap what they have sown defending privatisation of war making on such an enormous scale is becoming tenuous its hard to paint a picture of contractors providing taxpayers value when so many instances of contractor misconduct have found their way into the publics consciousness
4664973 this magnitude of expenditures on private contractors is especially striking in light of recent government and media reports of dysfunction in the dcaa the protection of the interests of american taxpayers is apparently suffering a number of impediments
4664974 in the army any sign that you are a woman means you are automatically ridiculed and treated as inferior
4664975 there are only three things the guys let you be if youre a girl in the military a bitch a ho or a dyke one guy told me he thinks the military sends women over to give the guys eye candy to keep them sane he told me in vietnam they had prostitutes but they dont have those in iraq so they have women soldiers instead
4664976 there is the possibility that the demographics of the all volunteer force draw more rape prone men into uniform as compared to civil society
4664977 im interested in good relations between the united states and russia but in the 21st century nations dont invade other nations
4664978 against the background of the complicated ethnic politics of the caucasus a part of the world where historical grudges run deep and the oppressed can become the oppressor in the blink of an eye
4664979 for a lot of younger african americans the resistance of the civil rights generation to obamas candidacy signified the failure of their parents to come to terms at the dusk of their lives with the success of their own struggle to embrace the idea that black politics might now be disappearing into american politics in the same way that the irish and italian machines long ago joined the political mainstream
4664980 could not come to terms at the dusk of their lives with the success of their own struggle
4664981 the generational transition that is reordering black politics didnt start this year it has been happening gradually and quietly for at least a decade as younger african americans barack obama among them have challenged their elders in traditionally black districts what this years democratic nomination fight did was to accelerate that transition
4664982 the argument here is that a president obama closely watched for signs of parochialism or racial resentment would have less maneuvering room to champion spending on the urban poor say or to challenge racial injustice whats more his very presence in the rose garden might undermine the already tenuous case for affirmative action in hiring and school admissions
4664983 i wonder what the most intelligent thing ever said was that started with the word dude dude these are isotopes dude we removed your kidney youre gonna be fine dude i am so stoked to win this nobel prize i just wanna thank kevin and turtle and all my homies
4664984 i think that when you get dressed in the morning sometimes youre really making a decision about your behavior for the day like if you put on flipflops youre saying hope i dont get chased today be nice to people in sneakers
4664985 i saw a guy at a party wearing a leather jacket and i thought that is cool but then i saw another guy wearing a leather vest and i thought that is not cool then i figured it out cool is all about leather sleeves
4664986 when you have a fat friend there are no see saws only catapults
4664987 i like fruit baskets because it gives you the ability to mail someone a piece of fruit without appearing insane like if someone just mailed you an apple youd be like huh what the hell is this but if its in a fruit basket youre like this is nice
4664988 i feel stupid when i write the word banana its like how many nas are on this thing cause im like bana keep going bananana damn
4664989 i wanna make a jigsaw puzzle thats 40 000 pieces and when you finish it it says go outside
4664990 i like parties but i dont like pi atas because the pinata promotes violence against flamboyant animals hey theres a donkey with some pizzazz lets kick its ass what im trying to say is dont make the same halloween costume mistake that i did
4664991 people and squirrels are very different most people will not argue that but i find that there is one situation in which theyre very similar and that is when i am driving towards them in my car then theyre kind of hard to tell apart especially if the human is kind of hairy
4664992 swimming is a confusing sport because sometimes you do it for fun and other times you do it to not die and when im swimming sometimes im not sure which one it is i gotta go by the outfit pants uh oh bathing suit okay naked well see
4664993 saying im sorry is the same as saying i apologize except at a funeral
4664994 they say that you can tell man apart from other animals by his ability to reason i think you could also go by last names whats his name patches patches what thats a dog dont waste my time
4664995 the easiest time to add insult to injury is when youre signing somebodys cast
4664996 some jokes are short and elegant like a mathematical proof or a midget in a ballgown
4664997 one of my friends has a stutter and a lot of people think thats a bad thing but to me thats just like starting certain words with a drum roll
4664998 the worst time to have a heart attack is during a game of charades
4664999 about a month ago i got a cactus a week later it died i was really depressed because i was like damn i am less nurturing than a desert
4665000 i like when good things happen to me but i wait two weeks to tell anyone because i like to use the word fortnight
4665001 i like video games but theyre really violent id like to play a video game where you help the people who were shot in all the other games itd be called really busy hospital
4665002 i think vests are all about protection you know what i mean like a lifevest protects you from drowning and bulletproof vests protect you from getting shot and the sweatervest protects you from pretty girls leave me alone
4665003 i went into a deli and got an egg sandwich and a hot chocolate
4665004 a drunk driver is very dangerous so is a drunk backseat driver if hes persuasive dude make a left those are trees trust me
4665005 i used to play sports then i realized you can buy trophies now im good at everything
4665006 i wrapped my christmas presents early this year but i used the wrong paper see the paper i used said happy birthday on it i didnt want to waste it so i just wrote jesus on it
4665007 i was making pancakes the other day and a fly flew into the kitchen and thats when i realized that a spatula is a lot like a fly swatter and a crushed fly is a lot like a blueberry and a roommate is a lot like a fly eater
4665008 i like sports i like professional football i like to get to the stadium and see the games live you know and i paint my chest before i leave the house but i dont have many friends you know so i usually just do punctuation and tack on a group already in progress
4665009 an easy way to sound like a creep is to add the word ladies to the end of things you say it can be harmless too but it just makes you a creep yeah after college i spent two years in the peace corps ladies the more harmless it is the more of a creep you become i broke my arm
4665010 my favorite fruit is grapes because with grapes you always get another chance cause you know if you have a crappy apple or a peach youre stuck with that crappy piece of fruit but if you have a crappy grape no problem just move on to the next grapes the fruit of hope
4665011 i went into a clothes store and a lady came up to me and said
4665012 the digital camera is a great invention because it allows us to reminisce instantly
4665013 on the downside its loaded with sexual predators on the plus side its also loaded with sexual prey
4665014 i love women but i feel like you cant trust some of them
4665015 i think it would be cool if you were writing a ransom note in microsoft word and it popped up the paperclip and said
4665016 oh thats how alex feels about maria i wouldnt have known if i had not walked by there thank you
4665017 i like sheryl as a friend but im not sure about taking things further

4665027 kerry brings more money and name recognition to the table than any other name on the obama list so far americans do tend to love a comeback kid and this would be the most amazing political comeback since richard nixon came back from the dead forty years ago polls show many voters question obamas foreign policy credentials to be a wartime president as a decorated veteran and longtime member of the senate foreign relations committee kerry could fill that gap obama suffers from being a new face on the political scene but kerry warts and all is well known to the voters and in 2004 he did draw more votes than any democrat ever has

4665029 brule native american concert live and coyote wisdom workshop native american techniques for healing body mind and spirit hosted by kc mayor mark funkhouser
4665030 from funks front porch by funk dear folks this week im writing the newsletter instead of gloria as im sure youre aware nine members of the city council co sponsored an ordinance on thursday that would place severe restrictions on would be volunteers for the city even a casual read of this proposal reveals it to be bad policy for instance there are 7 694 volunteers in our parks department alone this ordinance would require those generous citizens even the ones who give up a saturday afternoon to clean their neighborhood park to undergo hours and hours of antidiscrimination and harassment training and a criminal background check and it would stipulate that not one of those thousands of people be related to anyone in the parks department so if a city worker is short on help for a special event they cant ask their spouse or kids to lend a hand it would be illegal in fact my colleagues on the city council wouldnt be allowed to have their kids come in and stuff envelopes help answer phones or even move furniture around so yes its bad policy
4665031 you make the costumes ill paint the sets well use dads garage for a stage lets put on a show
4665032 but smart policy is not the point here this ordinance is a bald faced mean spirited political attack on me
4665033 to understand this you only have to ask yourself one question why now
4665034 this ordinance is obviously a reaction to a lawsuit against the city me and my wife
4665035 yet if it were to pass it would have no impact on that lawsuit worse it would essentially render a guilty verdict in that lawsuit without due process and this is america im sure that if we could somehow strip this whole situation of petty personal politics my colleagues would agree that conviction without fair trial is fundamentally wrong its especially wrong in a case such as ours in which the allegations are absolutely false i am very confident that we will prevail through the judicial process
4665036 but when you ask why now you have to take into consideration everything that is happening in this administration the progress that is being made
4665037 in just 14 months we have adopted a fiscally prudent budget a debt policy and an economic development and incentive policy which the city never had weve passed two important sales taxes one for infrastructure and another for transportation by historically wide margins weve placed on the november ballot the best light rail proposal this city has ever seen and weve made so much progress toward a regional transit system that i predict well see portions of that system up and running before my first term is complete and now were starting to move forward on bold new initiatives that will have a profound impact on the future of our city over the last two months ive reached out to my fellow mayors across the metro area and across the state all the way to st louis in an effort to build alliances as result were now taking the first steps toward creating a metropolitan mayors caucus and a statewide urban partnership through which we can impact lawmaking at the state and federal level to improve conditions in our city since may i have been working with leaders from across the city to develop new ideas for economic development in the most distressed areas of our city in the coming weeks i will appoint a group of leaders to move those forward turn them into plans and policies which greatly improve the quality of life in neighborhoods that have been left out of recent revitalization efforts with this ordinance some of my colleagues on the city council are diverting attention and energy away from these efforts and toward something that has very little impact on our city i know that some of you are skeptical about that statement some would say that im the one who is stirring unnecessary conflict because i insist on having my wife up here if she would only stay home all of this would go away and that might be true were it not for one stubborn fact gloria has been essential to all of our successes
4665038 she is a vital member of my team every bit as important as my chief of staff my writers policy analysts and scheduler in fact shes the primary reason why weve pushed all of these big initiatives in such a short period of time because the biggest most unique contribution she makes is to constantly push me to keep moving forward on my agenda
4665039 a vital member of my team every bit as important as my chief of staff my writers policy analysts and scheduler
4665040 so in short shes your standard elected officials spouse the driving force behind the leader what makes us most unique is that we dont hide it we dont pretend that shes just an adornment to my public life someone who surfaces now and then to smile at a banquet instead we are who we are a man and woman who have been deeply in love and partnership for 29 years and who will continue to be so for 30 more should we have the grace to live so long and if you value what this administration has accomplished if you share hope and faith for what we aim to accomplish you will help me oppose this vicious political attack i urge you to contact you to contact your city council member and tell them not to enact this bad ordinance tell them it will hurt the citys ability to work with volunteers and it will hurt this city council and mayors ability to make ours a city that works for you in faith mark
4665041 forbidding exports of u s petroleum reduces the incentive for domestic suppliers to produce and could potentially lead to higher prices if u s production or refining declined
4665042 didnt you hear me are you stupid go call an ambulance now
4665043 hey badass why dont you go call for an ambulance
4665044 the main reason why we have now close to 2 000 doctors that have chosen our zrx prescriber is because the most important objective for zoommed is to ensure that the doctors are using the best and most modern technologies and products available on the market to facilitate the prescription process in their daily practice

4665210 now we can see a new world coming into view a world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order
4665211 they are both need for general medical treatment and combat related vehicle accidents non combat injuries major illness combat injuries etc
4665212 interesting i do not seem to recall reading in the news that the is involved in combat operations in those nations are we talking about black ops
4665213 yes it is almost all black ops in those nations
4665214 how did you know that these troops had been injured in those nations and not say in
4665215 because they were angry at what they had been sent to do and they wanted someone to talk to about it as their care providers safe in the hospital late at night they cried they talked they confessed to us what they had been sent to do we are all under orders to shut up not tell the truth but soldier to soldier we talked a lot i heard more than i was prepared to hear due to the horrid extent of the injuries i saw more than i was prepared to see
4665216 why would a tough special ops soldier be crying loss of a fellow soldier loss of a leg or limb or god forbid his genitals or face unrecognizable anymore
4665217 because of what they were sent to do once they figured out what the real mission was
4665218 no they were sent to be the terrorists and it is why they were sent that had them crying some of them were afraid that god would never forgive them and i think they might be right at times there were some attacks on the us soldiers by people who do not want us there and some pay back attacks after us forces had attacked them but for the most part what i was being told about was the us conducting intimidation and terrorism operations against civilians to get their oil and gas
4665219 many of the people in those areas do not like company have these soldiers been sent in to strong arm threaten terrorize etc with these big oil thugs and things got too hot shooting started
4665220 some times yes but that is not what had many of them upset unless they did lose a fellow soldier or yes they lost a future because of their injuries
4665221 exactly and that is exactly why i contacted you japan china russia and others are over there to sign up the oil and gas leases but the us is the only one i know of that is going in there and terrorizing or killing people to get its way they are using us soldiers to try to force people to sign a contract or kill them and take it from them anyway the truth has to get out about what bush has done and used 9 11 as the excuse to do it these black ops started way before 9 11 they had to get oil and gas leases signed then they had to get the pipeline under control
4665222 many of our soldiers have already figured out that 9 11 was just to get the pipeline they need across many of these soldiers know they were used to get the oil and gas leases nailed down so there would be something to put through that pipeline
4665223 the us army or marines cannot tell you the truth lest they want to face court martial and spend the rest of their life in
4665224 were you able to determine from any of these special ops soldiers how long such covert operations had been going on prior to 9 11
4665225 yes according to some of them these operations had been going on for up to a year before 9 11 and possibly even longer they had to nail down those oil and gas leases pipeline right of ways because many other nations were after the same oil and gas deals
4665226 the thought just occurred to me how do they explain these injuries or kia of these soldiers who are waging black ops against civilians in nations we supposedly have no ongoing military operations
4665227 afghanistan some times if after october 7 2001 or they list them as victims of terrorists without explaining that they were killed or injured conducting acts of terrorism against civilians and a fire fight broke out innocent humans except they were sitting on land with oil and gas under it there were some attacks on us troops as pay back
4665228 did any of these soldiers admit to you how they figured out that someone had ordered them on an illegal mission an illegal order to go process a death warrant on civilians who would not sign a contract
4665229 oh brendan when we get past these trees look at the moon
4665230 so im looking forward to having lunch with my ex tomorrow

4665256 im no nutritionist but that wont stop me from telling you what to eat
4665257 theres no evidence that nutritional advice or any of these health products are beneficial or at all necessary
4665258 its just an income generator a way to push products
4665259 nutritional supplements when mixed with other medication and strenuous exercise can result in injury or even death
4665260 its crucial that your health care provider knows youre taking nutritional supplements because it can be dangerous

4665290 this afternoon the jewish quarter of leopoldstadt was invaded by triumphant crowds that called families from their houses and forced them to kneel and scrub the pavements shouting perish jewry out with the jews
4665291 entering jewish owned shops and carrying off whatever goods they fancied as well as money and going into private homes and demanding large sums of moneypersonal jewelry and other valuables
4665292 i can only hope and expect that the other world which has such deep sympathy for these criminals will at last be generous enough to convert that sympathy into practical aid we on our part are ready to put all these criminals at the disposal of these countries for all i care even on luxury ships
4665293 it is heartbreaking to think of the queues of desperate human beings around our consulates in vienna and other cities waiting in suspense for what happens at evian it is not a question of how many unemployed this country can safely add to its own unemployed millions it is a test of civilization can america live with itself if it lets germany get away with this policy of extermination
4665294 as we have no real racial problem we are not desirous of importing one
4665295 a sudden rush of jewish refugees might arouse anti semitic feelings
4665296 switzerland which has as little use for these jews as germany has will herself take measures to protect herself from being swamped by the jews
4665297 you can do what you like with the jews nobody is interested in them
4665298 we on our part are ready to put all these criminals at the disposal of these countries for all i care even on luxury ships
4665299 we see that one likes to pity the jews as long as one can use this pity for a wicked agitation against germany but that no state is prepared to admit a few thousand jews thus the conference serves to justify germanys policy against jewry
4665300 no member of the medical profession wishes to see the country inundated by migr s
4665301 it is felt by many people that we hear too much about the trouble of the jews they shout too loudly they make too insistent a demand upon the compassion of the world compassion they get and deserve but annoyance is apt to accompany it

4665380 like any top sportsman who senses he or she has the ability we are obviously disappointed to have so narrowly missed out on victory in june even so we played a leading role in what proved to be a thrilling race and we can be proud of the tremendous exemplary work our team has put in since the beginning of this project thanks to everyones untiring efforts we went to le mans this year with three cars which all had the necessary legs and reliability to contest what turned out to be a 24 hour sprint at full song the performance potential of the 908 hdi fap meant we were able to play several joker cards but we ended up needing one too many this years winner emerged after a fierce battle between the two main players who both deserve respect for their efforts and encouragement for the future we now have every intention of keeping up our effort in order to be in a position to top the podium in 2009
4665381 we have called on our core driver line up for this race but marc christian pedro and st phane will be joined by alexander and christian there are two reasons behind this decision to begin with they are both available while at the same time this race will give them a chance to gain extra experience of endurance racing

4665394 a key aspect of the debate both during the public consultation on and parliamentary debate about the code of practice for voluntary retention of data and also during the debate about the directive within the european council and the european parliament has been the impact or potential impact that retention of communications data has on individuals human rights

4665418 britains honeybees have suffered catastrophic losses this year according to a survey of the nations beekeepers contributing to a shortage of honey and putting at risk the pollination of fruits and vegetables
4665419 average winter bee losses due to poor weather and disease vary from between 5 and 10 so a 30 loss is deeply worrying this spells serious trouble for pollination services and honey producers
4665420 we dont know why there is a difference and what is behind the high mortality
4665421 30 fewer honeybee colonies could therefore cost the economy some 50m and put at risk the governments crusade for the public to eat five portions of fresh fruit and vegetables a day

4665542 look at me look how clever and subtle i am
4665543 i suppose that one reason that this haunting line struck me with such force when i first came across it is that it acknowledges with perfect simplicity the inevitable entwining of beauty and tragedy that is the hallmark of the greek theater and is a consistent element in the works that have always moved me the most from the plays of euripides to the history of thucydides from the light comedies of no l coward to the films of pedro almod var as the greeks knew well its the potential for being broken which boils down to the knowledge that we all must die that gives resonance and meaning to the small part of the universe that is our life

4665564 they had problems a couple of years ago and i got involved at that time to lend support and give counsel to todd and his staff in talking with todd i was led to believe those issues were now in order obviously they werent
4665565 we know that many of you will have questions for most of which we presently have no answers

4665568 doing all that we can do to bring correction and counsel to todd
4665569 a period of time while the couple both continue to receive counseling
4665570 the outpouring has put a tremendous strain on their counseling process because the process for all intents and purposes was almost suspended because of the exaggerated distance and the exaggerated seven days a week schedule
4665571 we believe that it is important to recognize and defend the authenticity of this outpouring by the testimonies of the countless thousands who viewed on god tv or attended at lakeland and were healed set free and delivered through jesus christ
4665572 i love todd i will always love him i will carry him in my heart and prayers and never let go
4665573 for the body of christ for todd for his family
4665574 none of the revival alliance members sweeps things under the carpet and ignore or deny tragedy

4665596 we rely on affiliate marketing to drive our gaming website design sales and lead acquisition mostly because some webmasters in our field are better at marketing online than we are
4665597 things in the industry really turned a corner when people began to acquire not maintain customers online
4665598 when acquisiton via online services got big companies in the gaming website design sector finally woke up to the idea that the information super highway was here to stay in a very big way
4665599 because people hardly come to our stores in person anymore

4665730 it just felt like another ride for me it didnt feel fast didnt feel slow it was quite weird to be honest
4665731 i kept well away from the atmosphere when i first arrived here i had a bit of a look around but i warmed up downstairs well away from the hype
4665732 wed seen the earlier times they werent overly quick so i knew what i had to do
4665733 its really a waste of time riding a 4 15 if you can qualify in second place with a 4 18 today is basically where it counts
4665734 to come in from worlds ranked seventh and to make fourth fastest time is a great confidence booster it was by no means perfect though ive got more in the tank
4665735 she has withdrawn from the olympics and will not be traveling to beijing
4665736 yes grandpa there are blacks that live near me and asians and hispanics and all sorts of people
4665737 well there are bad white people and bad people of all colors
4665738 and id rather have a black neighbor than a racist asshole
4665739 you can support us or leave to our fate but if they come for us and all hope is gone we will turn the middle east into a radioactive wasteland until the end of time
4665740 el proceso comienza cuando la formaci n ubicada en uno de los brazos del lago argentino avanza hasta la punta de la pen nsula de magallanes cubriendo las v as de drenaje
4665741 lo que culmina con el desprendimiento de inmensos bloques de hielo como el ocurrido el pasado 9 de julio
4665742 son incorrectos porque solamente est n basados en modelos matem ticos y presentan resultados en escenarios que no incluyen por ejemplo la actividad solar
4665743 curiosamente al astro nunca se le ha visto como un agente de enfriamiento sino de calentamiento pero tiene los dos papeles

4665745 the last game we were watching a lot of different guys in the huddle now we want to see that first group a little more disciplined and under control
4665746 whoever your quarterback is has got to be the best competitor on the team hes your leader right that goes for any offense
4665747 teammates will listen to you and be attentive to you in the huddle when you make plays that position is under great pressure and stress you gain their respect by how well you respond to adversity
4665748 as a great competitor and by playing consistently at a high level you command their respect and become a leader thats why leaders come in all shapes sizes and personalities
4665749 we went into camp short on numbers to begin with
4665750 this injury level is normal this has been normal for every camp ive been in
4665751 as long as i can get some reps in practice ill be ok
4665752 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
4665753 i understand where you are coming from but how many real bigfoot researchers are out there trekking 140 000 miles 225 000 kilometres a year
4665754 just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4665755 in my wildest imagination i didnt think they would throw at my players coconut
4665756 its one thing if the ball hit him in the face but it hit the bat first
4665757 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity
4665758 as the commission finds are necessary to diminish eliminate or prevent such burden
4665759 you want people to think well of you dont you
4665760 i know my mother was mad at me i was supposed to go by her house before i left for china but i just didnt want to do that goodbye
4665761 i was trying to stay calm and not think about it and the last thing i wanted to see was her face like its the last time im gonna see you because i know what happened the last time or im gonna have to come see you again like i did the last time i didnt want to go through that whole emotional deal she wouldve got emotional and i wouldve got emotional
4665762 i was trying to take her hand out of my back and she was trying to keep it in
4665763 the two ambulance guys said youre not going to stop us were taking him right now
4665764 i dont remember the first 12 days in the hospital
4665765 all i remember is i got this he fingered a small bump near his mouth because i kept trying to take the ventilator out of my mouth to ask them how eric was and to ask them about aaron smiths then year old son back in dayton
4665766 they the media and track world had basically written her off and were looking for the next up and comer
4665767 thats the only time i was nervous and it wasnt for myself
4665768 to tell her the guy who was killed wasnt me knowing my mom she was probably going berserk
4665769 its a volatile economy that were in with some pretty extreme indicators but were in a solid place here in the midwest and we are the number one renewable energy producing congressional district in america and that means i think something to the people of siouxland
4665770 the pain of grief and the spiral of mourning they refer to the heartbreak at the heart of things griefs contradictions
4665771 i just ran the first 50 meters then i looked around to make sure i was safe and i shut it off
4665772 okay what about the new law that eliminates the provision offering a lesser sentence for honor killings
4665773 it refers to the wrong provision it eliminates the mitgating factor for honor killings as set forth in one article when in fact the reference should be a different article the article they referred to concerns what mitigation means and does not mention honor killings at all
4665774 this is a mistake from the legislature it needs to be fixed
4665775 judge abdul aziz had a case like this he did not apply the law because it refers to the wrong section so even if honor killings are not an excuse under one article they are under another
4665776 the law makes clear that the honor killing excuse is being wiped out thats what should apply
4665777 so the islamist judge keeps the old provision effectively in place because of a drafting error but you wouldnt there is choice in the interpretive process
4665778 no theres a mistake in the law that needs to be fixed
4665779 which leads to confusion thats why it must be fixed
4665780 the owner of the land owns the resources underneath the land and so can be taxed on the wealth
4665781 different state laws but its always the same to the extent that the federal government owns oil it is because they own lots of land underneath which there is oil
4665782 what article number of the tax code makes people taxable
4665783 not sure the number ill look it up but right now its just the principle of it im trying to get across
4665784 i am here to provide you with an analysis and explanation of the international criminal court and its statute
4665785 im not a hanafi abbasid judge im an iraqi judge
4665786 i really hope the program can keep going after the convention
4665787 im going to put this ride in my training log
4665788 le sujet se con oit concevant lobjet quil con oit
4665789 where there is no revelation the people cast off restraint
4665790 but god forbid that i should boast except in the cross of our lord jesus christ by whom the world has been crucified to me and i to the world
4665791 if any of you lacks wisdom let him ask god who gives generously to all without reproach and it will be given him
4665792 for everyone who has been born of god overcomes the world and this is the victory that has overcome the world our faith
4665793 god forbid that i should boast except in the cross of our lord jesus christ
4665794 god has overlooked the times when people did not know him but now he commands all of them everywhere to turn away from their evil ways and repent
4665795 if the spirit of him who raised jesus from the dead dwells in you he who raised christ jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his spirit who dwells in you
4665796 those who are led by gods spirit are gods children
4665797 and having made peace for us by the blood of his cross he brought all things again into a right relationship with him whether in heaven or in earth
4665798 he canceled the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands this he did when he nailed it to the cross
4665799 but god forbid that i should boast except in the cross of our lord jesus christ by whom the world has been crucified to me and i to the world
4665800 for the message about christs death on the cross is nonsense to those who are being lost but for us who are being saved it is gods power
4665801 jews want miracles for proof and greeks look for wisdom
4665802 how far would god go to bring his children back who were lost
4665803 and having made peace for us by the blood of his cross he brought all things again into a right relationship with him whether in heaven or in earth
4665804 but god forbid that i should boast except in the cross of our lord jesus christ by whom the world has been crucified to me and i to the world
4665805 for we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are yet without sin
4665806 christ was without sin but for our sake god had him share our sin in order that with him we might share the righteousness of god
4665807 neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved
4665808 if god were human i could answer him we could go to court to decide our quarrel but there is no one to step between us no one to judge between god and me
4665809 for there is one god and there is one who brings god and human beings together the man christ jesus
4665810 how interesting that the little ant can carry something so much larger than himself
4665811 id had it with the cold weather the passengers and my family
4665812 i wonder what would happen if i just took off for a few days and told no one where i was going
4665813 que no se debe confundir nuestros resultados y nuestra felicidad de poder representar a puerto rico en tan sublime justa deportiva con el conformismo mal social que padecen muchos en nuestra sociedad

4665815 in the interest of the court the parties and judicial economy
4665816 we believe this action takes us one step closer to the end of the legal process and the beginning of construction activities
4665817 her ideas are a rare if not entirely new approach to natural history
4665818 the science of selecting trees for different uses around the world has not been well studied
4665819 the guys made a lot of big plays behind me asdrubal cabrera especially ive told him about it four times since the game ended
4665820 its too early to think of those things but cliff has had as good a year as anybody
4665821 it looked like he lost his feel you turn the page on this hell bounce back
4665822 with the ball in the air i dont know why the guy was running but i thank him for that
4665823 maybe he thought it would drop all i know is that figgins is so fast i had to get off the mound and try to make a play
4665824 i always play hard but with cliff i bear down more because i know he gets groundballs
4665825 any time you have runners in scoring position against him you have to make it count
4665826 unlike the americans they are trained for this as a job the government puts them in a program and they train from when they are little this is their job and everything they need to live is provided for them
4665827 its the biggest one made by wurlitzer and that makes it historic and in a theatre that is historic
4665828 i looked in the mirror and i said why not
4665829 ive paid so far to the music hall 118 182
4665830 sir you looked like youd like to see jack moelmann for free
4665831 i just admire that hes doing this so i think he deserves to get some support

4665838 i believe naples is just a bunch of folks not rich enough for palm beach so therefore avoid and go for the real thing there
4665839 who are either subscribers or are playing in the first 30 days included in the sale of the box
4665840 each condition of metabolic syndrome phenomenon type 2 diabetes and obesity independently raises the risk for erectile dysfunction just on their own
4665841 and so when all are present in combination as part of this syndrome you have a situation where you dont even need to be as diabetic or hypertensive as you might otherwise have to be to experience erectile dysfunction and that fact has been raising concern among clinicians
4665842 statins are used by everyone under the sun and as far as i know theres been no hard evidence that it can be used to treat erectile dysfunction
4665843 on the other hand it may be that it could prevent or modify some of the other for erectile dysfunction
4665844 this is because we do know that an increase in rho kinase leads to heightened tone of the corpus smooth muscle which is one of the causes of erectile dysfunction
4665845 so while i wouldnt go too far with this and i would probably not see statins becoming a primary treatment for erectile dysfunction if these findings turn out to be true then there could perhaps be an additional good use for statins
4665846 part d continues to come in under budget achieve consistently high satisfaction rates and with it millions of americans are living healthier better lives
4665847 most beneficiaries will see a premium increase in their current plan there will be some significant increases
4665848 first there is a trend in prescription drug cost growth generally prices tend to increase because of price increases for existing drugs the growth in the average number of prescriptions per person and the introduction of new drugs
4665849 so they have adjusted their 2009 bids to reflect those higher than anticipated costs
4665850 moreover many medicare beneficiaries will have access to a medicare advantage plan that offers lower prescription drug premiums than a stand alone plan
4665851 we are paying for better outcomes and we are getting higher quality and more value for the medicare dollar
4665852 and these results show that by working in collaboration with the physician groups on new and innovative ways to reimburse for high quality care we are on the right track to find a better way to pay physicians
4665853 no its a complete re model and re construct theyre making it two lanes in each direction
4665854 unexpressed concerns are challenging because they can lead to different expectations and understanding of the problems patients are concerned about and treatment recommendations that are poorly tailored to patient needs
4665855 physicians will have little chance to correct or modify them unfortunately unexpressed concerns may contribute to breakdowns in communication which are frustrating for both physicians and patients
4665856 knowing that older adults frequently dont voice all their concerns should help surgeons create opportunities for patients who are reluctant to bring them up
4665857 yo llore porque no tenia zapatos hasta que vi un nino que no tenia pies
4665858 when i took the last stroke i thought i lost the race there but it turns out that was the difference
4665859 i feel a little bit of everything relief excitement everything
4665860 it means everything to me and i never knew it was going to be like this
4665861 when i took the last stroke i thought i lost the race there but it turns out that was the difference
4665862 i feel a little bit of everything relief excitement everything
4665863 it means everything to me and i never knew it was going to be like this i just got in there and did my best its absolutely amazing i have worked so hard and its paid off
4665864 basically i have the most experience besides dandre who played a lot more than me last year
4665865 but as far as know ing the offense knowing all the positions knowing what guys have to do knowing what the coaches expect thats my role i have to make a lot of plays all the time lead by example and show those guys how it needs to be done
4665866 but now when i look back i see there was a big distance between me and the guys who were playing a lot practices were the games to me those guys played on saturdays i played monday through thursday those were my games thats how i treated it i tried to have just a ton of fun make a lot of plays and i feel like this year the coaches are going to give me an opportunity to go out there and make some plays against some guys who dont wear the same colors as us
4665867 its nice being called the leader trying to go out there and show the guys how to do things and execute what receivers coach charlie baggett coaches us to do
4665868 theyre all game breakers they have the ability when they have the ball in their hands the sky is the limit i think theyre going to be pretty big for us this season
4665869 i did not resign because i was guilty of anything
4665870 i resigned because i was told that was the only way to get a letter that says i didnt do it
4665871 if you werent guilty then why not go through with it if there was no evidence against them then what would it cost what would they have to defend against i would never give up my tenure if i were innocent
4665872 i thought it would exonerate me but we still havent seen it and now i dont think we ever will
4665873 she cleaned rooms in the hospital my wife margaret said she would come home and put her feet in an ice bucket

4665879 she did it all on her own that was the thing that always impressed me most

4665881 i will get about the task as practically as possible to determine whether there is probable cause that violations have occurred
4665882 the probable cause statement speaks for itself there were issues that definitely needed to be looked into
4665883 the doctor who rode out here with us said theyre doing as good as they could possibly be doing
4665884 i cant wait to tell them that i really miss them and i really love them
4665885 the doctor who rode out here with us said theyre doing as good as they could possibly be doing
4665886 they called me and said there was a mission that had to be flown
4665887 i said if they could find the airplane id volunteer my time various people volunteered to buy the fuel they pulled it together i just did all the flying
4665888 it took a lot to get us here a lot of friends a good community theres a good family of people that weve missed here they did everything possible for us while weve been gone and did everything possible to bring us back
4665889 its hard to accept that much love thats all you can do is just accept it and hope that you can someday touch somebody like everybody has touched us

4665891 either kratovil has a short term memory or he is intentionally misleading the voters in the first district
4665892 the reason kratovil is trying to have an extreme makeover in his first ad is because he knows voters in the first district wont embrace his radical liberal washington agenda

4665921 many of the people from the highest reaches of the party told me that they felt theyd made a mistake and they wanted to make it right if they want to win the riding i dont think they couldve gone any other way
4665922 i think the essence of a vibrant national party is you would have to encompass a wide range of views probably one of the worst things is a monolithic party where everybody stands up and nods at the same time and says the same things
4665923 i strongly believe that we have to open up the party to the ordinary people the grassroots and we have to touch a chord if were going to be effective as a national party
4665924 going to have to do something very different than the way its been done if were going to get beyond having a single member from this province

4665930 the recent days have had very good air conditions indeed
4665931 its not that the anti pollution measures did nothing but their effect is a lot smaller than city fathers would like to admit possibly so small we cant detect the difference
4665932 the pollution plumes can be as high as 2 km to 3 km which has a huge impact
4665933 up at that height they can travel across the pacific in three to four days
4665934 how large and how rapid global warming is going to be over the next few decades may depend on how fast we unmask the pollution

4665977 i have been taking acid reflux medication for over five years
4665978 i am at this very moment trying the acv cure for acid reflux i developed reflux symptoms after a greasy meal 3 months ago i dont eat much grease and i guess it was a shock to my system ive been on aciphex for 3 days and today i felt worse than ever i really do not want to take another pill so after reading all the praises of acv and honey im giving it a shot i also have anxiety panic disorder and the aciphex and pain from reflux has made it much worse i bought a bottle of acv 3 weeks ago without reading about mixing it with water and honey i just tried a spoonful of it and couldnt bear the taste so put it away im desperate tonight as its 2 30 in the morning and im in such pain i dont know what else to do i only used about a teaspoon in a cup of water and a big squirt of honey and im sipping it the taste is not great but bearable part of my symptoms are esophageal spasms from my esophagus trying to keep the acid from leaking out and today i have this horrible lump in the back of my throat that feels like a ball of acid ive gotta say i think im feeling a bit better from it i will continue to take it 2 or 3 times a day as well as the apples i just cant take another ppi i sure hope this works thanks so much for offering me some hope of a natural cure
4665979 this is in response to kylie from ft lee nj side effects
4665980 i just began the avc remedy tonight wed july 9th 2008 and immediately its started working i took one table spoon of it straight and then another mixed with water after realizing how intense the sensation and taste of it is its been little less then an hour and its seems to almost be wearing off but its not as bad as it was earlier today hopefully its goes away in the morning when i try it again thanks so much to this website i really believe i found my cure its been over 4 years and im only 17 i will not live with this any longer ill let you know if it works
4665981 renee our 14 year old son also experiences acid reflux
4665982 i guess im one of the first one all the way from tanzania east africa who has appreciated earthclinics efforts
4665983 yesterday i wrote concerning my first time using the apple cider vineger my condition was pretty severe gerd and or acid into my throat and nose area extreme pain and or burning in the lungs i have been dealing with this oondition for years but it has worsened up until yesterday
4665984 i have suffered from acid reflux and a hiatal hernia for over 10 years and have taken prilosec for almost the entire time recently ive heard that prilosec is bad for you so ive been trying different natural remedies i tried the apple cider vinegar and i have to say it was awful not only did it taste terrible but it gave me the worst sudden attack of diarhea ever great remedy if your problem is constipation not so great for acid reflux
4665985 i have to disagree with you about acv because it has been my lifesaver
4665986 i am 27 six foot and weigh 225 acv is amazing i have suffered from acid reflex and allergies my whole life withing 48 hours i felt great go get some now
4665987 i am just going try the acv i have been on priolosec prevacid aciphex protonix etc its really does not work very good so here it goes for me i will let you know the results my first swig of it burned but it onlyu lasted a half hour and my throat started feeling better
4665988 if you are taking ppis and still suffering from acid reflux then you might want to try and increase your dosage i would check with your doctor but i currently take 3 tablets 20mg day of prilosec or prilosec otc i found that this worked the best other ppis cause me to have a bad back and sometimes a stiff neck
4665989 suzanne if you have been on so many ppis and it still hasnt worked please also consult your doctor as you may have more severe problems like a tumor that keeps making acid also im not sure about taking more than 1 ppi pill a day because from my readings i am a medical student if you suppress your acid too much it can actually cause stomach cancer
4665990 i dont quite understand how apple cider vineger even though a low acid but an acid would help anyone i took 1tb with 8oz of water and instantly i got heartburn and it all started coming back up the next morning was even better i had horrible diarrhea for hours i have had severe gerd with tachacardia for over a year as a result of hydrocodone es and robaxin muscle relaxer the recipe for acv with baking soda sounds even worse isnt that what makes the volcano eruptions in the science projects i dont want my stomach to ingest that
4665991 it is unfortunate for us in the non profit community that nearly all philanthropic foundations and businesses with community outreach programs do not support operating expenses and more specifically salaries the only chance an executive director has of getting funding through the majority of philanthropies is to devise a totally new innovative program which will require more hours of work more speeches more research more training and no increase in salary
4665992 in the long run you cant have strong programs in weak organizations
4665993 it is not operating support alone that generates higher ratings of impact in the grantee organization but rather operating support of sufficient size and duration

4666065 add to this the thousands of people whose conditions or treatments may secondarily cause them to be light sensitive and you have a large number of people potentially being isolated in the dark
4666066 it is important that patients with photosensitive skin eruptions are allowed to use lights that dont exacerbate their condition
4666067 it is essential that such patients are able to protect themselves from specific wavelengths of light emitted by fluorescent bulbs especially as they are often trapped indoors because they cant venture out in natural sunlight
4666068 may have been caused by gardasil because the patient received the injection within 30 days of the pregnancy

4666112 many marketing training resources do a solid job at addressing the demographic and psychographic challenges of consumer marketing
4666113 however marketing to a business or government agency requires understanding the special dynamics of the organizational sale branding and positioning are just as critical in b2b marketing as they are in b2c but the techniques and nuances of being effective can be dramatically different
4666114 social media marketing opportunities are developing more rapidly than most organizations realize

4666119 the obsession with northern ireland and particularly policing on the east coast of america was something we identified very quickly as needing to be dealt with
4666120 the work we did in the states for the past six years has been unravelling 35 years of a very one dimensional interpretation of policing the republican agenda and turning that into an accurate description of what policing actually was
4666121 its not the content of the conversation thats important but that the conversation takes place
4666122 there will come a point when speaking to the unspeakable will happen and the role of the police is to create the conditions where people realise this terrorism aint going to work
4666123 an awful lot of people who are so called al qaeda are actually radicalised young disenfranchised british

4666125 we had a previous administration that had internal problems people around town kept asking me to run
4666126 were a community of older folks and people say old folks dont change but many of my supporters were older men
4666127 all the other cities in our area were flourishing and we were seeing ours deteriorate
4666128 women often dont feel like theyre qualified to run they probably are but they need to feel the push of someone asking them to run
4666129 women look more at whats not being said at underlying motivations

4666132 the recent days have had very good air conditions indeed
4666133 its not that the anti pollution measures did nothing but their effect is a lot smaller than city fathers would like to admit possibly so small we cant detect the difference
4666134 the pollution plumes can be as high as 2 km to 3 km which has a huge impact
4666135 up at that height they can travel across the pacific in three to four days
4666136 how large and how rapid global warming is going to be over the next few decades may depend on how fast we unmask the pollution

4666142 we have eight young men arrested the arrests have taken place between thursday night and today they are under custody in connection with these crimes but with no charges so far
4666143 we cannot divulge the charges at this stage it is very sensitive and may put others on their guard so the information we gave is all we can give at this stage

4666145 my daughter loves dogs and here she can see all kinds of breeds
4666146 my dog trainer told me i should bring him for socialization purposes
4666147 these social outings help the dogs not be aggressive as for the owners it makes them feel theyre not the only crazy person who loves dogs
4666148 the other day four young men showed up with one dog
4666149 its just a nice opportunity for people to be able to sit down and relax and bring their dogs with them so they dont stay at home with their dog
4666150 people with pets generally get along very well with other people with pets
4666151 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4666152 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4666153 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4666154 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4666155 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4666156 as a steward of the green industry for over 15 years i have seen many changes in our industry i believe the greatest change has been the rise in professionalism and the focus on the environmental issues such as conversation will be the first all inclusive job site to help bring these professionals together my goal is to offer a safe and secure medium to trade industry thoughts and hire the most qualified individuals in the green golf industry whether your company has five employees and is looking for one more key individual or you have a large company and are looking to hire entire crews is on the brink of great success and i look forward to watching it blossom into something beneficial for everyone involved in the green golf industry

4666169 weve actually had a few people come in today just to cool down
4666170 we in higher education are out there fighting the fight but it is really the students fight
4666171 this is not my problem this is their education at stake ive got mine
4666172 no im not advocating riots or fires or shootings but i do think students should be out protesting and letting the legislators know how unhappy they are about this
4666173 they should do it in a very civil way but they have to do something
4666174 were going to have a good number of people at that meeting
4666175 its a little tougher to do because a lot of people are gone for summer but were making a real effort to get as many students as we can out there
4666176 obviously the governor and the legislature have some tough decisions to make in spreading out the limited resources they have
4666177 but at the end of the day i think students and their individual stories will show how important higher education is in the state and how budget cuts can hurt the future of these students their career goals and the contributions they could make to society
4666178 i think they are a little afraid sometimes to speak out to authority figures but they need to let the governor and the legislators know where they stand
4666179 they are the ultimate customers and the ones most affected its important that the legislature knows how they feel
4666180 years ago a student body president led this big procession of students and they went through two days of comments but it only turned the legislators against them
4666181 i support what the chancellor says but we need to coordinate what we do and it has to be in good taste
4666182 dumping pennies on the capitol lawn is that more for the media i think talking to our state senators and assembly representatives will go a lot further than a media stunt
4666183 thats not to say once the legislature starts meeting that were not going to get people fired up and go down there
4666184 but we have to communicate our message without turning anyone off

4666239 why did you hesitate when i asked you if you think i am thin
4666240 because some people are insulted when you tell them you think they are thin they say why do you think i am too thin
4666241 that is great just out of curiosity do you think i am thin
4666242 why did you say that i am the right weight for your size
4666243 because many times i associate thin as being too skinny thin usually isnt in my vocabulary
4666244 ok i believe you think i am thin but what is your definition of thin
4666245 you cannot go by definition but by the person let me explain in other words lets say a girl by the name of donna is blonde when you look at the definition it doesnt say donna is blond it says blonde is a color same applies to thin rebecca is thin i said you are definitely think absolutely thin i said it about six times again you are absolutely and definitely thin i will repeat it again
4666246 you do tell me all the time i am thin
4666247 i know i did but i told you in different way
4666248 yes you can definitely accept the fact hannah thinks you are thin
4666249 charlene i only saw you sitting down my god you are thin that night charlene called me after she told me the story she asked me if she can accept the fact that josie thinks charlene is thin

4666253 in the 1970s the centers for disease control cdc and american academy of pediatrics aap said children should get 23 doses of 7 vaccines by age 6 the first vaccinations were given at 2 months old today the cdc and aap tell doctors to give children 48 doses of 14 vaccines by age 6 the first vaccination is given at 12 hours old in the newborn nursery at age 2 months a baby can receive 8 vaccines on a single day at age 15 to 18 months a child can receive as many as 12 vaccines on a single day is the atypical manipulation of the immune system with more and more vaccines in early life setting some children up for chronic disease and disability since the 70s cases of asthma diabetes learning disabilities and autism have increased tremendously

4666258 no i did not do that i just did this hitting his palm on the back of his other hand i was angry with gobalakrishnan he called me bodoh stupid so i called him bodoh back whats wrong with that
4666259 gobalakrishnan called me bodoh when i questioned the speaker why should the opposition be given 30 minutes of prime time on television which the government has paid for
4666260 no i never called anyone bodoh i would never make such an unparliamentary remark
4666261 well wars are expensive we just have to recognize that fact

4666270 durante la semana hubo autocr tica del partido con defensa pero como te dije ya quedo atras se hablo al principio de semana ahora lo nico que queda es el planteo para el s bado estamos bien esperando que llegue el partido del s bado para que si dios quiere volver a sumar de a tres para acumular los puntos que necesitamos el pr ximo partido es una final para nosotros los dos equipos tenemos que sumar y bueno el que haga mejor las cosas y sea mas inteligente va a ganar el partido nosotros estamos muy bien ya lo que paso paso esperando ahora lo que viene
4666271 estamos bien mejorando d a tras d a despu s de la derrota del fin de semana pasado yo creo que partido tras partido y entrenamiento tras entrenamiento me voy a ir sintiendo cada d a m s c modo con mis compa eros
4666272 se noto el otro d a que al equipo le falto adaptaci n a la categor a creo que con el correr del campeonato se va ir logrando en el sentido f sico me sent bien pero con bronca porque perdimos y se en lo personal que no tuve un buen partido ahora esperemos que contra all boys poder hacer un buen partido a todos y ganar que ser importante para e l grupo se hizo una buena pr ctica de f tbol y ahora habr que hacerlo dentro de la cancha contra all boys
4666273 muy bien el equipo anduvo muy bien en la practica presionando en todos los sectores de la cancha tranquilo esperando hacer un buen partido sabemos que ser una final y habr que estar a la altura de las circunstancia el otro d a solo hab a hecho tres practicas solamente ahora voy sumando mas d as de conocimiento yo de ellos y ellos a mi me van conociendo espero ayudar al equipo para que este gane para nosotros esto es una final y lo primordial es sumar para mantener la categor a
4666274 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4666275 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4666276 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4666277 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4666278 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4666279 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4666280 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4666281 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4666282 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4666283 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4666284 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4666285 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4666286 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4666287 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

4666290 the olympics certainly cant hurt a companys fortunes its clearly the kind of exposure they dream about with billions of people watching worldwide
4666291 certainly the overexuberant credit cycle went too far which has put us in a bind
4666292 it is as broken as i have ever seen it
4666293 we will look back on this as the most challenging period since the great depression
4666294 there was a massive credit expansion in this country that was run up since 1982 we had the most impressive bull market in financial securities the world has seen we are at the end of that bull market

4666298 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4666299 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4666300 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4666301 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4666302 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4666303 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4666304 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4666305 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4666306 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4666307 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4666308 who are open to doing something on the production side
4666309 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4666310 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4666311 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4666312 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4666313 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4666314 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4666315 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4666316 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4666317 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4666318 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4666319 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4666320 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4666321 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4666322 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4666323 oh yeah if you see jeremy there tell him he has strep throat

4666326 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4666327 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4666328 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4666329 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4666330 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4666331 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4666332 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4666333 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4666334 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4666335 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4666336 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4666337 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4666338 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4666339 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4666340 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4666341 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4666342 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4666343 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4666344 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4666345 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4666346 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4666347 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4666348 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4666349 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4666350 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4666351 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4666352 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4666353 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4666354 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4666355 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4666356 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4666357 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4666358 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4666359 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4666360 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4666361 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4666362 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4666363 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4666364 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4666365 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4666366 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4666367 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4666368 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4666369 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4666370 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4666371 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4666372 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4666373 some boys roll in with there hats pulled down they aint from around here they aint from my town
4666374 if i offer to buy you a drink trust me when i say its non alcoholic you no good to me if you cant even speak
4666375 event 2 0 i met a lot of people that i already knew in real life or virtually and a lot of new faces halfway through the afternoon food was served in the shape of conor oneills atomic chicken wings free drinks were available in the hall courtesy of britvic
4666376 i am not buying the lie that sacrificing the arctic national wildlife refuge and americas coastal waters to oil dilling would make a real difference in gas prices either today or twenty years from today
4666377 with just three percent of the worlds oil reserves our nation doesnt have enough oil to impact the global market or drill our way to lower prices at the pump
4666378 if we have a view of love that has strings attached then it is small l love and is in fact nothing to do with real love

4666402 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4666403 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4666404 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4666405 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4666406 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4666407 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4666408 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4666409 dont look away or go to the bathroom you might miss a goal
4666410 what do you expect youre playing one of the best teams in the world
4666411 its one of the best teams in the world so the guys fought and did everything they can but theres a big gap between these type of clubs and our team at the moment and we hope to close it in many years
4666412 weve got to build an infrastructure what you see with barcelona is they have an infrastructure and thats what needs to be built at red bull

4666415 my goal was to create a sweater simple enough for a beginner to make
4666416 the internet is a profoundly open system and advanced internet users are cautious about either accepting or sending material from and to unknown sources and are careful in releasing information about themselves in any form conceptually the internet challenges us to take greater responsibility for the protection of privacy and security than perhaps we are used to when dealing with the media
4666417 with awareness as your safety net you can minimize the chance of an internet mishap
4666418 social network communities allow more than the public articulation of social networks in each service a user creates a richly detailed personal profile the data in an individuals profile ranges from the relatively innocuous favourite book or movie to the potentially invasive sexual orientation political views photo
4666419 good communication practice on the internet is not something one learns but something one practices so as to teach others less familiar than yourself how it is done
4666420 when you communicate electronically all you see is a computer screen you dont have the opportunity to use facial expressions gestures and tone of voice to communicate your meaning words lonely written words are all youve got
4666421 unless you are using an encryption device hardware or software you should assume that mail on the internet is not secure never put in a mail message anything you would not put on a postcard
4666422 communicating in real time with text enables a form of authoring of the self that is similar to the processes of face to face speech but which is much more amenable to authorial control experimentation and reflection further text based communication carries with it the possibility for multiple differing conversations occurring simultaneously relying on the ability of the human brain to deal with text much better than speech
4666423 threading is what makes discussion groups either usenet news groups or for example this units discussion group accessed from the home page or the learning space page so valuable for enabling complex inter flows of communication to take place in a manner that allows us to see the pattern of conversation and response
4666424 in a learning situation the primary goal of any discussion is to promote thinking web based discussion tools provide many ways to increase discussion between class members and faculty researchers have found that adding threaded discussion areas to a course increases student motivation and participation in class discussions
4666425 it is fundamental that interaction between the student and course content the faculty member and other students contributes to learning
4666426 lots of homeschoolers who are plain weird and not well adjusted at all
4666427 you want that table eh im sorry but ill have to shoot you first
4666428 there was a nice home run during the game wasnt there
4666429 its up to women to break out of these unhealthy traditions and dogmas that lead people down a different path
4666430 someone bumped into me and i just lost it i climbed the stairs and started slashing people
4666431 i thought i was going to die and wanted to take other people with me
4666432 i guess ill lose my visa and get deported if i do that
4666433 well they the same as in tokyo why dont you come up and well hang out
4666434 no man he says man a lot arent they ugly
4666435 my work wasnt going well and i bought the knife after deciding to kill someone i was frustrated i didnt care who i attacked
4666436 there are thousands of people willing to relieve a human of their life in japan why is this there was a time this was not the case
4666437 hey im not part of the ethnic majority so im just going to secede
4666438 it was a hassle being told to study the subjects i liked were ok but i hated the teachers of the subjects i disliked
4666439 her grades were good when she was in elementary school but they fell when she entered junior high school so we told her to study we hadnt mentioned it much recently and i dont know if it was one of the motives
4666440 if we are crazy then it is because we refuse to be crazy in the same way the world has gone crazy whats crazy is a matter of perspective after all what is crazier one person owning the same amount of money as the combined economies of twenty three countries or suggesting that if we shared there would be enough for everyone what is crazier spending billions of dollars on a defense shield or suggesting that we share our billions so we dont need a defense shield what is crazier maintaining arms contracts with 154 countries while asking the world to disarm its weapons or suggesting that we lead the world in disarmament by refusing to deal weapons whats crazy is that the us less than 6 percent of the worlds population consumes half of the worlds resources and that the average american consumes as much as 520 ethiopians do while obesity is declared a national health crisis
4666441 we have an unexpected baby boy do you want him
4666442 if you live each day as if it was your last someday youll most certainly be right
4666443 if today were the last day of my life would i want to do what i am about to do today
4666444 i want to help you have been acting differently around the office everyone has mentioned it
4666445 it was wonderful there were so many beautiful people and the decorations and the ballroom
4666446 there was a girl at the ball who the prince danced with for quite awhile
4666447 she left in a terrible hurry though hes searching for her
4666448 the quorum of the twelve apostles unitedly expresses its heartfelt love and admiration for president gordon b hinckley and the singular life of service he lived he was our prophet our leader our brother and our friend we feel a deep personal loss at his passing
4666449 president hinckley served as an apostle for more than 46 years the last 13 of which were as the senior apostle during his time as prophet and president of the church
4666450 we will miss his wit and his wisdom his leadership and his love
4666451 its not over yet and keep in mind that the weather here can do anything so its not automatically going to be a slower saturday
4666452 its not unusual for the clouds to roll in and the temperature to really cool off here so im not thinking that force cant still run quicker and im not sure that the other guys cant catch us either
4666453 how a team with four dnqs on the season can bounce back like we have and even be in this position to have a shot at the showdown is kind of amazing
4666454 as for the race on sunday i think were safe for the field with the 4 15 but well do our best to step it up a bit on saturday if that can be done once we sort out all of this showdown drama well put that behind us and aim all of our focus on winning rounds on sunday
4666455 you stupid you know what you are gonna do you gonna pay some foolish bucks for somethin insane
4666456 we had a meeting and i said billy youre falling to bits you admitted on tv that youre physically beaten and told me you cant even swim with your daughter
4666457 the work has got harder for billy over the years and he has been a bit slower that is not his fault but he is in his 50s and cant do what he could at 33 or 43
4666458 i love billy but cant have a trainer who has admitted umpteen times that he is physically beaten how can i expect him to be okay for the next 12 weeks while im preparing to fight malignaggi
4666459 there is no way billy could have been on top form and continue training me
4666460 how do i know how hard or correctly im punching when he has needles and cannot feel his hands when were on the pads
4666461 he might say youre hitting hard but i would be thinking how do you know you cant feel your hands
4666462 if he thinks anything of me hell have a good look in the mirror and admit im falling to bits im physically done
4666463 i dont want to hear from my trainer who is taking so much medication to ease the pain dont worry rick ill get through this training session
4666464 it is me who needs to get through sessions because im the one taking the punches
4666465 maybe i should have realised bily was struggling a couple of fights ago but ive put it off and put it off
4666466 billy thinks other people have conspired for him to leave but i am the boss and make the final decisions
4666467 there are some fights you cannot wait to see and this is one of them ill be at ringside on oct 3
4666468 please doctors you have to tell me what is going on
4666469 dont lie to me rayna you always were a bad liar
4666470 i am sorry to have to say this but i overheard your doctors saying something about dreading having to tell our parents the news it sounds like bad news maya im sorry
4666471 would you like to be alone i can leave if you want
4666472 what if his memory never returns to him what if he never wakes up what if elena was telling the truth
4666473 mrs alekseev we have been through this already i told you before that there is no way for anyone here to know what the chances are he could wake up now or never wake up at all we just dont know
4666474 i bet the man has never lost someone close to him before or he wouldnt act the way he does
4666475 hello maam are you all right can i get you anything
4666476 i saw you were upset and just thought id ask if you needed anything
4666477 oh im sorry its just that i have been here everyday for the past three weeks and not once has anyone here said a kind word to me
4666478 i have noticed that myself everyone here doesnt seem to be very friendly
4666479 well at least you are my name is anna aarden my granddaughter has n stage cancer i have been here with her everyday she seemed to have been getting better but today she took a turn for the worst theyre with her now they said it wont be long til
4666480 no i dont know who her father is he took off when she was born and her mother died of cancer a few years ago my husband also died of cancer seven years ago ive been with her alone i just cant believe i am going to lose another one to cancer i just dont understand what i did to deserve this everyone i love keeps dying its not fair
4666481 i know that feeling someone tried to kill my daughter a few days ago i almost lost her and now my husband has been in a terrible accident and is in a coma its almost too much for me to handle i know it doesnt compare to what youve gone through but i just want you to know that i am here if you ever want someone to talk to i know we just met but we can learn from each other be each others friend obviously no one else around here will be
4666482 thank you dear you dont know what that means to me im sorry about your husband and daughter i hope they will be all right
4666483 youth sports are not inherently either character building or harmful it is the way we organize and structure these competitions that has the greatest influence on children
4666484 where we see harsh discipline or abuse in boys lives we see boys who struggle with shame self hatred and anger
4666485 second place by one tenth of a second means you lost and dont belong on this team
4666486 70 of the 20 million american kids in organized sports some starting at 4 will quit before the age of 13
4666487 rick put his other interests aside and continued to play organized sports as his father dictated but his resentment toward his father grew and by junior high he was a strong fast angry boy with a quick temper
4666488 good discipline contains a boy and his energy providing the sense of physical and emotional security he needs in order to learn the larger lessons of self control and moral behavior
4666489 good discipline is consistent it provides clear and well reasoned expectations and firm compassionate guidance by adults who model the same standards and behavior in their daily interactions
4666490 discipline is what would have altered this unpleasant demeanor and attitude that many of us had hanging over us during the basketball season
4666491 my dad was super strict he was especially hard on me he was always kind of verbally abusive and in my face when i was not improving or playing to the potential he knew i was capable of it is what made my participation in some sports so short his intensity
4666492 sports at the lower levels are just simply overdone it is not that important how well you do just that you did the most and the best you could do
4666493 once again the powers of the herb open up the mind seek deep inside tell me what you find come on come on come on
4666494 im sorry my little boy was so noisy during mass
4666495 when i was rolling out i saw the blitz coming off so i was trying to set up quick as soon as i snatched my arm back the ball just slipped out of my hands
4666496 step down and sit again as you touched the menu before sitting
4666497 high risk sex offender kyle hammond used to be north dakotas responsiblity to keep tabs on

4666499 the respect for liverpool fans and for the people that work with him on a daily basis
4666500 buy me and wear me even though everyone else in the world is here and also buying me
4666501 but i dont want to talk to you i didnt stay around it was a gentlemens club
4666502 the twin cities has until about two years ago really had no high end hotels
4666503 one of the strong reasons for the high end hotels is that the buildings that they renovated are expensive buildings
4666504 theyre still lower than chicago but theyre getting more in line at least theyre attempting to get more in line
4666505 we can attribute a lot of it to target targets a huge they bring in a lot of people
4666506 i think time will tell right now our occupancy rates are fine
4666507 i dont think theres plan for us to do anything in the future
4666508 i dont know how clear the crystal ball is theyll make money whether they make a profit it remains to be seen
4666509 randomly decided to look at who made the default avatar stuff i was born with skin eyes and lashes were made by creator of sin skins portia sin body by ryan linden shoes and earrings by lyra muse last call hair by kin keiko outfit by torrid midnight torridwear

4666511 her favorite song will say more about her than her mouth ever will
4666512 a significant part of georgian territory remains under foreign military occupation never ever will georgia reconcile itself with the occupation of even one square kilometre of its territory
4666513 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4666514 if someone continues to attack our citizens our peacekeepers then of course we will answer just as we did
4666515 russia as guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region will make the decision which unambiguously supports the will of these two caucasus peoples
4666516 unfortunately today we are looking evil directly in the eye and today this evil is very dangerous for everybody not only for us
4666517 we told the world this is about starting an invasion we screamed to the world stop it
4666518 and the definition of an international mechanism which will be charged with overseeing the implementation of the agreement on the ground
4666519 we have left the timing open and we have said they could be made members if they want this and that position remains
4666520 we have left the timing open and we have said they could be made members if they want this and that position remains
4666521 all these could have been prevented we were screaming shouting to the world that russia was going to do it
4666522 we have left the timing open and we have said they could be made members if they want this and that position remains
4666523 she has withdrawn from the olympics and will not be traveling to beijing
4666524 i was shocked at the end it was kind of a little bit of a delayed reaction
4666525 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i had lost the race right there but i guess that was the difference in the end
4666526 i was starting to hurt for the last 10 metres it was my last individual race and i just wanted to finish as strong as i could
4666527 the storm is over waters of marginal warmth about 27 c a degree above the threshold of 26 c needed to sustain a tropical storm

4666529 he violated the conditions of his stay by not extending his tourist visa for more than three years and for engaging in gainful employment without the required work permit and visa
4666530 we also seized several documents proving that he is indeed in the companys employ as its business development officer
4666531 we are indebted to the physicians and caregivers at peking union medical college hospital who have done such a wonderful job providing barbara with the medical care she needed
4666532 we are also extremely appreciative of the support we have received from people here in beijing the united states new zealand and around the world the prayers and support have been a source of strength for our family during this difficult time

4666552 your call cannot be completed as dialed please check the number and dial again
4666553 that old thing i found it in the river that runs across my land there are hundreds of them why what is so important about it
4666554 after speaking to joel and hearing of his heartbreaking long wait to see doctors i just knew that i couldnt leave without securing him the treatment he so desperately needed so i worked with local doctors to get him all the help they could offer
4666555 joels problems were a very severe facial deformity as a result of a tumour growing in the middle of his face which was steadily growing twisting and rotating his face through approximately 90 degrees and pushing his eye sideways and outwards several centimetres
4666556 joels face was transformed in one major procedure and although the minor bruising around joels eye may take a while to completely resolve the transformation after his surgery is incredible
4666557 he can now look forward to a future that until now was destined to be bleak
4666558 he is the most fabulous little boy full of life smiles and bubbly enthusiasm
4666559 he will live life to the full whatever is thrown at him and is just absolutely charming he is very bright and has learnt remarkably good english very quickly
4666560 it has been a real pleasure to be able to help
4666561 i am so happy to be alive and that everything went so well im looking forward to going home and will work hard and study to become a doctor so that i can help people also
4666562 i see such a wonderful change in joel and only god can know how happy i am for having the opportunity for joel to come to london for his surgery
4666563 i do not have words to thank lisa bryer the surgeons and everyone at facing the world
4666564 joel is a delight it is not often that you are privileged to meet someone who lights up every room that he walks into and to have had the opportunity to give him a future that he always deserved has been an honour
4666565 while our results were not unexpected they do point to intriguing potential mechanisms to explain the gender differences in asthma incidence and severity
4666566 especially intriguing is that the differences in gender begin at the time of transition into early puberty
4666567 we know that asthma prevalence is higher among boys than girls but that the condition later in life is more prevalent in women than men
4666568 this study is particularly exciting as it provides an insight into the mechanisms involved in asthma development during the transition period between childhood and adulthood demonstrating how we can influence these processes and develop new targeted therapies
4666569 hormones can play a key role in influencing asthma symptoms and severity suggesting that gender is an important factor in asthma development
4666570 yeah yeah wassup this is jordan im not at the crib right now but if you leave your name and number i might back the square and page you 888 555 2620 wanna get the hit ill hit you bring it live

4666574 as a communion we are going to continue to be in grave peril
4666575 were happy to report that all of our shipping centers are resuming normal operations after experiencing three days of significant issues
4666576 throughout the night and as we post this update our distribution centers are processing customer orders and getting them into the mail if a member should have been shipped a disc tuesday wednesday or thursday with rare exception it will ship today friday
4666577 taking aggressive steps to fully understand the root cause of this weeks problems and safeguard against issues like these in the future
4666578 the heart has its reasons of which reason knows nothing
4666579 subscription games like ultima online and everquest have even more at risk because a loss of players is directly linked to a loss of income theyve had to make catching cheaters a priority right from the start but they also have the advantage of controlling the servers the game is played on when a problem is discovered its relatively easy to make changes and or ban the culprits todays mmorpgs operate under the watchful eye of large contingents of game masters and its still impossible to ensure that there are no shenanigans going on the most one can hope for is that the shenanigans will be discovered and correctly quickly
4666580 the good news is that cheating has become significantly more difficult in recent years not only have game developers found better ways to secure their products third party software has also made large advances in sniffing out and banning cheaters
4666581 at the end of the day its a lot more satisfying to win while following the rules than it is to win using some cheap hack or exploit so if youre here looking for ways to cheat in online games i hope ive given you some reasons to reconsider
4666582 all characters wear a single costume which does not change over the course of the game the only exception is when characters dress up in enemy uniforms to infiltrate their base
4666583 any characters costume no matter how skimpy complicated or simply outlandish is always completely suitable to wear when climbing around in caves hiking across the desert and slogging through the sewers it will continue to be completely suitable right afterwards when said character goes to meet the king
4666584 i would not be surprised if some ethnic minorities in china were offended by this but they are also accustomed to it
4666585 in the west we are obsessed with authenticity in such matters but its different in china id guess many chinese would not have a problem with it
4666586 i see nothing wrong exactly with where the children are from it is a tradition in china in terms of giving a performance
4666587 if youve done something right no one will know that youve done anything at all
4666588 when you send one message to twitter and we send it to ten followers you arent charged ten times thats because weve been footing the bill
4666589 we took a risk hoping to bring more nations onboard and more mobile operators around to our way of thinking but weve arrived at a point where the responsible thing to do is slow our costs and take a different approach
4666590 weve all also worked carefully in crafting the principles implementation guidelines and accountability and learning framework to be sure this isnt a code pointing at or strictly about china
4666591 this is much broader as it should be we are in agreement across companies and human rights organizations that this initiative will be global in scope
4666592 supongo que fue una gran ayuda siempre haber cre do que pod a hacerlo
4666593 hab a ciertas dudas especialmente desde ayer en la clasificaci n eliminatoria porque no le fue tambi n logr por supuesto su pase a esta final pero no lo hizo con una buena actuaci n
4666594 l dec a en ese momento de que se trataba de que reci n acababa de recibir una medalla ten a que otra vez cambiarse de ropa volver a ponerse su traje de ba o y lanzarse a la piscina no le dio tiempo para prepararse lo suficiente mentalmente esta vez s le bast y logr aunque sea por una cent sima el s ptimo oro
4666595 lo que hiciste esta noche fue algo pico y fue pico para que lo viera el mundo entero
4666596 i was running from georgian troops i want to thank the russian troops
4666597 of this group the vast majority constitute arab or muslim states
4666598 since islam prohibits proselytism by other religions foreign religious workers will in effect be denied entry to conduct religious work
4666599 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation
4666600 the mere fact that rabbis would be openly invited to the kingdom a country where in principle jews are not permitted to visit would have constituted a turning point
4666601 this gives us a better picture of what countries discriminate against us based on religion
4666602 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4666603 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4666604 liberals are more self centered than conservatives conservatives are more generous and charitable than liberals liberals are more envious and less hardworking than conservatives conservatives value truth more than liberals and are less prone to cheating and lying liberals are more angry than conservatives conservatives are actually more knowledgeable than liberals liberals are more dissatisfied and unhappy than conservatives
4666605 held on 260 000 00 bond on charges including cocaine possession attempt to sell cocaine and traffic charges
4666606 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4666607 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4666608 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4666609 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4666610 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4666611 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4666612 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4666613 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4666614 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4666615 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be
4666616 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4666617 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet
4666618 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
4666619 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4666620 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4666621 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4666622 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4666623 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4666624 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4666625 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4666626 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4666627 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4666628 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4666629 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4666630 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4666631 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4666632 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4666633 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4666634 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4666635 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4666636 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4666637 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4666638 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4666639 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4666640 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4666641 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4666642 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4666643 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4666644 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
4666645 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
4666646 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
4666647 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
4666648 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
4666649 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
4666650 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
4666651 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4666652 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
4666653 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4666654 en amerikansk invasion av kina skulle ju ge en miljard kineser demokrati
4666655 ive lent my crystal ball to someone so i cant give you the figure
4666656 ik geloofde continu in onze kansen zeker met een toekomstig toptien speler als partner
4666657 het was niet bijzonder maar wel goed op de laatste 25 meter moet ik nog versnellen en ook de finish moet beter
4666658 ik ben trots op mezelf hoe ik hier uit ben gekomen morgen ga ik nog een keer knallen
4666659 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4666660 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4666661 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4666662 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4666663 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4666664 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4666665 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4666666 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4666667 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4666668 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4666669 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4666670 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4666671 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4666672 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4666673 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4666674 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4666675 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4666676 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4666677 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4666678 recycling is recycling glass should be included its not about making money its about making difference
4666679 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4666680 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4666681 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4666682 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4666683 these robotic policemen wiped out all of cambridge in one day of carnage what have you got to say about that
4666684 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4666685 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4666686 bridges to nowhere than the one in alaska and there are more builders of such bridges than those built by alaskas defendant senator
4666687 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4666688 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4666689 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4666690 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4666691 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4666692 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4666693 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4666694 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4666695 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4666696 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4666697 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4666698 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4666699 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4666700 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4666701 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4666702 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4666703 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4666704 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4666705 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4666706 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4666707 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4666708 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4666709 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4666710 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4666711 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4666712 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4666713 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4666714 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4666715 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4666716 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4666717 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4666718 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4666719 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4666720 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4666721 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4666722 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4666723 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4666724 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4666725 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4666726 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4666727 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4666728 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4666729 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4666730 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4666731 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4666732 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4666733 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4666734 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4666735 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4666736 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4666737 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4666738 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4666739 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4666740 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
4666741 as this thing gets rolling the newness will wear off and it gets down to playing and ill keep saying this im here for one reason and thats to help this team win no other reason
4666742 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys
4666743 its definitely cool to play a hall of fame quarterback it will be interesting getting out there with the gunslinger
4666744 its cool that a preseason game has more hype its going to be intense its going to be a big game up there
4666745 thats up to the medical staff i feel good right now and i practiced today so well see
4666746 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4666747 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4666748 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
4666749 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
4666750 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
4666751 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4666752 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4666753 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4666754 you could win 5 000 000 shoppers optimum points purchase 25 of participating products using for sdm optimum card between aug 9 and sept 5th 2008
4666755 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4666756 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4666757 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4666758 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4666759 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4666760 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4666761 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4666762 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4666763 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4666764 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
4666765 this year we hope to grow on the success of 2007s event and bring the innovative and oftentimes
4666766 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4666767 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4666768 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4666769 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4666770 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4666771 just so you all know we did set a record
4666772 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4666773 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4666774 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4666775 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4666776 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4666777 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4666778 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4666779 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4666780 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4666781 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4666782 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4666783 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4666784 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4666785 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4666786 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4666787 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4666788 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4666789 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4666790 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4666791 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4666792 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4666793 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4666794 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
4666795 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
4666796 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
4666797 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
4666798 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4666799 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4666800 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4666801 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4666802 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4666803 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4666804 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4666805 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4666806 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4666807 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4666808 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4666809 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4666810 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4666811 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4666812 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4666813 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4666814 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4666815 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
4666816 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4666817 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4666818 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4666819 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4666820 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4666821 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4666822 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4666823 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4666824 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4666825 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4666826 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4666827 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4666828 this is expected to take place within the next few weeks on completion of final processing of the document
4666829 kipi polis acknowledging security code sent by federation vessel uss amazon welcome lynden its been a while since youve last visited how have you been

4666832 if you dont mind me asking why are you here are you going to take him off our hands
4666833 i cant tell you why im here hon but a partial answer to your other question is could be
4666834 okay ill stop being nosy then are you ready to send your sim down the link
4666835 shit the old heretic does have a little imagination left
4666836 whatsa matter mon vulcan women come in heat every seven years too ya know how dya think they gets little vulcans
4666837 but i have something serious to talk to you about
4666838 okay okay sorry liss hon we have to finish this later head back to the bungalo and ill be there in a few
4666839 now that you spoiled my afternoon workout come over give your ol grampa a hug and spill yer guts
4666840 chuck gramps im in deep with something even i cant control i had to accept a mission that could possibly endanger all of the present societies in the galaxy
4666841 and it has to be something really big and nasty that can spook an ex supersoldier like lynden even being a toned down augment shouldnt do this to him
4666842 so what did you get drafted for whats the big bad thing you have to dig out is it for star fleet section 31 or for the time travel division whats put the fear of god into an augment that he has to come to his poor old retired posthuman grampa for a visit
4666843 i was brought into the central chamber of the federation council two weeks ago only it wasnt with the full council there was only nine members mostly original races that signed the original charter human vulcan tellerite andorian orion and centaurian they were all in star fleet uniforms but there was also a rihannsu tklingon and cardasian sitting with them it was all so weird all of them sitting there staring at me
4666844 the human admiral brecker was his name was the only one to spoke to me he goes into detail about who and what i am he gives me my life story word for word he didnt miss a thing chuck not a stinking thing
4666845 of course star fleet knew i had a nanobot neural net throughout my nervous system but they thought it was of recent nanite design put into my body during the dominion war after my ship the
4666846 you are ordered to starbase 600 and report to admiral hailey there you will oversee a refit of a galaxy class starship and receive your final orders
4666847 you said there were nine of them lynden how were they seated and how did they
4666848 they were all seated on a dias overlooking the council chamber
4666849 come to think of it that admiral didnt move his lips at all chuck i dont know how he got that past me but he mustve held me in a telepathic trance that explains how he knew all about me
4666850 how was he able to do that gramps wouldnt my own transhuman abilities detect that
4666851 no my boy your abilities are no match for them you were in the company of beings that have a billion and a half years of evolution on us you were looking at our ancestors the progenitors the vestiges of the domain the jury of nine itself
4666852 but they were alpha quadrant humanoids chuck how could they
4666853 theyre non corporeal beings like the organians arent they they simply took over the bodies of these people didnt they
4666854 how do you know about this jury of nine chuck youve had dealings with them before havent you what happened you had to do a job for them too didnt you
4666855 i was doing my second stint in the corps the
4666856 anyway when you were fighting colonel green and his anti artificial intelligence army in malaysia i was a warrant officer on a mission with a colonel and captain investigating an object that had entered the solar system
4666857 i really thought that was the end of the domain and the jury of nine obviously i was mistaken once again my past catches up with me this time involving people i love it never fucking ends
4666858 so what happened to that jupiter brain remnant was it destroyed when you betrayed the domain or did it escape
4666859 i recruited some like minded friends of mine and we made another deal with the kipi if we found them another power source that could provide energy for another billion years they would take us in and let us redo the programming in the computronium to suit our tastes so we rigged up an outsized tesla carr drive and searched for a long lived singularity small enough to be non descript but powerful enough to relight this joint et voila remodelled ancient white dwarf complete with reprogrammed computronium you cant get any better than that sonny
4666860 see if that man was going for a pee right now everyone could see him
4666861 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4666862 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4666863 who discovered what is known as precession of the equinoxes and in their calculation such an occurrence takes place every 25 827 years our modern science after labour of hundreds of years has simply proved them to be correct
4666864 instead of keeping their promise to drain the swamp of corruption in washington house democrats are sinking in it chairman rangels own public admissions about his conduct make clear that his sweetheart deals violate house rules as well as state and federal laws
4666865 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4666866 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4666867 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4666868 no va a suceder si van a la games convention por eso quedar n decepcionados
4666869 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers

4666874 i am not sure thats the right question isnt public education working quite well
4666875 youve done well in school heres a chance to continue and become something
4666876 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4666877 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4666878 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4666879 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4666880 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4666881 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4666882 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4666883 it is a large business and a large responsibility and youve got to have capable and qualified people
4666884 you get back to old adage you get what you pay for we cannot afford to not get proper legal advice
4666885 stfu no one reads your third garde mentality on this board you should shut your piehole and get liberal and prouds cock out of your mouth
4666886 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means
4666887 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south
4666888 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
4666889 who is this mark spitz guy and why does everybody keep asking me about him
4666890 i was just hoping i was winning and hoping i could get my hand to the wall first
4666891 i was in the awards ceremony for the 200 fly when i started thinking about it and thats when i started tearing up

4666901 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4666902 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4666903 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables

4666912 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender

4666921 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4666922 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4666923 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4666924 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4666925 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4666926 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4666927 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4666928 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4666929 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4666930 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4666931 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4666932 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4666933 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4666934 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4666935 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4666936 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4666937 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4666938 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4666939 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4666940 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4666941 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4666942 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4666943 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4666944 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
4666945 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4666946 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4666947 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
4666948 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4666949 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4666950 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
4666951 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4666952 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4666953 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4666954 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4666955 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4666956 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4666957 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4666958 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4666959 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4666960 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4666961 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4666962 its mainly for men who are exhausted by the summer heat

4666968 the tuesday before the thursday you and she and the therapy person would meet and in which shed say she had a sense the boys never knew where they were supposed to be and when while they were with you
4666969 i can see how it might happen after all there are three children and its hard to keep track of everything everybodys got going on she likely confused another childs activity with the youngests
4666970 but the other two have nothing going on right now no sports no activities
4666971 hey does she still complain about the way you tie your shoes

4666986 fellow reptiles i do not hesitate to tell you that we face grave problems i do not hesitate to tell you that we have the answer size is the answer increase size there are those who say that size is not the answer there are those even propose that we pollute our reptilian strain with mammalian amalgamations and cross breading and i say to you if the only way i could survive was by mating with egg eating rats then i would choose not to survive but we will survive we will increase both in size and in numbers and we will continue to dominate this planet as we have done for 300 million years bigger is better and biggest is best
4666987 he wasnt tapped on the shoulder i dont wish to speculate on what was said and what was discussed but hed finished his event hes an olympian hes part of the team
4666988 we discovered it as a result of a radio report
4666989 it would certainly appear that the sport knew nothing about it
4666990 we cannot independently ascertain whether someone is facing a criminal charge if they are not prepared to provide that information
4666991 if youre not a party to the proceedings you cant get that information
4666992 its not possible or feasible for the aoc say in future teams to do some search in some database to be able to verify these matters
4666993 so were dependent upon the athlete signing the agreement disclosing that information and or the federation if theyre aware of it
4666994 i was a bit nervous before the race but it was my best race ever my dream was to be an olympic champion and that is now realised

4667008 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4667009 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4667010 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4667011 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4667012 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4667013 by ones and twos almost spontaneously and without orders the men got to their feet and with a kind of universal anger moved toward the enemy position bitter hand to hand combat ensued as the americans fought from one fortified position to the next finally the enemy broke in disorder
4667014 with deep sincerity and utmost appreciation for the gallant fight to effect our rescue after wed been isolated for seven days
4667015 fought with gallantry and intrepidity when his unit was pinned down by grazing fire from the enemys strong mountain defense and command of the squad devolved on him with the wounding of its regular leader
4667016 withdrawing under murderous fire and showers of grenades from other enemy emplacements he had nearly reached a shell crater occupied by two of his men when an unexploded grenade bounced on his helmet and rolled toward his helpless comrades he arose into the withering fire dived for the missile and smothered its blast with his body
4667017 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4667018 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4667019 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4667020 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4667021 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4667022 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4667023 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4667024 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4667025 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4667026 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4667027 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4667028 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4667029 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4667030 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4667031 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4667032 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4667033 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4667034 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4667035 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4667036 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4667037 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4667038 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4667039 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4667040 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4667041 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4667042 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4667043 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4667044 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4667045 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4667046 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4667047 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4667048 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4667049 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4667050 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4667051 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4667052 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4667053 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4667054 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4667055 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4667056 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4667057 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4667058 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4667059 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4667060 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4667061 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4667062 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4667063 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4667064 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4667065 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4667066 m not looking for a booty call or a one night stand or friends with benefits
4667067 we have not done a good job of engaging you or the public at large in our project
4667068 i believe dialogue will lead us to a better understanding of the issues and solutions
4667069 were concerned that money is being diverted from cleanup to operations
4667070 we think they should take care of the problems now
4667071 there is no one on our board taking a short term view of this
4667072 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4667073 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4667074 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4667075 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4667076 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4667077 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4667078 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4667079 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4667080 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4667081 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4667082 should act now to renew the extended warranty on its car
4667083 i wouldnt come here at night by myself thats for sure

4667085 you never change things by fighting the existing reality to change something build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete

4667087 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4667088 the deployment of new anti missile forces has as its aim the russian federation
4667089 we told the world this is about starting an invasion
4667090 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and the future of south ossetia this is about getting russian troops out
4667091 this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4667092 in no way is the us presidents plan for missile defence aimed at russia
4667093 the purpose of missile defence is to protect our european allies from any rogue threats
4667094 an impressive stg 195 000 250 000 due almost entirely to the magnificent work of friends of sinn fein usa
4667095 a major impact on this was the decision of all our ministers to donate their ministerial salaries to the party
4667096 a political party needs an income in order to cover its expenditures the general public understand that fundraising and donations are part and parcel of generating that income
4667097 where cynicism starts to creep in is when it is perceived that political parties are not open and transparent about their financial affairs
4667098 the primary source of donations to sinn fein in the south comes from each of the partys tds and mep who each donated 6 000 and of the norths twenty seven mlas who donated 5 787

4667114 well now they wont have to change schools every year
4667115 kids would spit at me pull my hair throw books on my head and call me names
4667116 my dad would beat up my mum and i she left him to protect us
4667117 i would hide near the book shelf at the back of the classroom during recess to prevent the white kids from bullying me
4667118 but the teachers would pull me out to join the rest they didnt understand
4667119 people would drive by and throw beer bottles at us
4667120 when i walked down the street people would give a mean stare and restaurants would reject us i felt unwanted
4667121 i kept asking why did people hate me is it just because im brown
4667122 and told me to be proud of who i am a native american
4667123 they called you names because they are jealous that our ancestors were the first to step on the soil of america and because we have our own land
4667124 the non reservation indians have been subjected to the wrath of a confused non indian population which believes that all maine indians will be on easy street as the result of the suit
4667125 i was so relieved to leave i hated the place
4667126 i wouldnt want to return to a place where i felt unwelcomed
4667127 they were basically saying come join us you are one of us too
4667128 the new generation of americans has become more accepting of different races
4667129 being welcomed back was the best experience in my life
4667130 their actions were like a way of apologizing for what they have done to my community 23 years ago
4667131 a lot of patients wont go out because they are embarrassed by those movements
4667132 suppressing those movements means a lot to people with huntingtons disease
4667133 for the first time there is a treatment that can help patients with this disease gain some quality of life
4667134 after speaking to joel and hearing of his heartbreaking long wait to see doctors i just knew that i couldnt leave without securing him the treatment he so desperately needed so i worked with local doctors to get him all the help they could offer
4667135 joels problems were a very severe facial deformity as a result of a tumour growing in the middle of his face which was steadily growing twisting and rotating his face through approximately 90 degrees and pushing his eye sideways and outwards several centimetres
4667136 joels face was transformed in one major procedure and although the minor bruising around joels eye may take a while to completely resolve the transformation after his surgery is incredible
4667137 he can now look forward to a future that until now was destined to be bleak
4667138 he is the most fabulous little boy full of life smiles and bubbly enthusiasm
4667139 he will live life to the full whatever is thrown at him and is just absolutely charming he is very bright and has learnt remarkably good english very quickly
4667140 it has been a real pleasure to be able to help
4667141 i am so happy to be alive and that everything went so well im looking forward to going home and will work hard and study to become a doctor so that i can help people also
4667142 i see such a wonderful change in joel and only god can know how happy i am for having the opportunity for joel to come to london for his surgery
4667143 i do not have words to thank lisa bryer the surgeons and everyone at facing the world
4667144 joel is a delight it is not often that you are privileged to meet someone who lights up every room that he walks into and to have had the opportunity to give him a future that he always deserved has been an honour
4667145 while our results were not unexpected they do point to intriguing potential mechanisms to explain the gender differences in asthma incidence and severity
4667146 especially intriguing is that the differences in gender begin at the time of transition into early puberty
4667147 we know that asthma prevalence is higher among boys than girls but that the condition later in life is more prevalent in women than men
4667148 this study is particularly exciting as it provides an insight into the mechanisms involved in asthma development during the transition period between childhood and adulthood demonstrating how we can influence these processes and develop new targeted therapies

4667173 the prestige of government has undoubtedly been lowered considerably by the prohibition law for nothing is more destructive of respect for the government and the law of the land than passing laws which cannot be enforced it is an open secret that the dangerous increase of crime in this country is closely connected with this

4667216 councils would step in to deal with an under nourished and neglected child so should a case with a morbidly obese child be different
4667217 if parents consistently place their children at risk through bad diet and lack of exercise is it right that a council should step in to keep the childs health under review
4667218 there needs to be a national debate about the extent to which it is acceptable for local authorities to take action in cases where the welfare of children is in real jeopardy
4667219 the nations expanding waistline threatens to have a devastating impact on our public services its a massive issue for public health but it also risks placing an unprecedented amount of pressure on council services
4667220 obesity is increasingly costing the council taxpayer dear it falls to social services to care for the house bound obese adults to invest money in encouraging people to be active and to replace school furniture that is just too small for larger pupils

4667227 you know in the old days we used to talk about a virus and a computer got infected
4667228 and even the ones that spread very quickly you know the i love you virus the melissa virus and what not they spread very quickly and that was part of their intent as the author wanted to gain fame and recognition these guys dont want fame and recognition
4667229 you have a worldwide media and you have the funding of organized crime to really turn this into big business instead of just a small onesy and twosy operation
4667230 they dont have to be extremely efficient they just have to pump out lots and lots of emails thats why the spam volume is so huge

4667237 two years ago we needed an album with a slightly different approach and an expensive producer just to find out how that sort of thing works
4667238 it was the right album at the time but now we have returned to our typical trademarks
4667239 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4667240 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4667241 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4667242 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4667243 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4667244 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4667245 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4667256 i had to wake up at 6 a m this morning which was not fun considering i had been up until 3 a m watching the opening ceremony and hanging out at destination again
4667257 i have to say that it got busy very late i am officially too old for bars that close at 5 a m
4667258 it is a sizeable club very pleasant staff which is not a given in every gay bar
4667259 not many black people about in beijing outside of the athletes
4667260 so far we have seen more foreign visitors coming to destination
4667261 we had a large crowd on the dance floor on aug 9 saturday the highlight of the night was most of them singing along to the chorus of ymca when i played this oldie towards the end of my set
4667262 there are many new regulations on security such as internet censorship travel migrant workers in beijing
4667263 we have to be careful with our work to avoid intriguing safety concerns
4667264 most lgbt groups particularly those in beijing and surrounding areas have completely suspended their work during the olympic period partly because of logistic reasons transportation problems etc partly because the beijing public security has become hysterical and closed down many entertainment venues gay or otherwise
4667265 since many of these groups work consists mainly of conducting outreach at these venues it effectively made it impossible for them to continue
4667266 together for hiv and aids prevention a toolkit for the sports community
4667267 in recent years the government has made a lot of effort to involve the lgbt community in the fight against hiv aids toward that end the health branch of the government approves of lgbt work and has good relationship with us as well
4667268 i think we need to alert our friends here about two relatively recent developments in china because both are partly the result of u s exports and we need everyones help to stop them
4667269 many of the religious fringe elements having been kept at bay in the u s by the lgbt community are seeing china as a new territory
4667270 theres been a huge surge of various religious extremist groups entering in to china
4667271 many religious conservatives from the west mainly the u s go to china as mental health experts and continue to spread lies
4667272 in the past two years aibai has twice organized activists in successfully defeating two events billed as seminars or conferences on sexuality while in reality they were venues for reparative therapy proponents to spread their misinformation
4667273 although in different continents and social cultural and political environments we find many things in common between lgbt people in the u s and in china the oppression from the mainstream society towards sexual minorities and the struggles lgbt people go through
4667274 we are inspired by many stories in the history of the lgbt movement in the states the courage and the dedication of lgbt individuals to make social change we hope to do the same
4667275 in places like el salvador the dominican republic and south america i saw churches come together to bring the gospel to people in their communities
4667276 and i thought why cant we do this in our own backyard
4667277 this is crawl before you walk before you run event
4667278 from the meetings we launched the idea to do something beyond our churches four walls
4667279 this event moves us beyond that barrier we value each others churches and we feel we ought to come together there is a lot of spiritual history here in the valley but a lot of it is separate
4667280 the first thing i heard about jerry was his preaching in the french quarter of new orleans la during mardi gras
4667281 a lot of the crowd there was hostile but that didnt seem to faze him i think he has a message for the people of this area
4667282 this crusade will bear fruit but its just the beginning
4667283 its overlooking our denominational distinctions and laying aside non essentials for the essential which is jesus christ
4667284 our desire is to pull everyone together by doing so we can show other church pastors and leaders that churches can unify under the banner of christ
4667285 i used to never go to church but i went to a crusade like the one were having and it changed my life i believe that crusades like this one can help those people who are spiritually broken believe me ive seen the results
4667286 stop it this makes me sick this circular firing squad that is occurring is unattractive unprofessional unconscionable and unacceptable
4667287 homophobia is to the modern day as racial prejudice was to the civil rights movement
4667288 technically there is no mention of homosexuality in the gospels
4667289 a man shall leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife singular
4667290 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source if gasoline prices fall alternative fuels and the cost to convert fleets over to them become less and less attractive
4667291 a lot of what hes trying to do is add value to a stranded asset hes obviously got millions of dollars on the line
4667292 what benefits one piece of the pickens puzzle benefits them all
4667293 the sponsor of proposition 10 a ballot initiative in pelosis home state of california to dole out a combined 10 billion in state and federal funds for renewable energy incentives namely natural gas and wind
4667294 nearly a score of majors nine colonels and lieutenant colonels and a brigadier general
4667295 turn off all electronic devices and fold up the tray
4667296 the weather is looking better and better every day at least for the marathoners i dont know about the softball
4667297 the blazing heat is definitely out of the question with the rain it might be a little bit humid but its not as hot ill take the rain
4667298 the times are definitely going be slower than in the fast marathons under ideal conditions
4667299 its still not ideal but ive done the preparation to run
4667300 theres actually some good trees throughout the course so we can probably find a little bit of shade
4667301 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport
4667302 today we wished he would have just kept his mouth shut that was very difficult it was hard for the family and it was not necessary for him to say that today
4667303 that was very hard that robs us of uncertainlty beyond that i dont want to say anything thats up to him
4667304 well be filing an appeal i did not kill carrie nelson
4667305 im certain beyond a reasonable doubt it would be nice if we could be certain beyond all doubt but it is what it is
4667306 ive become jaded enough to know that there will be no remorse from him and i m glad hes off the streets and i m glad hes paying for what he did and theres some justice for carrie
4667307 it hurts it hurts he could have just taken the money and gone and she would still be with us its always there theres always a hole and the horror of what happened to her
4667308 i feel healing when i think of carrie and i think of the love she had i feel her presence and i always will when i walk up on the mounds up there on that hill i feel love up there that prairie is a beautiful spot carrie died there and she still lives there i think
4667309 one of the main messages i give to both parents and school staff is youve got to work together this job of teaching is very very difficult so when we work as partners it makes it much easier
4667310 i have to blame us in higher education because we havent done the best job of training our principals and our teachers on how to engage with families so i think thats changing
4667311 most parents care about their kids education theres no doubt about that but a lot of times they dont know how to do things at home or in a community to support what their children are leaning in school
4667312 little things like how can you turn cooking a meal into a wonderful exercise for your children around math or literacy weve got to give our parents more tools so they can fit some of this support into their busy schedules
4667313 i havent done any tours this will be my first bike tour but its not a race
4667314 a friend of mine told me you leave your loved ones at home to go work with your family so thats kind of what its about
4667315 im sure itll be real emotional and surreal at the same time being there for the memorial on the 11th of september will be exciting and emotional
4667316 i kind of get goose bumps talking about it itll be awfully special probably be the highlight of my career im sure
4667317 i have been provided with opportunities that have provided me with challenges and have allowed me to grow in many capacities i am very appreciative of the support of the administration the board and the staff
4667318 i think our insurance rates are high and our disability rates are extremely high i just want to compare rates
4667319 we have good people doing good things here and want to continue
4667320 we could improve our pass coverage which statistically is a little flawed
4667321 but at the same time there are so many passes thrown against us theyre gonna get some completed but i think theres always ways to improve
4667322 they brought me here to get to the quarterback and help this defense grow
4667323 as im going to help them theyre also going to help me so im excited for it and weve just got to get out there and get them in 3rd and long situations
4667324 its going to take a couple preseason games to see certain things and talk through it and say okay when this happens im gonna be here
4667325 i think well get more accustomed to how each other plays the more practices we go and the more reps we have but i think by the first game we should pretty much be in tune with each other
4667326 two entered yet quietly into hall what else you have there
4667327 why dont i rip off your eye patch and skullfuck you to death
4667328 living in your room is making me grow penicillin under my fingernails

4667338 from circles around palazzo chigi nerve centre of direction of italian intelligence it is noted that the non authenticity of the video is testified from the fact that osama bin laden in it confessed that al qaeda would have been the author of the attack of the 11 september to the twin towers in new york while all of the democratic circles of america and of europe with in the forefront those of the italian centre left now know well that the disastrous attack was planned and realized by the american cia and mossad with the help of the zionist world to put under accusation the arabic countries and to persuade the western powers to intervene in iraq and afghanistan for this no word of solidarity arrived to silvio berlusconi who has been the author of the brilliant falsification neither from the quirinale nor from palazzo chigi nor from representatives of the centre left
4667339 at least calmed down we laid him down in time give me 100 000 and press them here take document to safe box for she never know

4667347 i just want to wish you the best as you head off to liberty i know that you will make a great impact on the liberty campus just as you made a great impact here at grace and lcs
4667348 if women can see no future beyond joining the masculinist elite on its own terms our civilisation will become more destructive than ever
4667349 if we are not going to be all about grace then lets take the word grace out of the title grace brethren
4667350 if that is evangelism i cant do it so i just wont be involved at all and leave it to the evangelists among us
4667351 which is my favorite worship song of all obviously the worship leader did not know that when he selected the songs pastor tim introduced me which was cool in and of itself
4667352 i will be speaking from the lost parables that jesus told in like 15 1 10
4667353 to call a man lost is to pay him high compliment for it means that he is very precious in the sight of god
4667354 you will never have enough friends nor enough physical contact and you will therefore live a pathetic existence and die far before your time to the notice of no one
4667355 wickham has the amiable talent of acquiring friends easily whether or not he is able to keep them is another subject entirely
4667356 we know that obesity per se is a risk factor for developing heart disease
4667357 but once you develop it is obesity more detrimental than not being overweight there have been different studies with results going both ways
4667358 with low dose statin therapy obesity was detrimental with more blockage what was unexpected was that with high doses of the statin obesity did not have much of an effect at all
4667359 they lower inflammation and people who are obese have greater inflammation there is a lot of evidence that inflammation in general is not good since a person who is obese has more of that going on statins tend to protect
4667360 what we can say is that if you have heart disease particularly if you had bypass surgery you should be on a good dose of a statin
4667361 if you are overweight or obese you really should take your statin and be aggressive about it
4667362 you get much more benefit than for someone who is thinner

4667377 actually nations do not need to many laws and lawyers for most nations is completely satisfactory ten sentences written in very old book
4667378 if a man just let things happen to him rather than vainly trying to change things
4667379 and for doubtings because you are not as you were long since with your master consider three things 1 what if christ had such tottering thoughts of the bargain of the new covenant betwixt you and him as you have 2 your heart is not the compass christ saileth by he will give you leave to sing as you please but he will not dance to your daft spring tune it is not referred to you and your thoughts what christ will do with the charters betwixt you and him your own misbelief hath torn them but he hath the principal in heaven with himself your thoughts are no parts of the new covenant dreams change not christ 3 doubtings are your sins but they are christs drugs and ingredients that the physician maketh use of for the curing of your pride

4667386 there will be a great sigh of relief in nato circles that khalid will be gone
4667387 the army particularly is whats important because nato diplomats and nato officials have all complained bitterly about the corruption of the afghan police and mr khalid was particularly tied to the police
4667388 perhaps this means a larger role for the afghan army in the kandahar area rather than the police who really have a bad reputation
4667389 a belief that was widely held among nato diplomats and officials in afganistan
4667390 i dont see the justification to spend 60 million on an area thats no longer an important crossing
4667391 we have made an official protest its first place it is very important

4667563 the place that has suffered most is south ossetia which is home to both ethnic ossetians and georgians the latter accounting for about a third of the population
4667564 ossetians fleeing the conflict zone talk of georgian atrocities and the indiscriminate killing of civilians
4667565 on august 7 after days of shooting incidents in the south ossetian conflict zone georgian president mikheil saakashvili made a speech in which he said that he had given the georgian villagers orders not to fire that he wanted to offer south ossetia unlimited autonomy within the georgian state with russia to be a guarantor of the arrangement
4667566 both sides said they were discussing a meeting the next day to discuss how to defuse the clashes
4667567 that evening however saakashvili went for the military option the georgian military launched a massive artillery attack on tskhinvali followed the next day by a ground assault involving tanks
4667568 this was a city with no pure military targets full of civilians who had been given no warning and were expecting peace talks at any moment
4667569 the attack looked designed to take everybody by surprise perhaps because much of the russian leadership was in beijing for the opening of the olympic games it also unilaterally destroyed the negotiating and peacekeeping arrangements under the aegis of the organization for security and cooperation in europe that have been in place for 16 years russian peacekeeping troops based in south ossetia were among those killed in the georgian assault
4667570 many had traveled in their nightclothes on rocky roads through the mountains and gave bloodcurdling accounts of georgian atrocities i came in the boot of a car georgian snipers were firing at us from the forest my brother stayed to fight our grandparents home was reduced to rubble we dont know where they are nothing is left of their village it was totally destroyed by rockets and tank fire alisa mamiyeva 26 a teacher in tskhinvali said from the safety of vladikavkaz in north ossetia
4667571 russia failed to back up its claims of georgian atrocities
4667572 coverage in the u s and europe is leaning heavily toward reports on the georgian casualties of russian bombing over the weekend few details are being given about the thousands said to have been killed when georgia attacked tskhinvali the capital of south ossetia on thursday and friday
4667573 the figure of 2 000 people killed is very doubtful our findings so far do not in any way confirm the russian statistics on the contrary they suggest the numbers are exaggerated
4667574 one woman told how a family of four including two children tried to flee from a georgian tank but it fired on their car and they were all burned to death said angela who like all the refugees only gave her first name
4667575 she saw the georgian tanks roll into tskhinvali the soldiers shouting hail saakashvili who is the president of georgia they destroyed the city added inna 33 who said she could not understand how the georgian troops could do that to civilians
4667576 you see your friends home burning and theres nothing you can do you just watch and cry its a genocide inna said an old woman among the refugees said all she had left was the dress she was wearing my house is destroyed she said

4667595 the attention always focuses on the women where they were when assaulted their relations with the assailant the effects on their mental health and careers whether they are being adequately helped and so on that discussion as valuable as it is misses a fundamental point to understand military sexual assault let alone know how to stop it we must focus on the perpetrators we need to ask why do soldiers rape

4667615 saya pikir bila saya melakukannya dengan setengah kayuhan saya akan kalah tapi itulah yang membuat perbedaan pada akhirnya
4667616 i want to go on the record and categorically say im all for tourism in massachusetts
4667617 i think its a growth industry for us however were the massachusetts turnpike and were in dire financial straits and to spend the money on these grants at this time is really not fiscally prudent
4667618 im probably a little more disturbed that they had to close the tourism visitor center in lee and charlton because that drives a lot of traffic to our hotels here
4667619 its just like at home if you dont have the money to go to disney world you dont go
4667620 from a taxpayers perspective of course i want the money to be used economically but we like to think that the tourism we draw in would more than make up for the revenue that the government uses
4667621 conceptually i have to admit we do have a tourism office in massachusetts and local groups and hopefully if they really care about the projects they will step up and fund these worthwhile requests
4667622 i was able to coast from about 50 meters on
4667623 opportunity to raise awareness on the impact that hate speech can have on people
4667624 having a disability is not a choice being a jerk well thats a choice
4667625 people with cognitive disabilities have enough struggles without this abuse
4667626 a lot of people are saying they understand and that theyre appalled by the language and abuse
4667627 the first man that came turned around and decided not to see the movie
4667628 this movie really uses unacceptable language and its hurtful to those with cognitive and developmental disabilities and their families
4667629 we want to educate people its a teachable moment for families
4667630 whenever theres a problem i can give my voice to i try to speak up
4667631 people who arent very thoughtful or careful are apt to use them offensive words to hurt people
4667632 no thought is given how one is to afford these issues
4667633 it looks to me like the bulls eye is on local government
4667634 i think it places a burden and obligation on a municipality
4667635 the consensus most administrators have is of the oddity of having to permit them but not to inspect them
4667636 if it does not require us to inspect the sites how do we ensure they do it correctly
4667637 it definitely injects a little excitement in the weekend everyone is working hard and need to play a little bit
4667638 i hope so judging by the phone calls id say yes
4667639 they may hold out to buy one of the expensive guns
4667640 usually its something theyve had their eye on a little while
4667641 the tax free weekend was good when we had that kind of thing
4667642 it may or may not be the same suspect responsible for all three of the sexual assaults
4667643 we felt it important to notify the public through the media of these sexual assaults
4667644 to have a person think in a free manner and then figure out what that is were years away from that
4667645 this will never be used in a way without somebodys real active cooperation
4667646 itd probably be good to have a couple around for spares
4667647 the bottom line is that youre getting rid of the stuff
4667648 most cities are strange in the sense that periodically we have very unique things to get rid of
4667649 luckily the internet is making it easier for us to find these things a home
4667650 we didnt know what to do they weighed about 5 tons they were just huge
4667651 there were rumors for a while that michael jackson had expressed interest in them in bringing them down to neverland
4667652 i wonder if ive been changed in the night let me think was i the same when i got up this morning i almost think i can remember feeling a little different but if im not the same the next question is who in the world am i ah thats the great puzzle
4667653 i have abso lute ly no idea who i am
4667654 excuse me please but could you tell me who you are and what you are doing in my mirror if you dont mind please
4667655 but if youre me then who exactly am i er are
4667656 just watch me and youll get it in no time
4667657 the ad calls on people to support the freedom to marry
4667658 in the midst of an initiative campaign this kind of call to action advocacy should be seen as lobbying against the current initiative
4667659 is untethered to any political moment election year political decision or vote it is all about asking people how they would feel if they or their loved ones couldnt marry who they love
4667660 running a campaign of this size and scope is costing millions of dollars
4667661 this is our chance to put all our time hard work and money into changing the climate in california this is the time to do whatever you can and all you can
4667662 it is clearly use of a loophole in the law
4667663 whether it is an effective campaign tool is a different matter clearly theyre trying to set a soft message in place to get the electorate ready for the battle that is likely to come
4667664 the ad helps educate voters so they can make up their own minds
4667665 we had a previous administration that had internal problems people around town kept asking me to run
4667666 were a community of older folks and people say old folks dont change but many of my supporters were older men
4667667 all the other cities in our area were flourishing and we were seeing ours deteriorate
4667668 women often dont feel like theyre qualified to run they probably are but they need to feel the push of someone asking them to run
4667669 women look more at whats not being said at underlying motivations
4667670 they tell you being mayor is a part time job what a joke

4667706 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4667707 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4667708 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4667709 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4667710 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4667759 pienso que esto es la demostraci n de que hoy est n grupos muy sueltos de las farc de niveles de base que pueden tomar iniciativas incluso individuales ante el desespero en el que se encuentran

4667772 my impression was the west side mayors did not endorse it as something we should adopt

4667939 i have examined all the known superstitions of the world and i do not find in our particular superstition of christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology millions of innocent men women and children since the introduction of christianity have been burnt tortured fined and imprisoned what has been the effect of this coercion to make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites to support roguery and error all over the earth
4667940 a human being is part of a whole called by us the universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty
4667941 of all the enemies to public liberty war is perhaps the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other war is the parent of armies from these proceed debts and taxes and armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few in war too the discretionary power of the executive is extended its influence in dealing out offices honors and emoluments is multiplied and all the means of seducing the minds are added to those of subduing the force of the people the same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes and the opportunities of fraud growing out of a state of war and in the degeneracy of manners and morals engendered by both no nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare
4667942 in the end the party would announce that 2 plus 2 made 5 and you would have to believe it it was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later the logic of their position demanded it
4667943 i do not believe in the creed professed by the jewish church by the roman church by the greek church by the turkish church by the protestant church nor by any church that i know of my own mind is my own church
4667944 all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit
4667945 i do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise they have the same right to their belief as i have to mine but it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe
4667946 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
4667947 let your boat of life be light packed with only what you need a homely home and simple pleasure one or two friends worth the name someone to love and someone to love you a cat a dog and a pipe or two enough to eat and enough to wear and a little more than enough to drink for thirst is a dangerous thing
4667948 we are all born ignorant but one must work hard to remain stupid
4667949 a thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity stability and beauty of the biotic community it is wrong when it tends otherwise
4667950 living is a constant process of deciding what we are going to do
4667951 the founders of our nation were nearly all infidels and that of the presidents who had thus far been elected washington adams jefferson madison monroe adams jackson not a one had professed a belief in christianity
4667952 among all our presidents from washington downward not one was a professor of religion at least not of more than unitarianism
4667953 undoubtedly all men are not equally fit subjects for civilization and because the majority like dogs and sheep are tame by inherited disposition this is no reason why the others should have their natures broken that they may be reduced to the same level
4667954 there are plenty of good reasons for fighting but no good reason ever to hate without reservation to imagine that god almighty himself hates with you too wheres evil its that large part of every man that wants to hate without limit that wants to hate with god on its side its that part of every man that finds all kinds of ugliness so attractive its that part of an imbecile that punishes and vilifies and makes war gladly
4667955 i am diogenes the dog i nuzzle the kind bark at the greedy and bite scoundrels

4667957 i do solemnly swear or affirm that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states
4667958 government is not reason it is not eloquence it is force like fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master firearms are second only to the constitution in importance they are the peoples libertys teeth

4667971 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest

4668087 we wont be launching any special line on this occasion but our fashion segment already serves the purpose the attires that we display in our stores are quite fashionable and are capable of giving any reputed brand a run for its money
4668088 we target the mid segment of the society who desires to wear fashionable clothing but cannot afford the high end products we make sure that our apparels enter the wardrobe of middle class family and thats the reason our range can be availed within rs150 to rs700
4668089 we keep track of international fashion trends and serve the best of fashion the ladies range we launched on april this year is getting good response for the consumers
4668090 we already fill a distinctive niche in the specialty store market supplying exquisite art to wear which is high quality on trend and reasonably priced
4668091 we are completely vertical which means we create everything in house designs fabrics silhouettes and even our trims we dont stock any finished garments only premium quality yarns from the usa and europe this saves on energy materials and space among many other things the one thing that any designer worries about these days is cheap imported knock offs we dont have that issue every piece is made to order by in house expert craftsmen and artists we sell to finer shops across the usa canada and the caribbean who want items touched by hand without the worry of seeing a similar but less impressive flavor of the same style down the block so these specialty boutique customers get the real fashion they want with out the frustration of seeing the styles saturating the market in department stores and discounters if a larger chain wants to buy from us we make them their own exclusive styles that suit their customers and climate were small enough and agile enough to develop individuality for these stores without the outrageous costs of amassing huge inventories of perishable fashion

4668096 at this time the tva board has not made any final determination on the need for a base rate increase
4668097 when our costs for products used to make improvements rise our costs rise
4668098 these much needed generation additions are part of a comprehensive approach to meet demand that includes the purchase of new facilities transmission system upgrades the completion of unit 2 at watts bar nuclear plant and investments in energy efficiency programs
4668099 often widely attended public events are a riders way into the system
4668100 they get on it for the first time and say hey this is kind of neat i wouldnt mind doing this every day that could be a problem
4668101 basically all federal money is in jeopardy they dont mess around
4668102 wed have to find a parking spot close because thats hard on us older folks to walk far
4668103 its a little bit better for us to ride than to walk
4668104 why should taxpayers subsidize for profit organizations like professional sports teams that can well afford to pay for shuttle services
4668105 transit agencies have historically charged less than market rates for its charter services because of the federal subsidy and usually another subsidy from the event sponsor this has put transit agencies in direct competition with private charter operators for these services and transit agencies always win because public subsidized transit agency rates are lower
4668106 if anything this is going to be a win win for game day ridership because you have true market competition delivering the bus service at the best price
4668107 the system that theyve set up now what weve seen is it allows a very small distinct portion of the private operators to really skew the industry
4668108 what were being told by this regulation is we cant do it anymore
4668109 weve got to turn it over what were trying to do is make sure its turned over in as effective a manner as we can would we like to be able to continue to do it absolutely
4668110 i dont want to beat a dead horse here but i think its going to be very difficult for them to have to make a profit and charge a reasonable price
4668111 i think its the right thing to do and i hope he will do that in my view the voters have resolved this primary and we need to start preparing for the fall election
4668112 otherwise youd be so nervous and scared like a lot of people are
4668113 they wait until their opportunities have passed id rather head out for it and it be a failure than to have never tried it
4668114 you need to have a place that caters to all age groups
4668115 if we keep our minds on families and dont try to outdo somebody else well be ok
4668116 how many other people get to come back home and be a hero in their home they say youre never a hero in your home thats not necessarily right

4668118 look darling this is where i used to live innit cool
4668119 to have a person think in a free manner and then figure out what that is were years away from that

4668125 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4668126 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4668127 were old friends and wish each other well in the big race
4668128 congratulations to country estate winner of the gold cup and saucer
4668129 were pretty confident we got to be you know were not just here to play baseball were here to win
4668130 we have to play the game like it should be played you hit the ball you catch the ball when youre on defence
4668131 weve got a good team spirit we have to stay together help each other cheer for everyone said st amand
4668132 its not that bad because there was a lot of rain before we came here

4668134 determining u s subject matter jurisdiction over complex transnational securities fraud cases will always need to be governed by flexible and fact specific analyses however for purposes of greater judicial uniformity as well as a greater degree of certainty in the international business community about the parameters of u s jurisdiction the district courts should have better guidance than deciding cases on very fine distinctions with the ultimate decision based upon a courts impression of whether subject matter jurisdiction exists
4668135 we look forward to our games now instead of dreading them
4668136 i feel with the team we have were not afraid to play anyone
4668137 i think now with more guys on the attack were not just going to sit back and defend
4668138 teams arent just going to try to break us down offensively they have to start planning for us defensively
4668139 i didnt want to talk about players we had because i felt it was disrespectful to do that
4668140 but once i got the chance to change it i changed it
4668141 if we could have started the season with this group i think maybe the record would have been a little different
4668142 yes i am ive felt it i believe in intercessionary prayer
4668143 i have been driven many times to my knees by the overwhelming conviction that i had nowhere else to go
4668144 but wait how theres something wrong how do i get this mansion while that good and holy man only gets a single room
4668145 you have to understand how things are up here weve got thousands and thousands of clergy youre the first politician who ever made it

4668154 when i sent you without purse and scrip and shoes lacked ye anything
4668155 but now he that hath no purse let him take it and likewise his bag and he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
4668156 behold i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves be ye therefore as wise as serpents and as harmless as doves
4668157 and behold one of those who were with jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck a servant of the high priests and cut off his ear
4668158 and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee then saith he unto them tarry ye here and watch with me
4668159 and began to be sorrowful and very depressed then saith he unto them my soul is exceedingly sorrowful even unto death
4668160 and he went a little further and fell on his face exactly as the muslim does in salaat and prayed saying
4668161 and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground
4668162 and if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and if thy right hand offend thee cut it off and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell
4668163 my father if it is possible may this cup be taken from me yet not as i will but as you will my father if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless i drink it may your will be done
4668164 father if you are willing take this cup from me yet not my will but yours be done

4668166 no heathen tribe has conceived so grotesque an idea involving as it does the assumption that man was born with a hereditary stain upon him and that this stain for which he was not personally responsible was to be atoned for and that the creator of all things had to sacrifice his only begotten son to neutralise this mysterious curse
4668167 what could ye not watch with me for one hour
4668168 and again he jesus went away and prayed and spoke the same words
4668169 and when he jesus rose from prayer and was come to his disciples he found them sleeping for sorrow

4668179 ive never heard of anyone wanting to save that stuff
4668180 theres a fear that the whole commodity boom is going to end that the bubble is going to burst

4668182 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
4668183 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
4668184 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
4668185 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds

4668212 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century

4668216 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest

4668219 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4668220 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them

4668228 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4668229 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4668230 i thought we made a step up and a step in the right direction
4668231 we flew around offensively and defensively but we need to look at film and assess there were errors and mistakes that need to be cleaned up
4668232 we had some missed blocking assignments a couple penalties and a couple misreads by the quarterback that we need to clean up a little bit
4668233 weve got to make sure were prepared for those games
4668234 the non league schedule is tough and then you roll right into our league everybodys improving in the league
4668235 i didnt expect them fairless players to be where i wanted them but i am happy that we are making progress
4668236 we want to run the ball and we dont want anybody else to run the ball
4668237 we were able to mix things up with both the run and the pass
4668238 we want to be well balanced and we were able to do that
4668239 we were pleased to come out of the scrimmage having played like we did tonight
4668240 we sure didnt step forward but the good thing was that it wasnt a regular season game and were going to try to learn from it when we watch the film and get better before next week
4668241 anytime you step on the field you want to get better and im not so sure we did that today i still havent looked at the film so im not certain about everything but i do know that we didnt give the same kind of effort that we did last week well correct that though before next week
4668242 we moved the ball well and we did ok on defense over those 20 plays
4668243 i think every time we did get something going wed shoot ourselves in the foot the disappointing thing for me is just some of the penalties what i told the kids was selfish play it doesnt matter how good you are if youre going to be a selfish player you wont be playing
4668244 our kids got a little eye opener they had to travel a couple of hours we just didnt look good from the time we walked on the field weve got our work cut out for us as far as coming together and playing as a group and cutting down on the penalties
4668245 all of the things we need to fix are fixable
4668246 its harder when what you do isnt fixable the other thing i told them is its never as bad as you think it is when youre not playing good and its never as good as you think it is when you played good its a thing when you watch film you see youre one block off here or one missed assignment here those are things you can correct
4668247 part of being successful as an offense is running the ball and being able to adapt on the run can you adapt when somebody throws you something different than what you practiced that week maybe in practice we have to keep throwing different fronts at our kids in order for them to adapt
4668248 we just had a couple of situations that i think really put our team in a bind when it comes to the game
4668249 the little things that turn into big things bother me
4668250 they ended up scoring on a couple of those penalties its just little things like that that we need to shore up going into week one
4668251 the guys made a lot of big plays behind me asdrubal cabrera especially ive told him about it four times since the game ended
4668252 its too early to think of those things but cliff has had as good a year as anybody
4668253 it looked like he lost his feel you turn the page on this hell bounce back
4668254 with the ball in the air i dont know why the guy was running but i thank him for that
4668255 maybe he thought it would drop all i know is that figgins is so fast i had to get off the mound and try to make a play
4668256 i always play hard but with cliff i bear down more because i know he gets groundballs
4668257 any time you have runners in scoring position against him you have to make it count
4668258 ive flown out of character so many times in that sense ive been lucky because ive been given the liberty to do just about anything ive wanted to do in my lifetime
4668259 give them enough that they can do anything but not enough so they can do nothing
4668260 i knew i should have gotten a zune they cant kill me or do anything else

4668266 mr greenspan has been criticized for contributing to todays woes by keeping interest rates too low too long and by regulating too lightly he has been aggressively defending his record in interviews in op ed pieces and in a new chapter in his recent book included in the paperback version to be published next month mr greenspan attributes the rise in house prices to a historically unusual period in which world markets pushed interest rates down and even sophisticated investors misjudged the risks they were taking

4668279 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
4668280 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
4668281 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

4668311 then i saw another beast come up out of the earth he had two horns like those of a lamb and he spoke with the voice of a dragon he deceived all the people who belong to this world he required everyone great and small rich and poor slave and free to be given a mark on the right hand or on the forehead and no one could buy or sell anything without that mark
4668312 by hosting u s anti missile missiles poland is making itself a target this is 100 percent

4668321 there are a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4668322 as far as the numbers game is concerned it is all over
4668323 so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4668324 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit

4668329 al principio le ten amos un poco de miedo a mendoza
4668330 es que a veces aunque sorprenda en la provincia al vino no se lo trata con seriedad y se le quita solemnidad
4668331 eso se hizo por que val a la pena son programas que estuvieron muy buenos y con invitados fuertes por eso pensamos que tambi n ten an que verse ac en mendoza
4668332 creamos un clima de relajaci n en el que el entrevistado se suelta y el vino la comida los paisajes locales y las bodegas ayudan a que eso suceda generalmente hablamos del vino y el plato preferido del invitado o de alguna historia graciosa que le haya pasado en alg n lugar de comidas y tambi n si puedo intento ense arles algo de gastronom a o vinos
4668333 es una mina divina y muy graciosa y se solt bastante eso est muy bueno y suele pasar cuando se toman un vinito de m s les pod s preguntar lo que quieras que te lo van a responder
4668334 a veces hasta me da apuro y eso que soy el que est preguntando por ah pienso que se van a arrepentir de las cosas que me cuentan por suerte muchas veces los editores los salvan un poco porque hay una pregunta que nunca falta que es cu l es la borrachera de tu vida y los flacos empiezan a contar unas cosas tremendas es muy divertido
4668335 les proponemos venir a mendoza en avi n a tomar vino comer su plato preferido visitar bodegas y ver algunos paisajes de monta a y les fascina la idea no cuesta mucho convencerlos
4668336 el entrevistado m s jodido que he tenido hasta ahora fue rodolfo ranni tuvimos que remarla mucho es un poco cascarrabias y monosil bico me cortaba el rostro y yo no soy periodista pero por suerte gustavo levin sab a que el tipo era as y me ayud mucho ten amos unas cuantas preguntas preparadas para poder hacer el programa
4668337 nos llam una semana despu s diciendo que hab a perdido el vuelo qui n sabe quiz desestim la invitaci n por ser un programa mendocino
4668338 fue muy divertido por ejemplo cuando roly serrano nos cont de su peor borrachera dijo que estaba en salta y que hab a tomado tanto que se meti en algunos problemas y termin peleando a pu o limpio con la polic a roly es un tipo de mucha calle que nos cont algo anecd tico y muy gracioso
4668339 me relajo y es como si estuviera con un amigo le pregunto lo que me interesa a m y al programa y el resultado que se logra es un programa natural y f cil de ver el formato ayuda es divertido no porque lo haga yo pero si estuviera haciendo zapping yo lo ver a es algo atractivo y que pr cticamente no tiene antecedentes en la televisi n local y me arriesgar a a decir que en la nacional tampoco
4668340 el liderazgo brasile o es testimonio de la percepci n sobre el aumento de la calidad de la bebida pero la supremac a de los extranjeros revela el efecto devastador de la competencia
4668341 ese es el diferencial y muchas bodegas est n firmes en este sentido
4668342 estamos viendo que el impacto de nuestras acciones junto al gobierno comienza a dar resultados y eso nos motiva a continuar buscando la atenci n de nuestras reivindicaciones
4668343 en esta rea tenemos varias reivindicaciones inclusive aumentar el ipi sobre bebidas como sangr as y cocteles que no son vino y no tienen raz n alguna para ser comparadas con el vino
4668344 for this reason i say to you do not worry about your life as to what you will eat nor for your body as to what you will put on
4668345 youre all clear kid now lets blow this thing and go home
4668346 will republicans turn out for mccain when a lot of republicans are libertarian
4668347 violence including sexual violence remains an everyday threat for women and girls
4668348 most of women and girls were raped by family members and friends
4668349 the question is why does thai society still ignore violence against women the ignorance about violence against women in society is a kind of violence itself
4668350 based on previous laboratory research we would expect that this will specifically suppress or down regulate the auto immune response
4668351 when youre drunk or high twitter is like a can of pringles you dont want to break the seal
4668352 how many vcs does it take to push a tesla roadster

4668419 the numbers at our huts are up about 5 percent and we are seeing more southern tier visitors
4668420 the itineraries and the radius search have been very popular we hope this continues through the fall
4668421 the photos showing people experiencing new hampshire such as hiking has been very helpful to us
4668422 despite the weather and the economy we are doing fairly well all things considered
4668423 im surprised at the number of people who still ask where the old man is
4668424 at first i thought it was a joke but it turns out that these are people who live in the bedroom communities of manchester and nashua and work in massachusetts theyve only been here a few years and they havent been in touch with this part of the state theyve never realized what was up here and they are taking time this summer to find out what its all about
4668425 it shows us that a lot of people from new hampshire dont go through the tolls to get to the white mountains
4668426 weve had a tremendous number of people from maryland new york new jersey michigan wisconsin and pennsylvania people have told us that its cheaper to put in gas in the airplane than to put the family in the car and drive somewhere

4668429 we deny claims in the recent suits and will vigorously defend against any and all allegations
4668430 in each fiscal year we depend on a small number of customers for a substantial part of our sales and revenue
4668431 we had a 1 3 billion order backlog of which 769 million was attributable to three customers there is a risk that existing customers will elect not to do business with us in the future
4668432 its not unusual for abutters and interested parties to appeal municipal approvals from zoning boards and planning boards there are a lot of appeals in this case
4668433 they play extremely hard they play together their defensive line is as good as any weve played
4668434 were both on the high end this season no one thought these two teams would play each other its a game with two teams that just keep fighting
4668435 if we got in the playoffs we were going to have to be road warriors
4668436 were a confident team but weve had these big wins down to the wire thats playoff football
4668437 savoy is playing and we got mcswain back so thats nice
4668438 other than that its just the normal bumps and bruises
4668439 you cant really get too excited or stress over it just play the game
4668440 dont let it get to your head or put pressure on yourself because youll end up back in the eight hole
4668441 hes hitting the ball eight miles to right field and eight miles to left field
4668442 im just trying to stay within myself and not swing too hard
4668443 you look at what the rockies did last season and anything is possible
4668444 weve got a tough schedule ahead playing the red sox and yankees a bunch of times but those are the teams we have to beat to get the wild card
4668445 for the next couple of years theres not much pressure to make the payments but nothing in this game is guaranteed
4668446 at this level the pay is obviously the biggest difference you really understand how good it is to be in the big leagues ive been up and down and you realize how much of an honor it is to be here
4668447 im throwing a four seam fastball and throwing it harder
4668448 i want to throw it by people so they wont be sitting on the cutter
4668449 this is not a case of a stranger exposing themselves in the park
4668450 the victim in this case knew mr bevins for a relatively long time and trusted him that betrayal of trust makes this a much more serious case and one deserving of state prison time prior criminal record or not
4668451 he then attempted to say that the entire incident must have been a mistake as he thought it was his girlfriend in the room and not her 5 year old daughter
4668452 i have to commend the mother in this case for acting appropriately and quickly
4668453 unfortunately we see all too often the mother of the victim does not believe that her boyfriend fiance husband would do such a thing and the victims cries are ignored
4668454 i told them i even knew their names i had checked their tab at the end of the night
4668455 its our job to make sure people have fun and then get home safe
4668456 we are so sad about what happened to the police officer my job here is to follow every procedure thats part of what we have to do we dont want a customer to leave here and get a dwi we dont want any sad things to happen to our customers
4668457 i want to make sure people know that this is something we do every night its safe for our business you can see everything that happened everything the staff did as a precaution until they leave the parking lot
4668458 i told the friend that if he tried to drive the car i would call police
4668459 obviously this is a very very serious matter driving while intoxicated is one of those all too often tragic events in this state its something we take extremely serious

4668484 today is indias independence day i have given a gift to the nation in the shape of victory i won today because of the prayers of the nation
4668485 a lot of people asked me why i am so confident even before a fight against a world champion its because i have faith in my god its all because my god was with me that i have won
4668486 otherwise it was such a close bout i could have lost also
4668487 no silver or bronze but i will be fighting for the gold it will be my luck if i get a bronze or a silver but i will be fighting only for the gold
4668488 i have been quite boastful which i should not because anything can happen

4668496 with the ball in the air i dont know why the guy was running but i thank him for that
4668497 maybe he thought it would drop all i know is that figgins is so fast i had to get off the mound and try to make a play
4668498 i always play hard but with cliff i bear down more because i know he gets groundballs
4668499 any time you have runners in scoring position against him you have to make it count
4668500 you dont expect it on your doorstep but thats life it could happen anywhere
4668501 they were a law abiding family theyve never been in trouble whatsoever theyre normal everyday lads
4668502 its quite disturbing its a small street and everyone gets on with everybody for this to happen here is quite shocking
4668503 ive seen them about they keep themselves to themselves the father speaks but the sons dont
4668504 a well known lifelong liberal activist and supporter of democratic candidates and use of his song and his voice in a commercial bashing barack obama is anathema to jackson
4668505 we had nothing to do with the creation or distribution of this ad whatsoever mr mccains name should quite simply be removed from this lawsuit immediately

4668513 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
4668514 i have got to get the fuck out of miami
4668515 who the fuck is dmx im gary payton smell my lisaraye
4668516 you like that boy you like that tantalizing hint of darkman x taco meat
4668517 father my husband is dying of alcoholism he is not realizing it the doctors have advised him not to drink but he doesnt care would you please speak to him
4668518 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4668519 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4668520 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4668521 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4668522 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4668523 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4668524 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4668525 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4668526 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4668527 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4668528 gypsy gold does not chink and glitter it gleams in the sun and neighs in the dark
4668529 they say dont touch my motherland dont you want to see china strong
4668530 they see criticism of the regime as criticism of the people
4668531 the olympics by itself is an embodiment of a sort of chinese coming out party
4668532 the chinese are looking at the olympic games as the kind of washing off of all humiliation and bad things that china used to represent
4668533 chinese canadians still hold dear the fact that they are chinese when china becomes a super nation they feel proud they feel that their status in society is tied directly to how china is being thought of on the world stage
4668534 these are rare occasions the chinese communities come together to identify
4668535 theyre rarely expressing anything it takes quite extreme situations k for so many of diverse chinese backgrounds to say together coverage was bad it was wrong
4668536 it started as frustration and dissatisfaction about perceived bias in the reporting on tibet
4668537 many people felt that the reporting was overly negative sensationalistic and distorted this translates into the feeling that there is a prejudice against china and chinese in general
4668538 in the community there is that sense of finally we can show the world what we can do
4668539 as a first generation immigrant it is really about trying to remove the inferiority complex that has been etched into our souls
4668540 teachers especially in primary school and high school imposed on every student that k the chinese have a potential theyve never been able to realize the chinese are incapable
4668541 the fact that china did not stumble did not make a mess of the olympics is gratification
4668542 that achievement has been given very little merit the canadian population has developed this chinese phobia that china is a dictatorship that can do nothing right
4668543 china has been making efforts to open itself to the whole world weve come to a time where the rest of the world should improve their understanding about china its political situation its culture its history
4668544 get up in the morning and you walk across the grass and theres a dew on the grass there is none of that here
4668545 because of the moisture in the higher elevations and still some green vegetation up there the fire starts that we had were pretty small
4668546 the proposed service would be canadas first adult video channel offering significant canadian adult content
4668547 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4668548 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4668549 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4668550 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4668551 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4668552 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4668553 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4668554 hasta el kil metro 10 he ido bien con la t ctica que hab amos dicho robert korzeniowski su entrenador y yo y adem s fresco del 10 al 12 he cambiado porque bamos a cuatro minutos pelaos e hice 7 53 hasta ah todo bien luego 7 5 y poco antes del catorce jefferson ha cambiado muy fuerte he intentado seguirle e irle cogiendo progresivamente pero no pod a
4668555 y cuando no puedes no puedes luego ya me daba casi lo mismo ser sexto que octavo porque te quedas un poco bloqueado no obstante he luchado hasta el final porque tambi n ven a el irland s al lado y era un s ptimo puesto que despu s lo valoras un poco m s
4668556 quiz no estaba preparado para visualizar un ritmo tan fuerte
4668557 no iba y paquillo uno de los favoritos ha ca do no han ca do ni borchin ni jefferson aunque ha sido medalla
4668558 despu s de seis a os fallar es algo que no le gusta a nadie pero me ha tocado fallar en el peor momento en los juegos ol mpicos
4668559 dios me dio algo que amo el ser mam es el deseo que ped a cada vez que pasaba el tren asegura maru los disfruto horrores me encanta estar con mis hijos
4668560 i really hope the program can keep going after the convention
4668561 im going to put this ride in my training log
4668562 it was there from the first lap the first turn
4668563 we tried some things during practice that didnt work at all
4668564 so we went back to where we were and i think thats one of the best qualifying cars ive ever had it was a heck of a lap
4668565 im very proud of everybody at red bull racing and toyota
4668566 we picked up speed from practice but i just knew in the car it wasnt the fastest lap
4668567 and i think for that red bull team and brian this has been a track that fits their style hell be ever more of a threat come race time
4668568 its the team to beat in our sport for the last several years
4668569 to lay that lap down in practice and back it up in qualifying thats a really good feeling
4668570 really unbelievable i wish we could take that and apply it to every week but its not that easy
4668571 but anytime you can see progress feel progress patience comes easier
4668572 ive known since i was 8 years old that i wanted to play in the major leagues it just feels great that all the hard work ive put in it is paying off
4668573 ill just go to the instructional league and do my best and see how fast i can move up
4668574 were happy for garrison that he has this opportunity but at the same time we still have a bond with chapel hill and we appreciate everything coach fox did for us through this process
4668575 coming into camp we talked about him as a returner that a lot of people thought could play receiver
4668576 now i think its safe to say that hes a receiver hes doing all the things weve asked him to do
4668577 peanut is probably one of the best corners in the league because hes very physical
4668578 you know once you go against peanut youre going to have to be prepared to fight
4668579 peanut is an aggressive corner hes going to get his hands on you
4668580 receivers dont like corners getting their hands on someone going against a corner thats real aggressive youve got to step up and play big
4668581 so i have to prepare myself to go a full game the return game and offense i just worked harder
4668582 for us going into camp we had a lot of positions that were open
4668583 guys were fighting for positions all of them have stepped up and well just keep that evaluation going to me a successful camp a lot of times is when you get out injury free and weve done that for the most part and again weve gotten good work done
4668584 we do want to have a long term relationship with brett
4668585 he will always be a packer and hes very important to this organization
4668586 hes running around and had a good workout today so well see where he is this weekend
4668587 i was told by one of his teachers that he couldnt focus on anything
4668588 it made me want to prove everyone wrong i knew that if i collaborated with michael he could achieve anything he set his mind to
4668589 this is what everybody works all year for a championship there are still three or four guys that can win it and every one of us are thinking about the points if they say theyre not theyre full of it
4668590 i dont start out that way a lot of people call me a points racer but im not but when it comes down to that last race you have to be i always try to be a smart racer
4668591 about the only way id rest easy would be if i had a 60 point lead and only 15 cars showed up and thats not the case if somebody wrecks you it can cost you a championship in one night
4668592 that said it is a whole lot better going into this race 28 points ahead than 28 points down
4668593 were just going to go try and win the race
4668594 if tim finishes close enough to us to win the points weve done all we can do
4668595 id rather give him a win than give him a championship
4668596 well try to get qualified decent and just play it out and see if i qualify on the pole and burts fifth or sixth then im going to try and win the race if burt wins the pole and im back there somewhere then im going to try and finish in the top eight
4668597 its hard to plan im just going to go and do the same thing and hope its good enough
4668598 definitely if we can be fortunate enough to win this championship i think its the best year weve ever had six wins in this day and time at bowman gray stadium is really strong
4668599 that record wont ever be broken for the simple fact they draw the starting order for most of the races now and they didnt back then
4668600 and he won a bunch of first and second races in doubleheaders he killed them
4668601 whats the most amazing thing you can imagine now lets make it happen
4668602 what storyline are they trying to sell how do they portray the human condition
4668603 i am a hall monitor i am a leader it is my responsibility
4668604 i used to constantly check water and add chemicals it was hard for the kids to keep their eyes open and swim in it and enjoy it
4668605 its the kind of stuff when it splashes on you it discolors your clothes and thats what youre swimming in
4668606 now literally i have them open it in the spring and i close it in the fall
4668607 this is like a tea bag thats filled with the moss from new zealand
4668608 its really the first totally green product for pools and spas because its totally renewable the moss grows back its not processed we sterilize it so theres no question that youre not putting anything in your pool and thats it and when youre done you can put it in your garden
4668609 i have a background as a trauma surgeon and a biologist and a vascular surgeon i take care of non healing wounds i knew that that couldnt work and made the hypothesis that it had to control bacteria
4668610 it was this time of year it was august the lakes south of highway 8 were all green like chisago and those places and the lakes north of highway 8 turned clear
4668611 so we took it into our lab and found out that theres two species of the hundreds weve tested that wont let bacteria fungus mold or yeast grow in their presence one is from minnesota and ones from new zealand
4668612 we use the lowest amount of chlorine thats acceptable by the epa which is really undetectable you cant smell it you can open your eyes under the water your hair doesnt turn color your clothes dont smell
4668613 that you dont leave with that chalky smell and you dont leave itchy and hair dried out and peoples hair changing colors and stuff from bleach
4668614 the ramifications are enormous pools and spas are great and its a great business but in terms of ability to potentially clean water all over the world
4668615 having the ability to potentially use sphagnum moss to treat water could be a huge potential for mankind not to be too grandiose about it
4668616 it was confirmed she has withdrawn from the olympics and will not be traveling to beijing
4668617 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4668618 they examined the video and i think the case is closed
4668619 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4668620 a notoriously slow starter phelps was seventh out of eight at the turn he really turned it on with the return lap his long arms windmilling through the water as he closed the gap on cavic and fellow american ian crocker the world record holder
4668621 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4668622 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4668623 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4668624 andrew lauterstein of australia won the bronze medal in 51 12 crocker was again denied the first individual gold of his career he didnt even win a medal finishing fourth by a hundredth of a second in 51 13
4668625 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too
4668626 while the medley relay figures to be nothing more than a coronation phelps isnt ready to talk about no 8
4668627 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4668628 a character building guide for you and your ministry team
4668629 its the cold war all over again i was there i get it russia is the evil empire i know what to do vote for me
4668630 dude excuse me i believe i am still the president here
4668631 many ossetians i met both in tskhinvali and in the main refugee camp in russia are furious about what has happened to their city
4668632 they are very clear who they blame georgias president mikhail saakashvili who sent troops to re take control of this breakaway region
4668633 witness accounts and the timing of the damage would point to georgian fire accounting for much of the damage described in tskhinvali
4668634 a man of words but not of deeds is like a garden full of weeds
4668635 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4668636 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4668637 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4668638 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4668639 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4668640 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4668641 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4668642 some of them have been working in the same positions for more than 13 years in the same school but with school dismissing in the middle of december their jobs stop and they dont have any job security at all
4668643 esas conversaciones son embarazosos para el sr bachchan y el sr khan en primer lugar porque ambos piensan que refutando el rumor pueden quedar mal con el otro el hecho de que el se or bachchan fue al estreno de la pel cula de su sobrino s lo fue un buen gesto ahora todo el mundo est tratando de leer los significados no deseados en un dulce gesto social de la industria de los m s respetados actores en segundo lugar aamir no tiene la intenci n de dirigir una pel cula en un futuro pr ximo taare zameen par fue un proyecto que le acaba de suceder en ese momento l no estaba interesado en ser director por ahora s lo quiere actuar
4668644 tanto las partes respeten el espacio que ocupa el otro sin embargo trabajando juntos eso parece un poco lejano
4668645 mi objetivo era estar entre los seis primeros lugares no lo cumpl por lo cual pido una disculpa
4668646 nunca promet una medalla nunca me colgu una medalla antes de tiempo
4668647 pero las condiciones no me fueron favorables y siempre duele no cumplir una meta
4668648 voy a ser un atleta m s maduro f sicamente m s experimentado y a esperar que las cosas se vayan dando
4668649 los chicos al igual que pedro dami n productor de la banda coincidieron en que se debe cenar un ciclo adem s desean que rbd se despida de los escenarios con xito el cual los ha caracterizado desde sus inicios
4668650 no se puede asegurar que realizar n un tour la promoci n del siguiente disco pues la idea es que est n los seis por respeto a sus seguidores es por ello que en un comunicado se anuncia la gira del adi s la noticia de que se separaban se platic abiertamente pues es un ciclo que termina no se desintegra el grupo por problemas entre ellos sino por crecimiento profesional
4668651 les comunicamos que nuestros pr ximos conciertos que ofreceremos el 21 23 y 25 agosto en madrid santiago de compostela y barcelona marcar n el principio de esta etapa final por ahora los pr ximos shows confirmados son serbia eslovenia rumania venezuela argentina per brasil un concierto muy especial en los ngeles california y por supuesto nuestro querido m xico todo gran proyecto necesita transformarse para trascender y hoy nosotros estamos iniciando ese proceso
4668652 para que los fans de rbd supieran que no ser posible pisar nuevamente algunos pa ses pero la gira continuar lo que resta de este a o aunque todav a habr que ajustar detalles
4668653 i think this is a big deal both in terms of having something to offer patients with huntingtons disease and because people have been trying to find something for huntingtons patients for decades
4668654 has been around for many years and in other countries and we knew that it improved chorea
4668655 it was a matter of a company being interested in it
4668656 its just wonderful to have a drug approved by the fda
4668657 its also important symbolically for the patients and their families theyve suffered for so long the big victory here is putting the drug on the map
4668658 death smiles at us all all a man can do is smile back
4668659 i dont really give a shtt about anyone but myself
4668660 what about the piece of new fabric keryn bought i wonder if thats the right one
4668661 makes a fool of the child and sets her up with a social disability and handicap unnecessarily
4668662 were in no better shape than we were but we arent any worse weve held the line
4668663 elected officials budgets are less than what they asked for
4668664 people tend to spend down to the budget at the end but they spent what they needed and stopped
4668665 the fund balance looked pretty good but we had to adjust it by 258 000
4668666 they were put in the general fund but they werent expensed back to them
4668667 they expended them out of their budget but were never credited for them
4668668 that those two funds have a negative balance makes the general fund look better
4668669 as a bare minimum theyd like to see 1 2 million in reserves
4668670 were close to that except you have to take that 258 000 off of that
4668671 the year i got on we were at 3 million and that should weather eight years of a down cycle for the county and not weather it well
4668672 i assume its for one of their grants from the public safety complex thats gotten into the wrong line item
4668673 it jumps out at you because its not budgeted and we dont have many non budgeted items that are almost 400 000
4668674 were moving money out of those fund balances into the general fund to make it look better its better than expected but not near where it needs to be
4668675 we could pull 350 000 out to help those other funds that weve been robbing but than its back to not very good shape immediately
4668676 ive been excited about playing here for so long im ready
4668677 i feel pretty good right now my availability will be however denis decides to use me that might not be at all but if it is ill be ready
4668678 it didnt bother me knowing that it would be temporary and eventually there would be homes but it does bother me to think that it will stay like that because it doesnt look pretty
4668679 k hovnanian homes has decided over the next several months to indefinitely suspend construction activity at rosemary arbor and lantanas edge
4668680 well at this point in time there is no demand there is a tremendous amount of foreclosures and the homeowners are opting to buy the foreclosures
4668681 like most other homebuilders during these challenging economic times we have been forced to reevaluate each and every one of our new home communities as a courtesy to our customers we have taken the proactive step of informing them that due to current market conditions we have decided to hold off for the time being on building out our rosemary arbor and lantanas edge communities in the interim we will reassess our product the market and when we will re open these communities we are very optimistic about the long term prospects of these communities and the bakersfield market
4668682 we are prepared to do whatever it takes to win a football game in respect of a football game
4668683 are we ready to kill someone to win a game no because you have to respect the rules in football the beauty in the game is to win in respect of the rules
4668684 can you win the league by playing completely non football i dont believe so historically it is proven that the teams who win the league are the better technical teams
4668685 the leading clubs have a responsibility to try to make the games attractive they can never be a long term target to play a dirty game or one which is not attractive
4668686 we want to play our game because we feel it is the most efficient way to win
4668687 it is always very nice in pre season and everyone wants to respect each other when it comes to points it becomes a bit different
4668688 the most important thing is the actions during the game
4668689 when you go to church on a sunday the priest says everyone has to be respectful and generous but when you come out of the church everyone is not generous and respectful
4668690 we will have to show on the pitch that you are capable of doing that but not only us so will every player
4668691 he can replace alex hleb in the build up of the game in the creation of the chances and also he is very versatile
4668692 i expect he will fit well into our collective game and that he expresses a good attitude is very ambitious and fights very hard for the team
4668693 you might be surprised whats going to happen in the next two days
4668694 improvement maybe will come in different ways for ronaldo next season 42 goals is a target again
4668695 its not impossible for him to achieve it given the mentality of the boy and his goalscoring abilities but its a big target for him
4668696 what you will see is improvement in his authority and his decision making which improves with experience experience gives better timing all these things
4668697 he never misses a session morning or afternoon its terrific were penciling in the beginning of october for his return
4668698 its the job of the money men hes one player who could play for any club in the world hes a fantastic player but i am happy with my players in chelsea if one or two more players arrive its better for us
4668699 if we lose to portsmouth it wont be because robinho is not here
4668700 its because we dont play very well hes just one player i have players here who could win all the games
4668701 we need to put fire in anelka we need to say look you are very good
4668702 i need to work more on his head than on the field with him but hes a very good player if he wasnt he wouldnt be in the french national team
4668703 hes played many seasons and made many goals he doesnt dribble too much but he goes direct to goal hes different to florent malouda who dribbles more
4668704 i was very very happy when two days ago he came to me and said mister i renewed my contract for five years
4668705 i said i want you here 10 years because you are a very good player and maybe after five years you can come with me as an assistant its fantastic for chelsea because he is not one player he is a symbol for chelsea and i think the fans like him even more
4668706 if the governor wishes to apply we would be honored
4668707 ive got a lot of challenging decisions ahead of me in the near term
4668708 there is an air of fear and intimidation at vcu thats not the vcu i know
4668709 i dont feel intimidated by him i dont feel afraid to say what is true
4668710 hes given his life to this place im sure that has taken a toll on him
4668711 he has put the university on the map where degrees are worth more to students
4668712 vcu has become a powerful engine to drive the quality of life in its home city
4668713 he has been a visionary leader working to improve virginia higher education richmond and most importantly virginia commonwealth university
4668714 the first thing that ought to be noted is that romney is the most intellectually inconsistent politician
4668715 thats very evident in places like san francisco which never got rid of its streetcar system
4668716 in years gone by people would move to cities to get a job
4668717 today young educated workers move to cities with a sense of place and if businesses see us laying rail down on a street theyll know thats a permanent route that will have people passing by seven days a week
4668718 we have to compete for talent and for place of national prominence
4668719 streetcars as we knew them will never again run in washington
4668720 boston and san francisco aided by the u s department of transportation have agreed upon the specifications for a new generation of trolleys to equip their remaining lines san francisco even has plans and the promise of federal money to expand its electric streetcar system as well as to renovate its cable car lines
4668721 maybe the reason passenger losses developed in the transit industry was not higher fares but elimination of trolleys it is an interesting concept how about a new trolley system instead of a subway with automatic i e reserved trolley lanes
4668722 a national transit holding company allied with bus manufacturing interests embarked upon a deliberate program of replying trolleys with buses in dozens of cities from baltimore to oakland
4668723 t he alienation between the united states and russia has rarely if ever been deeper
4668724 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
4668725 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4668726 georgia was part of russia for 200 years and what saakashvili was doing in south ossetia threatened the stability of the whole north caucasus
4668727 what worries me about this episode is the united states is jeopardizing russian cooperation on a number of issues over a dispute that at most involves limited american interests
4668728 earlier we drove to a town called senaki about 30km 20 miles east of here and it seemed the russians were very much occupying it
4668729 how long shall we stay in gori as long as we want to
4668730 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4668731 this is something that had it been about south ossetia could have been resolved within certain limits
4668732 russian peacekeepers were in the area that is true and russia initially said it needed to act to protect its peacekeepers and its people
4668733 but what russia has done is well beyond anything that anyone could say is for the protection of those people and for those peacekeepers
4668734 drove home the message by meeting with the separatist leaders of abkhazia and south ossetia
4668735 ossetians are killing poor georgians this is a problem and we are trying to deal with it
4668736 the wounded both local people and soldiers were taken to our hospital in truckloads we could barely cope there were loads of local people both dead and injured
4668737 mostly they had shrapnel wounds there were also bullet wounds though not so many
4668738 im not sure what kind of bombs were used but the shrapnel was as sharp as razor blades some shrapnel pieces were really huge i saw them penetrating concrete foundations
4668739 my minivan was stopped by men in russian peacekeeping uniforms
4668740 they threw us to the ground then put us back in the minivan and pushed more georgians into the car three men with machine guns came with us they told me to drive towards tskhinvali
4668741 the government says only 120 people have been killed but it is not true
4668742 in gori i saw lorries full of bodies being delivered to the hospital every day so many people have died why is the government lying
4668743 the russians dont realise that when russias foreign minister says something against georgia they actually make saakashvili more powerful and more popular since he was elected i have disagreed with many of saakashvilis policies but nothing that he or the georgian government could have possibly done can justify what russia is doing in my country
4668744 i blame the russians because it was them who provoked the whole thing they found some south ossetians and some abkhazians who have agreed to play their game
4668745 the russians still cannot get used to the idea that georgia is an independent state they still want to use us as their slaves
4668746 people are turning quite nationalistic and many think that the presidents decision was a justified response to ossetian shootings
4668747 it now looks like any chance there was of reconciliation is burning along with the houses
4668748 we were here four days and nights we couldnt sleep our whole building shook with the bombing
4668749 i just sat here with my 16 year old son
4668750 we were bombed for three days and nights if russia had not helped we would have disappeared
4668751 only russia takes us under its wing we want to be with russia
4668752 many ossetians i met both in tskhinvali and in the main refugee camp in russia are furious about what has happened to their city
4668753 they are very clear who they blame georgias president mikhail saakashvili who sent troops to re take control of this breakaway region
4668754 we saw no evidence to support or dispute the numbers
4668755 witness accounts and the timing of the damage would point to georgian fire accounting for much of the damage described in tskhinvali
4668756 i am not trying to get healed i am healed i am standing on the victory ground which jesus has given me
4668757 be konstruktive kritik an der bibliothek ohne resonanz k nnen die leute da drin nicht wissen was du willst

4668759 but not as open many unstressed syllables in chinese use the schwa ide a and this is also written as
4668760 you will only see this as in final only form
4668761 if they completely understand or picture what they are hearing or reading
4668762 me on jtv so that you get notified when i launch the broadcast so that you never miss out
4668763 the debate of which one is more powerful has been lasted for a long time
4668764 the description of the obamas life together displays no evidence of their connections to black culture
4668765 and what does the white world know about black people like the obamas really
4668766 the black middle class is the most invisible unknown group in the country
4668767 there are millions and millions of people in it and yet we know nothing about them
4668768 this camelot myth has formed around barack and michelle but they come from almost the opposite place in the world from the kennedys
4668769 if you saw barack on a yacht that would be pretty unseemly hes the guy from the basketball court who used to go around in jeans and a leather jacket in law school he was really uncomfortable with the markers of elitism like even dressing in a suit
4668770 whenever obama enters the room theres a sense of calm and satisfaction
4668771 thats a mask shes wearing in public most of the time and we arent sure what is underneath
4668772 the first time in my adult life im really proud of my country
4668773 how many dumps did i have to take today i took a lot of dumps today
4668774 i hired a campaign manager to win the servant towel award people like that dont deserve to win it
4668775 however in hindsight i think it might have been better to have told him in front of john macarthur so that dad would just say grace to you
4668776 he told me look we wont be remembering this at your thirtieth wedding anniversary
4668777 of course i start to breathe after somebody passed gas
4668778 jeesh just told a story about being hit on by an old lady
4668779 im like a fountain of wit or the fertilizer of said fountain
4668780 holy crap we lost 99 48 in the season opener i see they stopped worrying about updating the score list
4668781 do you enjoy making people feel retarded you behave like that is your job in life
4668782 stephen sounds so smart when hes on the phone what happens when he hangs up
4668783 if you were mooned while you were marooned you would be a mooned marooned moon
4668784 hey thrower thrower thrower hey thrower thrower thrower huck thrower huck huck thrower huck
4668785 well youre her boss and shes your your your whatever
4668786 its hard to fill a gas tank on the shoulder of the interstate in 4 inch heels while someone is mocking you with a camera but thats what happens when you dont think the gas gauge really means it yet
4668787 its been a while since i took geometry its been even longer since you took geometry
4668788 you know what else is strange looking at a total stranger who looks totally familiar then comparing life stories only to realize that you are the only common link it was six degrees of john letoto and it was hilariously awkward i think its fair to say we both blame your camera
4668789 ill be away from my desk invoking a john maneuver
4668790 there are limits on what i will forge for you mr letoto
4668791 the three worst words in the english language as a brother

4668793 aaahhh the wisdom five sisters impart i still get my kicks but i dont get kicked
4668794 yup i get all dressed up to go to the grocery store or city hall or whatever its kinda funny if id done that during seminary id probably be married to a preacher boy right now whew that was a close call
4668795 johns a little coffee press strong and brown here is his handle here is his frown
4668796 being older and still single makes you more single more single than say katie mohler
4668797 were talking about logic and about the law of non contradiction in worldviews and im pretty sure theres a law that says if theres food being given away and letoto is present then letoto is eating
4668798 yeah the pee phrase kept coming out of order something about how he peed in worship it confused me
4668799 i like how we just had an extended conversation about ryans buttocks actually i dont really like that
4668800 thats hawaiian harassment and i dont have to stand for it
4668801 shipping will be extra to hawaii alaska or any of the other non contiguous u s states
4668802 in some northern countries they can use their watches to tell the time
4668803 they never know whether to come out the front or the back

4668807 more liquid in your system makes the boogers come out faster
4668808 its like my car was trying to do a yoga pose my car was doing a headstand in a ditch

4668815 taryn walker sarah alliett and one more big one i cant think of
4668816 i mean are people thinking itll up their chances of winning the servant towel award by taking me or something
4668817 im not a liar i just bend the truth without realizing it thats all
4668818 oh my arm pits are sweaty theyre sticky and i dont like it at all
4668819 ive been married for five years and i think the gospels way easier to understand
4668820 one girl six locations that means shes either got a really active social life or shes just fat
4668821 you know what the worst game to play with my family is monopoly try getting a whole bunch of jewish people together and see how that turns out
4668822 they asked you if you needed a nudge after they jostled you
4668823 you know what i cant understand people who come here to work out and take the elevator
4668824 but if there was no jesus we would worship you

4668835 i have boyish charm just cause im hairy doesnt mean i dont have boyish charm
4668836 if anyone ever thinks about buying a leather jacket from wal mart its a bad idea
4668837 oh no i just remembered i didnt flush their toilet this morning
4668838 when she was pushing and i saw the head coming out i thought to myself itll be a miracle if she ever walks again
4668839 whats your type hawaiian cause it could be a while around here
4668840 i was trying to remember did i forget or did i never know
4668841 what do you mean were going to be a big bump on the skin

4668843 you know what i want to see you pull off a jacket with boardshorts
4668844 it seemed like it was something that wasnt widely understood or maybe that was just because i was talking to sean malinger

4668957 in the future the study of human psychology will be completely transformed by the darwinian approach it wont be called evolutionary psychology it will just be called psychology
4668958 not a single theory but a large set of hypotheses
4668959 has also come to refer to a particular way of applying evolutionary theory to the mind with an emphasis on adaptation gene level selection and brain comprises many functional mechanisms
4668960 mccains focus on georgia raises question of propriety after chiding obama he dwells on crisis as a president might
4668961 involvement in the military conflict in georgia appears remarkable among presidential candidates who traditionally have kept some distance from unfolding crises out of deference to whoever is occupying the white house
4668962 obama operative plants anti mccain hit piece in washington post
4668963 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
4668964 obviously more of this water will be traversable in more parts of the year so we want to find it before hollywood

4668982 the exercise will consist of a simulated fire within the tunnel and the evacuation of participating vehicles travelling within it at that time
4668983 the committee has finished its job and the draft of the charge sheet has been handed over to law minister farooq naek to clothe it in appropriate jargon
4668984 they have been charging an innocent man wrongly and about these charges we have only heard through the media
4668985 the media have been behaving irresponsibly and we think all news about the presidents resignation are being planted with certain intentions and motives he is totally innocent
4668986 every sane individual who has seen him the president at work is supporting this man who has dedicated his life for over eight years to the country and its people
4668987 he is as confident as an innocent man would be because he has done nothing wrong

4669074 i stay away from the tabloids im not going to talk about lindsay because shes my friend you know shes great shes also 22 years old i think people forget that with the internet the way it is one second were enemies one second were best friends one second were lovers and then were broken up
4669075 i just had to share something that came up today and it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach so heres the visual two paparazzi come up out of nowhere like usual and start throwing questions at me one of them being hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants wow
4669076 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
4669077 i was caught out of nowhere so i didnt really come up with the proper response at the time theres many other things that i felt like saying but why give it to a random guy with a camera so that he can make money all i am trying to say is is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4669078 the three actors were totally heroic coming in this doesnt happen very often where theres a tragedy like this and very famous very successful actors suddenly say ok well do whatever it takes to help they came they did the work they allowed the movie to be finished they didnt take money the money goes to heaths daughter thats extraordinary i am so glad these guys are so humble thats why they make a great addition to the film it will be bittersweet seeing this movie knowing he was filming it only days before he died this picture still hurts to see because as we all know he did die a couple of days after this picture was taken my thoughts will always be with heath

4669084 im not saying what hes doing there overnight let me tell you itll be by far the most provocative lady heather episode weve ever done
4669085 if a story line creatively needs grissom then hes totally willing to come back and do it
4669086 what cbs president nina tassler was really getting at when she talked about the character was that the new character has a genetic complex a number of different genes and elements that have been correlated with criminal behavior
4669087 hes an academic he has a background in clinical pathology
4669088 he decides that this might be an interesting way to explore himself he feels that if he has these genetic tendencies maybe a way to see if he has the ability to become a criminal a way to look at it is by understanding and studying violent criminals what they do and why they do it in a sense its like holding up a mirror to himself but in an exciting and interesting way its a new career thats really the angle were going with
4669089 you know we havent gotten to that level of really kind of nailing down the guy its really about a guy exploring who he is trying to use the world of solving murders and violent killers to understand his own soul
4669090 to me dexter is not a about a guy whos trying to decide if hes a serial killer he is a serial killer to me dexter is about a guy whos trying to decide if hes a human being its actually the exact opposite
4669091 our feeling is and you never really know til you actually cast it is that hes going to a more volatile maybe a little less predictable character than grissom but again this is in the very early stages
4669092 theres a whole segment of the fan base that goes crazy over this personal stuff then a whole segment of the fan base that doesnt want that stuff at all
4669093 you can never make everyone happy and if you try to youre bound to fail all you can try to do is tell a great mystery week after week after week
4669094 unlike a lot of shows that get very deep into their run we try so hard to remember what we are to never forget what we are we are not going to become a soap opera we are not going to change for lack of a better term the dna of what the show is because what we are at its heart is a crime solving mystery forensics drama that is what we are down to the tiniest molecule of what the show is
4669095 were not saying whether or not warrick lives or dies
4669096 but we will say that the premiere may be the last time our loyal fans see the entire original csi cast together
4669097 she has a very distinct personality a very wry sense of humor she doesnt take herself too seriously
4669098 this is a person who unlike the rest of our gang has not had grissom as a mentor so theres a very different relationship between riley and grissom
4669099 he will not appear on the landscape as a csi to begin with
4669100 hes a professor with background in pathology he will appear when grissom is investigating what will be a two part case he will help grissom and the team bring the perpetrator to justice and then this character will stay around and ultimately become a csi
4669101 billy will definitely be on the set for mr friedkins episode whether its behind the camera or in front of the camera is tbd

4669115 the graffiti and the condition of that bridge which sees 60 000 cars over the course of a day is deplorable
4669116 and its deplorable that csx refuses to do anything to improve its aesthetic value
4669117 whether their nervousness is genuine or political posturing we dont really know and it doesnt really matter very much we have to take it seriously

4669124 physicians assistants will extend the capacity of our highly skilled medical workforce
4669125 we need to provide the best possible training for junior doctors and for doctors to gain experience they must have opportunities to see patients and do procedures
4669126 we are concerned if physician assistants are increasingly used they could be substituted for doctors in some of these roles and the training of junior medicos compromised
4669127 it is an extremely harsh and stark environment to detain people seeking asylum while their applications for protection are determined
4669128 the very expensive security systems of the facility are quite unnecessary for the population who may be detained there

4669172 if you look at baghdad through google earth you can see that there is a black spot in southern baghdad due to the accumulation of the sewage there
4669173 there is a certain amount of righteous indignation i hold for this culture because to get back to the real root of it to get broader about it my opinion that is my species and my culture in america specifically have let me down and betrayed me i think this species had great great promise with this great upper brain that we have and i think we squandered it on god and mammon and i think this culture of ours has such promise with the promise of real true freedom and then everyone has been shackled by ownership and possessions and acquisition and status and power
4669174 and perhaps its just a human weakness and an inevitable human story that these things happen but theres disillusionment and some discontent in me about it i dont consider myself a cynic i think of myself as a skeptic and a realist but i understand the word cynic has more than one meaning and i see how i could be seen as cynical george youre cynical well you know they say if you scratch a cynic you find a disappointed idealist and perhaps the flame still flickers a little you know

4669199 a generation ago as a reaction from higher criticism and its offspring modernism there arose in protestantism a powerful movement in defense of the historic christian faith this for obvious reasons came to be known as fundamentalism
4669200 fundamentalism fell victim to its own virtues the word died in the hands of its friends the voice of the prophet was silenced and the scribe captured the minds of the faithful in large areas religious imagination withered an unofficial hierarchy decided what christians were to believe not the scriptures but what the scribe thought the scriptures meant became the christian creed christian colleges seminaries bible institutes bible conferences popular bible expositors all joined to promote the cult of textualism

4669203 if ye were of the world the world would love his own but because ye are not of the world but i have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hateth you remember the word that i said unto you the servant is not greater than his lord if they have persecuted me they will also persecute you if they have kept my sayings they will keep yours also but all these things will they do unto you for my names sake because they do not know him that sent me if i had not come and spoken unto them they had not had sin but now they have no cloke for their sin he that hateth me hateth my father also
4669204 because this people draw near with their words and honor me with their lip service but they remove their hearts far from me and their reverence for me consists of tradition learned by rote the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the discernment of their men shall be concealed

4669240 with the extra money the larger boat will bring you can buy a second one and a third one and so on until you have an entire fleet of trawlers instead of selling your fish to a middle man you can then negotiate directly with the processing plants and maybe even open your own plant you can then leave this little village and move to mexico city los angeles or even new york city from there you can direct your huge new enterprise

4669256 to do what he did today is a bit of a surprise but a good surprise
4669257 it was above my expectation because after he won at flemington we gave him a short break
4669258 i said to ben give him a good warmup and make sure hes on the go in the gates because he can flop out and be out the back
4669259 when he gets up to his right distance it gets too hard to win from those backward positions
4669260 i told ben to be positive and thought he would race handy but i was as surprised as anybody to see him lead
4669261 he did quicken off them good so it was very positive
4669262 hes in those sort of things and he certainly justifies the entry fee at this stage

4669328 the fundamental reason is that oil consumption by advanced economies has declined

4669330 there was further proof that the economic malaise that has afflicted the united states is spreading globally with the economy of the 15 nation euro zone contracting by 0 2 in its worst second quarter since 1995

4669335 this has quietly and insidiously grown into a big problem
4669336 its not a creepy guy in an overcoat pushing drugs this is about medications that are in your home prescription drugs are the drug of choice for teens who are trying drugs for the first time they are getting drugs from their parents or their grandparents medicine cabinets
4669337 more and more they are coming in strung out on prescription pill opiates
4669338 teenagers and young people across the country can often get dangerous drugs on the internet
4669339 we need to stop it and this bill would be a major step forward
4669340 you can get addicted anytime but the two most vulnerable times are adolescence and old age
4669341 a lot of parents arent very aware often they are the last to know many parents dont get their teens to us until their senior year of high school then they lament not bringing them in when they are 15 or 16
4669342 they tend to forget the pills are in there or they feel they paid for them and dont want to toss them
4669343 its an invitation if a teenager is looking for drugs teenagers are prone to experimentation and having the medication in the home makes it easier because it is free we need to make parents more accountable to their medications when you are done with them throw them out
4669344 preventing substance abuse among teens is primarily a mom and pop operation
4669345 it is inexcusable that there are so many problem parents who dont try harder who fail to appropriately monitor their children on school nights fail to keep dangerous prescription drugs out of their reach and tolerate drug infected schools for their children

4669350 i had also narrated it to anees bazmee when i was working with him during the making of karz the burden of truth in which i had written the screenplay and dialogue i have sent photocopies of the scenes copied from my novel i want my credits
4669351 i had given a break to amit and now that my film is a hit hes claiming ive stolen his story does he have the proof for it this is what success does to people

4669367 going to razorback sporting events is kind of a family tradition for us
4669368 theyre big razorback fans and we go to a lot of games and they like coming to practice
4669369 we taught them how to call the hogs at an early age and to sing the fight song
4669370 the potential for long term success under coach petrino is there he seems to run a real organized practice and seems to have a plan in place to make the hogs successful in the sec
4669371 the family considers cash to be jakes hero because without her we probably would not have had a body to bring home
4669372 as weeks went by we hoped hed walk back in one day like hed been on vacation or something
4669373 having cash now is like having him with us it is the silver lining
4669374 cash had to have found a water source somewhere the morning dew off of the grass or maybe she found a puddle somewhere
4669375 she might have even resorted to eating small rodents for water
4669376 it sounds like such a strong bond that this dog will kill or die so to speak for this owner
4669377 dogs are extremely loyal to humans i dont think there is any other creature on the planet that is as loyal
4669378 jake was trying to be brave for everyone and not show he had been losing his ground
4669379 there is a time for peace and that there is a time for war
4669380 they made it out like i was trying to move behind their back
4669381 thats nonsense why would i be trying to hide from my customers
4669382 its no longer the rite of passage it used to be when i was growing up
4669383 if you make an old man run you have to go to jail
4669384 i dont have a problem if they are breaking up a ruckus
4669385 i have a problem if they are just walking over to someone and saying show me your id i think they should be worrying about something else
4669386 i remember watching travis when he played northwestern in the jamboree as a senior in high school shannon told reporters
4669387 he caught a hitch route and went 90 yards and that hasnt changed anytime he goes one on one with anybody he can go the distance thats the kind of players we need on this team
4669388 throwing the ball to him reminds me of playing ncaa football on the playstation 3 and you hit the r2 button and he just takes off
4669389 the guy has amazing speed you throw the ball out to him and he always has a chance to go 80 yards
4669390 he reminds me of ted ginn the way he just caught the pass and ran up the middle hes just so fast
4669391 it was a bloodbath it was mano a mano the offense drove the ball down to about the 20 yard line and we kicked the field goal
4669392 thats how you want it to be treating it like its 4 minutes left in the game and you got to run the clock out so i think were becoming a more tougher team because of the addition of the fullbacks their doing a great job of blocking for us
4669393 we got six guys but we cant get caught like last year where we ran out of running backs the more we get those guys working the better off well be if they do a good job picking up the offense well be ok
4669394 he went lateral on me jumped up and grabbed the ball
4669395 as soon as it slipped it out of my hands i felt like i had a string on my arm and i tried to snatch it back and i couldnt
4669396 it was a turnover so i had to go and make the tackle to keep the points off the board i had to go through about 5 6 guys jump stiff arm them and then i eventually made the tackle
4669397 im the type of person that whatever coaches want is what i want
4669398 i didnt come here with a guaranteed starting spot no coaches told me that they just told me i had to come in and compete and thats what im doing and its a wonderful competition right now
4669399 right now in the first two weeks i feel like ive progressed a lot from spring im actually comfortable now with the plays i basically feel like im a sophomore or junior coach nix has been working with us booting and getting our heads around we do that we can see the blitz quicker and that makes us quicker on our throws i think ive gotten better with the team my confidence the plays and the things i got to do
4669400 you got the whole playbook in by now im trying to get all the little kinks out of it we had a few penalties in our 2 minute drill its hard to get going when you get that on first down i think were doing really good as a group though all the quarterbacks are feeling comfortable
4669401 how fast the game looks in my eyes its really slowing down a lot
4669402 i can use my abilities to throw on the run or throw in general and make my reads thats probably my biggest improvement
4669403 cannon smith got a series or two toward the end of the scrimmage about 18 plays
4669404 he looked normal he moved the ball well like he always does
4669405 i7 handle attached so theyll officially be intel core i7 processors
4669406 its a good feeling to be able to do something good for someone during a situation like this
4669407 i think it is important because you never know when you are going to be the one requiring help one day
4669408 when we are working against the clock with a 24 hour turnaround everyone is working hard
4669409 but it brings a lot of joy to do something good for someone
4669410 weve had some two a days and weve really been building their endurance they have some chemistry going at the forward and midfield positions
4669411 i think that will allow us to control the tempo of the game and allow us to enforce our style of play upon the other team
4669412 we graduated a four man unit that had been together three years
4669413 we dont have that this year but theyre tough and they know what theyre doing theyre going to get the job done
4669414 i think were going to be a top contender in the conference i dont think a conference championship is out of our reach
4669415 i think the previous years were just preparing me to be the leader
4669416 i just try to keep everybody motivated were a pretty tight unit a lot of us are friends outside of soccer
4669417 probably about our sixth game i should start seeing what our team is going to look like by the end of the season
4669418 the goal for the season is to make the playoffs second round and to have a 65 to 75 percent winning percentage
4669419 i think it is very important to get used to playing them
4669420 there is not going to be a doormat in the conference next year
4669421 we have to step on the field every time we play in order to be successful
4669422 i remind them every day that they are not champions
4669423 we let that one game at west carteret slip away which sort of eliminated any chance i think you have to remind the kids that if you slip up once there goes your goal you have to step on the field every time you play we cant take any team lightly
4669424 i think it is more of a re gelling year finding the right players at the right time
4669425 as the season goes he is going to get more comfortable
4669426 he will be a great component for us as the season goes and throughout his four years he has got a great left foot he just has to understand the game is a little quicker than what he is used to he is going to be someone that is going to be very special for us
4669427 he is always chiming in on different things during scrimmages organizing getting on people a little bit to remind them what to do
4669428 he is going to be a big reason if we are going to be successful
4669429 we are a week behind where we typically should be in terms of organization wise
4669430 because we are replacing the players that we lost last year and to find that right mix i would love another week to get the kids organized you need a little longer than five sessions to organize
4669431 i dont think we have that personality that a lot of very successful teams have like with the girls team where we had a lot of personality players
4669432 i dont think we have that player that is going to say give me the ball at this time and ill score a goal its going to be a collaborative effort
4669433 you worry about them you know its thrilling to say the least im amazed at how calm she is
4669434 we were about 12 and she was 6 and she passed us all the time
4669435 she dissed him right back its neat to see shes an equal
4669436 in a way this was a practice run coming in fourth at the olympics is absolutely incredible
4669437 i couldnt be more proud of her i think its a really kind of an incredible emotional experience for her you want to do well for your country its so much about the medals at this point im absolutely incredibly proud of her overall the entire olympic team is just so awesome
4669438 nothing too crazy oh yes ive been there with her
4669439 but i cant tell you how awesomely cool it is to be here
4669440 you always heard about the little girl who swam really fast
4669441 just to watch the look on her face she just looks so happy its a dream come true
4669442 this is a serious matter that should be thoroughly investigated and we are sending a letter to homeland security secretary michael chertoff asking for an investigation
4669443 while ice is conducting its own internal investigation homeland security has jurisdiction and we want someone with oversight to take a hard look at this
4669444 the conduct of ice agents guards medical staff and other employees
4669445 its clearly a violation of human rights we believe that its a criminal act to deny someone medical care and cause their death like that
4669446 ice may think they can get away with this all around the country but no not in rhode island
4669447 this is our state and ice is not going to torture people here we want our congressional representatives our u s attorney and our state attorney general to be with us in the statement that no criminal outrageous sadistic violence against a human being is permitted in rhode island
4669448 of systematic and routine denial of medical care for people who have preventable documented medical problems
4669449 takes great care to ensure the safety and well being of each of the individuals who come through our detention facilities each year
4669450 specific allegations that have been raised that mr ng was mistreated by officers while in custody of the wyatt detention facility
4669451 came as the direct result of medical care and special diagnostic evaluation recommended by the facilitys medical staff
4669452 will point out the facts that are already available to what happened to mr ng and express concern about the comments that have thus far been made by the wyatt facility
4669453 this is a serious matter that should be thoroughly investigated and we are sending a letter to homeland security secretary michael chertoff asking for an investigation

4669463 will point out the facts that are already available to what happened to mr ng and express concern about the comments that have thus far been made by the wyatt facility
4669464 but i am surprised by this i did not think the numbers would go down as significantly
4669465 but all you have to do is walk around the neighborhoods around here and see all the boarded up houses and given the tough economy my principals have told me many families are moving away to the south or the west or where they have relatives
4669466 i see two or three foreclosed homes on every street
4669467 many of these families drive without licenses and when the state police started stopping people earlier this year and bringing them to court people got scared also the economic situation in the state is grave the cost of food and gasoline and everything is going up many of these people earn just 6 an hour so all of this has created a situation where they cannot maintain their lives here
4669468 i dont think the executive order was signed in order to force people to leave the state although that could very well be a consequence of it
4669469 if so i say thats great congratulations to the governor because we are gaining something here in rhode island if its forcing some people to leave
4669470 it took me all of about 20 minutes to get comfortable when i came over here
4669471 these guys are unbelievable we have fun and we joke around so much
4669472 i heard about the camaraderie in chicago and it couldnt be more true i think thats one of the big reasons why weve been so successful
4669473 i guess you could say ive been anticipating the return to oakland a little bit he said
4669474 to come back and see a lot of people that i havent seen for a while is great but half of the guys that i played with arent here anymore
4669475 we are indebted to the physicians and caregivers at peking union medical college hospital who have done such a wonderful job providing barbara with the medical care she needed
4669476 we are also extremely appreciative of the support we have received from people here in beijing the united states new zealand and around the world the prayers and support have been a source of strength for our family during this difficult time
4669477 archaeological surveys have located that indicate the population was sizable by 5 000 years ago

4669479 could have difficulty maintaining their minority government much less winning their coveted majority
4669480 rare summer hearings into the tories in and out advertising scheme in the 2006 election campaign
4669481 in the past few months and particularly over the summer we have seen increasing signs that this parliament is really not working very well any more it is becoming increasingly dysfunctional
4669482 quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively
4669483 governing is more than not just being defeated in the house its also being able to pass legislation
4669484 is how democracy works of course there are fundamental laws to prevent this principle from violating basic human rights and so forth like our in the
4669485 and in the westminster parliamentary tradition charles i was beheaded because he refused to abandon the theory on january 30 1649 on a scaffold outside the banqueting house at whitehall in london england
4669486 requires elections on the third monday in october every four years starting with october 19 2009
4669487 parliamentary expert and queens university political science professor ned franks maintains that despite the new legislation under the parliament of canada act the prime minister is still free to request an election at any time
4669488 the canadian federal by elections on september 8 a monday will be held in two vacant quebec ridings westmount ville marie in montreal and nearby saint lambert along with the southwestern ontario riding of guelph
4669489 the conventional wisdom seems to be that if the liberals do well in these contests take all three seats e
4669490 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
4669491 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
4669492 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
4669493 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
4669494 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4669495 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4669496 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4669497 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year
4669498 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity
4669499 mesaba doesnt have to upgrade anyone other than plats so those seats will stay empty
4669500 there are no first businessfirst international business class seats available on nw65 in the amsterdam netherlands ams to new york newark nj ewr liberty market
4669501 and to think that i saw it on mulberry street
4669502 i knew right then and there that there was going to be some serious issues but there was no getting away from it
4669503 i mean it goes up pretty quickly and within a minute my truck was melting down
4669504 i knew something was going to be wrong right after i went through that big flame suddenly i could feel the heat through the cab
4669505 if the caps wouldnt have exploded off the tanks it could have been a big boom
4669506 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4669507 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4669508 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4669509 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4669510 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4669511 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4669512 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4669513 youre driving your car at 100 kilometres an hour you switch on the headlights is the light from your headlights now travelling 100 km h faster than the speed of light
4669514 the speed of light is a constant for all observers the light from your headlights is travelling at the same speed as if your car were stationary or if it were travelling at the speed of light
4669515 it has been tested to enormous precision in innumerable experiments
4669516 as the special theory of relativity shows time passes slightly more slowly if you are moving and this compensates for the velocity of the car we dont notice this effect at speeds we routinely encounter but we would if we were to travel at a substantial fraction of the speed of light an objective many drivers on the trans canada highway seemed determined to reach
4669517 as the federal public servant responsible for introducing a 100 km h speed limit policy during the 1974 75 energy crisis i can assure you that actual car efficiency was not considered in choosing 100 km h
4669518 not so drastic that provincial politicians would reject it outright i should note that the minister of energy for one province said that its citizens were simply unable to drive that slowly
4669519 i wonder why people say they lucked out when they win something rather than saying they lucked in as it would appear to me they are in not out of luck
4669520 we had a previous administration that had internal problems people around town kept asking me to run
4669521 were a community of older folks and people say old folks dont change but many of my supporters were older men
4669522 all the other cities in our area were flourishing and we were seeing ours deteriorate
4669523 women often dont feel like theyre qualified to run they probably are but they need to feel the push of someone asking them to run
4669524 women look more at whats not being said at underlying motivations
4669525 they tell you being mayor is a part time job what a joke
4669526 theyve made beijing a huge lab and a bunch of us on the sideline are excited over whats unfolding
4669527 the recent days have had very good air conditions indeed
4669528 its not that the anti pollution measures did nothing but their effect is a lot smaller than city fathers would like to admit possibly so small we cant detect the difference
4669529 the pollution plumes can be as high as 2 km to 3 km which has a huge impact
4669530 up at that height they can travel across the pacific in three to four days
4669531 how large and how rapid global warming is going to be over the next few decades may depend on how fast we unmask the pollution
4669532 obviously more of this water will be traversable in more parts of the year so we want to find it before hollywood
4669533 its very exciting its like an indiana jones adventure its searching for a lost under water tomb
4669534 our objective is to find and protect the wreck because they are in danger of being found by people who dont have the know how and the same intention and preoccupation that we have
4669535 for the first time in over 160 years i feel that the witnesses of the franklin tragedy events have a chance to really contribute to an important search party
4669536 two isaf service members died as a result of wounds suffered during an ied strike and small arms fire attack on their patrol in eastern afghanistan today
4669537 at this rate reconstruction will last 10 years and a generation of our citizens of our children will be raised in inequality because they live in huts and have nowhere to study
4669538 our goal in south asia is to seek a peaceful stable and prosperous neighbourhood
4669539 we wish all our neighbours well we welcome the strengthening of democratic forces in our neighbourhood especially in bhutan nepal and pakistan
4669540 and to bring a lasting and honourable peace in our region
4669541 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take the terrorists and those who support them are enemies of the people of india and pakistan of friendship between the two countries and of peace in the region and the world we must defeat them
4669542 whatever resources are required will be provided whatever manpower is required will be provided we are firm in our resolve to meet the challenge of terrorism
4669543 the challenge of communalism of extremism and of terrorism cannot be won by a nation divided
4669544 in this hour of crisis divisive politics will lead us nowhere i appeal to all political parties to keep the long term interests of jammu and kashmir in view and come together to find a permanent solution to the problems of the state
4669545 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4669546 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4669547 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4669548 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect

4669550 dalam sistem kita mana mana individu yang dituduh boleh membersihkan diri atau maruah sama ada dengan cara islam atau cara mahkamah dan saiful memilih cara islam dan kini terpulanglah pada rakyat menilai sumpah saiful itu

4669552 it takes a lot of time and it takes funds and all that but we know that we are helping the family through a tough time and showing honor dignity and respect
4669553 that is why you wear sunglasses truly because it is heart wrenching weve had the father of a fallen soldier come through and walk the flag line and come up to each and every one of us and shake our hands weve had the mother come through and hug us
4669554 i dont think you can control all the world from one centre
4669555 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
4669556 there are so many important issues like the nuclear issue iraq the caucasus afghanistan
4669557 iran is definitely having some influence of these issues so we are talking
4669558 we dont want to see weapons of mass destruction in this region
4669559 if its in our neighbourhood we definitely dont want to see it
4669560 i dont want to think about that everybody should take a lesson from what happened in iraq
4669561 i wish to see turkey as an island where the european standard of democracy is being fulfilled and the free market economy is functioning very well
4669562 this will be a real gift to the region to the world for peace and this turkey will be a source of inspiration for so many
4669563 as we are transforming ourselves in that direction we will not forget our natural links and relationships and advantages with other countries muslim countries central asian countries caucasus countries middle eastern and other countries
4669564 turkey is having a positive impact on them spreading the values of democracy freedom rule of law also the economic changes here are admired maybe that is the indirect influence of this country
4669565 in the last two years we spent our energy on domestic issues and the reforms slowed down
4669566 now after the court case there is a new era this is a big opportunity for turkey everybody realises that reforms are necessary
4669567 turkey has great capacity to influence the region indirectly very peacefully being an inspiration for changes turkey has been playing this role already this has not been appreciated enough
4669568 europe should realise that turkey can do more for the stability and security of the region
4669569 start with the caucasus last month the problem was not serious but suddenly we found ourselves in a war situation
4669570 europe should encourage turkey and not create some artificial problems during the negotiation process with us some member countries or some politicians should not mix domestic issues and strategic issues domestic issues are conjunctural today its there and tomorrow its not but the strategic issues are always there and we cannot sacrifice strategic issues for domestic issues unfortunately nowadays we see this kind of shortsighted policies in some countries
4669571 some call it terror some call it the south east problem some call it the kurdish problem whatever you call it we will find a solution
4669572 there are other problems secularism and anti secularism those things will also find solutions in this climate that is why i focus on the reform process the problem was this the lack of democracy the standard of democracy that was creating problems not only in the south east but in other issues that is when we upgrade the standards these problems will find solutions
4669573 but having a good relationship helps the stability of the region

4669579 i didnt think that i would be able to get tickets
4669580 it was something i wanted to do and when they called me yesterday to say that i had won tickets because i had been leader of a small group and they put me in a raffle ticket i was ecstatic
4669581 there was just an unfortunate situation where they promised there would be tickets available to the general public and they kept postponing the date on their web site and finally wednesday the big day they said all tickets have been distributed
4669582 i happen to have made a contact here and she was kind enough to find two tickets for me she works here so im very mixed about my feelings in general i think it was unfortunate
4669583 guaranteed the next president is in the room thats just unbelievable its exciting it really is

4669589 se voc viver cada dia como se fosse o ltimo um dia ele realmente ser o ltimo
4669590 se hoje fosse o meu ltimo dia eu gostaria de fazer o que farei hoje
4669591 im using jolbert cabrera in left field because i need another right handed bat against left hander paul maholm who is tough
4669592 dickerson had a little problem with left handers in the minors
4669593 with a younger player you have to protect him and his confidence and try to put him in a better possible situation to succeed dickerson will be back in there tonight against ian snell
4669594 i liked him in spring training you know and i thought he would be a very good complement to this team and he has been
4669595 i think thats the ball i hit for the double
4669596 so youre getting micah owings in the adam dunn trade
4669597 false information thats all i can say that makes me look like a jackass you never hear players talking about money i dont think about the offseason me and my agent dont even talk about numbers
4669598 thats great hes a little down and dirty dude he looks good gives a great target and he is throwing better than i remember in spring training and i like how he blocks the ball
4669599 in fact hell start friday against the cardinals either in left field or shortstop jeff keppinger shortstop looks like he is coming out of it a slump
4669600 after they scored that run on us in the first i told the kids not to worry because i knew we could come back
4669601 when we got to bat their pitchers were throwing a little slower than we were used to but it didnt take us long to adjust
4669602 starting out with a win is going to build our confidence big time
4669603 these pool games are very important because you want to get those high seeds for the bracket were after that no 1 seed
4669604 we have to get cueto out of that first inning with a lower pitch count
4669605 and their lineup rolls around quicker and you face the big boys again in the second or third instead of the fourth
4669606 if he has as 1 2 3 first inning who knows how deep he might go into a game
4669607 im just glad he got the win because he has been pitching great
4669608 this guy is a competitor he competes he wants it
4669609 it is refreshing to see him on the mound and he is controlling his emotions a little better and im excited for him and us and his future
4669610 thats what young people are supposed to do and he brought some speed the way he covers ground and runs the bases
4669611 it was so exciting i just dont know what to say i felt really comfortable and worked out all the jitters
4669612 we have a little verbal confirmation and at the time berry didnt know if i understood what he said
4669613 i got the sign from the git go and i was geared up because i know keppinger is a good bunter as soon as he made the call i knew wed get an automatic run
4669614 i got good pitches to hit and thats all you can ask for
4669615 i was able to put a pretty good swing on things
4669616 i saw what i hadnt seen in the first few matches which was that team unity
4669617 we actually had that cohesiveness tonight they played well together and liz engen has come in and done a fantastic job setting and she isnt even our backup setter our regular setter is out
4669618 weve got two sophomore setters and their experience consists of freshman setting experience and a jv setting experience
4669619 so we are still making those rookie mistakes that are no brainers for players that have been there for an extended amount of time i think that is the biggest frustration those little things that give the team another chance to start a rally
4669620 i think we are where we need to be right now with the experience we have
4669621 but i would like us to be a bit more aggressive which is another type of style of volleyball that we are looking for we dont need to give teams free balls so they can run it down our throats
4669622 it looked like we were a bit slow and sluggish but we needed the win
4669623 weve played a lot of volleyball this week so the girls needed this win
4669624 im considering this season a washout ill start all over next year
4669625 i wasnt throwing as many strikes in the fifth walked a couple of guys but mostly i wasnt making the pitches i needed to make
4669626 after michaels home run the rest of the inning got away from me
4669627 if im able to get the third inning before doumit hit the double and were still a 2 1 ballgame but i wasnt able to finish off the inning
4669628 those walks in the fifth by fogg is what set it up for the big boys to come up in the fifth
4669629 we know fogg is going to give you six or six and a fraction
4669630 he gave up the home run michaels and that made it 2 1 no problem but then he lost command of the strike zone and it turned into a big inning
4669631 were very young but have a lot of good kids even a lot of our seniors havent played on friday nights the potential is there now its a matter of bringing it all together we have two scrimmages and five non district games to get ready
4669632 because of injuries and needs last year we gradually went from a two back set to a one back in the midseason
4669633 thats what were sticking with were going to have a more hybrid spread attack traditionally weve been more of an i formation and knock you off the football offense so this is a big change for us
4669634 theres a learning curve with a lot of new players and were trying to work out the details of that style of play its new to the coaches and players so were taking a little extra time so far i think everybody has handled it really well the kids are picking it up and improving
4669635 ed is a great player who came through for us last season
4669636 hes one of the guys that has been there before and can get it done
4669637 we have some experience on the offensive line some size and some depth
4669638 thats a good group and were going to need them to work well together to make us go
4669639 weve run that 4 3 forever but theres a lot more spread offenses well face and we better play defense if were going to make it to the playoffs
4669640 again were young on defense but the athleticism is there you have to match that ability with gaining experience to be good
4669641 in 10 of the 13 years ive been at sweeny weve made the playoffs so it was unusual for us not to be there last season
4669642 always one of our goals is to be playing in the 11th week the kids want to get back to the postseason and have worked hard on getting us there again
4669643 a gente vai checar as informa es ver se houve uma amea a

4669748 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4669874 lovers repeated bartholomew goldilocks and i for more than a year now
4669875 wait wait said jack in a state of some confusion you were to great fanfare westminsters first openly gay mp and have remained a vociferous mouthpiece for all kinds of minority rights issues for the past twenty five years and now youre telling me youre
4669876 bartholomew covered his face with his hands and his shoulders shook with a silent sob
4669877 you dont know what its like he said miserably living a lie
4669878 utterly amazin this feat is how much courage it took for michael to do this how much focusing realizing that if hes just 1 10th of a second off one of these other swimmers could beat him knowing its that breathtakingly close still michael a greattttt american a true american patriot role model and just all round nice guy prevails because hes wearing that american flag on his swimsuit that super slick designed swimsuit by nike one of chinas largest businesses
4669879 when i hit the water i feel like a rocket
4669880 i can wait to race in it this is going to take the sport of swimming to a new level
4669881 unfortunately due to michaels performance at the melbourne world championships and the probability that he might reach that million dollar bonus speedo was unable to secure insurance this time around
4669882 we consider axcelerate a fusion between fashion and sport and weve taken something very authentic to the brand which is olympic hero michael phelps and tied him into a more fashion focused situation that consumers may find surprising
4669883 its authentic and aspirational fashion sports and entertainment are melding like never before its an area we are continuing to explore
4669884 all of us are excited about what michael is accomplishing and it will be fun to salute him in this way
4669885 no books by great olympians have done well except for greg louganis
4669886 at a time when world records seemed to have hit the ceiling of whats physically possible to wrestle out of the human organism phelps has been the man who managed to push the limits with his magnificent performance
4669887 the all time no 1 olympian or just one of many such belt holders
4669888 the latter is my conclusion because numbers of golds won is only one criterion by which to weigh olympic greatness not least because of the sheer number of scarcely distinguishable events open to swimmers though phelps will move another giant step towards the all time title on sunday if he puts spitz in the shade
4669889 we couldnt care less whether hes the greatest olympian ever
4669890 the truth is hes costing us a fortune and punters bettors just love him if phelps comes to london in 2012 theres a strong chance he could clean up again frankly were already dreading it
4669891 if michael phelps were a country he would be sitting fourth on the games medal tally
4669892 every olympiad produces its own titans athletes whose performances galvanize the worlds attention and whose names become synonymous in olympic history with the cities and years
4669893 god please let us make a difference like this in seymour and through out east tennessee

4669900 the people in the northern panhandle are just sitting on natural gas
4669901 there is a lot of growth and production in that area
4669902 generally there might be some liquids associated with natural gas

4669907 if we had seen a large drop in enrollment then we would be in trouble
4669908 about 80 to 85 percent of our first responders are trained at community colleges
4669909 many of the students there go on to attend four year colleges community colleges provide education often calibrated specifically to certain businesses
4669910 financing an education is a huge national issue i would imagine that the number of first generation students at wvu remains high

4669918 c stato un calo di reati in questi ultimi mesi ma non per i patti per la sicurezza che sono rimasti tutti sulla carta tranne i nostri
4669919 se bastasse la firma dei patti per far calare i reati sarebbe troppo semplice in realt il calo dovuto a diversi fattori tra i quali la fine delleffetto dovuto allindulto e certamente anche per una pi efficace azione delle forze dellordine ma ancora presto per fare i bilanci li faremo a fine anno
4669920 will republicans turn out for mccain when a lot of republicans are libertarian

4669928 that was for heaths camp i had the last laugh and the last words to say i mightve went a little overboard
4669929 if i offended anybody then im sorry uh not really
4669930 a lot of people lose sight of the bottom line this is a business its about making dollars by selling tickets pay per views and merchandise its up to the promoter to decide what is televised i just train hard then get in the octagon and fight
4669931 ive gotta be honest though i was kinda bored with this match
4669932 halfway in the third round i got up and left the arena
4669933 well i think gsps last fight definitely takes him out of the running anderson silvas looking tough bj penns always up there hes tough
4669934 we had a great breakfast and went out to dinner later that night
4669935 certainly one of the main topics was the possibility of having a fight together and the realities that we both face mainly that he couture faces and whether the reality of having a fight can happen
4669936 what i do is a sport if i meet randy in the ring i will meet him as a sportsman
4669937 i dont want to let the cat out of the bag but soon the next couple of month were hoping to get mma live on espn or espn 2 and the sponsors are getting on board as we speak so we should have a deal very very soon were all very pumped
4669938 like the rest of us our co host and analyst kenny florian is very excited about mma live the quality of the show its hosts and the audience that it is building we are very energized about the place mma live has in our growing original digital lineup on espn com but there are no current plans for it to appear on any espn television networks in the future
4669939 i love the kid but i kinda wanna kill him everyones telling me about this fasting thing you know as his trainer me and ray longo youd think wed be in the loop with it but the guy didnt freakin tell us anything

4669941 but the problem is that i will never put my foot in the octagon after they ufc tried to be funny
4669942 i would rather have bleeding hemorrhoids than fight for the ufc
4669943 i would go with obama hes younger hillary clinton might kick the shit out of both of them
4669944 corruption fragmentation and greed killed boxing when i started with the ufc i took all the shit i hated about boxing and changed it
4669945 that big mouthed bitch that clown back when he had the title he refused to fight chuck liddell he sat on the sidelines for a year and a half crying aww i dont have any money
4669946 hes not the best pound for pound fighter not even close but hes one of the four or five best heavyweights
4669947 but we all have to thank him for getting rid of tim sylvia hed been stinking out the joint the last couple of years and fedor did everyone a favor by beating him so easily and getting rid of him

4669950 i was shocked at the end it was kind of a little bit of a delayed reaction
4669951 i feel a little bit of everything relief excitement everything i had to take my goggles off to make sure the 1 was next to my name
4669952 when i saw the 50 58 and the 50 59 and i saw the 1 next to my name thats when i sort of let my roar out
4669953 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i had lost the race right there but i guess that was the difference in the end
4669954 i was starting to hurt for the last 10 metres it was my last individual race and i just wanted to finish as strong as i could
4669955 i think the biggest thing is when someone says you cant do something
4669956 it shows that anything is possible when you put your mind to it
4669957 it is imperative that we find mr alex jones recent legislation on homegrown terrorism made it a felony to criticize the democrat and republican parties
4669958 people who buy alex jones dvds will be in violation of the usa patriot act dont forget that with all of the laws we have on the books and the technology we have at our disposal we will be able to track all of your online financial transactions
4669959 senator obama said that we ought to all inflate our tyres and i dont disagree with that
4669960 increase in fuel use attributable to tyre pressure can be substantial
4669961 the correct tyre pressure gives a balance between rolling resistance traction and keeping the tyre firmly mounted on the rim
4669962 the moment tyre pressure drops rolling resistance increases which is bad for fuel consumption
4669963 if you cars recommended tyre pressure is 2 bar and you fill your tyres to 1 4 a difference of 60 kilopascals in pressure you lose 4 fuel efficiency
4669964 apart from wearing rapidly on the shoulders an under inflated tyre eventually overheats during driving
4669965 this can cause the plies the various layers bonded together to form the tyre to separate from one another leading to tyre failure also under inflated tyres reduce traction and steering control noticeably
4669966 another risk is that if a driver has to swerve to avoid an obstacle the lateral forces placed on an under inflated tyre can dismount it from the rim or cause the tyre to flex enough so that the rim touches the road surface this can result in a rollover
4669967 weve asked for a heavy police presence and banned alcohol and placards completely as well as being very strict with registration of delegates
4669968 the election of our leadership is a sober affair and everyone must therefore be sober if we suspect that anyone has being partying or drinking before the deliberations we will resort to breathalysers if necessary
4669969 already our province is controlled by government directors who all come from gauteng all the big 2010 contracts are given to gauteng companies and even chiwayos personal car has gp plates
4669970 if i was a thabo man then why was my name only on jzs list at polokwane while mabuzas was on lists for both thabo and jz also how can it be that i was also a key supporter of mpumalangas fundraiser for jz
4669971 it needs strong truthful and unified leadership that is incorruptible i have served in provincial cabinet in parliament and other senior party positions without any skeletons in my closet can my critics say the same
4669972 we need to re establish benchmarks and cut out the rot mpumalanga cannot afford to be a laughing stock anymore
4669973 i was shocked at the end it was kind of a little bit of a delayed reaction
4669974 i feel a little bit of everything relief excitement everything i had to take my goggles off to make sure the 1 was next to my name
4669975 when i saw the 50 58 and the 50 59 and i saw the 1 next to my name thats when i sort of let my roar out

4669979 it shows that anything is possible when you put your mind to it
4669980 no party has officially launched its election campaign yet so it is too early to predict anything decisive
4669981 even if they are unhappy with the anc they feel they have no alternative what is obvious from the results is that there is still no party that is emerging as a strong alternative to the anc
4669982 we see a pattern in by elections that we are taking anc votes but also bringing in new people who havent voted before they include younger people we seem to attract them but also those people who feel marginalised and neglected by other political parties
4669983 in the anc two things might happen a lot of people might be turned off by the infighting and stay away from the polls which is most likely others might vote for someone else
4669984 but the potential for us to capitalise on this disaffection might be countered by anc president jacob zuma as a populist he might bring people back who stayed away before because of the bad service delivery under president thabo mbeki
4669985 we are getting vibes from the ground that there are many members of the anc who are disgruntled they might withhold their vote that will weaken the anc and reduce their overwhelming majority
4669986 we are all worried it was a military regime the maaouya ould taya government that pushed us out and now its another military takeover
4669987 my name got passed around from a couple people and i got a call in january 2007 from washington
4669988 hadrian not only was he one of the greatest of the roman emperors but ive always found him one of the most enigmatic and fascinating characters in the whole of ancient history now at the british museum in london theres a new exhibition which sheds light on some of the key moments of this remarkable mans life im going to try and get to the places where these remarkable objects came from i want to learn about the empire that hadrian knew travelled around and dominated more than any other roman emperor i want to see the architecture that he commissioned i want to see the places that inspired him and above all i want to get to know hadrian as a man
4669989 the question i would ask is what precautions had been taken to keep the legs secured before they started removing them
4669990 who invited the trouble here who invited this arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here
4669991 not only those people who perpetrate them are responsible but also those people who failed to stop it
4669992 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4669993 politically it was just off base with the whole feeling over here at manhunt
4669994 boy was i embarrassed when i found out he gave 2 300
4669995 he said if john is too good for my money ill give it to presumptive democratic nominee barack obama
4669996 i believe mccain will be a better commander in chief than obama who also opposes gay marriage
4669997 if we have an experienced seasoned person defending the country in this dangerous age we will be able to argue about the gay agenda later
4669998 barack cant endorse this kind of adult content its sort of like a third rail
4669999 i would imagine if its tough for one its tough for the other
