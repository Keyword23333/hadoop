8280027 israel is the only country in the west whose leaders support the war unreservedly and where no alternative opinion is voiced
8280028 concern for israels safety rightfully factored into the deliberations of the main jewish groups
8280029 a compilation of nationwide opinion polls by the pew research center shows that jews are less supportive of the iraq war than the population at large 52 to 62
8280030 even if evidence does not link iraq directly to the 9 11 attack any strategy aiming at the eradication of terrorism and its sponsors must include a determined effort to remove saddam hussein from power in iraq
8280031 israel has been and remains americas staunchest ally against international terrorism
8280032 focus on removing saddam hussein from power in iraq an important israeli strategic objective in its own right

8280038 senior idf officers and those close to prime minister ariel sharon such as national security advisor ephraim halevy paint a rosy picture of the wonderful future israel can expect after the war
8280039 we have a long list of issues that we are thinking of demanding of the syrians and it is appropriate that it should be done through the americans
8280040 we could deliver a short message a two worded message to other hostile regimes in the middle east youre next

8280053 whatever value israel might have had as a strategic asset during the cold war that value obviously ended when the cold war itself came to a close the change was clearly manifested in the gulf war last year when what the united states most desired from israel was to keep out of the conflict to be silent inactive and as far as possible invisible israel was not an asset but an irrelevance some even said a nuisance some of the things that the israeli government later said and did were unlikely to change this perception
8280054 no other issue resonates with the public in the arab world and many other parts of the muslim world more deeply than palestine no other issue shapes the regional perceptions of america more fundamentally than the issue of palestine

8280255 and its all related to the uil realignment everything is going to cost more money so we have to look at every trip closely were being as wise and frugal as we can be with our expenditures
8280256 ours is not in the millions yet but its close
8280257 lake view makes a lot of long trips as well so that makes it doubly difficult for us its doubled what we accounted for but so far we havent had to make any cuts
8280258 were a member of the uil we support the uil and under the present policy of no fewer than six teams per district in class 5a there was no other choice
8280259 the other option was to move us into el paso or the dallas fort worth area and we probably would have been in worse shape
8280260 everybody wants to blame the uil but they hold the deck and they dealt the cards
8280261 this is an awesome and competitive league and were excited to be a part of it i dont know what the uil could have done differently it is what it is well show up and try to win no matter who and where were playing

8280265 he seems quite a confident lad if we can get him over in good time then i have no doubt that he would be involved on sunday at some stage

8280355 i spoke to prime minister manmohan singh this morning wednesday and expressed concern over the flood induced situation
8280356 i urge the central government to assist the state government in every possible way in dealing with this extraordinary natural disaster he said
8280357 assured me on this score and informed me that he was visiting bihar for an on the spot survey tomorrow thursday
8280358 i demand that the central government treat this as a national calamity and bear the full burden of relief and rehabilitation operations it cannot and must not be seen as a calamity of bihar alone
8280359 the first and foremost consideration of all political parties at this moment should be to save lives and alleviate the suffering of people wherever evacuation is needed it should be effected urgently and smoothly
8280360 these kids made it a crack house they made it a party house
8280361 there were hundreds of chicken bones all over the house both the toilets were stopped up with chicken bones
8280362 they must have had a smoke fire in here or a grease fire because there was soot all over the place
8280363 what appeared to be crack bottles were laying all over the house so they were doing some kind of drugs here
8280364 stealing is one thing and i can live with that

8280370 caregivers have similar cortisol levels as controls their cells seem to be hearing less of this signal in other words something goes awry in caregivers white blood cells so they are not able to receive the signal from cortisol that tells them to shut down inflammation
8280371 because people have traditionally thought that higher cortisol is the reason that stress contributes to disease but this work shows that at least in caregivers its actually the opposite theres too little cortisol signal being heard by the cells rather than too much
8280372 we dont know how to account for the resilience of some stressed people exposed to severe sustained stress or the vulnerability of some people to relatively mild stress
8280373 the better that we understand the underlying molecular mechanisms that link stress to illness the more likely we are to make progress in answering these important questions
8280374 we now report evidence that restoration of the functioning of the stress axis may be the key to how these new antidepressant approaches might work
8280375 these findings lend weight to the hope that crf1 antagonists might play a role in the treatment of antidepressant resistant symptoms of depression or posttraumatic stress disorder if so crf1 antagonists could fulfill an important unmet need

8280518 biden has been too cozy with the supporters of the iranian regime which is anti american anti iranian and has a horrendous human rights record
8280519 this is because the iranians instead of empowering the lobby supporting them undermine it
8280520 senator joseph biden said that even if iran was a full democracy like india it would want nuclear capability like india what the world needed to address was irans emotional needs he said with a nonaggression pact

8280564 the manner in which the deceased were shot was brutal and totally senseless two innocent and defenceless people in the prime of their lives were murdered by you i have observed the family members when they testified and almost all of them wept openly when they recounted the events of that fateful night your actions caused them so much pain three minor children must face the world without a mother because of your actions
8280565 h e had the audacity to demand the return of the pistol which was used in the commission of the murders that to me is not a sign of somebody who is remorseful

8280570 there are botswana vehicles driven by zimbabwean drivers without prdps some zimbabweans do not have work permits but only have residence permits a foreigner with class b is also in possession of prdp goods light vehicles
8280571 can p permit passenger permit holders operate as ba permit holders since ba permit holders transport passengers with bags

8280580 it was always kind of frustrating because the fans were usually about 12 and i couldnt do anything
8280581 refuses to play with me because he doesnt do pop
8280582 the lifespan of an artist is about as fast as it takes to log on to the internet
8280583 that paul potts dude who won last years britains got talent but maybe we would actually have been more popular now because the music business is predominantly made up of what we were always accused of being manufactured
8280584 i handed over the flame to them back in the nineties at the smash hits awards when i presented them with the best band statue or something
8280585 syd was my favourite id like it if he came to see us when the tour reaches england
8280586 we wanted to invite our fans back to the table and if anyone else wants to join us they can

8280593 we need to focus on getting the economic and legal fundamental right in nigeria in order to open the door to prosperity and growth
8280594 when it comes to the abuse of intellectual property rights everyone suffers the person in the street leaders of businesses international trading partners and the nigerian economy as a whole we still have a major problem with counterfeit goods of all kinds here in the country
8280595 theft of ip deprives nigerian professionals of the revenue they have rightly earned and the government of the taxes that can be derived from that revenue reinvest in the economy
8280596 we estimate that nigeria is the largest market in africa for goods that infringe ip rights around 80 of the international music cds available here are pirated even the local music industry sees 40 of its products being copied counterfeited or sold illegally
8280597 its often said that software is too expensive however a huge amount of revenue is channeled back into the research and development of products that help people do business the very same people that are complaining about paying for the software
8280598 id love to see a point where it is irrelevant and could be repealed because abortion is no longer necessary
8280599 but certainly in the short term or even the long term i would not support repeal of roe v wade which would then force x number of women in america to undergo illegal and dangerous operations
8280600 come september 7th we are going to god the almighty we are going spiritual about it we are going to have a national turning point outreach in celebration of what we are doing and appeal to god and the people so that the hearts of nigerians could be changed
8280601 if this could be done there will be a total transformation when the holy spirit takes over the affairs of every citizen of this country
8280602 if they begin to act to their faiths the christians believe they have to be honest muslims also believe that they have to be honest then the war would have been won

8280604 so far the embassy has not been able to protect its nationals from the frequent abuse they face in lebanese homes
8280605 i think the lebanese government should put a law to protect foreign maids or give us rights to leave immediately if we are badly treated
8280606 when someone holds on to your passport this means he is taking your freedom away from you if a maid is well treated she will not run away
8280607 and the iranian reaction would definitely make the enemy regret both its decision and action

8280643 people have been misguided in kashmir giving the politicians an opportunity the original mission is that the amarnath yatra should be conducted peacefully and with facilities all the kashmir leaders are saying this the amarnath yatra has not been stopped till date even when the militancy was at its peak in kashmir
8280644 recently also the amarnath yatra continued during the nine day shutdown in the valley and the kashmiris organised community lunches for the devotees during the shutdown when there was unavailability of food they kashmiris have been saying that they will never stop the yatra at any cost
8280645 every religious place should be respected and all the devotees should also be respected i ve heard that the devotees going to kashmir are given a warm welcome and provided with food and other facilities by the kashmiris there is no communal feeling there what i feel is that the issue is political
8280646 it is common people who are the real sufferers the politicians can use them any way they feel like politics has been working behind this issue amarnath yatra is centuries old so why suddenly such an issue has been raised why not the issue was raised ten years ago or 20 years ago or 50 years ago it is all politics and we cannot understand it what s happening is bad and all religious places should be equally respected
8280647 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered

8280650 to be selected as the technology that search marketers cant live without is a huge compliment search analytics is at the forefront of what marketers need today which is a way to more scientifically approach getting a higher ranking in the search engine results pages or serps weve focused our offerings in part on the longtail of search because it has the potential to help marketers maximize the opportunities inherent in this qualified traffic by doing so were giving marketers a big picture view of how they can improve their search result rankings and run the most effective campaigns

8280674 his speeches remind me of the sorts of summaries i used to write of interdepartmental committee meetings in canberra
8280675 he is very much trying to put himself in the howard mode of being a practical no nonsense politician
8280676 howard wasnt interested in weaving rhetorical spells around people but howards speeches look positively churchillian compared to rudds at the moment
8280677 at least you got a message and political philosophy from howard you did get a narrative you mightnt have agreed with it but howard was far more adept than rudd at getting up there and giving expression to his political philosophy
8280678 i think this is the problem at the moment with a lack of narrative what is the central binding glue that is holding this government together beyond being part of the reforming centre whatever that means

8280735 hace poco termin la mayor a de las discusiones y se cerraron los actuales convenios
8280736 los aumentos salariales pactados en las convenciones colectivas industriales son importantes
8280737 no se han dado en otros sectores ni en los trabajadores informales
8280738 la mayor a de los sectores industriales han finalizado hace pocos meses la discusi n y firmado sus convenios
8280739 hay sectores de bienes transables que est n en una situaci n compleja
8280740 muchos de ellos se ven reflejados en los aumentos de las importaciones que hubo en estos ltimos meses
8280741 en virtud de lo que hizo este gobierno y el anterior en todos estos a os evidentemente este es un tema que se podr resolver r pidamente
8280742 el concepto es una de las figuras de la ley
8280743 cuando hay voluntad de vender y hay voluntad de comprar la expropiaci n es una figura que no puede ser analizada si no resuelven primero esas dos voluntades para eso firmamos un acuerdo donde el grupo marsans dice que le quiere vender al estado nacional

8280751 its probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their child words baby and daddy in english papa in italian and tata grandpa in hungarian for example
8280752 the language centre of most right handed adults is located on the left side of the brain
8280753 this is consistent with our finding with new born babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently

8280779 rusia est tratando de cambiar las fronteras de europa por medio de la violencia si europa les deja que esto ocurra rusia lo volver a hacer en el futuro
8280780 advirti saakashvili quien reiter que fueron los rusos quienes iniciaron el conflicto el pasado 8 de agosto

8280788 this is the flagship match of the mcc womens season and were looking forward to a contest that will be of high quality and important for the development of our young cricketers

8280790 can nato which is not a state located in the black sea continuously increase its group of forces and systems there it turns out that it cannot
8280791 we cannot accept these violations of international law of accords for security and cooperation in europe of united nations resolutions and the taking of a territory by the army of a neighboring country

8280797 although we believe macquarie is a strong franchise with strong diverse businesses a sustained downturn will place substantial pressure on its operations
8280798 additionally given equity accounting of a number of these positions if the boards of these associates chose to write down asset values it will be proportionally recognised by macquarie
8280799 this is consistent with many of the write downs recently announced by babcock amp brown
8280800 although we see macquarie group as adequately capitalised we believe there is less flexibility than is widely perceived
8280801 an analyst is entitled to his point of view but hes guessing that financial markets wont be any different next time macquarie reports its profit
8280802 sure macquarie will struggle to beat 2008 earnings as it has said
8280803 first steps is more than a price first steps it all

8280805 environmental factors such as stressful life events may trigger an anxiety disorder more easily in people who have a genetic predisposition to the illness
8280806 previously addiction to benzodiazepines has been explained by reference to negative rather than positive reinforcement in other words the thinking has been that the reason people continue to use the medicine is that it helps to alleviate their distressing withdrawal symptoms and general discomfort rather than because it provides a sense of reward
8280807 our studies have shown that diazepam also affects the dopamine system which adds a new positive reinforcement mechanism of reward learning to the theory of benzodiazepine addiction
8280808 half of the children whose parents had difficulties in reading and writing found learning to read more challenging than children in the control group the atypical characteristics of these childrens linguistic development indicated the risk at a very early stage and we were also able to draw a clearer picture of the typical progression of a development that indicates reading and writing difficulties
8280809 acquiring the ability to read demands much more practice from these children than from their peers the automatisation of reading poses an additional challenge also a fluent ability to read is a prerequisite to be able to understand a demanding piece of text
8280810 a slow reader isnt able to grasp a given text as a whole and therefore has a hard time following the storyline this is why we should pay special attention not only to the accuracy of reading and writing but also to the comprehension of texts even with quite long sentences
8280811 and in a way that children find amusing even if they do have difficulties in learning to read
8280812 the best time to start these exercises is the latter part of the pre school age but its not too late even after the children have started school the learning result of course improves with repeated training more than once a day and in short sessions the optimal time for a single playing session is however long the children find it enjoyable
8280813 cover florida has received considerable attention but the track record for bare bones policies suggests that they will not attract many uninsured floridians especially when as with the new state law premium subsidies for low and moderate income consumers are not provided
8280814 this important step forward by florida reflects what many nationwide know all too well consumers cant afford the benefits lawmakers force on them
8280815 in many cases the good intentions of lawmakers to protect consumers by mandating benefits they cannot afford or do not want has protected them into the ranks of the uninsured
8280816 a major step toward bringing common sense to its health care market
8280817 getting rid of mandates for at least some policies allows people in florida to buy health insurance that best fits their needs at a price theyre willing to pay
8280818 eliminating treatment mandates doesnt mean the automatic elimination of the treatment
8280819 just because coverage for a certain treatment isnt mandated by law does not necessarily give the insurer the subsequent right to deny coverage for those patients who actually need that service most medical treatment is not specifically mandated by law
8280820 most medical treatment is provided because the individual needs it and the doctor orders it
8280821 new georgia and florida health plans unlikely to reduce ranks of uninsured
8280822 this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse
8280823 there is definitely a move nationally to usher this type of legislation through
8280824 government regulation that drives up the cost of health insurance is a significant factor in denying health insurance to the working poor
8280825 if government were to mandate that the only car anyone could own was a lexus it wouldnt be long before the poor lacked transportation sometimes people have to drive a kia
8280826 state imposed mandates force people to pay for more insurance coverage than they want or need and in effect place a legal ban on low cost economy model insurance
8280827 its like a hotel market with all hiltons and sheratons but no motel 6
8280828 the mean brain volume in preterm infants with abnormal blood flow distribution was 45 millilitres smaller than in other preterm infants
8280829 we examined tissue samples from preterm placentas and classified them according to the amount of inflammation found in microscopic examinations inflammatory reactions were seen in 45 per cent of the placentas
8280830 a genotype causing strong inflammatory response increases the risk of placental inflammation but on the other hand protects the child against inflammation our preliminary findings suggest that genetic regulation of interleukin 6 is also associated with the volume of the deep gray matter of the brain
8280831 in order for us to create treatments that can help protect the development of the brain its essential that we systematically follow up the development of preterm infants this should always be an integral part of the care of preterm infants
8280832 what in the world is that ancient custom i dont understand that
8280833 i felt god was leading me in a different direction i came with very little money
8280834 its been very rewarding the fact that we can offer economic housing for senior citizens
8280835 weve built or rehabbed probably 40 or 50 homes in the east dayton area and provided them for sale for first time homeowners
8280836 while you dont do all these things in the community to get recognition its pleasant when you do
8280837 is he willing to prevent evil but not able then is he impotent is he able but not willing then is he malevolent is he both able and willing whence then is evil
8280838 the turn to emerging markets is triggered by the economic slowdown in developed economies stricter regulations as well as the fact that emerging countries are rather protected from the impact of the u s mortgage and credit crisis
8280839 the number of small and medium sized investment deals will increase as tightening credit conditions divert capital from large scale acquisitions in the coming year
8280840 if there is a prolonged lag in investment and if the liquidity environment continues to be constrictive then it is concerning for the venture capital industry
8280841 as i look for deals and talk to people i have never seen a time in europe when there are so many good young companies being started
8280842 there is a lot of innovation in the energy sector right now and investors are trying to educate themselves on the types of companies out there before investing in everything
8280843 id like to see you for an hour whats your rate

8280845 its for keeping your car from getting stolen its for making sure your kids dont go where theyre not to nobody would ever use it for
8280846 a big bamboo as the opinion of the sexual power of swarthy men is widely spread all over the world

8280859 one of an leabhar mors great successes is its spread throughout and beyond the gaeltacht in scotland the education programme has taken the book to places such as aberdeen ayrshire and lanarkshire where children have been learning artforms such as calligraphy and exploring the connection between word poem and image this use of visual arts make the project accessible to gaels and non gaels alike and has enabled the exhibition tour to reach audiences wider still including australia canada and north america
8280860 whilst an leabhar is founded in the shared history and traditions of gaelic culture in ireland and scotland forward thinking and engagement with new media has always been close to the heart of the project the new website is a further step along this road that started with the live streaming of the exhibition launch connecting 8 art galleries online from the outer hebrides to the deep southwest of ireland as well as housing the entire work of an leabhar m r the new website allows even more ways to engage with this fascinating project

8280868 personally i want to become a better player and a better person than i was last year to make it a better season for everyone i plan to work my butt off i had an injury during the off season so that got me a little behind but thats okay because i still have two months before the season starts i will work my butt off for that so i can help the team as much as possible as far as team expectations i hope were all going for big ten champs but i think we all just want to do our best so we can get pretty far
8280869 probably ohio state because theyre always the biggest team and last year i remember they were one of the best ones in the conference your rival is kind of always the best one to play because you want to beat them and they have a target on their backs
8280870 i just remember one christmas my mom got me some highlight tapes of him and i watched them
8280871 i dont think i try to model my game after him but i do wish i could pass and shoot like him you always want to try and be like a great player like larry bird but its just hard i like watching him and i wish i could do the things he could but im my own player and no way do i want to wear those short shorts
8280872 well first of all its the kohl center so thats awesome right there we go to other venues and i always think ours is the greatest place to play the atmosphere is awesome and so is the general sports program at wisconsin i think the mens basketball team brings in a ton and i think that helps us too i love the big huge atmosphere its my home and its great to play for the states biggest school its fun that youre the center of it all when youre playing in the kohl center
8280873 its awesome i remember last year that helped me so much because ive known caitlin for probably 10 years played with her in high school and before that i remember one of the first days i was already overwhelmed and she said to me lin youre fine its your freshman summer dont worry about it all
8280874 if i could do it over again i wouldnt let my highs get too high and my lows get too low because its an up and down season to play a sport in college is very grueling and hard some days can be really bad some days can be awesome and last year i think i let that get to me if i had a really bad day it would drag on but if i had a really good day it would also drag on and if something all of a sudden would happen that would make me go back down it was an emotional rollercoaster and that got to me i think this year i have to realize that everyone has bad days and i have to let it go and if its good take it but always look at what i can do better or improve on next time

8281005 5 although some data from science can be interpreted in ways consistent with the biblical concept of creation we also reviewed data interpreted in ways that challenge the churchs belief in a recent creation the strength of these interpretations cannot be dismissed lightly we respect the claims of science study them and hope for a resolution this does not preclude a re examination of scripture to make sure it is being properly understood however when an interpretation harmonious with the findings of science is not possible we do not allow science a privileged position in which it automatically determines the outcome rather we recognize that it is not justifiable to hold clear teachings of scripture hostage to current scientific interpretations of data

8281026 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8281027 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
8281028 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8281029 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche

8281035 the lack of affordable housing for service workers healthcare workers and first responders is a well known problem with no easy solution
8281036 in a perfectly functioning market housing providers would simply increase production to meet the tremendous demand for what is generally referred to as workforce housing but housing is far from a perfectly functioning market high land and construction costs regulatory barriers and local impact fees make it virtually impossible to build rehabilitate and operate apartments at rents affordable to these workers in any mid to large size metro area
8281037 localities that want workforce housing and developers who want to provide it have to find creative ways to bridge the gap between construction costs and affordable rents
8281038 in some cases that means project subsidies in others it simply requires expedited permitting or density bonuses thats where nmhcs project estimator comes in it functions like a commercial real estate underwriting system and allows users to evaluate the financial viability of a project under different scenarios
8281039 users enter a projects financial pro forma data into the nmhc project estimator they can then apply a wide variety of incentives common in public private partnerships such as tax abatements expedited permitting direct public investment and others to the project to determine what combination is necessary to make the project financially viable
8281040 the first was to help the private sector find ways to meet the growing demand for workforce housing given the tremendous demand for this product there are many firms that would consider moving into the workforce housing market if we can help them figure out how to make the numbers work
8281041 many of the local leaders who now find themselves responsible for solving their communitys housing shortage do not have backgrounds in housing finance because they dont understand the economics of housing they dont understand why some incentives work better than others in various marketplaces the nmhc project estimator will give them a realistic analysis of different incentives and help them determine which ones meet the developers needs as well as the communitys goals
8281042 the nmhc project estimator represents more than a years worth of work
8281043 it has been rigorously tested and we will continue to refine it based on user feedback
8281044 they now exist in urban suburban and rural counties to find affordable housing many workers are being pushed farther and farther from their jobs this is no longer a tenable solution in an era of 4 a gallon gasoline and its not sustainable if we are serious about wanting to reduce our national carbon footprint and tackle climate change the apartment industry is committed to being part of the solution to the workforce housing by creating concrete tools for investors developers and local officials
8281045 there is such intense scrutiny that it takes longer to get a loan and there are more conditions at every step
8281046 instead of a quick 30 day escrow they are taking 45 to 60 days
8281047 lets say you were to make a 500 000 purchase two to three years ago with a 1 percent negative amortizing loan
8281048 the payment would start at 1 608 take the same loan today with rates up to about 6 5 percent on a 30 year fixed loan the payment today is 3 160
8281049 with 20 percent down you dont have to pay private mortgage insurance
8281050 you dont have to pay the fees that lenders are charging for loan to values of higher than 80 percent

8281394 i met with harry last weekend and had a dinner with him so i know so far he is very happy with his club
8281395 turkish football suits him its technical and they always attack and he is thrilled to be part of a new world new faces he is very happy
8281396 ive been there so i know what we can expect i was there with south korea
8281397 it will be quite a tough game they play a russian style physically they are strong but skilful and organised but okay our boys are used to it
8281398 itll be a hectic night they are how you say dark horses i know uzbekistan from the asian games in doha and asian cup and they were the first team to qualify for next round of world cup qualifiers
8281399 sometimes i find it hard to believe that i played the game professionally for top level sides for 20 years it seems like a lifetime
8281400 it was simply out of the question i spent all my youth with flamengo and practically my entire professional career im eternally grateful for having played a part in the most glorious period of the clubs history
8281401 one of the conditions i insisted upon was that i would be allowed to play in midfield which was my position when i started out in football im not a full back im a midfielder who ended up playing in defence
8281402 i knew that i could play on for longer as a midfielder i really wanted to enjoy that experience and after that id already made up my mind to go back to flamengo to finish my career
8281403 i was the last remaining member of that 1980s generation and so for me it was really special to play a part in winning the brazilian cup in 1990 and particularly the brazilian league title in 1992
8281404 the latter title was probably the trophy that meant the most to me because it helped me say a fond farewell to flamengo
8281405 i think i can only remember scoring one own goal in my career but it was so ridiculous that it should count as several it was in a brazilian league match against sport recife in 1991 they were on the verge of relegation to the second division and needed to win
8281406 i was in middle of the park and without looking up i knocked the ball back to our keeper gilmar but he was on the other side of the box the ball trickled into the net and we could only stand there looking at each other we ended up losing 2 1 how embarrassing
8281407 that said i knew i wasnt going to be a coach i tried my hand at it twice in 1993 94 and later in 1997 but i did it because i love flamengo they asked me to do it and i could never say no to them
8281408 when i used to live in italy i took part in a few tv programs and in brazil i took up the profession for good from the 1998 world cup for me its the perfect progression from a career as a player because i always loved analysing the game
8281409 and i think i managed to learn something in those 20 years out on the pitch

8281552 what republicans consider to be the greatest threat of the civilized world
8281553 good evening im from chicago the hometown of the next president of the united states barack obama
8281554 in the 2006 election democrats independents and even some republicans scored a victory that president bush himself called a thumpin
8281555 the truth is the bush crowd has been giving the middle class a thumpin and this november the middle class is going to give it right back
8281556 a strong economy depends on a strong middle class but george bush has put the middle class in a hole and john mccain has a plan to keep digging that hole with george bushs shovel
8281557 four of which sort of note will equal one whole note

8281559 were really looking to create a well rounded entertainment experience
8281560 the voters wanted medical marijuana dispensaries to be used for seriously ill patients and their caregivers not as million dollar businesses
8281561 the targets are those clubs that are part of a larger criminal operation where medical marijuana winds up being sold on the street and contributing to crime and violence
8281562 its something many activists have been looking for since the medical marijuana law passed
8281563 we only sell to patients we only get our pot in small quantities from patients who grow it and sell it on consignment
8281564 weve been on the front page of every major newspaper in the nation and have never been bothered by the feds because we are an open book

8281569 california has been hit by the financial and housing crisis more than most states thats for sure and the unemployment rate has risen over the last year and a half
8281570 you would expect that at the end of a six year expansion incomes would have moved higher instead were going into the next downturn from a lower point than where we started at the beginning of the decade
8281571 there is tremendous wealth in california and there are pockets of california that have continued to do extraordinarily well
8281572 thats part of the story of income inequality that continues to widen in california
8281573 the fact that its so expensive to live in san francisco doesnt mean we dont have low income people as part of our community
8281574 people who work as housecleaners and busboys in the city tend to live in other places san franciscos low poverty rate doesnt mean the city is doing all the right things it could mean that san francisco is too expensive for poor people
8281575 then it takes a couple of years of growth to see poverty going down
8281576 if we worked to eradicate child poverty it would improve the lives of every one of us
8281577 we need to create more jobs and have policies that encourage firms to hire people here as opposed to moving jobs elsewhere
8281578 we need to get opportunities to people in areas that are still struggling education is part of it but so are jobs
8281579 just because the legislature is late two months in doing their job of approving a budget
8281580 its time for the governor to stop sending letters and holding press conferences and start getting votes from legislators of his own party so that our state can move forward on these critical issues
8281581 i must confess ive stopped listening to the governor on what we should and shouldnt do
8281582 but the stage is set and right now today we plan to have everything up and running in just four weeks everything
8281583 its all about celebrating life because thats the academys mission and passion to show through every exhibit and program how science and evolution are fundamental to understanding the amazing biological diversity of our world and what we can do to save it

8281598 its inevitable because our brains were forming when we were around her
8281599 even if a daughter takes after her dad theres still a bit of her mom in her

8281627 having a personal or party videographers is a must nowadays videos bring back the events on how they were and preserves the events that you can never look back considering the significance of these events to you it is important to choose the best videographers in maryland videographers in virginia and videographers in washington dc dont hasten in having a videographer if you want to get the results you have dreamed of each memory is made to last and each event is significant that should be captured to become existential throughout the times with the advent of digital cameras and camcorders every events in our lives can be easily reminisce and can be remembered incessantly weddings parties proms graduations and the like are captured through the cameras lens and the memories dwell throughout out lifetime the search is on form a theme or idea that you likely want to achieve that will serve as your point in choosing a videographer look as many videographers as you can so you could separate the outstanding from mediocre if you already have a prospect look at his sample video works and decide if hes the one you are going to hire consider the videographers experience craftsmanship and personality for example when it comes to choosing a maryland wedding videographer you should determine how artistic he is to come up with fresh and unique video ideas and techniques videographer and client relationship is extremely crucial thats why you should be particular with his or her traits since youll be working with him her look for someone whos not only talented but has good attitude where to find the yellow page is a great option phone all the video production company and ask the terms of service and pricing word of mouth or referrals is another way to find a good company actually you can have the videographer you want in any possible ways but always remember the criteria that you should consider make sure that the company youve hired is a cut above the rest money matters the client should know how much to budget for while the videographers know how much money they will have to work with videographers differ in pricing that depends on their services and expertise the price or package varies on these factors number of cameras for your event hours of coverage editing techniques add ons and video copies given to clients video services any video will not run properly without a script documentaries news and short films need comprehensive scripts for it to deliver the thought it has to convey you can either have your own script or have a scriptwriter for your videos there is no fix cost for a script copy or write up but the script should have a complete spiel voice and video shot after accomplishing a complete script shooting is the next step usually the shoot is done by day to capture the natural lighting the shoot may be as small as hiring one cameraman with gear or a complete crew with cameraman lighting director audio technician production assistant etc the price for the shooting depends on how complex the video is including the location and technical involved it would be better to hire one or two news style crew complete with camera gear audio and lighting package any video projects wouldnt be complete without final editing touch up today a lot of state of the art editing styles are offered by professionals usually editing is charge per hour and vary on how complicated and professional you want your video turned out to be the quality of the final product depends on the quality of equipment and expertise of the video production company if youre on tight budget always assure to find both professional and affordable video company tips to ponder being a novice doesnt mean you deserve deceit and low quality work you should be wise in choosing and planning your video dont hesitate to confront the producer or editor whenever there are problems that should be fixed always ask questions and communicate well so you will reap the benefits of a good video product

8281629 im very pleased that we have been able to add a coach of mikes caliber and experience to our staff

8281632 if we can play the seven big east opponents and play in state rival marshall that gives us eight then we play east carolina if we could play four more like that where our fans could drive that would be great but we cant so well play a i aa opponent
8281633 i cant get border states to play us i dont know what to do heres my deal about a i aa you take a class program like villanova that gets a chance to play a i a football team ive been a i aa coach and i always welcomed the opportunity they say well you can get guys hurt baloney you can get guys hurt walking to class in the snow
8281634 as a i aa coach myself i always loved the opportunity to play the so called i a school the flip side of that is the i a schools if we could play within driving distance five opponents outside of the big east wed do that
8281635 one guy at a golf outing told me im paying i a money i told him to go get their governor or whomever from one of our border states to play us i dont know what to tell people i dont want to fly all over the country where our fans cant drive to a game if we cant get games close by us we may have to take a trip to colorado or to an auburn like we are
8281636 hell transform our energy agenda by creating millions of green jobs and building a new clean energy future
8281637 theres been a sea change in societal cultural and individual acceptance of cohabitation
8281638 a lot of the earlier studies were relying on data that may have been gathered in the late 80s and mid 90s were talking about a moving target the evidence is a lot more mixed
8281639 cohabiters 20 years ago were the rule breakers the rebels the risk takers the folks who were perhaps not as interested in marriage and using cohabitation as an alternative to marriage
8281640 we are continuing to get the pattern of significantly increased risk for cohabiters who began cohabiting either prior to engagement or marriage in other words people appear to be at increased risk when they cohabit prior to both partners being very clear about future plans to marry whether that is because they waited all the way until marriage or were at least engaged we are finding this pattern to hold up more or less in very recent samples including for those who only cohabited with their eventual mate and for first or second marriages etc
8281641 what scott stanley says about cohabitation in the us seems to be mirrored here in the uk ive just completed a survey of married and unmarried cohabiting mothers attending post natal clinics with their new babies even amongst the mostly well educated new parents who attend such groups the unmarried are more likely than the married to exhibit certain unhelpful relationship interactions these are new parents surveyed in the last 12 months

8281663 yngwie malmsteen legally changes his name to yngwie fucking malmsteen
8281664 he showed he could pass block he showed he could block at the point of attack
8281665 he showed he wasnt a liability when we put him on an island we didnt have to chip help every time he was over there
8281666 in the past weve had one deep and really didnt get into playing anyone after that
8281667 i could see with those guys being interchangeable because we intend to be moving pretty good on defense and the one thing we havent done is have the second tier guys get significant reps and perform at a high rate to keep the first guys ready to go
8281668 actually weve had kyle running with that first group for two weeks
8281669 he runs faster down the field than the rest of them
8281670 if i make him wear knee braces during practice he thinks im trying to make him into a slug it out linebacker as long hes a safety playing down there hes happy
8281671 snapping is something i do all the time so i dont even think about it

8281675 and the white man get paid off of all of that
8281676 im looking for them to be earned theres a chance im going to wait for a long time to hand them out thats something that we as a staff will talk about
8281677 whats a blackshirt mean if its just a symbol that you havent earned isnt that the point i think everyone wants to rush this thing its the same way as when i was here the first time i dont see the point to it if you just hand them out to hand them out
8281678 i really cant speak for everyone else but for me im on the same page
8281679 we have to definitely earn them as it has been every year that ive been here i dont fault pelini for setting that as a rule
8281680 its not something just to hand out because you are starter its something that you need to earn its a level of play that you have to consistently play at week in and out
8281681 there is a one defense out there but we really havent performed to a blackshirt standard theres no telling when well get them
8281682 theyre three football players that all have earned playing time
8281683 thats a great problem to have i would anticipate marlon will start the game the other two guys are good football players and theyre going to be out there some
8281684 im not trying to take anything away from marlon but youre going to see them a lot itll all depend on the way the game goes but its a good problem to have
8281685 coach gilmore and coach watson have the most experience in this offense
8281686 watson has worked with coach gilmore for a long time so hes got a lot of trust in coach gilmore and so do i hell be coach watsons eyes and ears on the sideline because he sees the game better from upstairs
8281687 ill be going to coach gilmore if i have any questions and watson calls me every time i come off the field and ill just talk to him and see what he sees and thats pretty much how it will go

8281695 despite several years of economic growth kentuckys families actually lost ground in reducing poverty improving health coverage or increasing family incomes

8281697 congratulated the jamaica olympic team on its impressive and historic record breaking performances in the just concluded 29th olympiad in beijing china
8281698 our athletes demonstrated in beijing quite convincingly the capacity of the jamaican people for exceptional greatness when we are provided with opportunities to exercise our talents as a people
8281699 that the majority of our athletes who shone brilliantly in the olympics actually live and train locally in jamaica with several of them having roots in some of the countrys inner city or poor rural communities further highlights and exhibits the magnitude of our olympic success
8281700 first sergeant hatley then made the call to take the detainees to a canal and kill them
8281701 so the patrol went to the canal and first sergeant sgt first class mayo and i took the detainees out of the back of the bradley fighting vehicle lined them up and shot them
8281702 then we pushed the bodies into the canal and left

8281705 hell bring quality and competition for places which is what we want hopefully we can take him to another level here at sunderland
8281706 he has come through the ranks at west ham and maybe just needs a change
8281707 it was hard leaving west ham because i have been there for 16 years but after meeting roy keane i knew it was time for a change
8281708 this is a great challenge for me and i feel it is an exciting time at sunderland i think the move will do me good
8281709 i have one more player in mind and then that is the end of it for a few months at least
8281710 do you think i would have appointed mr ota if there were various problems
8281711 what this government has also done in that area as its done across the government is weve instituted an expenditure management system where over a period of five years we comprehensively review every program and we make sure that were spending on priorities and spending on those programs that are most effective some programs in arts and culture have increased in funding others have gone down in total its gone up
8281712 can nato which is not a state located in the black sea continuously increase its group of forces and systems there it turns out that it cannot
8281713 we cannot accept these violations of international law of accords for security and cooperation in europe of united nations resolutions and the taking of a territory by the army of a neighboring country
8281714 there is no reason why joe public cannot do this save themselves a bit of money and help the environment because they are not using fossil fuels
8281715 whenever people have had oil they have been really really willing to give it its a waste product for them so we are taking away their rubbish
8281716 with petrol prices so high lots of people are looking for ways to reduce their fuel bills and this is a fantastic way to do it
8281717 those who dont read the newspapers are better off than those
8281718 we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal this was the moment this was the time when we came together to remake this great nation
8281719 iran radical islamic government known sponsors of terrorism developing nuclear capabilities to generate power but threatening to eliminate israel
8281720 they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us
8281721 you know iran they spend one 100th of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance
8281722 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8281723 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8281724 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt theres a pattern here
8281725 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8281726 nowhere in that speech did she answer the question about his character his ability to lead the things that are at issue here
8281727 and until she does youre going to have a lot of hillary clinton supporters that are either not going to vote or are going to vote for john mccain
8281728 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8281729 we are able to see the scrolls in such detail that no one has before

8281743 benefiting from high oil prices and effective cost control the companys net profit for the first half of the year increased significantly
8281744 i have to say that while this is the worst year ever for chinas petrochemical sector the worst is still not yet past
8281745 i can tell you the deal is a permanent one we are not speaking about a loan
8281746 this week ill be at monza for a test day on friday 29th

8281748 ill give it all to win again if someone has doubts as far as my motivation is concerned go ahead i want to win more than ever
8281749 fernando and myself managed to link up quite a few times against middlesbrough on saturday so there are definitely a few signs there that the partnership is developing
8281750 it would obviously have been nicer if one of us would have scored but it doesnt really matter who gets the goals as long as someone does and the results follow thats the most important thing
8281751 we know what a big game this is but then every game is a must win when you are at a club like liverpool
8281752 we want to go one further than last year and were confident we can do it
8281753 they were the better team on the night two weeks ago and you have to give them credit
8281754 it was a massive wake up call that they cant be underestimated they have some big physical boys who can also play a bit
8281755 we need to make sure we improve from saturday and see that were on it if not well come unstuck
8281756 its a massive game and we need to play very well but we know were at home and were at a better level than two weeks ago so were very confident well win the game
8281757 i would think he wont go to ireland we will look to the champion stakes at newmarket
8281758 he ran a super race on saturday and hes fine
8281759 i keep reading it but the sands of time are running out and there is no approach
8281760 clubs know we have no interest in doing any business there so i presume thats why they havent bothered
8281761 and i dont have any metal detectors to get in my front door
8281762 i grew up in iowa where we left our doors unlocked and our keys in the car
8281763 i live in northern minnesota where lots of folks still do
8281764 thats the way it ought to be but this is the way its become
8281765 it was a disastrous result for us really but fair play to northampton because they came here set their stall out and made it difficult for us
8281766 the referee has sent off gary cahill and i dont want to start having a go at him but it was a bit harsh because gary was committed to the challenge and wasnt going for the man
8281767 weve spoke after the game and we cant be happy with that performance we know as players that we have let ourselves down as well as the gaffer the staff and the fans
8281768 this was a massive chance for us to go on and do something outside the premier league and maybe get into europe through this route but it wasnt to be and now its all our attention to the league because thats all we have got until the end of december
8281769 now its down to us to make sure we stay up with the big boys and keep in the top eight from now until that time
8281770 and i dont have any metal detectors to get in my front door
8281771 i grew up in iowa where we left our doors unlocked and our keys in the car
8281772 i live in northern minnesota where lots of folks still do
8281773 thats the way it ought to be but this is the way its become
8281774 obviously they want to have a look at tom at loosehead and i am happy enough to play tighthead
8281775 there are a lot of guys vying for two positions and opposition is going to be incredibly fierce brendon botha is going to be coming in and he is going to bring his own dimension and his own ideas
8281776 i know clearly what i have got to do i have to get my aggression levels up i have got to be ruthless in there and get back to where i was 18 months ago where i want to hit people as hard as i can and get around the park and use my athletic ability
8281777 it was a tough year last year but i want to build again from that my job description is to hit people really hard make tackles and keep working for the team and obviously scrummaging is a massive part of that setanta readers comment of the day
8281778 really the way it has translated is that by the time it gets to the borrower they get no real savings
8281779 there are a lot of moving parts here and none of them are moving in favor of lower mortgage rates

8281783 if you party too much or you go out and drink too much or you mess with too many girls too much of something that isnt mandatory can sometimes be a bad thing it is possible to over indulge theres always an inner struggle to balance yourself thats kind of what the records about loving the life and everything that comes along with it but at the same token realizing that sometimes you wish you didnt love it so much because it can have a negative effect on you sometimes in the long run or the very next day which is the hangover its a love hangover it appears that im just talking about being in love with a girl and her treating me wrong and me still being with her anyway but thats not what the song is about the girl is just a metaphor for the rap life

8281787 the mutineer is based on the idea that the world of wine beer spirits and all fine beverages has been somehow perverted within the void that exists between maker and drinker this is a void that has overstayed its welcome and it is a void that has now found itself in our crosshairs it is of our opinion that the people ideas and culture surrounding the world of fine beverage are far more relevent and interesting than countless pages of beverage ratings we the mutineer will never reduce something as complex and beautiful as a fine beverage to a mere number
8281788 copeland borough council has a duty to provide temporary housing for the homeless and to help those who are homeless find permanent accommodation it is in respect of this that we have been working with ms farrington

8281825 the preference at the department is that we will use existing commercial reprocessing plants in the world for reprocessing spent fuel
8281826 in the medium to long term we will also look at whether its economically viable to establish a reprocessing plant in south africa but economically it makes sense in the short term that we use existing facilities
8281827 the contracting would be done by eskom not by government so i would be hesitant to give a figure

8281839 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8281840 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt theres a pattern here
8281841 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8281842 nowhere in that speech did she answer the question about his character his ability to lead the things that are at issue here
8281843 and until she does youre going to have a lot of hillary clinton supporters that are either not going to vote or are going to vote for john mccain

8281845 weakened consumer and tighter corporate expenses have not had an effect that matches the dire economic headlines
8281846 the current issue with the badge holder is the possibility of the badge holder becoming a foreign object damage fod hazard to flight hardware or a projectile hazard under certain circumstances
8281847 the badge holder may separate with little effort allowing the clips the front half of the holder and badge id to separate creating a significant fod hazard in controlled areas
8281848 personnel should ensure the badge holder is not worn or is properly secured in the vicinity of sensitive flight hardware such as electronics where fod may be an issue
8281849 when removing your badge do not point the end with metal clips towards your face or another person
8281850 the successful implementation of hspd 12 will increase the security of federal facilities and federal it systems this will provide better protection for the employees the information systems and the employees work products
8281851 im sure if it was for some kind of independent brand that wasnt as iconic as calvin klein i dont think i would have done it because thats too much of a risk
8281852 his location wasnt good he was up with the ball this wasnt one of his better days
8281853 he didnt have the usual zip on the ball but it was a struggle for him i gave him every opportunity to win a ballgame i was hoping he could get through the fifth inning couldnt do it
8281854 we would have loved to keep them this season as our main aim is to fight for promotion but at the same time we could not hold onto them if a great opportunity like this comes around
8281855 the players got knocks on the shoulders and knee its not something serious
8281856 its not a money problem its an attitude issue its discipline
8281857 thats what we have to change along with our spending habits
8281858 if you try to run a current account deficit and fiscal deficit simultaneously you expose yourself to enormous risk and volatility and would see a downturn in capital inflows
8281859 i have left because typical of cape town soccer it is difficult to be honestly respected for what you are worth if you are black
8281860 what happened is that the club bosses brought in another guy by the name of gary gary gibson ex hellenic defender that they wanted to work with meaning i was immediately relegated
8281861 so instead of complicating things i decided that it would be better if i left because it doesnt help trying to influence people who have their own beliefs
8281862 these are the kind of things that you have to live with in cape town if you are black so for now i will focus on my duties as a 2010 world cup ambassador here in the western cape while looking for a coaching job elsewhere
8281863 i left them because of the way things were being done at the club
8281864 they rushed to me and said that i will be reverting back to being a player this season the thing is there were circumstances last season where i wanted to play but that doesnt mean i now want to go back as a full time player how can i want to be a player again when i dont even have a future as a player
8281865 why not give me a chance to focus on coaching where i can contribute positively and consistently
8281866 i dont think that at my age i can play regularly in a real match situation i can obviously only show these younger players what to do when we are at training or in less intense friendly matches i did show them last season how to play when we were at training
8281867 dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8281868 harnessing the natural and abundant power of the sun and cost effectively converting it into energy is an important component of our comprehensive strategy to commercialize and deploy advanced clean alternative technologies to enhance our energy security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions

8281872 it was a tough call to make between derick chiliboy and bandise
8281873 but derick is our first choice hooker and he had a good super 14 i spoke to chili and bandise and told them they have to lift their game to be the no1 hooker
8281874 chili will be in the mix next week but he is not where he can be in terms of form we have identified a few aspects of his game that he should work on
8281875 pedrie has played at lock in the past and provides adequate back up for us
8281876 we know that we are a bit thin at lock but this game will be a great test for our depth wilhelm played in all 13 super 14 matches and juandr kruger was full of promise against the griquas i have a lot of confidence in both of them and they know they have a huge role to play in friday nights game
8281877 junior is recuperating at a fast pace from a left knee ligament but he is taking his time to warm himself into the team
8281878 this is good news since the egyptians have waited for long anticipating seeing their newly signed striker do what he knows best
8281879 he looks well composed now he is extremely happy with his current progress with the team and we are expecting to see more of those in future games
8281880 having said that i must also emphasise that in appointing a replacement we will be moving away from the old era of pros who used to dance on the pitch and run around in front of supporters
8281881 we are looking for a much more professional approach from a communications and protocols personnel
8281882 football is naturally in me and i know that i have the talent all i need is to be given a chance to work on my fitness which is the only thing that is lacking seeing as i havent been in competitive football for a long time now at the moment i havent received any offers but i havent lost hope
8281883 there is no reason why i shouldnt try to keep fit even if i have no club i always make sure that every day i work out with the boys from around where i stay if i just sit at home and give up then it will not help my cause because i believe age is still on my side if i am to revive my career
8281884 in south africa some of our greatest heroes are soccer players
8281885 they can and often do come from the most humble backgrounds to take on the toughest international players watched by millions of spectators and inspiring generations of future heroes
8281886 as an opportunity to entrench the samsung brand into africa where a large proportion of our growing market is based the nexthero campaign is designed to get everyone involved in the future of their youth
8281887 it is strange that the amount of money globally going into soccer tapers off so sharply at the grassroots level where so many children can be taught many important social and life skills through soccer and in this way become important future heroes on and off the pitch we rely heavily on corporate sponsorship and the nexthero campaign is really putting their money where their mouth is with real support through a project that has longevity and interaction
8281888 im elated i dont know what to say in congratulating our gallant countrymen and women
8281889 they have really done a lot in portraying a positive image of our country abroad
8281890 this goes to show that we as kenyans are able to sort out our own problems and move on
8281891 the athletes have hit the ground running literary and have been our great ambassadors in beijing
8281892 the chinese have a lot to learn from our athletics training methods and we also have a great deal to learn from their sports success we are already talking and we hope to implement some of the ideas we have soon
8281893 we have received overwhelming support from the government corporate organisations and individuals and it is these actions that have spurred our athletes on to their performances at the olympics
8281894 the fitness level of my players was not up to scratch because of the off season
8281895 santos is a very tactically good team but we managed to match them especially in the second half and equalised our strategy was to stop santos attacking from the back so that they could be forced to pump the balls from the back to the strikers
8281896 we also knew that they would play a flat four at the back so we started with three attackers so that we could stop them from playing the ball at the back
8281897 the boy has plenty of potential and theres a bright future for him in football and the club
8281898 im excited about the team we are keeping about 20 of our players because they are our investment those guys already know the system i can see potential and a good future for them as psl players the new signings bring with them a lot of psl experience and suit the club system
8281899 the new contracts were signed with development in mind without compromising our psl status our target is to exhaust our resources to remain in the psl
8281900 we understand his personal situation he is working very hard to come back negotiations are under way hell be back
8281901 i believe there is need for total commitment from the government in the development of sport in order for sport codes to grow we must have infrastructure and the government has to channel a healthy subvention to the bnsc
8281902 i believe once we bid for the afcon we will have a focused environment like what is happening in south africa because of the 2010 world cup infrastructure development will be everlasting
8281903 we are a star studded nation in our own right youngsters must desist from giving themselves nicknames of foreign players it shows lack of patriotism we have had great players in this country
8281904 the springboks will get worse if they continue in this way no one in world rugby is playing the way their coach is talking not successfully anyway
8281905 everyone has discipline policies and a procedure in their game the way he is talking is nonsense you cant just play an expansive wide game this is still a very good squad of players but what they need is the organisation and discipline
8281906 the hard thing for peter is that he has never coached professionally and this is one of the most difficult teams to coach theyre attacking off everything he has to change his philosophy because it doesnt fit these players it is not credible
8281907 if he learns he can turn it around but if he continues to be stubborn he wont last long
8281908 once we get the report we will be able to see the rationale behind the ban and then we will have 48 hours to appeal
8281909 but we have accepted that he will be out this week
8281910 bryan is looking doubtful he has not had a hamstring injury before so he is not sure how it should feel but he is not confident at the moment so we will see how he looks on thursday tomorrow and then make a call
8281911 es spricht nichts gegen eine fr nkische flagge auf der n rnberger burg spd kritik gegenstandslos

8281916 those who made the judgment regarded themselves as educated people

8281922 eine unterst tzung unserer schulen bei der vermittlung von kenntnissen ber das ddr unrechtsregime durch die landesregierung ist gut und wichtig allerdings darf nicht bersehen werden dass schon jetzt viele lehrerinnen und lehrer mit viel engagement und erfolg im unterricht an diesem thema arbeiten
8281923 bereits in der vergangenen legislaturperiode hat der landtag auch mit den stimmen der gr nen einen beschluss zu diesem thema gefasst wir bedauern dass er offensichtlich von der landesregierung noch nicht umgesetzt wurde
8281924 ich halte es nicht f r eine aufgabe der landesregierung ein konzept zu entwickeln wie bestimmte dinge im unterricht dargestellt werden geschichtsunterricht ber die ddr gibt es ich hielte es nicht f r gut den auftrag an die landesregierung zu vergeben sich ein konzept auszudenken wie das getan werden kann deshalb wird die fdp f r ablehnung dieses antrags stimmen
8281925 one of the poorest members of the senate biden lamented how people like him sit at the kitchen table at night worrying about how to get by in tough economic times
8281926 folks better vote for me because my partner here is pretty uncontrollable
8281927 joe biden served me admirably as my vice president and will show the same dedication in the same capacity for the united states of america
8281928 i am writing this letter to your good esteemed office sic letting you know that i will no longer be able to join you because i still have a contractual obligation with nico united
8281929 some theologians to speculate that specifically human life capable of receiving an immortal soul may not exist until a few weeks into pregnancy while in canon law these theories led to a distinction in penalties between very early and later abortions the churchs moral teaching never justified or permitted abortion at any stage of development
8281930 agrees with the church that we should reduce the number of abortions
8281931 suppose for example youre a voter and you have candidate x and you have candidate y
8281932 candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver
8281933 this is the kind of question that i predict and this heas nothing to do with whats going on now but i am just saying if you look at five 10 15 years from now you may actually see this delivery issue become a serious issue in democratic debates because it is so hard to figure out how to turn good intentions into real changes in the lives of the people we represent
8281934 what his strategy is to go around drumming stuff on obama his crazy quotes and hes cultivated a careful reputation for being eccentric and therefore hillary is not blamed for what he does and the result is he can go around and dump on obama and almost be like a negative greek chorus
8281935 to defeat barack obama and make sure hillary can get elected in 2012
8281936 one of the most unique and beloved figures in the democratic party and the country
8281937 talk about why senator obama is the right leader right now
8281938 bill clinton knows a little bit about trying to yank the economy out of the doldrums
8281939 it wouldnt make sense for me to want to edit his remarks
8281940 bill clintons place in the hearts of democrats is very secure he rescued us from the wilderness
8281941 we had been wandering there for 40 years having lost three presidential elections
8281942 now were turning a page barack obama is going to be our next president and i expect bill clinton to be campaigning for him
8281943 he will assert that role in any number of ways well see one of those ways when he gives a speech at the convention
8281944 if anything i wouldnt be at all surprised to see clinton give a very strong speech in support of obama
8281945 een dak boven je hoofd is zo ongeveer de meest basale behoefte van ieder mens
8281946 het is onvoorstelbaar dat ieder jaar miljoenen mensen op de vlucht raken omdat ze in n klap nagenoeg alles kwijt zijn dit probleem m et beter belicht worden daarom heeft 3fm dit jaar vluchtelingenhulp gekozen als onderwerp voor serious request het is fantastisch dat de gemeente breda daar ons dit jaar bij gaat helpen

8281948 burns patients need to have their bandages changed three times a week for up to two months and this is a very painful experience
8281949 the children are already anxious when they arrive at the hospital because they know the procedure is going to hurt
8281950 however we know that pain perception has a strong psychological component that can be overcome with appropriate preparation and distraction
8281951 it was important that the product took only seconds to engage the child and it was also important that the distraction lasted 20 minutes about the length of time it usually takes a nurse to replace burns bandaging
8281952 the whole form of the toy is the interface it has a touch screen and vibrating handles
8281953 children can choose a character who accompanies them through the games find and touch stories and sing along movies they can also take a figurine of their character home with them
8281954 they can even look underneath objects by tipping it upside down
8281955 thats about as big a situation as youre going to find poise is not a problem he deserves to be in those situations
8281956 oil markets are keeping a nervous eye on hurricane gustav with forecasts showing it may move into the gulf of mexico
8281957 this is what happens see i create this image and this is what happens
8281958 its very hard to write good stuff when youre pissed
8281959 without putting too fine a point on it it was really cool to be not into anything if you know what i mean we were focused on outdrinking
8281960 i wouldnt recommend it to anyone it was a very bad thing it was what consumed the wreckery pursuing that to the nth degree you cant be a productive artist and be a drunkie or a junkie it just doesnt work that way you cant sustain it
8281961 yet i wouldnt say ive got regrets about it it was something that was bizarre and interesting up to a point it was all part of the game not the game plan it was just the way it was
8281962 we stayed vaguely in touch over the years particularly hugo and i and we realised it was coming up to 20 years since the band broke up and we thought that was cause enough for some kind of celebration or acknowledgement
8281963 the wreckery fell apart just as it was getting a head of steam there was a lot of material we didnt get to do live we look at the brief tenure we did with the wreckery as an insane but fun time i dont think we were out to prove anything with
8281964 its certainly been great to be in touch with these guys its just a great feeling to have old friends to get back with old friends who youve shared something special with to do this project is a real thrill
8281965 theres a lot of tents around here and theyre all pretty big
8281966 how did you get this and how did you get here
8281967 is it ok if i call my boss and let him know where i am
8281968 the climate here is something special you get only a brief glimpse of sunlight before its all cloudy again the winters are mild but in summer the temperatures seldom go higher than 20c
8281969 manchesters main attraction is considered to be the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities
8281970 just dont have time to feel the joy of life
8281971 in russia and serbia the peoples way of life is similar
8281972 the only time to meet friends is at weekends but for football players its the busiest time of all

8281980 a lot of people came here just because they wanted to celebrate hillary
8281981 we get criticism because theres this idea that the election should move on and just leave her behind were not going down that quietly
8281982 we were budgeting and everything and it was getting really close to going
8281983 but the new head of hbo felt it was just too dark and too violent and too controversial which of course is kind of the point
8281984 it was a very faithful adaptation of the first few books nearly word for word they offered me the chance to redevelop it but i refused ive learned my lesson on that front and i wont do it again so im afraid its dead at hbo
8281985 i was never anorexic so i was never that skinny
8281986 doing shows and flying economy nobody ever fed me or id be staying in hotels so cheap that by the time id get in there wasnt any room service
8281987 i didnt eat for a long time not on purpose
8281988 youd be on shoots with bad food or get on a plane and the food would be so disgusting you couldnt eat it
8281989 you go to a show and theres no food at all so if youre doing shows back to back you can forget eating
8281990 i remember standing up in the bath one day and there was a mirror in front of me and i was so thin i hated it i never liked being that skinny

8282003 wat ik tof vind is dat ze de antwerpse metrotunnel zullen kunnen schrappen uit het blunderboek van het rekenhof
8282004 want dit is nooit een blunder geweest er was enkel politieke moed nodig om dit af te werken
8282005 hell go through the process but hes more unlikely than likely at this stage
8282006 hes running pretty strong but ill wait until the end of the week to decide
8282007 well go through the week and when we sit down next week well talk about next week
8282008 were firmly focused on round 22 and the essendon football club
8282009 its their tribute to a couple of favourite sons premiership players that have been magnificent contributors in an incredible team from 99 to 01
8282010 were playing an opponent that dug themselves out of a big hole early in the year
8282011 theyve been playing some exciting football and we know theyre more than capable of kicking over 100 points
8282012 we expect some clubs to come up with lame offers
8282013 if anyones serious it will need to be an exceptional offer
8282014 we had to give chris judd up for the third selection in last years draft because he was out of contract but daniel kerr is contracted
8282015 so wed be entitled to another pick in the first three as well as an additional draft choice inside the top 10
8282016 daniel wants it all on his terms and that is not going to be the case
8282017 everyone thinks hes leaving but we doubt whether any other club has the firepower to get him
8282018 i have meetings with every afl club every four weeks and at some stages they have brought up daniel kerrs name
8282019 i have to give credit to daniel because he does get a lot of negative focus
8282020 they represent a red tape barrier against the very public input they claim they desire
8282021 because home workers telecommunication needs are not strictly personal nor precisely business based providers have a difficult time creating a product strategy for these consumers
8282022 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8282023 we created some pretty good opportunities but we are not cashing in on them
8282024 i pretty much screwed it up every way you can screw it up
8282025 i dont think the hitters are going to be any different
8282026 just to see them i dont know youve still got to attack them like nobodys there
8282027 if im putting my bet up there i think carlos quentin or josh hamilton right now
8282028 for me personally it was a long night i pretty much screwed it up any way you can screw it up
8282029 my team expects me to get big hits and make big plays tonight i didnt do that
8282030 there are two kinds of people i dont trust people who dont drink and people who collect stickers
8282031 program on the latest developments of the convention in addition jason has
8282032 everywhere she goes michelle obama a native of chicagos south side and daughter of a city pump operator vouches for her husbands understanding of working class struggles the moment is more important than ever for obama who by all accounts rose from humble beginnings and isnt that far removed from financial struggle in his own life but he also emerged with ivy league degrees and ultimately earned millions of dollars in book contracts and it may be those details combined with his manner of soaring oratory that help fix the word elite in the lexicon critics use to describe him
8282033 i remember those days clearly sweating to get that mail that collection agency the loan debt people calling you telling you that youve got a few more days before youre in trouble

8282041 a new letter has been sent to tom cruise business partner united artists in which we set out the facts of the case again and put a figure on the legal demands of our clients of 11 million
8282042 our catholic institutions will not honor catholic politicians who take pro abortion legislative positions or invite them to speak at our functions or schools
8282043 i would say that as long as senator bidens stated position on abortion remains the same then it would apply to senator biden whether he was a senator or the vice president of any type of public figure
8282044 no one today would accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
8282045 wir haben die gefangenen aus dem wagen geholt in einer reihe aufgestellt und geschossen
8282046 i dont want to sound for a minute like i did all of those i didnt
8282047 but those were things that made a huge difference in the quality of northwest
8282048 however its taken them much longer it really takes time for all users students faculty and staff to become very comfortable with technology before its effective weve been ahead of the implementation curve for most schools therefore everyones benefited much longer
8282049 every time i would think do i really want to start over
8282050 i mean the reason they wanted me was they would say we want an electronic campus or we want the culture of quality type program and thats all fine but that means then i go back to square one and start working my way back up
8282051 once we had those things working and everybody was on board at northwest the pace of improvement and innovation was accelerating why leave
8282052 i think because of that the students understand that and weve grown tremendously because they feel theyre important here
8282053 we were the first institution to have a computer in every residence hall and now of course nobody could imagine a world without having a computer but we thought of that first
8282054 the questions got harder and harder and they finally got down to questions about the electoral college and there was not one question that our students didnt hit out of the ballpark
8282055 i was so proud and all of the talk about american college students dont understand and all of that well it certainly wasnt true of our students that was one of my proudest moments in education of my whole career
8282056 this has been a very congenial community with the relationship between northwest and the community
8282057 it is very positive i mean any issue that comes up i can pick up the phone and i know half a dozen people i can call immediately and invite them to come in here and figure out a way to resolve it
8282058 there is a number n such that an act is morally right iff either i it has a utility of at least n or ii it maximizes utility
8282059 but brian magalong chunks of sanity has a different approach in claiming what is due to him
8282060 a certain brian magalong related how he was suffering from a slow connection and his frustration with the call center accessible through landline at 172
8282061 i think it also pays to be polite with your complaints i think had i sent hate mails peppered with colorful cuss words they would not have replied
8282062 as negocia es por robinho continuam e provavelmente v o chegar a bom termo nas pr ximas 48 horas
8282063 the board of regents established the procedures they intend to implement in the search for the next president of the university
8282064 the process will involve the entire university we have established a plan that will allow interaction for all university division to provide guidance to the board
8282065 i believe the entire board realizes the major task at hand when the final selection is made we understand we will be establishing a new history for the future of northwest
8282066 i would like to see if it would be possible to see if using common sense what was done in the past that is considered wholesome and part of our community and to allow it to still happen
8282067 and if that cant happen im just one vote in the wilderness
8282068 seriously considering using a bubble of plasma to shield astronauts from radiation during long journeys through space
8282069 the outer edge of the egg form actually looks like an eggshell to me it appears to have a thickness of about a quarter to a half inch it is strong and resilient resistant to penetration and protects the field
8282070 the event is designed to provide customers with a unique opportunity to meet face to face with embarq staff to discuss any billing questions or possible service issues that they may have experienced
8282071 the event is also a great opportunity for customers to learn more about embarqs products and services including ways to possibly reduce their monthly communication bill through the bundling of services
8282072 we want people to get excited about this years united way campaign at the kick off breakfast
8282073 last year our goal was 90 000 and we only raised 83 200
8282074 we are setting our goal higher this year and hope to exceed that number
8282075 people will be able to become more aware of united way and the benefits of donating when they check out the new website
8282076 this year people will also be able to donate to united way through the website by credit card they will also find information about the agencies supported by united way on the website
8282077 people can watch the paper for more information about the upcoming fundraisers
8282078 our thermometer will be up this year at the usual location at the corner of south main and south avenue so people can trace our success this year
8282079 while the decision to plead guilty was made by the defendant without a plea agreement i am pleased that the result was reached without the necessity of a trial
8282080 this is the result of hours of investigation and work by the members of the maryville public safety department and the missouri state highway patrol
8282081 the charge of involuntary manslaughter in the first degree conforms with the facts as developed in the case provides the same result as the state believes would have occurred had the matter gone to trial and negates any claim of self defense by romig
8282082 the law provides that an act which caused physical injury but ignores substantial and unjustifiable risk that death would result is manslaughter even if the defendant did not intend to kill the victim
8282083 obviously our biggest bad is we lose our starting corner all conference special teams player
8282084 he broke his leg tonight hes going to be out for a while
8282085 we dont know for how long yet but probably at least two months
8282086 we just told them well watch the film and well analyze the film from there well make as many improvements as we can
8282087 weve got to do a better job of tackling we didnt catch the football we had a lot of dropped balls tonight
8282088 it is humid out tonight but weve got to make those catches
8282089 the results will be compiled to help with future planning efforts
8282090 if called we would really appreciate your assistance we respect everyones valuable time but it is an easy way for the community members to get involved and contribute to the downtown
8282091 overall the feedback we received has been good and positive
8282092 i think it has given us a solid initiative to start our revitalization effort it really is critical to get a good foundation set in terms of building that foundation to move forward
8282093 i really think we will get a good response were just hoping to get feedback on what they like downtown and what they like as a whole we expect to get a good idea on what needs to be improved and what focuses need to be first
8282094 we really want good constructive criticism about what were doing right what were doing wrong and what we can improve

8282134 people have been misguided in kashmir giving the politicians an opportunity the original mission is that the amarnath yatra should be conducted peacefully and with facilities all the kashmir leaders are saying this the amarnath yatra has not been stopped till date even when the militancy was at its peak in kashmir
8282135 recently also the amarnath yatra continued during the nine day shutdown in the valley and the kashmiris organised community lunches for the devotees during the shutdown when there was unavailability of food they kashmiris have been saying that they will never stop the yatra at any cost
8282136 every religious place should be respected and all the devotees should also be respected ive heard that the devotees going to kashmir are given a warm welcome and provided with food and other facilities by the kashmiris there is no communal feeling there what i feel is that the issue is political
8282137 it is common people who are the real sufferers the politicians can use them any way they feel like politics has been working behind this issue amarnath yatra is centuries old so why suddenly such an issue has been raised why not the issue was raised ten years ago or 20 years ago or 50 years ago it is all politics and we cannot understand it whats happening is bad and all religious places should be equally respected

8282243 that the economic gratification of a utility company is as worthy of as much protection as the sexual gratification of a married couple because neither is mentioned in the constitution

8282256 entanglement means being correlated as far as many different measurements are concerned classical correlations mean being correlated as far as one particular measurement is concerned that is why researchers usually think that when there is entanglement there are also classical correlations however our paper shows that you have to be careful about making this inference
8282257 entanglement represents excess of correlations over and above classical ones in other words whatever cannot be accounted for locally is due to quantum entanglement when you make local measurements on entangled particles then you will invariably be destroying their correlations both classical and quantum since quantum is in excess of classical it is possible that you can first get rid of entanglement but are still left with some classical correlations
8282258 imagine that i tell you that i am a billionaire
8282259 you would then infer that i certainly have 100 million somewhere in my assets you would be very surprised indeed if i told you that this was not true and that i am actually not also a millionaire you cant have more without have less as well by definition
8282260 the key is that we are using one particular definition of classical correlations which is in fact the main one used in the solid state physics and is used to mark phase transitions among other things
8282261 this is based on average values of a set of observables and the key is that this set is not complete however when it comes to two particles and two point correlations is what all solid state experiments are about then you cannot have the situation that we found with three and more particles namely if classical correlations vanish for two qubits then so do the quantum ones

8282316 people are confused and lethargic not simply because they are tired of hearing the gospel or because they have never really been emotionally gripped by it but also because they are confused they have not heard the gospel in a way that provokes a thoughtful basement to attic reappraisal of themselves and their world

8282318 interviews with the officials who were responsible for awarding the contracts revealed that they felt pressured by erwin doug lords and jeff lords to award work
8282319 lords stated that he had never awarded or had the opportunity to award a contract to cd amp l since he had lacked the authority in the positions that he had held he also stated that he had never showed favoritism toward cd amp l
8282320 he must have been through a lot of pressure from the press both the media and liu xiang himself should take the responsibility
8282321 in the end it really matters only to himself we are just the audience i am sure he is the one that regrets this the most not anyone else we feel disappointed of course but we still like him as a person

8282343 with a low c u ratio increasing popularity may simply bring with it piles of bug reports and frustration by all involved with few new volunteers coming in existing ones risk becoming burned out and the c u ratio continues to decrease
8282344 its sort of ironic that many of us got involved in inkscape to further the aims of open source with the intent of getting people away from windows yet since there arent enough windows contributors to cover all the problems particular to that platform here we are with an expectation that we spend extra time supporting it do not want
8282345 these comparisons are outrageous and offensive and have no place in the political process
8282346 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
8282347 we hope that john mccain will offer a similar condemnation as his allies increasingly practice sleazy swift boat tactics
8282348 remember 18 million people voted for me 18 million people give or take voted for barack

8282352 melbourne australia forensic scientists say champion australian gelding phar lap died of arsenic poisoning solving a mystery that has intrigued the horse racing world for more than 75 years
8282353 phar lap won 37 of his 51 starts before his death in mysterious circumstances at menlo park in california in april 1932 days before his death he won mexico s agua caliente handicap which was then the richest horse race in north america
8282354 arsenic poisoning has long been suspected as the cause of phar laps death but confirmation had been lacking until recently released the findings of their forensic investigation
8282355 researchers took six hairs from phar laps mane and analyzed them at the advanced photon source synchrotron in chicago finding that in the 40 hours before phar laps death the horse had ingested a massive dose of arsenic
8282356 phar laps mounted hide is on display at the melbourne museum
8282357 we cant speculate where the arsenic came from but it was easily accessible at the time one of the researchers said
8282358 notebooks kept by phar laps handler show the horse was administered tonics and ointments containing both arsenic and strychnine an accidental overdose has long been considered the likely cause of death
8282359 who done it the nagging mystery of brigham youngs last moments
8282360 in order to satisfy the feelings of many of our readers and answer numerous inquiries concerning the particulars of the last sickness of our late beloved president brigham young we publish the following arranged from reports made by drs
8282361 president youngs sickness commenced on thursday august 23 continuing the whole of the afternoon
8282362 at 11 oclock at night on retiring he was seized with an attack of cholera morbus the usual symptoms of vomiting and purging being almost continuous until 5 oclock on friday morning when at his own request a mild opiate was administered hypodermically into each foot to relieve the intense pain caused by the constant cramping of the muscles
8282363 during the whole of that day his sufferings were great continuing through most of the night but becoming less severe toward saturday morning when he slept for a few hours
8282364 inflammation of the bowels set in on saturday at 3 p
8282365 throughout sunday he continued both while awake and asleep to moan
8282366 on monday morning at 8 oclock he showed increasing symptoms of nervous prostration by constant moving of the hands and twitching of the muscles of the arms
8282367 during sunday and monday he had received at intervals of half an hour a tablespoon of milk and brandy an ounce of the latter to eight of the former
8282368 at 1 oclock on tuesday morning warm stimulating injections were given after which he thoroughly aroused and by the aid of his attendants got out of bed twice
8282369 this condition remained until about 8 in the evening when partial prostration again ensued and his case considered exceedingly critical by the attending physicians drs
8282370 on wednesday morning symptoms of approaching dissolution were plainly evident
8282371 not only the physicians named above but the members of the profession of salt lake generally expressed an anxiety to give all the aid in their power with a view to the relief and restoration of the president
8282372 on tuesday night about 10 oclock while lying in a kind of stupor his son john w
8282373 since news of the great mans departure have gone abroad messages of condolence have been received from all parts of the territory as well as from the different points of the union and from europe no earthly potentate ever reigned more fully in the hearts of his people than did president brigham young and throughout the territory while flags hang at half mast and civic and religious organizations vie with each other in rendering tributes of respect to the departed grief swells the souls of the saints
8282374 this report evidently was published to quiet rumors of poisoning however it is more revealing than the doctors at that time realized
8282375 after consulting with pathologists dimick reported that what you would like to know is who had access to his lunch that day it must have been arsenic and it had to be acute rather than chronic poisoning
8282376 dimick discussed the possibility of typhoid paratyphoid or bacillary dysentery dismissing them because in such cases he young should have been ill over a prolonged period of time
8282377 dimick enclosed tear sheets regarding arsenic from a medical text by authors louis s
8282378 whether by exhuming brighams remains it would be possible to ascertain if he was poisoned
8282379 the embalming fluid would penetrate the bones and hair after death as the poison would have during life
8282380 the embalming fluid would not contaminate the bones or hair
8282381 pain in the limbs headache convulsions muscular weakness and unconsciousness indicate an effect of arsenic upon the central nervous system nervous symptoms are numbness buming tingling or itching these are followed by fasculation muscular twitching or gross tremors with the muscular atrophy and paralysis
8282382 pain in the limbs headache convulsions muscular weakness and unconsciousness indicate an effect of arsenic upon the central nervous system nervous symptoms are numbness buming tingling or itching these are followed by fasculation muscular twitching or gross tremors with the muscular atrophy and paralysis
8282383 from the available material it appears that brigham young died as the result of ingesting arsenic this certainly does not resemble appendicitis
8282384 noted that in lasting a week brigham must have been a tough s
8282385 i have seen innumerable cases of appendicitis including the complications of rupture peritonitis and abcess formation i have never seen it present itself with symptoms such as those described for brigham young diarrhea is rare and continual vomiting and purging are not described as symptoms of appendicitis in summary one can say brigham young did not die of appendicitis that he had a massive generalized gastroenteritis is evident and is compatible with acute arsenic poisoning
8282386 belong ing to the school known as the new mormon history characterized by a veritable avalanche of footnotes but too often defending the faith rather than following the facts
8282387 if a medical student diagnosed appendicitis from brighams symptoms hed flunk out of school
8282388 pointed out that while the swelling of brighams abdomen in the latter stages of his sickness is suggestive of peritonids and ileus resembling the symptoms of appendicids
8282389 doesnt necessarily mean the condition was caused by a ruptured appendix because the corrosive action of arsenic may erode the mucosa and perforation can and does occur this in turn would insure peritonitis and ileus the violent vomiting and purging of the first few days would be typical of poison but certainly not of appendicitis
8282390 the muscular twitchings described here are also consistent with arsenic poisoning evidently the diagnosis of appendicitis dr dimick concluded can be made only by ignoring completely the first days of brighams sickness
8282391 i n a case of acute poisoning the digestive tract is inflamed and may show ulceration and the whole of the mucous membrane may be reddened with consequent erosion which may penetrate all the coats of the stomach and cause perforation
8282392 brigham had displayed the classic symptoms of arsenic poisoning for several days before evidence of peritonitis appeared
8282393 would have a most compelling reason to conceal evidence of foul play he was not only protecting the establishment stance but preventing a family scandal
8282394 it could be significant that seymour young not only had second thoughts about brighams death years later after brigham youngs supposed appendicitis had been discovered but that dr young dug back in his journals to 24 august 1877 five days before brighams death and penciled in the addendum appendix broke this suggests that the journal wasnt a repository for private and personal matters but was considered a historical record being written for posterity
8282395 was known in his own family that brigham died of poison
8282396 also told me that he had talked with the wife of apostle john a widstoe who was a young and she said that fact that brigham died of poison was well known in her family
8282397 it is a possibility that brigham had planned to form a young family dynasty to rule the church t b h stenhouse had accused him of this in the book rocky mountain saints evidence being that brigham had secretly ordained a son john w young as an apostle when john w was a boy of 10
8282398 subsequently in 1864 young ordained two more sons brigham young jr
8282399 confirmed in the internal press by reed c durham and steven h heath in succession of the church presidency salt lake bookcraft 1970 also by the lds church almanac 1975
8282400 the significance of this action is that according to the mormon system of the prophet replacement the senior member of the quorum of the twelve apostles would succeed to the office of church president upon the death of the incumbent
8282401 however if this was brighams plan it backfired the quorum of the twelve was outraged on learning of the secret ordinations of the boys and only one of the three brigham young jr was accepted into the twelve
8282402 by 1877 the last year of brighams life he was accused by the salt lake tribune of planning to abdicate in favor of brigham young jr
8282403 the gentile press had freely predicted that at the upcoming dedication conference of the mormon st
8282404 the ambiguous ranking of apostle john taylor was another evidence that abdication might have been planned
8282405 brigham hadnt abdicated at the st george conference very probably because of the recent execution of john d lee scapegoat of mountain meadows 20 years previously and the sensation caused by his confessions written after he felt betrayed by brigham in receiving the death sentence
8282406 the nation wide uproar at this time could have caused brigham to remain in control had he planned abdication at st george the tribune however predicted that he would abdicate in favor of brigham young jr at the next conference in october but brigham young died 29 august
8282407 brigham young could have controlled succession to the presidency only by personally stepping down in favor of his selected replacement dead the matter of succession was beyond his control
8282408 it is a fact that brigham and several other brethren in salt lake upon arrival at st george for the april conference had been felled by sudden attacks of violent purging and vomiting were the brethren victims of bad water tainted food or we must ask had something been slipped into their food
8282409 who done it well who had free access to youngs heavily guarded compound who would have given brigham his medication in the small hours and sat with him throughout the night who would be admitted without question to the sickroom at all times
8282410 the answer is inevitable members of his immediate family and in particular the nurses about whom the desert news last moments say nothing yet with vomiting and purging being almost continuous the first few days the patient needed a great deal of attention
8282411 the women of the household would have been busy with bedpans with changing sheets with keeping the patient clean and as comfortable as possible
8282412 in looking for someone who would have been in position and with a motive to have put arsenic in brighams lunch on thursday and very possibly to have also given additional doses at the bedside during the week of his sickness we must examine those who were very close
8282413 t he guilty person had to be someone living in the lion beehive house complex
8282414 we must remember that there would have been an impelling motive for such an act
8282415 who of this select group would have both opportunity and an immediate impelling and overwhelming motive
8282416 what is important is not the actual name of ms
8282417 the threat to her daughter a beautiful girl of 17
8282418 in the event more than one dose was required because brigham was a tough s o b consider the tea served to settle his stomach during his weeks sickness and also the medication a mixture of brandy and milk there was ample opportunity
8282419 whether or not the identity of the culprit was suspected i have no way of knowing though her unhappy fate subsequently would have indicated that she was tormented by conscience or harassed by family rumor
8282420 and so the case stands officially brigham young died of appendicitis impartial medical evidence says arsenic poisoning and like the case of jack the ripper the full facts may never be known
8282421 they only work four and a half days each week every day there are two coffee breaks and no one can suffer any discomfort because of human rights

8282429 i am comfortable with the current policy i believe we need to give the second half of 2008 a little time to see if the scenario that i personally am counting on plays out more or less according to plan
8282430 many markets continue to be strained it seems to me that we have to continue to be very vigilant about the status of the financial markets and their potential negative impact on the general economy
8282431 the banking system is experiencing a lot of strain and some banks are in very difficult circumstances we continue to monitor banks in this particular part of the country and a number of them are facing liquidity strains and asset quality strains
8282432 with weak growth and financial market strains i believe the most likely outcome is that both headline and core inflation will diminish over the rest of 2008 and into next year as the temporary effects of energy and food price increases abate
8282433 i think the stabilization of the dollar which we hope will hold the stabilization has helped and the inter play between the dollar and commodity prices might also have an influence on the dampening of those pressures
8282434 the almost 30 drop in oil prices has certainly helped and we believe it will play through to the headline inflation number in the second half of 2008
8282435 if overall prices do not moderate in the near term as i expect inflation expectations could become unmoored
8282436 inflation expectations may have risen modestly but not by a material degree
8282437 let me emphasize that i am mindful of todays elevated risks and am prepared at any point to change tactics to ensure inflation expectations do not become unanchored
8282438 the risk must be that in time the combination of slowing global growth and a stronger dollar crimps exports but for now they are the lifeline
8282439 most of the increase in capital spending implied by these data is being undertaken by companies benefiting from the export boom the domestic economy remains very weak indeed

8282451 moldova should draw its own positive conclusions after the conflict in south ossetia
8282452 it is simply impossible to have moldova behave in a similar way to georgia
8282453 i believe that in moldova the leaders will use their wisdom to not allow such a bloody and catastrophic trend of events
8282454 there is no intention to escalate the situation in the security zone a demilitarized area along the dniester river and i believe that there shouldnt be any
8282455 you talk about that as a dead end silo while selling end to end business processes
8282456 i dont think it will lead to an increase in demand for siebel
8282457 i expect this is a strategy by oracle to keep its siebel customers from looking outside of the barn
8282458 the entire industry has to get better at making money selling on demand thats what were focused on before we scale the business

8282477 with great openness and courage we need to question how widespread is the culture of life today among individual christians families groups and communities in our dioceses
8282478 i have heard it expressed many times that the obvious rejection of the churchs teaching on contraception by many catholic couples is an apparent expression of the sensus fidelium what the catholic faithful sense to be the catholic faith and consequently the church should drop its opposition to it and adopt a more permissive attitude
8282479 regarded as lawful by married people in the solution of a particular family difficulty
8282480 a contraceptive is abortifacient literally causing abortion when one of its modes of action is to precipitate the destruction of the developing embryo for example intrauterine devices prevent the implantation of the embryo in the uterine lining and hence cause its destruction
8282481 the church has richly developed her doctrine on marital love seen in pope john paul iis comprehensive theology of the body the deepening understanding of marriage as a covenant and the billings ovulation method
8282482 the advocates and apologists for the culture of death dismissively accuse catholics of being indoctrinated or brain washed
8282483 every crucifix in church and home proclaims the victory of life over the culture of death the paschal mystery of christ eucharist passion death and resurrection are the ultimate expression of the law of self gift
8282484 at every opportunity proclaim the right to life the most fundamental human right that underpins authentic work for justice and peace

8282486 the section 9 9 on the bishops conference is but a very small part of the document there are far more important parts
8282487 we must keep it clearly in mind that the bishop is not the manager of his local branch of the catholic church who reports to the board of the national episcopal conference

8282533 vividly recounts the saga of the ancient israelites and digs deeply into both the bible and the history of the israelites through the archeological artifacts they left behind
8282534 these stories are unlikely to represent real historical events but rather theres some kernel of ancient experience in there which has survived and which helps give identity to the people at the time the bible finally took shape centuries and centuries later

8282542 if god is all good and all powerful why is there so much intense unequally distributed suffering of innocents
8282543 god allows only that evil in this world from which he can bring about a greater good or prevent a worse evil
8282544 if god allows evil to bring about a good is that good a necessary good
8282545 god allows the evil because in the end his judgment of the wicked will bring glory to himself
8282546 why did not god actualize a world with less evil a better world we might say

8282573 there are more horror themes on all levels than before
8282574 the lyrics in particular are more like horror stories than before
8282575 the music is guitar based rock just the way a rock band should be the album features sounds from the 80s hammond style organs and a bit of rob zombie style as well all the experiences weve had and people weve met touring the world during the last few years have had their influences on the album
8282576 it expresses a longing an underlying sadness for something or someone thats been missing in your life and never quite sure if it will ever return in this case for us its rock and roll saudades de rock
8282577 i like how it expresses that longing weve been feeling to play for our fans and be together again
8282578 with more tickets sold for this years damnation festival in the first month than we managed in the whole of last year it was a simple choice lock out the fans or take the plunge and add the huge 2 000 capacity refectory will now host three stages rammed with talent and were delighted to welcome rock sound on board as our newest partners theyve been at the forefront of breaking bands for over a decade and we pride ourselves on doing the same
8282579 wed been working with jeff balding job but we knew we needed something else to give the material that extra push so we brought in andy it was cool because he isnt like some big rock star producer he was just another joe to me so we were trading jokes and laughing and it was fun my sense of humour is pretty close to a british one so we worked well together also andy told me i was the reason that he got into playing metal in the first place which was really flattering
8282580 15 track extravaganza that frequently echoes the down and dirty rock nroll of its iconic 1980 album
8282581 after developing a good friendship from touring and hanging out it was inevitable that we would gravitate towards musical conversation rather than just conversation its very similar to my fabulous friendship relationship partnership with adrian vandenberg great pals and that translated into a very healthy and very creative relationship you dont need to be aggressively and negatively beating the shit out of each other in order to create good rock music otherwise id still be working with some assholes from my past
8282582 he said i wish we did more together again i said dont worry i was delighted with what we did it was an honor and privilege to work with one of my heroes and who now is one of my dearest friends who i love and adore and support

8282590 a report that shows not just how their child is doing but how their childs school is performing compared to similar schools
8282591 there is little doubt that greater transparency will reveal some schools in australia may be seriously underperforming and have been struggling for some time
8282592 many but by no means all of these schools are in the government school system we should not tolerate underperformance
8282593 this is not about creating an arbitrary public league table it is about ensuring all schools and all teachers and all students are focused on achieving the results we need as a nation and realising the potential of each child he said
8282594 under our new reform partnership beginning from next year we will work towards establishing a similar scheme in australia
8282595 currently most teachers reach a salary ceiling at around 75 000 if they aspire to earn more they must leave the classroom
8282596 we believe we must try to shape the future of our region rather than let it simply be shaped by events and that means unapologetically prosecuting an activist foreign defence and security policy for the future he said
8282597 quality education the case for an education revolution in our schools
8282598 in summary we need to build a culture of high expectations in our schools for students and teachers mr rudd writes in the introduction to the document
8282599 this culture must also be matched to effective transparency and accountability mechansims that meet the needs of parents policy makers and the broader community
8282600 in a broad sense i think ways of rewarding high performance are welcome but the devil is in the detail mr mcalpine said
8282601 so long as its done in a way that reflects the genuine complexity and context of schools and the challenges of both leadership and teaching then i think it will be good thing
8282602 make a real difference but questioned where the funding would come from
8282603 i think it would be much better if the federal government could make direct funding to schools of an average of half a million dollars each and that funding be used to improve the learning in the school rather than the state governments having to meet the federal governments commitments he said
8282604 we are really concerned that this government is really not talking to the people it needs to talk to before its making decisions about whats best for australia she said

8282745 he was very close to returning but the great part about michael is that he takes his time to think about things and he is very thorough
8282746 you can get excited about coming back and running through the tunnel one more time
8282747 in the end he felt he could not get back to where he was
8282748 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8282749 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8282750 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8282751 we know the parameters of the contract and the giants would have been generous
8282752 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8282753 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8282754 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8282755 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8282756 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8282757 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8282758 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play

8282765 never in the political process did he obama mention cesar chavez or the plight of farmworkers
8282766 texas and the southwest are deeply indebted to clinton because of the great work he did for mexican americans i dont think obama knows anything about mexican americans
8282767 as farmworkers and laborers across america continue to struggle for fair treatment and fair wages we find strength in what cesar chavez accomplished so many years ago and we should honor him for what hes taught us about making america a stronger more just and more prosperous nation thats why i support the call to make cesar chavezs birthday a national holiday its time to recognize the contributions of this american icon to the ongoing efforts to perfect our union
8282768 i felt i had an obligation to the public to use every tool available to me to get to the truth of the matter
8282769 i still support it but i understand theres some people who dont and if they choose not to use it i think thats fine
8282770 but i just want it to be clear to the public because i think you owe them that that this contract is going to eliminate the polygraph
8282771 the united states supreme court says that polygraph examinations even a polygraph expert can only surmise can only offer opinions
8282772 there is no scientific there is no factual basis for anything that is given as part of a polygraph examination
8282773 when cap crimes against persons handles a homicide they dont allow witnesses to go home and rest
8282774 theyve just witnessed a murder their relative killed they dont get to go home and rest
8282775 theyre taken down to the cap office and they sit there for hours until cap gets statements
8282776 so its to the citys interest its to the officers interest its to everyones interest to ensure that the statement you get is the best statement that can be given that its useful
8282777 when you use deadly force against someone it is not a casual event that is an impactful thing that a lot of times makes people quit this job ive seen it several times in my career
8282778 chief wiles believed in it philosophically we are opposed on this and i respect him deeply but some of the things we have been talking about today are to guarantee both the rights of the officer and to make sure that we protect the city
8282779 the polygraph laid dormant for 20 years and the big question is why if its such a valid tool why
8282780 and yes the public does deserve the best that it can get from this department and the integrity of the officers that serve this city but that has never been an issue never
8282781 dont get comfortable mixed up with happy ok im not happy with it all but i am comfortable with it
8282782 at uc berkeley ee100 is the introduction to electrical engineering class for non ee majors the goal of this course is to serve as a hands on electronics class we use multisim in the ee100 course because it is easy to use and abstracts the messy details of spice multisim also provides very useful features like the breadboard tool and instruments like the multimeter we can show students how to wire an ammeter without blowing fuses multisim also integrates with labview and this helps our students compare simulation data to experimental data
8282783 sputtered strain gauge manufacturers sputter deposit a layer of glass onto the diaphragm sputtered strain gauge sensors actually from a molecular bond
8282784 gauge pressure is measured relative to ambient atmospheric pressure as shown in figure 3 similar to absolute pressure the abbreviations pag pascals gauge or psia pounds per square inch gauge are use to describe gauge pressure
8282785 a classic example of overloading a pressure sensor is known as the water hammer phenomenon this occurs when a fast moving fluid is suddenly stopped by the closing of a valve the fluid has momentum that is suddenly arrested which causes a minute stretching of the vessel in which the fluid is constrained this stretching generates a pressure spike that can damage a pressure sensor

8282813 the new data show that emissions from power generation are racing in the wrong direction
8282814 we urgently need to cut power related co2 emissions and to very rapidly bring down the price of proven zero carbon renewable power sources such as wind and solar
8282815 higher fuel prices lead power companies to improve the efficiency of fossil fueled plants whenever possible but those measures are inherently modest and total global emissions continue to grow rapidly
8282816 the needed shift to renewable and low carbon alternatives is happening far too slowly to avert dangerous climate change
8282817 europes projected increase in carbon intensity is disconcerting and reflects a growing reliance on coal as oil and natural gas prices rise
8282818 given europes past leadership in renewable technologies this move back to coal is a serious blemish on an otherwise encouraging record
8282819 a number of power companies have expressed desire for national policies to limit emissions and promote alternative energy
8282820 but without financial incentives for big emitters to change their behavior they continue operating and building carbon intensive plants and earths climate moves closer to the breaking point
8282821 the rich countries created this problem and will have to take the lead in solving it but the rapid growth in developing country power sector emissions reminds us that we wont be able to avert rapid climate change and the harm it will cause to the worlds poorest people without also finding a way to enable poor countries to both grow and cut emissions

8282933 although it is relatively rare to find the eggs and babies of extinct animals it is even rarer to find them inside the body of the mother
8282934 the turtle specimen was partly broken when it was first discovered it is this fortuitous break that revealed that the fossil was a mother
8282935 based on these fossils we have determined that the ancestor of living hidden necked turtles which are most of todays turtles and tortoises laid a large number of eggs and had hard rigid shells
8282936 these new findings have several clinical implications besides the impairment of sexual function in these young men
8282937 the lack of testosterone during these critical years may lead to diminished bone mass and the lack of development or lose of skeletal muscle in addition these patients may gain more weight with an average body mass index of 38 they already were obese and become more insulin resistant
8282938 also patients with low testosterone and type 2 diabetes have been shown to have very high concentrations of c reactive protein
8282939 which increases their risk of developing atherosclerosis and heart disease above and beyond the risk associated with diabetes
8282940 while obesity contributes to the association of type 2 diabetes and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism hh the association is not dependent entirely on obesity
8282941 in our first study of diabetic men we found that 31 percent of lean type 2 diabetics also had hh so it is likely that factors other than obesity contribute to hh possibly insulin resistance
8282942 whether obesity or insulin resistance is the major determinant of hh has to be addressed in future studies and the pathogenesis of hh needs to be defined

8282952 the governments reliance on the internet to disseminate and provide access to information has increased significantly over the years as have the risks associated with potential unauthorized use compromise and loss of the gov domain space

8282960 we will not be roaming the globe twisting peoples arms for them to recognise south ossetia and abkhazia
8282961 his personal physicians attributed this to exhaustion and have advised him to cancel his engagements for the time being
8282962 he dominated cricket for 20 years from his debut in 1928 to his retirement 60 years ago this month and if he had not lost eight years of his career to world war ii his figures would no doubt be better still
8282963 at every olympics plenty of records are broken bradman remains unassailable of the 2 519 batsmen who have taken the crease in 131 years of test cricket bradman stands alone and untouched
8282964 there are thousands of kids in every generation who grow up in australia wanting to scale the heights of the greatest cricketer who ever lived

8282972 one of the things our government wont tolerate and after 9 11 our citizens wont tolerate is trying to use americans as punching bags or targets for terrorist acts or mindless acts
8282973 we are one of 12 states that have experienced high growth in english language learners
8282974 many schools are embracing the challenge in unique and creative ways others are struggling more its hit or miss across the state
8282975 harrison hasnt arrived yet but it is embracing the issues and preparing the teaching force and heading in the right direction
8282976 many school districts ask parents to pay for things like athletic fees but our folks cant pay them
8282977 a lot of schools save money by asking students to print out their homework online our kids dont have computers most schools are having parents pay for the new graphing calculators we have to buy those for students
8282978 the good news about all this is that we do have a diverse population and we like that our students learn to celebrate diversity
8282979 its obviously been a factor playing on the minds of oil markets at the moment
8282980 theres a potential impact on production in the gulf of mexico area
8282981 were getting some pretty powerful data that suggests slower growth and higher gasoline prices have really crimped oil demand in the u s

8282986 solid gains in both overall and core new orders bode well for a return to positive growth for investment spending on equipment and software after a 3 4 per cent drop in the second quarter
8282987 as well the gain in inventories of durable goods is consistent with expectations that overall business inventories will add to gdp growth in q3
8282988 it is time to take back the country we love and whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8282989 im very proud to introduce my hero and mother sen hillary rodham clinton
8282990 im here tonight as a proud mother as a proud democrat as a proud senator from new york a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
8282991 i think it was a very high level of expectation
8282992 john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and in 2008 he still thinks its ok when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8282993 sen clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead
8282994 millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8282995 she hit a homer she did what she had to do
8282996 gustav is headed right toward the centre of the gulf of mexico hurricanes taking this route are usually threatening
8282997 between now and the weekend we could see crude prices encounter a fair measure of support as the uncertain path of the storm generates the usual consternation
8282998 we are not convinced that this crisis will be bullish for the energy markets as any punishment meted out by the west will steer well clear of russias energy sector
8282999 what i expect from opec is to keep pumping at the same level after the increase
8283000 it is nice to be back in this area in a different capacity
8283001 art is everything to me and i wanted to convey that message to all my students
8283002 it is clear that the current system of providing care not just in northamptonshire but across the country will need to change if adequate support is to be provided for those in need

8283010 ich bin froh dass die vertrauensvolle basis der zusammenarbeit weiter besteht

8283014 i did have to take some items out and i did have to take some baggage on the plane
8283015 theyre going to charge you a lot less than the airlines
8283016 it may be cheaper to have a second bag thats not overweight than one bag thats overweight so divide and save
8283017 the more expensive ticket may be the cheaper ticket ironic but its true
8283018 iran radical islamic government known sponsors of terrorism developing nuclear capabilities to generate power but threatening to eliminate israel
8283019 they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us
8283020 you know iran they spend one 100th of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance
8283021 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8283022 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8283023 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt theres a pattern here
8283024 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8283025 nowhere in that speech did she answer the question about his character his ability to lead the things that are at issue here
8283026 and until she does youre going to have a lot of hillary clinton supporters that are either not going to vote or are going to vote for john mccain
8283027 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8283028 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8283029 i see the past experiences highs and lows as a gift given to me and they became gifts to pass on to others
8283030 but for me having the mind and spirit breakdown thats the toughest battle of them all
8283031 its not about me its about the spirit youre trying to make a difference in life
8283032 but my life might be so much more than a baseball career that was just one inning of my life
8283033 they didnt call it alzheimers it was pre senile dementia
8283034 there was no agency no support system that would arrange for someone to come over and help with her care
8283035 men are not just dealing with bills and legal matters they are getting their hands dirty and putting their muscle behind the most intimate and intricate details of caregiving
8283036 with so many more men taking on the role of primary caregiver we needed to take a look at what it meant for them in the context of their other life responsibilities
8283037 for this reason we felt it was important to have an issue that dealt honestly and directly with mens experiences
8283038 its not raining there are light breezes basically were all in standby
8283039 but my instinct is it will be a really wet night
8283040 they were all members of a family who had taken shelter since tropical storm fay and left to go home because they thought the danger had passed
8283041 it is somewhat offensive that there would be support for the people of the southside not have to deal with their own crap and be able to pipe it over to the westside i mean thats just not right
8283042 we already have letters from tceq telling us to move forward
8283043 i dont want to take a gamble on the 75 90 compliant rule with tceq that is so critical
8283044 is going to campaign her heart out for barack obama
8283045 this is a fabulous ticket for an important turning point in our countrys history
8283046 when we leave here we have to be one party and the people who will lead us are barack obama and joe biden
8283047 id like to compliment hillary clinton for running a great great campaign
8283048 and i want to compliment her for the gracious passing of the baton last night
8283049 from fannie and freddies perspective theres actually better investments now said moshe orenbuch an analyst at credit suisse group in new york adding that their interest margin is likely to continue to widen
8283050 they at the increment are very very profitable said dan fuss vice chairman of loomis sayles amp co
8283051 if they can continue to do anything close to business as usual they are immensely profitable
8283052 our funding costs remain attractive particularly based on the opportunities to purchase mortgage assets at attractive spreads freddie spokesman michael cosgrove said a fannie spokesman jason lobo declined to comment
8283053 yields on mortgage backed securities would decline reducing their spread opportunity said rick redmond a portfolio manager in new york at caspian capital management llc which oversees 5 8 billion
8283054 it would make a difference if they were increasing their portfolios said ubs ag mortgage analyst laurie goodman in new york whose team was ranked no
8283055 there is no pressing need for a bailout they wrote in the report titled

8283065 we are gravely concerned about the fate of these three bahais who are being held without charges in a case that is clearly based on religious persecution
8283066 although the three have lived in yemen for more than 25 years they hold iranian passports and we have come to believe that the yemeni government may be planning to deport them to iran where the government is waging a systematic campaign against bahais
8283067 while calling for their immediate release our primary concern today is to ask that the yemeni government resist any impulse to deport these three bahais to iran or any other country deportation to any country for three individuals with well established businesses and families for their religious beliefs would be grossly unjust but deportation to iran where they face the possibility of torture would be a clear violation of international human rights law
8283068 our hope has been to prevent this case from becoming a major human rights matter over the issue of religious persecution
8283069 under international laws on the freedom of religion there is no question that bahais and others in yemen should be free to practice their faith while the situation is still unfolding we stand by the right of bahais in yemen and elsewhere to practice their religion in all aspects without the fear of being forced to leave their adopted country

8283073 while in the past jen shunned publicity and shrank from photographers lenses now shes openly encouraging the attention smiling showing off her body and creating photo ops
8283074 jen was glowing smiling and being very friendly as she ate tuna tartare rock shrimp and spinach salad with a glass of wine it was hard to believe this was a woman who just broke up with her boyfriend
8283075 we have never neglected our core gamers we still have developers working on popular core gaming franchises but we need longer to complete these games approximately two to three years these games are not ready to launch in early 2009 but are being worked on by all development teams
8283076 a distribution must involve a sale or other transfer of ownership or a rental lease or lending of a copy of the work the recording companies have not proved an actual distribution of 42 of the copyrighted sound recordings at issue so their motion for summary judgement fails as to those recordings

8283078 we are already marketing snohomish county as a gateway to british columbia

8283082 i have to say im one of those nasty people who voted against having the winter olympics here
8283083 i was concerned about the cost and everything but to see the olympic village sprouting up over the way there im growing prouder by the moment
8283084 this warrants caution in undertaking a long position though the overall direction of the us dollar favors appreciation as suggested by the bullish breakout in the dxy dollar index

8283207 my general belief is that while the obama world is not the bush world were not allies they believe in elite consensus governance using terms such as civility and imposing liberal ish policy ideas from academics we believe in polarization and populism and in fact our very power and capacity on the internet emerges from conflict and polarization

8283242 i encourage investors new to tax lien investing to first just watch live sales for a while and study the deals before buying anything similar to virtual stock trading once they are ready to make their first purchase begin with a very small tax certificate say under 200 300 after they do a few small deals successfully and get comfortable with the process then start increasing the size of their deals along with the number of cities and property types in their portfolio the best thing about our site is that unlike most sites visitors can actually watch live auctions for free for as long as they like to get familiar with the process and even watch tutorials without buying anything we have partnered with a few very well known online players to deliver a list of new tax sales to our subscribers everyday in a secure online shopping environment
8283243 we are actively seeking property owners in the jackson hole market areas who want to auction their property for 100 percent of the current market value with no seller commission to enter their properties prior to the monday september 1st deadline
8283244 as one of only 322 accredited auctioneers of real estates aare in the united states we can deliver a higher level of service than 98 6 of real estate professionals in the marketplace
8283245 last year we auctioned two homes in teton springs and delivered 660 000 and 715 000 for a private seller who had purchased based on pre construction appraisals with inflated resale values of 1 4 to 1 6 million each our seller could not make the 18 000 payments for property in a subdivision that only had two arms length transactions during 2007 and they had no hope of selling using traditional methods
8283246 if you read the newspapers listen to the radio or watch the news on tv the message is nothing but doom and gloom about the real estate market
8283247 if you are trying to sell using the broken list price put up a sign and place it in the mls methods they are correct and your property can sit on the market for years with no bids or contingency
8283248 people selling real estate in the jackson hole market think they are immune to the nationwide correction in real estate values with almost every agent saying the same things agents in orange county california were telling us two years ago which is it cant happen here there is too much demand prices will never go down
8283249 july 2008 saw an actual 28 percent across the board decrease in orange county property values
8283250 this could be the tip of the iceberg or the prices can hold the line depending on a number of factors outside of the control of sellers agents or the local market
8283251 the good news is an auction is an event where bidders win the property and are happy knowing they only paid one bid more than someone else was willing to pay
8283252 competitive bidding will deliver 100 percent of the present cash market value for a property on a specific date in
8283253 this is the selling event of the season if a property owner wants to sell their property on september 20th this auction event will simply deliver more marketing firepower than the local agents are capable of delivering

8283367 but vera has a great love for the theatre and stuck up for herself to the best of her abilities as well as give a good description to police which we really do thank her for
8283368 this woman has acted very bravely in trying to stop the thief getting away with any money

8283439 barack obama began his career fighting for workers displaced by the global economy he built his campaign on a fundamental belief that change in this country must start from the ground up not the top down cheers applause and he knows that government must be about we the people not we the favored few
8283440 and i cannot wait to watch barack obama sign into law a health care plan that covers every single american cheers applause and we know that president obama will end the war in iraq responsibly bring our troops home and begin to repair our alliances around the world

8283509 all things that the father has are mine therefore i said that he will take of mine and declare it to you
8283510 a little while and you will not see me and again a little while and you will see me because i go to the father
8283511 what is this that he says to us a little while and you will not see me and again a little while and you will see me and because i go to the father
8283512 what is this that he says a little while we do not know what he is saying
8283513 are you inquiring among yourselves about what i said a little while and you will not see me and again a little while and you will see me
8283514 most assuredly i say to you that you will weep and lament but the world will rejoice and you will be sorrowful but your sorrow will be turned into joy
8283515 a woman when she is in labor has sorrow because her hour has come but as soon as she has given birth to the child she no longer remembers the anguish for joy that a human being has been born into the world
8283516 therefore you now have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart will rejoice and your joy no one will take from you
8283517 and in that day you will ask me nothing most assuredly i say to you whatever you ask the father in my name he will give you
8283518 until now you have asked nothing in my name ask and you will receive that your joy may be full

8283521 in that day you will ask in my name and i do not say to you that i shall pray the father for you
8283522 for the father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that i came forth from god
8283523 i came forth from the father and have come into the world again i leave the world and go to the father
8283524 see now you are speaking plainly and using no figure of speech
8283525 now we are sure that you know all things and have no need that anyone should question you by this we believe that you came forth from god
8283526 indeed the hour is coming yes has now come that you will be scattered each to his own and will leave me alone and yet i am not alone because the father is with me

8283533 der vorliegende werbespot gibt einen irref hrenden eindruck der internetf higkeiten des iphone wieder und darf daher in seiner gegenw rtigen form nicht mehr in der ffentlichkeit verbreitet werden
8283534 weil aber das iphone kein flash oder java unterst tzt zwei programme die f r die nutzung vieler webseiten unerl sslich sind kann damit das internet gar nicht in seiner vollen pracht wahrgenommen werden
8283535 derartige schadhafte werbung ist in deutschland ein absolutes randph nomen und kommt so gut wie nie vor

8283538 damit soll der internetprovider zum netzpolizisten und zur zensurbeh rde gemacht werden was jedem vern nftigen rechtsempfinden widerspricht
8283539 ein internet service provider hat weder das recht noch die m glichkeit zu berpr fen welche daten von seinen kunden im internet abgerufen oder zur verf gung gestellt werden
8283540 auch eine solche ma nahme w rde nur mit den mitteln eines totalit ren berwachungsstaates m glich sein und die b rgerlichen grundrechte massiv untergraben
8283541 internetprovider sind f r die inhalte von drittanbietern nicht selbst verantwortlich
8283542 es muss bei dieser frage klar zwischen access und host providern unterschieden werden letztgenannte haben datenschutzrechtlich gar keine m glichkeit konkrete webinhalte einzusehen da sie lediglich eine durchleitungsaufgabe wahrnehmen
8283543 noch dazu in einer so heiklen rechtsmaterie wie dem urheberrecht wo der provider in zivilrechtlichen fragen entscheiden m sste

8283587 i believe than an improved relationship with iran is in the naked self interest of the united states of america
8283588 we had hoped that after the 11 september attacks the iranian regime would end its support for terrorists
8283589 but iran did not stop its support for terror indeed the hard line elements of the iranian regime facilitated the movement of terrorists escaping from afghanistan
8283590 biden has been too cozy with the supporters of the iranian regime which is anti american anti iranian and has a horrendous human rights record
8283591 this is because the iranians instead of empowering the lobby supporting them undermine it
8283592 senator joseph biden said that even if iran was a full democracy like india it would want nuclear capability like india what the world needed to address was irans emotional needs he said with a nonaggression pact

8283601 what you have here is a group of people who have been working together through different groups and organizations for the past ten years
8283602 its deeply troubling to have a vice presidential candidate raise funds from people whose ties to the iranian regime raise such serious questions

8283713 may not be affected the full house approved a spending bill for military construction and the veterans affairs department before recessing earlier this month raising the possibility that a bill could pass the senate before oct 1

8283715 gave the biggest it spending increases to agencies and programs working with military health care homeland security and law enforcement the veterans affairs department had a fiscal 2008 it budget that skyrocketed 23 percent to 2 2 billion thanks mostly to a public outcry over the poor health care that wounded soldiers receive at walter reed army medical center
8283716 when military health care planners say they are building the hospitals of the future they are referring to having state of the art health applications and practices such as clinical decision support and e prescribing hard wired into the hospitals workflow
8283717 it remains to be seen how close planners come to creating true digital institutions in which medical and business information is integrated and available to all the departments clinics and service offices that constitute a modern hospital consulting firm pricewaterhousecoopers described that vision in a recent report

8283736 with all the optimism around campus all the promotions if we dont put on a good show for the fans itll be same old duke riley said
8283737 the biggest thing to begin with was just to generate the interest and have real expectations cutcliffe said tuesday
8283738 thank goodness there are expectations i like that ive never been afraid of expectations we welcome the challenge the administration has declared that they want to change the culture of football at duke and we are taking that seriously
8283739 obviously i know the importance of playing well people coming back and people believing
8283740 playing good defense has a lot with how you do on offense
8283741 if our offense is able to control the ball if we make people go a long way to score points against our defense then we have the potential to be good
8283742 knowing where to be at and knowing where everybody else is going to be on the field
8283743 thats all you can really ask for come out and play fast
8283744 big plays are a result of a missed tackle or mental mistake

8283747 we work in the heat of the day up here the heat of the day up here is probably the cool time down there
8283748 were rolling along trying to get their legs back now where theyre fresher
8283749 the airs pretty thin up here so i think it would be better for us when we get off the mountain
8283750 i think one thing we can feed off of is the adrenaline flow when you play in that stadium
8283751 theyre a typical southeastern conference football team big and fast and very very athletic supremely well coached theyre probably one of the best tackling football teams ive ever seen
8283752 the size and athletic factors versus those of our players are just at different levels but were going to waste a lot of time down there if we dont play hard thats the thing that were trying to drive home
8283753 we know they like to blitz a lot and we have to get rid of the ball quick and capitalize when they do blitz
8283754 we dont want to run up the middle with them so we have to try to keep it outside and make them chase us
8283755 key to the lock of the wto deadlock is not in our hands the key is with the developed countries

8283764 unfortunately because the examples he provides are still only experiments we cannot talk in length about how they work if we end up rolling out this experiment for all users we would definitely be able to talk in more detail right now we are experimenting with a number of factors so we cant really explain how the final product would work

8283828 no child in the wealthiest country in the world should grow up hungry

8283830 the company is discussing with andrew the ways his skills and expertise can be made available within the company
8283831 our concern is the depth of the cuts at the company and the way that they are doing it
8283832 they havent been able to tell us how many editorial jobs they need to lose at
8283833 they are not even at liberty to tell us how much of the 50 million in cuts over the next two years announced yesterday have to be carried out in melbourne so we are still nervously waiting to hear what our number is
8283834 this is much more about impressing the market in the short term than a serious attempt to position the paper for five years 10 years hence
8283835 were in favour of an overall road user charge in the longer term but only on the basis that the arbitrary fuel excise tax and other taxes on motoring are reviewed or removed and then replaced with a road user charge
8283836 that would be both roads and public transport to address the issues of the environment and congestion
8283837 the government would then pay a yearly amount based on usage
8283838 we were very lucky that the pilots skill allowed him to land the aircraft where he did
8283839 had he crashed across the road he would have gone straight into the primary school
8283840 he managed to land the aircraft in such a way as to protect the public
8283841 i saw the plane go right into the garage thank god i had ryan with me outside
8283842 it was very scary i was in such a panic and in such shock
8283843 this is not a safe environment for people living here
8283844 it chilled my blood when i heard about it and when they mentioned the school i thought oh golly whats the final report going to be
8283845 he was forced to do a spiral dive he would have been doing circuits which means you are not more than 1000 feet high and couldnt have had time to do it safely
8283846 local residents shouldnt be concerned about these sort of things happening frequently they dont
8283847 this is a terrible tragedy and my thoughts are with the family of the pilot
8283848 at the last meeting we were told there had been 380 000 movements of aircraft in the past 12 months
8283849 thats a lot of aircraft flying around in a very small circle over what is a growing and developing community
8283850 and if they dont do that then they must lower the amount of traffic in the skies
8283851 a very high percentage of the aircraft are 30 years or older and a lot of the activity is training activity involving learners
8283852 not i not i but the joe that blows through me
8283853 it is not good enough that children have to have their cardiac surgery cancelled four five six times
8283854 we do take these issues very seriously what has been going on here has not been good enough and we are all working together to try to improve things
8283855 its about making sure we have the right frameworks so that we can take that practical action to ensure we have more icu nurses so we can open up those icu beds and keep the beds we currently have open
8283856 if theres more that we can be doing i will do more and i am committed to working with the monash medical centre and with other services across the state to boost the overall capacity
8283857 what were looking at today is shorter term responses that will solve this critical issue now
8283858 solid gains in both overall and core new orders bode well for a return to positive growth for investment spending on equipment and software after a 3 4 per cent drop in the second quarter
8283859 as well the gain in inventories of durable goods is consistent with expectations that overall business inventories will add to gdp growth in q3
8283860 it looks like it could be a big one unless the path changes drastically this could have an impact on production and the market is being forced higher

8283863 our policy is not to keep players who dont want to play for us
8283864 however anthony is under contract until 2010 and unless a substantial offer is received from the championship or premier league he wont be sold
8283865 quite clearly anthony gerrards representative has been actively trying to stimulate the interest of other clubs regarding the transfer of the player
8283866 only last week we turned down an offer from a championship club
8283867 however such behind the scenes activity is bound to have an unsettling effect on the player and this it seems has led to anthony handing in a written transfer request
8283868 that their innocence has been lost and the circumstances of losing it is a tragedy for both of them

8283872 theres kind of a tipping point where perhaps other solutions look more attractive
8283873 companies will really need to rely on consultants and outsourcing firms to do a lot of this going forward and focus internally on whatever it is their business needs to do with these applications going forward
8283874 we noticed that their sap practices were growing by leaps and bounds
8283875 unless the striking variance in skills availability is eliminated oracle will become an increasingly attractive option relative to sap
8283876 cracks in what has essentially become a two party system may emerge
8283877 what were really trying to do is fill this pipeline with the talent and resources were going to need in the next five years
8283878 i think theyre doing as much as they possibly can
8283879 but in order to meet this demand they have to be more aggressive in pushing out a creative delivery model

8283894 we cannot accept these violations of all international law of agreements on security and cooperation in europe of united nations resolutions and the seizing for the first time in a long time of one territory by the army of a neighboring country
8283895 it russia is an international outlaw that is not just the opinion of the european union
8283896 its all very dangerous there are other objectives that one can suppose are the objectives of russia in particular crimea ukraine and moldova
8283897 ukraine could be the next target of political pressure by russia whose doctrine on its nearby neighbors is reminiscent of sphere politics
8283898 but we have to acknowledge that russia used military force against its sovereign neighbor and threatened its democratic government russia also cannot stand the idea that nato would expand to its southern neighbors so it purposely created tension in the region
8283899 we regret this decision for ukraine it is unacceptable and therefore we cannot support this position
8283900 any nation could be next any country when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity we put into doubt the existence of any country
8283901 we need to prevent ukraine becoming involved in a military conflict
8283902 we dont intend to allow troops which could be used in military action with a third or fourth country to use our territory as a base

8283904 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8283905 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8283906 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8283907 you taught me so much you made me laugh and you even made me cry you allowed me to become part of your lives and you became part of mine
8283908 that was excellent that was a strong speech she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election
8283909 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief
8283910 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere did she say that barack obama is ready to lead
8283911 millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8283912 standing on that stage tonight in front of 20 000 democrats unified behind senator obama i saw a bright future for america
8283913 i saw millions of people across the country working as one to elect the next democratic president
8283914 im sad that were not standing here talking about her running for president but we have to abide by her wishes
8283915 it was my idea to use barack obamas name i am going to be the same as that guy initially everybody thought it was a joke but now instead of alexandre theyre calling me barack

8283927 the economic situation has been so stable during the survey he said

8283929 the project will involve the documentation of all of the thousands of dead sea scrolls fragments belonging to about 900 manuscripts and placing them in an internet databank that will be available to the public
8283930 scores of scroll fragments that were blackened or ostensibly erased over the years and which were not visible to the naked eye until now
8283931 i believe that by using spectral photography we will succeed through non invasive means to determine the amount of water present in the parchment from which the scrolls are made
8283932 data such as this has added value for conservation and preservation issues if for example we discover that the parchments are too dry it will be necessary to modify the conditions in which they are maintained
8283933 the court will not speculate on the reason why petitioner irene for all the inconvenience and expense she and her adversaries would have to endure by a batac trial preferred that her case be heard and decided by the rtc in batac
8283934 litigants ought to bank on the righteousness of their causes the superiority of their cases and the persuasiveness of arguments to secure a favorable verdict it is high time that courts judges and those who come to court for redress keep this ideal in mind
8283935 in the final analysis the residences of irenes co plaintiffs cannot be made the basis in determining the venue of the subject suit this conclusion becomes all the more forceful considering that irene herself initiated and was actively prosecuting her claim against benedicto his heirs assigns or associates virtually rendering the impleading of the trustees unnecessary

8283965 the success of our efforts comes not so much from individual programs or changes but from working together as a system through a process of continuous improvement and with a common objective our purpose is through an effective public education to make life better for our students our community and our world
8283966 by reviewing the individual school report cards issued by the state parents can access the report cards through the ohio department of education web site or at www reportcard ohio gov the data on their childs report card offer suggestions to help increase student achievement working together with teachers and schools parents can now have an active role in their childs success on these standardized tests
8283967 but we are clearly headed in the right direction we must take time to celebrate our accomplishment reflect on what is working well and improve on areas that dont yet meet our expectations

8284007 if you decide to take a picture of your unclothed body and send it to a boyfriend or a friend if you send it to a guy whats the guy going to do a guy is going to send it to three more of his buddies and so on
8284008 self respect would dictate that you dont send these sorts of things out to anybody there are future consequences that you might not even think about
8284009 twenty five years down the road you dont want to be overhearing a conversation between your kid and your kids buddy saying i saw a picture of your mom naked on the internet it could happen
8284010 when you record something on your cell phone when you post something to the internet when you send a text message to one of your friends
8284011 basically what youre doing is creating a permanent record for law enforcement it becomes pretty easy for people like me people like the police to track this sort of thing down for instance heres a text message situation between two kids
8284012 kid a can you get me some dope kid b yeah sure meet me at the park at time x
8284013 thats basically all thats needed to prove a drug trafficking charge
8284014 its an offer of sale of drugs and its very easy for law enforcement to get access to these text messages you can erase text messages from your phone but just like a computer hard drive those files are not completely wiped clean
8284015 one of the charges that can come from kids sending nude photos to each other by cell phone is disseminating matter harmful to juveniles does that really mean that people think it is harmful if you see a nude photo no what it means from a legal perspective is that this sort of activity is offensive to the prevailing standards of adults in our community as to what is suitable for juveniles
8284016 this is a felony if somebody for instance takes cell phone video of some sort of sexual activity that they are involved in and posts it to the internet that is a serious offense
8284017 the reason why is sick people go out of their way to get a hold of pornography that features minors and the reason there is such a severe penalty for this is that the legislature decided thats the best way to keep kids safe a felony like this even on a first time offense will probably wind up with some detention time
8284018 you guys probably dont care at all about public records law
8284019 but what does public records law mean to you if a case is filed in juvenile court the media can request and can get your name because it is a public court case if you commit one of these offenses and the media requests the names your name could wind up in the paper think of how proud your parents would be
8284020 its a level of suspicion thats lower than probable cause
8284021 while law enforcement is held to probable cause reasonable suspicion is what school administrators are held to they have this lower level of suspicion where they can search your bag search your locker search your phone if they believe you are breaking any of the rules that are in your school handbook
8284022 its a pity that we did not win the gold but ah those boys tried they did their best but luck was not on their side
8284023 yes they played very well throughout the competition and thats why many people thought that they will beat argentina to win the gold but football is a funny game sometimes the better team does not win the match our boys missed many scoring chances argentina had their own and scored and thats what usually makes the difference between a winner and a loser in a tough match like that
8284024 dream team players and their coaches deserve praise for taking nigeria to the final even though we lost the gold to argentina at least silver is better than nothing if not for them we will not be talking of nigeria winning a silver medal at this olympics but what i cannot understand is why they fixed that match in the afternoon when the weather was very hot it was clear that the weather affected the way that match was played im sure if not for the hot weather our boys would have played better and beaten argentina
8284025 the weather affected both nigeria and argentina in fact i will say it affected argentina more because theyre oyibo the temperature at that stadium was not different from what we have here in nigeria so i will say that argentina won that match because they have more experienced players than us all their big players were there messi aguero riquelme mascherano you just name it and they all play in big big clubs in europe like barcelona real madrid liverpool and so on but apart from osaze do we have any other player in the dream team that is playing for a big club even osazes club which is in russia is not all that big yes our boys tried but they met a more matured and experienced team
8284026 its these european clubs that we should blame i believe theres discrimination in the way they held back some of our star players but allowed european and south american countries that participated in the olympics to come with their big name players thats cheating imagine what would have happened if taiye taiwo ikechukwu uche and vincent enyeama had been in that nigerian team argentina would not have been able to stop us from winning the gold uche in particular would have been able to get one or two goals from all those chances our strikers wasted i am also sure that taiye would have been able to score at least one free kick for us in that final match against argentina we had many free kicks in all the matches we played but we didnt have a player like taiye to help us convert them into goals the most painful is the fact that enyeama or austin ejide was not there ambrose vanzekin is a good goalkeeper but he lacks the experience to handle a match at the olympic level thats why he made those mistakes that helped our opponents to score against us but the worst mistake he made was in todays match against argentina didnt you see the way he rushed out an experienced keeper would not have done that kind of thing he should have waited in his goal area for that argentine player to come closer before moving that would have given one of our defenders the chance to try to catch up with the player so as to confuse him and make it impossible for him to score vincent enyeama would not have made that kind of mistake but i think these european clubs know what theyre doing they dont want an african country to win the olympic football gold again that is why they refused to release our players
8284027 i dont believe that its the absence of those players that you mentioned that made us to lose the match and the gold
8284028 its nice to be back at training after such a long time i feel like i am a trialist again in the team its going to be a tough battle again to fight back my position and its good to have such quality of goalkeepers at sundowns which will push me to work very hard
8284029 i have given myself a couple of weeks to regain my fitness before challenging for the number 1 jersey
8284030 he should take things softly he has done well in the olympics and should be commended for his efforts but he should not think that he is the best coach in nigeria no he is not
8284031 nobody can legislate against the peoples desperation to leave the country for more lucrative jobs abroad
8284032 with the unprecedented economic crisis weighing heavily even on the backs of filipino professionals keeping them in the country by way of law is not only dictatorial its wishful thinking
8284033 whats driving filipinos out is the grinding poverty and the absence of opportunities here in the country and the culprit behind this is no less than mr arroyos sister in law the president
8284034 except in the interest of national security public safety or public health as may be provided by law
8284035 people will come from the east and west and north and south and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of god
8284036 i thought you two needed to chat xyz is also interested in russia missions rugby etc
8284037 the boy showed potential and skill way belying his young age and we thought it wise to call him up so that he could become accustomed to the playing conditions at this level he might not be ready for international football right now but he is certainly a player for the future and needs to be well nurtured
8284038 its a pity we did not have adequate time to play friendly matches ahead of our important world cup qualifiers against kenya and zimbabwe i still need to see certain players in a game situation of how they cope with pressure and play in a system but from what i have seen i must confess im quite impressed with the commitment shown by the players so far
8284039 im still hopeful he will become an integral part of this team and would also like to run an eye over our three players in the angolan premier league
8284040 with the kind of support im enjoying from the namibian football associations president john muinjo and secretary general barry rukoro im extremely positive we can achieve greater heights with the added valuable input of my two assistants ronnie kanalelo and brian isaacs
8284041 im here to win games but it should also be understood that the team could only amass a paltry three points from a possible 12 and its going be an uphill battle to overturn the deficit our destiny is not in our hands though we have to win our remaining two matches and hope other contenders stumble along the way so we are in a catch 22 situation
8284042 this is a club that has not paid winning bonuses to players for more than two seasons and yet they create the impression that by sacking everything will be well
8284043 they should be putting the interest of the players first
8284044 there is an issue with the winning bonus from two years ago when they beat etoile du sahel to qualify for the group stage
8284045 but the club explained the unique difficulties at that time and promised to pay the players plus interest when the time comes
8284046 kosta papic decided after training with them for two weeks to trim the squad so sannie should not position himself as a scapegoat and the victim of a management vendetta
8284047 when eyal lachman presented a list of players he wanted to work with after a few weeks at hearts sannie was not part of them so that says a lot
8284048 every time there is change there are casualties the truth of the matter is that hearts performed poorly in the last season
8284049 hearts wants do well next season and to do well we must take a critical look at the playing body organization of the club the attitude of the players their character commitment level and performance from last seasons and act
8284050 if i get lost on the way to meet you
8284051 demonstrated the grave threat posed by a hostile regime possessing weapons of mass destruction and with reported ties to terrorists
8284052 his regime posed a threat we had to take seriously
8284053 to prevent outlaw states like iran today from developing weapons of mass destruction
8284054 wow found the on switch for the garbage disposal it like chews up garbage amazing those stale radishes are history
8284055 this is an operation that hasnt been done before it took a real team effort
8284056 we also took a skin graft from his thigh area to help fill in the large indentation of his lower lip to rebuild the area
8284057 its really the work of the doctors in ireland that have helped alan come this far they were essential in his early life saving resuscitation and permanently maintaining his breathing and feeding tubes throughout the years
8284058 we suspect based on what we were able to see that the tongue is so undeveloped its unlikely at this point that we will be able to restore swallowing and breathing and his mouth
8284059 his mom bernie has been so supportive throughout this entire process
8284060 she had the biggest smile on her face when the surgery was completed
8284061 his tenacity is what really propelled him to have the operation
8284062 initially i think there was some concern on part of his parents but it was alans motivation that gave him the support to get him through these procedures
8284063 its a great success not only physically but a new chance for his self esteem and self confidence
8284064 listening to the coach speak i could feel a sense of insecurity on his part and this i am sure will negatively affect his performance and delivery he said at a club gathering
8284065 i have been hearing a lot of reports about his problems at the club with the latest being the news that he could be replaced
8284066 if it is that you are not satisfied with his performance i recommend that in the spirit of transparency you call him and ask the appropriate questions that is better than he having to deal with grape vine stories about his future at kotoko
8284067 being the first match will be difficult they will be very strong try to convince i am sure will be a difficult game and we must do what we try and play as we try to win
8284068 were you just in this only for me or were you in it for a long list of down and out americans who needed help
8284069 now john mccain is my colleague and my friend he has served our country with honor and courage but we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8284070 nothing less than the fate of our nation hangs in the balance
8284071 this is a good economic driver and social reform legislation
8284072 we expect the laws full implementation a month from now
8284073 sarebbe impossibile dirlo oggi perch ancora ci deve essere il confronto con i sindacati
8284074 se domani il consiglio dei ministri approva tutto se dopodomani il cda di alitalia procede bisogner immediatamente aprire il
8284075 dichiara matteoli proprio mentre si recava al meeting su alitalia e conclude
8284076 the market moved sideways there was no new catalyst that could lead the market to any direction
8284077 buyers were waiting for anything big to happen in the global and the us market
8284078 sellers meanwhile were waiting for the next cue for the market to drop
8284079 the decisions have to be significant to make investors move aggressively and make the market move upward or downward
8284080 the market is still consolidating watching closely the developments in the global and domestic arena
8284081 if the market reaches the 2 800 level we will see a more aggressive market if it drops below 2 400 then the market would continue its bearish streak
8284082 pace of poverty reduction has been very weak among the three south asian giants bangladesh especially india and pakistan
8284083 overall rate of progress against poverty is fairly similar to past estimates
8284084 while the new data suggest that the developing world is poorer than we thought it has been no less successful in reducing the incidence of absolute poverty since the early 1980s
8284085 we are bothered by typhoons which affect the vulnerable sectors like the fisher folk these contribute to the problem of poverty
8284086 the efforts being undertaken by the local government units are not very focused so we intervene by giving them a database
8284087 these figures are not properly analyzed to guide the local governments they should instead use the community based monitoring system to focus on the needs of the people within their area
8284088 if we look at how much more water we will need for food and how much more for biomass for energy going forward it is quite worrying
8284089 almost every increase in water used in agriculture will affect water availability for other uses including that needed to keep ecosystems healthy and resilient in the face of change and perturbation
8284090 it might be environmentally reasonable to withdraw maybe 6 000 cubic kilometers but if we withdraw more water it would be at a very high environmental cost because we need water to flush the system and for different ecosystem services
8284091 by 2030 the same amount of energy that we produce today with fossil fuels will have to come from biomass
8284092 meet food demands by 2050 if we have a much more efficient use of water that does not include the water we need for all that biomass
8284093 we are at the end of the road when it comes to irrigation because all the water available in rivers and other sources has already been practically used up
8284094 in a large part of africa the amount of rainfall is usually enough to grow many crops
8284095 we are more concerned about the security of our businesses what will happen to the flow of the businesses and the existing policies since there will be a restructuring of the areas in mindanao with the creation of the bje
8284096 we expect that at the end of the congress mindanaos business leaders will come up with a statement over the proposed bje
8284097 for the first time we are doing a variation on the program instead of seeking from the government about its plans in mindanao it will be the private sector that will present solutions to the needs in mindanao and for the government to act on our propositions
8284098 this is the only island wide forum happening amid the conflict in mindanao
8284099 without the atrocities in north cotabato and lanao provinces everything would have been done smoothly
8284100 investing in your own company sends a signal to investors that the company is confident about its own growth prospect
8284101 the program is also a way to send a message to investors that the company would not allow the current market to lessen the value of its stocks
8284102 in the current environment we believe we can enhance shareholder value by buying our own shares
8284103 our p5 billion share buy back program for both alliance global and megaworld is our best option under the present circumstances
8284104 this share buyback program clearly underscores our confidence in our strategy and the sustained long term growth of alliance global
8284105 a further deterioration in the global equities market decreased our target buyers financial assets making our sales activities even more difficult
8284106 i tried to research about the dishes from the area i was actually quite relieved to find out that they are the same as the dishes in the area of emilia romagna the region of italy in which the microstate is situated they use a lot of cheese i ended up just doing my own interpretation of what i know about the food from the region and just used their wines and liquors to just enhance the flavor
8284107 i dont think weve been very accustomed to having a lot of alcohol in our food but the worlds gotten smaller and we filipinos are so well traveled now or the pleasures of the internet have allowed us to travel virtually its made the world a lot smaller
8284108 c laccordo su tutto con il club e con il giocatore menez entusiasta di venire alla roma sar ufficiale molto probabilmente nella giornata di gioved cerano altri grandi club su di lui e tra questi anche il barcellona
8284109 well keep doing it until we find the right way we cant get too down we still have another game here and more than a month left to go in the season
8284110 its frustrating but with this team in this stadium you never know
8284111 were looking at the possibility of further exports in the range of 100 000 150 000 tons excluding us quota over the next six months
8284112 the popular initiative against the construction of minarets has been submitted in accordance with the applicable regulations but infringes guaranteed international human rights and contradicts the core values of the swiss federal constitution
8284113 such a ban would endanger peace between religions and would not help to prevent the spread of fundamentalist islamic beliefs
8284114 everybody has been asking me about chamanga i dont know where these people get these reports no one from kaizer chiefs management has told me anything about chamanga isnt the player in china
8284115 how is it possible to get a good striker in just three days i will continue with what i have until the transfer window period re opens in january next year
8284116 we have it in our power to begin the world over again
8284117 management has told our coaches that we need to have at least 26 to 28 players this season because we want to cut costs that is why we released those three players last month but this does not mean we wont help the technical staff if they see the need for additions at the moment we are aware that coaches need one central defender we are looking for one locally and abroad
8284118 we have it in our power to begin the world over again

8284120 we are excited that this transaction allows us to continue our successful relationship with conocophillips building on several prior transactions and many years of working together

8284122 i look forward to continuing my passion of developing these brands across the west coast after we complete this transaction
8284123 this transaction is designed to strengthen our branded wholesale business model and grow market share
8284124 we have worked with petrosun before and believe that they will continue to enhance our brands and provide excellent service to our retail customers
8284125 this transaction further strengthens our already strong relationship with conocophillips and petrosun and we look forward to working closely together as we move forward
8284126 as humanitarian needs mount in georgia canada is increasing its support for those who have been displaced and are suffering in the aftermath of this terrible conflict
8284127 working with the international community canada continues to monitor the situation to ensure its aid efforts are effectively meeting the needs of the civilian population
8284128 we are pleased by initial reports that humanitarian access to affected regions in georgia is improving
8284129 however we reiterate our call to all parties to immediately facilitate and guarantee full safe and unhindered access to all conflict areas including south ossetia for all humanitarian actors access is critical to provide urgent assistance to populations in need and for humanitarian agencies to undertake essential needs assessments there can be no further delays

8284168 the memories that we all share in this place are very precious to us

8284177 its the ability to combine and recombine things that will make the difference because most of the technologies most of the raw materials most of the knowledge is available in these increasingly efficient and increasingly global markets
8284178 a club in europe wanted ajibade and they offered 20 000 twenty thousand dollars and i felt that was an insult to enyimba
8284179 last season ajibade got five million naira about 42 000 as sign on fees and when you consider that in the five seasons he has spent with us he as taken close to twenty million naira about 170 000 from us in sign on fees and salaries then you will agree with me that enyimba were insulted with that offer
8284180 i think it is all wrong and i hope our players do not continue to belittle themselves with this craze for europe
8284181 a manchester united player does not just leave camp two weeks to a uefa champions league match against ac milan to go on trials at barcelona so why should our case be different
8284182 we always release our players but we will not derail our ambitions because we want to let our players off to europe
8284183 eventually we want the best for our players and if our players do as well as they are doing now we will eventually not be able to hold on to them
8284184 what i always tell them to do is be careful and not be in too much of a hurry to leave for europe but allow europe to look for them

8284190 swung it once or twice and said i dont want to do it anymore
8284191 it was an emotional time and the children were happy they asked for it no one forced anyone

8284193 those who made the judgment regarded themselves as educated people
8284194 in spite of that they tortured an innocent person and had her executed although it was known to them that the alleged crime was neither doable nor possible and that there was no legal basis for their verdict

8284232 en los mundiales hay opciones de sacar oro con scar freire que va a ser el punta de lanza de la selecci n espa ola porque el recorrido se ajusta a sus caracter sticas y vamos a estar ayud ndole a expensas de las situaciones que haya en carrera

8284243 re re insurance question this is in fact in addition to and is paid directly to you and involves thingsd like if your child has cancer then it pays you 2 500 for the parents and child to fly to the treatment facility of your choice and then 100 a day for a hotel there are actually a lot of payouts like when you are diagnosed with cancer they cut you a check for 1 500 that day and then they also pay for prevention screening 100 a year there are a lot of good things to the policy and i also had herd about the just get long term disability but long term only pays 60 and it would be hard to make current ends meet with that in addition to paying all the medical treatments where we would only get one choice as to where to go this policy also pays for each day in the hospital and additional for each chemo session and i guess with me dh and 4 kids it really doesnt seem to bad but trying to investigate the company i have plenty of life from the military since i was disabled i got to keep the 400 000 00 policy for 25 a month in addition to my work and dhs work one good thing is if you do not use the policy you get premiums returned in 25 years my husband sells health insurance along with supplemental policies as well his top selling supplemental policy is the cancer policy i know that i have heard some of his policy holders love the policy and what it pays we actually have one for our family as a just in a case

8284304 isolation is not feasible russia is too enmeshed in the world economy
8284305 it would be counter productive its economic integration is the best discipline on its politics it would only strengthen the sense of victimhood that is the fuel for intolerant nationalism

8284321 the seed is sown on the land a reference to the promised land although this image is preferable to the garden image in luke it is possible to read the reference to the garden as an image of the land as a new eden in which case the two variants are not so far apart as they seem

8284466 james is an exceptional passer he is strong and fast he is not however a great three point shooter and he dribbles too much playing james as the pf does not mean taking the ball out of his hands the kings ran their offense through vlade divac and chris webber and each exhibited his passing acumen imagine james at the high post if he penetrates there is no way for the weak side defender to get from outside the lane to a position where he can take a charge so the defender either has to cheat meaning james can show off his passing skills or challenge james as he jumps to dunk i seriously do not know how anyone would defend the cavs if they ran their offense through james at the high post teams would have to play zone and take their chances with james passing to his teammates on the perimeter when the cavs give james the ball at half court and stand and watch him try to break down the other team they make it easier for their opponents they make james easier to guard honestly james would get 35 and 8 if he played the game within 18 feet of the basket rather than dribbling away half the shot clock 30 feet from the basket

8284739 we talk about that at the beginning of school it being a collective focus we all have a part in the a c t scores and in the national scores
8284740 we just got our scholastic aptitude test scores in we were pleased with that too our s a t scores went up 20 or more points in each of the areas the average s a t score was 1802 the state average is 1700 and the national average is 1511

8285078 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8285079 is part of a wider paradox in modern society on the subject of gender and leadership
8285080 in an era when women have made sweeping strides in educational attainment and workforce participation relatively few have made the journey all the way to the highest levels of political or corporate leadership
8285081 the challenge for women competing in politics or business is less misogyny than unconscious sexism americans dont hate women but they do frequently stereotype them as warm and friendly creating a mismatch with the stereotype we hold of leaders as tough and strong
8285082 many experiments have found that women have trouble being perceived as both nice and competent
8285083 if we can blast 50 women into space we will someday launch a woman into the white house
8285084 in america you always keep going we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8285085 it makes perfect sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8285086 party of hillary clinton and the party of barack obama
8285087 barack obama hasnt even closed the sale yet with 30 percent of democrats
8285088 its not merely the womans right to choose to have an abortion which is at stake
8285089 its whether or not you are going to be able to have a fair shot at a fair wage
8285090 its whether or not you are going to able to demand that you are treated equally in every aspect of your life
8285091 but obama will have to work a little harder to win over the working class women who saw something of themselves in hillary clinton
8285092 you talk about that as a dead end silo while selling end to end business processes
8285093 i dont think it will lead to an increase in demand for siebel
8285094 i expect this is a strategy by oracle to keep its siebel customers from looking outside of the barn
8285095 the entire industry has to get better at making money selling on demand thats what were focused on before we scale the business
8285096 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love

8285121 were focusing on the fact that were in the sports entertainment business and we have to interact with fans and sponsors
8285122 we want to emphasize to our players that they need to be approachable
8285123 were more of an international tour now but were an american based tour and the players need the tools to interact with fans and sponsors one of those tools is to speak english
8285124 we are proud to have tournaments in 30 countries and players from over 100 competing in them and have no plans to impose a common language on them
8285125 they may well violate florida discrimination laws because language is a key element of persons national origin people should be judged on their ability to perform a job english fluency has no more to do with the ability to play 18 holes of golf than whether you walk 18 holes or ride 18 holes

8285135 our policy is not to keep players who dont want to play for us
8285136 however anthony is under contract until 2010 and unless a substantial offer is received from the championship or premier league he wont be sold
8285137 quite clearly anthony gerrards representative has been actively trying to stimulate the interest of other clubs regarding the transfer of the player
8285138 only last week we turned down an offer from a championship club
8285139 however such behind the scenes activity is bound to have an unsettling effect on the player and this it seems has led to anthony handing in a written transfer request
8285140 oh no what happened did he force her to stay at his house and become his sex slave

8285165 the amount of fail on theforum com is reaching epic proportions
8285166 no the blues are because youre getting fat and maybe its been raining too long youre just sad thats all the mean reds are horrible suddenly youre afraid and you dont know what youre afraid of do you ever get that feeling
8285167 over the next twenty four hours put your salt shaker in the cabinet and leave it there
8285168 i think our real identity is not the image we have of ourselves the one we try to project or peoples thoughts about a certain position function or label
8285169 our real identity is our deepest human nature which always has the potential to flourish at any stage of life whether we are healthy or sick whether we are strong of weak because that is to do with the nature of the mind
8285170 even if the mind is not as sharp as before it still has the capacity for loving kindness and the capacity for inner peace as opposed to falling into unease and becoming sort of a little bit upset with the world
8285171 it helps if we can realise that its less a time of action and more for experiencing and manifesting warm heartedness and human qualities
8285172 so its a great time you are not distracted by hundreds of activities and you can bring out the best of yourself which is your human quality not the little things you knew how to do in the past who cares those things are going to pass anyway while human qualities are always available
8285173 well again impermanence is completely part of life so if we revolt against that we are revolting against the very nature of change so theres not much point i think we should embrace it more
8285174 try to see that no matter what happens the best homage we can pay the ones who are no longer there is to live whatever is left of our lives in the most constructive way
8285175 its a less active more contemplative time a time for enjoying the beauty of nature and viewing our interdependence with the whole world why dont we feel that every human being is our relative every place is our house
8285176 try to be in harmony with nature and with those around and then theres no such thing as feeling too lonely if we find the inner resources within ourselves
8285177 if we can find the joy within we radiate it to others and then we suffer less from being alone
8285178 of course if we are faced with complete indifference or sometimes lack of care and concern who can say its nice but i think we can also try to engage those who feel less concerned with us
8285179 maybe sometimes we are part of that but if we try to emphasise loving kindness and warmth for others then naturally they will feel more reciprocally happy in our presence and wont feel it as a burden and therefore it might be easier to maintain those ongoing warm relationships
8285180 we have to make efforts ourselves also not to be too demanding but to be more giving
8285181 yes its kind of heavy but in ancient times and in the east now the idea of extended families was very strong
8285182 of course now there is so much responsibility and difficulty in terms of time and financial burden so we have to find the most humane situation but we can at least try to maintain a very strong feeling of affection care and concern
8285183 try to genuinely and reciprocally cultivate this warm heartedness so that even if you are not together all the time being very affectionate and warm when you are together is a comfort during time spent apart
8285184 there are times in life when we can use our body in the most efficient way but when its not like that anymore if you can relate to inner resources nurture some kind of serenity it doesnt matter that much
8285185 certainly i saw that with my parents my mother is a very luminous and spiritual person she has had some physical disabilities but she is more and more radiant
8285186 my father was a great intellectual the philosopher jean francois revel who passed away last year at the age of 82 and because he depended so much upon his intellectual brilliance when it started to be reduced he felt a little bit down like something had been dimmed and there was not much else
8285187 my mother the painter yahne le toumelin becomes more and more luminous its all about displaying some heart qualities an aspect of peace something luminous that gives her a quality of appreciating being alive and appreciating every moment that passes even if it is not filled with activity
8285188 just resting and feeling at harmony with nature or even staying quietly with oneself if we can learn to appreciate that then we can more easily face the other aspect of our other faculties going away it becomes an opportunity
8285189 if we keep on looking for happiness where it is not then when we dont find it we become sure that it does not exist but this was never the place to find it at all at any time so its more important to identify what are the real conditions for flourishing
8285190 some cases might be particularly difficult but when we look at these situations it always needs two poles of unease or resentment or the feeling that people are not treating us the way they should to slowly create more and more bitterness
8285191 if one has less to lose and less to gain and one is more content with ones own life then if people are very nice or behave in a perfect way then thats great but we see more as well they could do better but after all thats their way of being and we wish that they could be different and they might
8285192 so the best way is to remain what we are and be as open and kind as possible that usually helps to mellow them down a little bit and is certainly better than antagonising them if they cant change anyway its better to be in a good mood than getting into a fight
8285193 often if there is a mood of conflict if you are not in that mood at all it is very hard to fight with someone who doesnt want to fight it is the best way to deal with tensions
8285194 when you see the studies on conflict whether it is couples or family it is very hard to get aggressive with someone who is really not in the mood to be aggressive
8285195 it was quite funny in berkley we hooked people up to all the physiological parameters and then they brought one of the most difficult people on the campus and they put him on the subject that would make him furious like why a scientist would become a monk and believe in reincarnation
8285196 of course its easier said than done but the more you say ok maybe thats the other persons problem not yours so why get into unnecessary conflict
8285197 the best way in fact is to minimise the conflict by not being in that mood or way of being if that can help and that person does change great but if it not then at least you yourself are not becoming totally upset so in any case its the best way
8285198 what do you think of openjdk 10 years from now
8285199 microsoft had better fix the animation sequence at the end of solitaire so that its speed is not cpu frequency dependent or it would run so fast that nobody would be able to see it plus how do you play solitaire on a 3 5 inch handheld screen
8285200 it will continue to push this idea that were not united
8285201 i supported hillary she said she was out she told us to support obama thats what were doing i dont know why theyre doing anything else there should not be a roll call
8285202 it will continue to push this idea that were not united
8285203 i supported hillary she said she was out she told us to support obama thats what were doing i dont know why theyre doing anything else there should not be a roll call
8285204 those who are considering supporting separatism should understand what dangerous consequences their actions threaten to have for world order international stability and the authority of the u n security councils decisions that took decades to build
8285205 if the kosovo precedent is used the russians can also recognise ethnic russian enclaves in places such as georgia or moldova whats good for kosovo is good for other places as well
8285206 ive shut up about this long enough samantha is using my daughter people never even knew who samantha ronson was until she met lindsay she was just some los angeles dj and now shes writing a book i am at my wits end with this stuff this is not in lindsays best interest lets just say i hope lindsay starts opening her eyes and realises who the people using her are
8285207 samantha drinks and passes the drinks under the table to lindsay and behind the scenes it gets worse and worse
8285208 my daughter isnt working because shes always with sam even my ex wife knows it she just isnt doing anything about it
8285209 many children are happy making some money from selling the animals to the markets but they keep some for their family
8285210 not only are our poor eating it but there is also demand from vietnamese living on the border with us

8285219 the georgia crisis has provided a rude awakening the sight of russian tanks in a neighbouring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8285220 the old sores and divisions fester and russia is not yet reconciled to the new map of this region yesterdays unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance
8285221 it is not just the end of the post cold war period of growing geopolitical calm in and around europe it is also the moment when countries are required to set out where they stand on the significant issues of nationhood and international law
8285222 in nato we will stand by our commitments to existing members and there will be renewed determination that there should be no russian veto on the future direction of nato
8285223 today russia is more isolated less trusted and less respected than two weeks ago it has made military gains in the short term but over time it will feel the economic and political losses
8285224 if she truly wants respect and influence and the benefits which flow from it then russia needs to change course
8285225 isolation is not feasible russia is too enmeshed in the world economy
8285226 it would be counter productive its economic integration is the best discipline on its politics it would only strengthen the sense of victimhood that is the fuel for intolerant nationalism
8285227 it will only be a tragedy for russia if it spends the next 20 years believing it to be the case
8285228 these are actions that seek to promote prosperity and respect for russia but they have recently been met with scorn
8285229 over georgia russia has moved from support for territorial integrity to breaking up the country in three weeks and relied entirely on military force to do so

8285276 that was excellent that was a strong speech she made the case for why were going to be unified in november and why were going to win this election
8285277 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief
8285278 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere did she say that barack obama is ready to lead
8285279 millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8285280 standing on that stage tonight in front of 20 000 democrats unified behind senator obama i saw a bright future for america

8285310 the fact of the matter is this government has increased cultural and arts funding
8285311 the opposition has a view that you can never cut any single program ever we have a responsibility to make sure the spending that were doing is effective and that involves analysing every program and making sure we spend where were getting the best results
8285312 this is not the kind of canada we want to live in
8285313 by definition the creation of wealth requires exports and in light of the competition from the u s a britain and others canadas governments must support the export of cultural goods and services in order to build positive trading balances in these areas and net gains for canada
8285314 an export strategy has the potential for huge dividends and if the current programs dont produce we should be hard at work building new ones not trashing those who received support
8285315 countries around the world as well as many cities and regions recognize that a dynamic culture sector plays a key role as a magnet for talent enhances economic output and acts as a catalyst for prosperity
8285316 as always we are listening to our audience and giving them what they want
8285317 wireless connection failed because the network denied the association reqest from this comp
8285318 the groups that are really affected by this are primarily in quebec
8285319 because the quebec artists are sent out as the pride of the province into the international market so the majority of people who are going to lose funding are here in quebec
8285320 some programs in the arts and culture area have increased in funding others have gone down
8285321 culture is one of canadas fastest growing economic sectors its spin off benefits include growth and diversification in tourism and local economies and skills development for the knowledge economy
8285322 if they slandered programs such as promart that were actually performing well they will have no defence against claims that funding cuts were ideologically motivated
8285323 you dont grant artists money in a competition and then subject them to ridicule a year later because your own government gave them money
8285324 reduce subsidies to national museums and galleries move toward privatization of the film industry and enact other reductions in the department of canadian heritage
8285325 the conservative trick is to try to convince canadians that they dont have a hidden agenda while at the same time reassuring their base that they of course do this sends out signals to their right wing base
8285326 at the end of the day we must also ask ourselves whether we want a government that doesnt understand the real value of culture that appoints itself as guardian of public morality and puts the act of artistic creation at the mercy of a narrow right wing ideology
8285327 well find the money somewhere somehow but obviously it will have to come from another area

8285331 in questo governo contrasti con tremonti non ne ho avuti
8285332 sicuramente se domani il consiglio dei ministri approva tutto se dopodomani il consiglio di amministrazione di alitalia procede ovviamente chiarisce il ministro subito dopo bisogna aprire il confronto con i sindacati
8285333 sono previsti anche ammortizzatori sociali non vogliamo lasciare nessuno in mezzo a una strada
8285334 quello che aveva detto berlusconi anche durante la campagna elettorale cioe salvare la compagnia di bandiera perche era impossibile ritenere che litalia non ne avesse una
8285335 in secondo luogo aggiunge il ministro viene salvata quasi totalmente per non dire totalmente dagli imprenditori italiani
8285336 what this government has also done in that area as its done across the government is weve instituted an expenditure management system where over a period of five years we comprehensively review every program and we make sure that were spending on priorities and spending on those programs that are most effective
8285337 some programs in arts and culture have increased in funding others have gone down in total its gone up
8285338 the opposition has a view that you can never cut any single program ever if thats how they want to run the country youll have two consequences youll either have out of control spending or you will have a flat amount of program funding that is increasingly less effective over time
8285339 to fall into the fallacy that its really about moving money around well it isnt

8285346 half of the children whose parents had difficulties in reading and writing found learning to read more challenging than children in the control group the atypical characteristics of these childrens linguistic development indicated the risk at a very early stage and we were also able to draw a clearer picture of the typical progression of a development that indicates reading and writing difficulties
8285347 acquiring the ability to read demands much more practice from these children than from their peers the automatisation of reading poses an additional challenge also a fluent ability to read is a prerequisite to be able to understand a demanding piece of text
8285348 a slow reader isnt able to grasp a given text as a whole and therefore has a hard time following the storyline this is why we should pay special attention not only to the accuracy of reading and writing but also to the comprehension of texts even with quite long sentences
8285349 and in a way that children find amusing even if they do have difficulties in learning to read
8285350 the best time to start these exercises is the latter part of the pre school age but its not too late even after the children have started school the learning result of course improves with repeated training more than once a day and in short sessions the optimal time for a single playing session is however long the children find it enjoyable

8285361 this was a challenging quarter to drive top line sales predominantly due to the change in our talbots brand annual june clearance strategy coupled with a difficult macro environment
8285362 while a year over year shortfall in retail sales impacted the quarter results were largely offset by the talbots brand merchandise gross margin expansion
8285363 also during the quarter we made significant progress in all activities related to the closing of talbots kids mens and u k non core businesses as a result we will complete the closing of these businesses by mid september at a greatly reduced cost versus our original expectation we currently anticipate that total close down costs of these non core businesses to be a net loss of 0 27 to 0 32 per share compared to our original estimate for a net loss of 0 59 to 0 64 per share

8285415 he put up a good show and there were no complaints from anyone watching
8285416 we expected him to go well and come back with at least a bronze
8285417 the draw might have helped him a bit but it was a real bonus to get a silver
8285418 it was absolutely brilliant and it was a very emotional time for everyone involved
8285419 it was hard enough to watch the fight but when he won silver it was out of this world its such a huge achievement

8285486 as more medications are approved for market each year and become available to americans the opportunity for potentially dangerous or even deadly errors due to drug mix ups from look alike or sound alike names becomes increasingly high
8285487 while one drug name may be nearly identical to that of another drug the two could be used for completely different conditions this presents a major public health threat and we think this new tool can play an important role in helping to reduce patient risk associated with this problem
8285488 as one can imagine for someone with hypertension receiving the wrong medication could present a potentially severe consequence
8285489 this is exactly the type of mix up we think could be avoided through tools such as our drug error finder this may be useful to parties across the health care system who are involved in dispensing and administering medications and especially to caregivers and to patients who should always remain vigilant and participate actively in their care

8285530 i consider the 1 1 draw with juventus a success
8285531 i dont think today we have taken a step backwards in our preparations
8285532 perhaps we werent so precise but we had an opponent which was also playing and we had five or six chances with only the goalkeeper to beat

8285557 daarom wordt ik assistent trainer van arjan zo blijf ik betrokken bij de groep en kan ik de meiden nog wat leren ook maar zodra ik fit ben ga ik weer spelen ik hoop dat ik aan het eind van het seizoen nog kan meedoen aan de play offs

8285572 ansys invests significant resources in optimization of our software for high performance computing hpc and we have achieved some impressive performance gains on the latest solution from microsoft
8285573 the combination of ansys software and windows hpc server 2008 enhances cluster computing as an option for our customers who need more hpc capacity in order to expand the role of simulation in their engineering process allowing engineers to work with larger data sets and perform complex analysis with shorter turnaround time
8285574 has been the speed at which the company can achieve even complex computations which has increased up to 12 fold using a dual or quad core workstation is fine for smaller simulations but for complex extensive simulations even multi core workstations couldnt complete the computations in a reasonable timeframe we were delighted to obtain such dramatic results from our investment in a windows cluster
8285575 as engineering simulations become more complex customers using workstations are looking to move up to high performance computing to improve performance and meet tight project schedules our relationship with ansys is key to microsofts commitment to helping companies get better products to market faster
8285576 windows hpc server 2008 makes computing capacity more easily deployable and maintainable within existing infrastructures typical hpc solutions can be costly and complex so we have designed a windows based hpc solution to meet performance objectives for engineering simulations while still being easy to deploy use and manage

8285578 this is an extraordinary example of a creative shift in thinking that truly places new zealand in the twenty first century
8285579 insulating all houses and reducing fuel poverty by compensating residential electricity users for raised prices should lead to evident health benefits for all new zealanders
8285580 the present poor energy efficiency of our houses in new zealand has had serious public health consequences
8285581 many of our homes were built in the late 19th century and the early part of the 20th when energy seemed so cheap we just used lots of it with the certainty of climate change we dont have the luxury of doing that any more
8285582 research the branz house condition survey indicates that around 375 000 new zealand homes have inadequate ceiling insulation and over one million have inadequate underfloor insulation
8285583 no i am the lucky one i am the one
8285584 we regret that we have to close these two daily routes to from cork however a 20 per cent increase in airport charges on these routes reduces our ability to offer really low fares at a time of higher oil prices and these higher costs will make these two new routes loss making this winter

8285608 you might think of new rss feed items as the acorns at the extremities of the tree popping in and out of view like strobe lights flashing as the timelapse runs through the decades now picture a little squirrel on the ground looking up eying those acorns with envy he is of course a feed grazer starting out at the root he makes his way along multiple levels in the hierarchy from sub node to sub node until he reaches the acorn latest feed item he plucks grazes it and then scuttles back down the tree up the hierarchy until he comes to another interesting looking fork then back towards the extremity to fetch another acorn and so on and so on that in a ahem nutshell is feed grazing

8285611 that was a fantastic weekend and like i said at the time it was also a perfect weekend with pole the win and fastest lap and honestly i didnt have a single problem all weekend
8285612 as for the circuit itself it actually looked much better on paper than in real life
8285613 after kimis engine failed it was disappointing of course but i was not too concerned for my own engine
8285614 my win in valencia moves me ahead of kimi into second place in the championship
8285615 i am really looking forward to the dtm event at brands hatch next sunday it is always really good fun when we run the vodafone mclaren mercedes formula 1 car away from the race weekend as the spectators can get closer to the action i have done a couple of events this year in front of my home crowd such as goodwood and the double 12 festival and you get to have some fun and spend some time with the fans ive not driven at brands hatch for a few years but i love the track so it is great that mercedes benz have organised for this demo i think the last time a current formula 1 car ran at the track was in 1986 when nigel mansell won the race so it is pretty cool to be taking it back
8285616 dtm is fantastic i was involved with the dtm when i competed in the f3 euro series supporting races back in 2004 and 2005 it is a great series the racing is always pretty exciting and the atmosphere is really open and welcoming the drivers get close to the fans as they can buy tickets for the paddock pretty easily there is always something happening on and off the track it is definitely worth coming down for the day
8285617 definitely it is a great track and they get to race 82 laps of the shorter indy circuit there is so much going on a lap of the track because it is so short with so much packed into it that the drivers have no time at all to relax i can always remember thinking the lap at brands is over so quickly the drivers will have to be very fit to stay focused in those hot dtm cockpits for 82 laps
8285618 i competed in a couple of races at the end of the 2003 season in the british f3 series at brands hatch after i had won the formula renault title that year racing through druids in a f3 car was just awesome i cannot wait to see what it will feel like in my formula 1 car but i wont be pushing so hard other sections of the track such as when you go up the hill to paddock hill bend are also fantastic you cant see the corner and then when you plunge downhill on the exit you hit this enormous compression it is unlike any other track i have raced on when i was in the f3 euro series it didnt support the dtm at brands hatch which was a shame but with the british f3 races and the three victories i took at the track in formula renault in 2002 and 2003 i know the circuit quite well
8285619 i know all of the mercedes benz drivers as we often bump into each other during the year but of course i know the british drivers that i competed against as we came up through the ranks better for example i raced with susie stoddart in formula renault we shared the podium a couple of times when i won my first formula 3 race in 2004 at the norisring i finished just ahead of jamie green the year when he won the euro series title gary paffett is my teammate at vodafone mclaren mercedes so we spend a lot of time working together on developing our formula 1 car i used to do lots of fitness training sessions with the mercedes dtm guys which was challenging and always a lot of fun as well we are all so competitive whatever part of the programme we were doing so running cycling and so on we all wanted to win badly i can remember the first session i went to i was so much younger than the dtm guys and was there with legends like bernd schneider i couldnt believe it but after a couple of hours i soon found my competitive streak
8285620 i will be supporting all the mercedes benz dtm drivers however a victory for a british driver in a mercedes in front of his home crowd would be fantastic i was fortunate to experience winning my home race in front of my home crowd at silverstone this year the atmosphere was something else so it would be great to see that happen again at brands hatch
8285621 we are not closing the door on the junk food issue
8285622 we would consider reviewing our position if evidence of an identifiably stronger link between advertising and obesity becomes available
8285623 it is therefore difficult to define with any clarity the benefit of banning food advertising to children
8285624 current evidence is that the association between food advertising and obesity is quite modest there is limited research on the benefits of banning food advertising and restricting advertising without a tool to identify hfss foods would be a blunt form of regulatory intervention
8285625 the concept could be explored further in a more mature multi channel environment
8285626 we were budgeting and everything and it was getting really close to going
8285627 but the new head of hbo felt it was just too dark and too violent and too controversial which of course is kind of the point
8285628 it was a very faithful adaptation of the first few books nearly word for word they offered me the chance to redevelop it but i refused ive learned my lesson on that front and i wont do it again so im afraid its dead at hbo
8285629 webers comments are a bit troubling i mean what data is he looking at the comments will create a bit of a row dispute in the u k because our economy is not going to contribute to the recovery he sees not at this stage
8285630 my sense is that ecb president jean claude trichet probably sent weber out there to begin to talk down interest rate cuts to lower expectations regarding how much the ecb is willing to cut
8285631 but even in that context the talk of needing to increase rates is a bit of a farce it may be a year or more before the economy is healthy enough to increase rates
8285632 its sort of hooray and oh shit in the same breath
8285633 nobody here loved the guy and there were a few people who were happy to see the back of him but everyone else realised this was a blow against the independence of the age and its ability and desire to produce quality stories
8285634 he had enough guts to come out on the floor and address journalists straight after hed been sacked
8285635 people were responding on a personal level to a guy whod just been humiliated and to a sense of concern about where the company was going
8285636 theyre taking the opportunity to remove someone who is a bit of a thorn in their side
8285637 this isnt the first time they have tried to cut costs they have tried to do so in the past by reducing the amount of useable journalistic space on the page he fought against that pretty hard
8285638 i think it is recognised he had refocused the paper on the investigative unit he had hired and stood behind and which has performed very strongly
8285639 personality differences with people up the line as well as down the line
8285640 he looked like banquos ghost when informed of the redundancies
8285641 the mainstream media tends to concentrate on droughts and flooding rains type things the downside of living in the bush the eternal struggles
8285642 theres also a view sometimes held in metropolitan areas that you have to be a bit of a dim bulb to stick with a life and career in rural australia
8285643 but there are many farmers and farm enterprises and agribusinesses generally that are having a bit of a go right across the country doing useful interesting and innovative things they have been at the leading edge of lots of innovation
8285644 its six on the road and myself pulling it all together and producing 46 hours of first run television and its a very big country
8285645 that certainly triggered a robust debate among some of our viewers
8285646 we did think very carefully about changing it but in the end we figured the whole gig was overdue for a lick of paint coming in as the new ep i was less hidebound by tradition
8285647 having reached the 1000th show its a matter of concentrating on the yarns and the issues and getting ourselves in a position to cover them as well as we can
8285648 need to look at it now and think if we dont do anything then in a decades time the idea of well resourced quality journalism with hundreds of journalists covering parliament and business and investigative journalism and the courts will be gone
8285649 whats at risk here is the role of well researched serious journalism to act as a check and balance in the system of democracy
8285650 online media can replace part of it the four websites im involved in employ 30 or 40 full time journalists which is quite a lot in independent media terms but compared with 300 or 400 journalists on big daily newspapers it is fairly small
8285651 we can cherrypick we can do the commentary and a little bit of investigative journalism and that kind of thing but i cant see a business model for independent journalism funding hundreds of journalists to do the bigger things that you have to do to fulfil the democratic mission
8285652 they didnt use those words and of course theyll deny that but by removing that number of journalists theyre saying their duty is to shareholders their duty is not to maintaining quality journalism and its place as the fourth estate

8285672 were kind of spoiled by now its been like that since april

8285674 give the team a chance to win and put up as many zeros as i can
8285675 playing defense behind him when hes pounding the strike zone like that it keeps you on your toes
8285676 i felt good for the first two innings and then i just got away from my game plan
8285677 i tried to battle through it but it just didnt work out a bounce here and a bounce there and that was it
8285678 we just didnt make plays that we should have we just couldnt stop the bleeding
8285679 just hopefully well continue to win the way we are as a team and finish strong
8285680 i dont like it i think that it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please

8285691 just because the legislature is late two months in doing their job of approving a budget
8285692 its time for the governor to stop sending letters and holding press conferences and start getting votes from legislators of his own party so that our state can move forward on these critical issues

8285700 cold is good and when it comes to the ocean ecosystem the colder that upwelling gets the better it is for all the animals in the food chain
8285701 this year theres been a striking resurgence of krill in the waters off monterey bay particularly for one species that has really made a comeback from the past three years
8285702 sea surface temperatures that we monitor have been the coldest since the late 1980s and that translates all the way up the food chain
8285703 its bringing more and more food up into levels of the ocean where fish can feed better than they have in years
8285704 the numbers of brandts cormorants for example which should normally be chowing down on this years abundant anchovies havent recovered its really a mystery and we dont have an answer for it
8285705 we wanted it to be shorter more principled forward looking

8285707 republicans caution against the doomsday climate change scenarios peddled by aficionados of centralized command and control government
8285708 we can and should address global warming without succumbing to the no growth radicalism that treats climate questions as dogma rather than as situations to be managed responsibly
8285709 this sounds like more of the bush white house plan acknowledge the problem as real but propose no serious solutions to deal with it
8285710 no one agrees with a hundred percent of whats in there the vast majority of this platform john mccain agrees with
8285711 we recognize thats not a good way to really encourage people to stay in a car free day event and so on a case by case basis were willing to downgrade the citations to a warning and actually take care of towing fees ourselves
8285712 we really saw this as an intriguing and interesting way to get people out walking more hopefully talking more with neighbors there is an opportunity to bike all the way from orcas to seward park so we saw this as a real fun opportunity to get people up and moving
8285713 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8285714 im looking for the track so i can get a seat because i like to sit on the outside
8285715 when i travel with my wife its really a pain getting two seats together
8285716 the ticket counter said it was going to be 20 minutes late
8285717 in europe you can hop the train so much easier and its cheaper i dont know why we cant do that here if they had more trains maybe i would ride more
8285718 when i was in europe i took the train a lot
8285719 they have a fair number of passenger cars that are out of service that could be put back into service with modest amounts of expenditure but their budget doesnt permit that
8285720 for me it costs the same to fly to drive or to take the train so you just have to pick your poison
8285721 i want to stay out of the airports so its easier to do this
8285722 if its an extinction plan instead of an aid to recovery plan
8285723 at the end of the day its very hard through voluntary incentives to truly protect the species
8285724 the act is designed not to just stave off extinction but to recover species often times with this administration that has not been their goal
8285725 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8285726 california has been hit by the financial and housing crisis more than most states thats for sure and the unemployment rate has risen over the last year and a half
8285727 you would expect that at the end of a six year expansion incomes would have moved higher instead were going into the next downturn from a lower point than where we started at the beginning of the decade
8285728 there is tremendous wealth in california and there are pockets of california that have continued to do extraordinarily well
8285729 thats part of the story of income inequality that continues to widen in california
8285730 the fact that its so expensive to live in san francisco doesnt mean we dont have low income people as part of our community
8285731 people who work as housecleaners and busboys in the city tend to live in other places san franciscos low poverty rate doesnt mean the city is doing all the right things it could mean that san francisco is too expensive for poor people
8285732 then it takes a couple of years of growth to see poverty going down
8285733 if we worked to eradicate child poverty it would improve the lives of every one of us
8285734 we need to create more jobs and have policies that encourage firms to hire people here as opposed to moving jobs elsewhere
8285735 we need to get opportunities to people in areas that are still struggling education is part of it but so are jobs
8285736 we have a high pressure system thats in place over the bay area and temperatures will be building over the next couple of days
8285737 growing grapes and making wine sustainably is all about stepping gently into natures realm nudging rather than fighting it
8285738 in an ideal world the sustainable winery would use only hand tools customers and workers would walk or bike here and we would refill glass bottles or goatskin bota wine bags from the barrel but the reality is we bring in farm equipment use cars and packaging materials our responsibility is to consider the big picture
8285739 from green power to green packaging we need to make quality wine and add to the quality of life of our employees and consumers
8285740 it will be the same people who in the 70s ridiculed california for talking about energy conservation
8285741 theyre so willing to embrace our concept ive never seen people who want to know the back story of a product more than san franciscans
8285742 they should all go on prozac the goal should be to eat right and raise your children well not buy heritage turkeys for 25 a pound
8285743 some really fancy dinners and some fancy wines but we also have pickles and potato chips
8285744 we need to go to the red states to people who celebrate traditional values
8285745 i think its important for a big event like this to be supported by city government which is the case here
8285746 maybe we will be dismissed by some people because its in san francisco but i think we can create a voice that connects all over the country who knows what we will stir up
8285747 here in king county just as our ridership is surging higher fuel costs and lower tax revenues from a faltering economy are creating a growing deficit in our metro budget
8285748 we must do all we can to keep our buses running and maintain our existing transit service
8285749 its very important to him and metro because of the very unusual circumstances
8285750 were seeing these huge increases in demands for service so its the worst possible time to scale back we have to scramble

8285757 benefiting from high oil prices and effective cost control the companys net profit for the first half of the year increased significantly

8285762 after much internal discussion over the last few months we agreed that parting ways with reed was the right decision for all of us
8285763 carl happened to be walking by and we gave him a thumbs up and cody gave him a thumbs up and he saw his flag waiving on the back of codys chair and so he stopped turned around and came back and he came over and he signed his wheelchair and he signed his shirt
8285764 he looked at him and he said hey buddy ill tell you if i win that trophy today now thats if i win ill give you that trophy
8285765 cody everyday he wakes up and sees it its like hes realizing its really his and hell get excited and squeal for someone to work so hard to get that trophy and then to say here you can have it that is the kindest gesture anybody has ever done
8285766 as the official hotel of nascar were always looking for ways to bring fans closer to nascar action and you cant get much closer than working as a driver and team owner
8285767 the winning bid not only delivers this once in a lifetime experience for a race fan but also makes a difference to the children that benefit from world vision
8285768 if fans think they can keep up with the grueling schedule of a driver and team owner i encourage them to bid for the chance to swap jobs with me for a day
8285769 strap on your helmet and buckle up because this will be one experience one race fan wont soon forget
8285770 reed is a highly talented driver with a wealth of experience and accomplishments for a 22 year old
8285771 we believe he has a great future ahead of him here at gillett evernham motorsports he will be a great fit with our drivers sponsors and employees
8285772 i really believe in what they are doing with their program with all their wins and poles this year ray evernham and the gilletts are going to give us the equipment we need to go out and be a contender each weekend and eventually race for a championship
8285773 we will announce reeds sponsorships and car number in the near future
8285774 he is a highly marketable young driver who knows how to win races and has a long career full of promise ahead of him
8285775 everybody hates the time change i use that to my advantage since i think im usually on west coast time anyway i still havent gotten east coast time down yet its fun for me its a cool atmosphere and the weather is great without the humidity if its hot out its nice and warm so the heat at fontana doesnt bother me as much as other places and if its cold its a crisp cold its still home and i love being out west and i really feel at home any time we race out there
8285776 was never about diversity as many would play it up to be its about dollars
8285777 ive heard a lot of different views on the dirt tracks over the years
8285778 some absolutely dread going i know i used to but thats certainly not the case anymore we absolutely love going to the fairgrounds truth be known we in many ways consider it the highlight of our season we tend to really get our stride this time of year never used to like going but once we figured out the dirt we love it and i know my brother bill crew chief feels the same way theres something to the history and tradition of racing at springfield and duquoin that also makes it neat to go it reminds me of the day when you had to be good in these types of places to win championships
8285779 when you had to be good in these types of places to win championships
8285780 to race in the nascar nationwide series is a new challenge for me and a great opportunity to kick my nascar career in high gear i know how much this opportunity means and i will do everything i can to earn my place here
8285781 i think hell do fine with the speeds and the tracks considering where he came from but he will have to adjust to the car itself and the level of competition
8285782 its great that he got this opportunity and he wont be the last there are a lot of great racers in canada

8285794 people can call in and talk to their favourite celebrity
8285795 if we continue to lose ice at this rate we will best
8285796 were going to lose that ice so weve got to understand what this means for the rest of us
8285797 already showing patches of open water within the ice much of the beaufort sea north of alaska is open and the laptev sea and east siberian sea have opened extensively in the past 13 days
8285798 it is very unusual to see so many bears in the open water at one time during a short flight period
8285799 its very worrisome its what we had anticipated but its happening right before our eyes
8285800 its just yet another wake up call in a long line of wake up calls to politicians in this country that says hey get your act together when it comes to global warming
8285801 current sea ice reduction is progressing at a very fast rate that appears to have no analogs in the past
8285802 sustained changes in sea ice coverage may cause perhaps the largest temperature changes observed on the planet
8285803 we knew we were vulnerable starting out in terms of ice cover
8285804 actually it was really awful boring the speakers were terrible and uninspiring michelle obama did well but i dont vote for democrats so it was wasted on me
8285805 theres a lot of people id like to help with code that i cant
8285806 many many studies are showing that even small levels of lead in the blood can increase the risk of high blood pressure kidney dysfunction and decreased iq
8285807 it was a u s proposal for the date which is 2015 and an iraqi one which is 2010 then we agreed to make it 2011
8285808 iraq has the right if necessary to extend the presence of these troops
8285809 as weve said negotiations are ongoing and we are not going to get into the details until an agreement is concluded
8285810 we hope that there will be flexibility and understanding from the two parties in order to reach an agreement
8285811 the cps wishes to make it clear that this prosecution was not an attack upon the practices or ceremonies of shia muslims indeed the prosecution relied as part of its evidence upon the president of the local shia community centre
8285812 this man not only abused the vulnerability of these children but also went against the wishes of his own community as well as knowingly breaking the law
8285813 the sensitivities this case raises both legal and cultural are significant we are aware of the communitys concerns about how this case could be portrayed and have been working closely with community leaders throughout the process
8285814 he does have huge flaws and were trying to really paint an honest picture of that
8285815 i think reality tv show the osbournes tarnished the publics perception of my dad as a bit of a senile funny bumbling guy my dad can be that guy but its not him i think that almost discredited who he is as an artist
8285816 a couple of days ago just a handful of districts were affected and today there are 15 which are under water
8285817 the government is asking us to escape but we have nowhere to go
8285818 by 2020 we might have nine billion people on the planet we could have a very big middle class driving millions more cars and we could be in a really resource hungry world with the oil price climbing and a supply situation in libya russia and saudi where natural gas is limited
8285819 it is those drivers those conditions which will encourage the possibility of landfill mining
8285820 once plastic is in a landfill site it pretty much sits there doing nothing and the beauty of that is that youre able to go back and recapture it in the future
8285821 there are some really buoyant prices around because plastic is all manufactured from oil so as the raw price of oil goes up every commodity derived from it goes up accordingly
8285822 over a period of a very long time many decades we have had a policy of burying whatever we can in landfill sites so there are valuable resources in those sites
8285823 and wherever there are valuable resources there is always the temptation to investigate whether its worth recovering them the logic is sound but the practicalities are complex and you have to balance those out with the commercial viability
8285824 several pilot studies have been carried out for research or pre feasibility studies in countries in europe but also in china japan and india
8285825 for example landfills in sweden dating from the 1960s have a lot of waste building material reflecting the construction boom of that era
8285826 and other landfills have very specific waste like those used by vehicle breakers which have high concentrations of aluminium copper and iron scrap
8285827 the value of these materials varies daily with global market prices and today there is considerable demand for scrap metal from china for instance
8285828 just imagine the resources that are lying in those landfills it could be incredible
8285829 russia has not reconciled itself to the new map of this new region we do not want a new cold war and he medvedev has a big responsibility not to start one
8285830 we need to raise the costs to russia for disregarding its responsibility
8285831 we need to re examine the nature depth and breadth of relations with russia
8285832 theyve kept a couple of trees in the front by the highway to hide it and have cleared everything in the back its completely gone
8285833 the trees have fallen onto the wetland and are lying there its very frustrating were expecting to do a roadside protest in the next few days but it seems like its a done deal
8285834 we feel that the municipality should be on site to observe what is going on the players in this are so big and our group doesnt have the experts like biologists who can properly assess what we are losing we have concerned citizens but everything is moving quickly

8285837 this is good news and is entirely attributable to the availability of government programs like medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program schip
8285838 programs like schip and medicaid are lifelines for providing americans with the healthcare they need especially during times when the economy is soft and more people feel vulnerable to losing employer sponsored health insurance
8285839 while this decline is a temporary victory for kids we fear next years data will paint a worse picture for americas children than ever before as the effects of a sluggish economy will be coupled with the inability of congress to pass renewal of the state childrens health insurance program over president bushs two vetoes
8285840 an opportunity for the private sector and the government to work together
8285841 so a lot of businesses across the country are feeling they cannot sustain the healthcare coverage they used to provide for their workers or they are requiring workers to pay more in premiums and deductibles and as a result many of the workers can no longer afford coverage
8285842 and more people are priced out of the healthcare they used to take for granted

8285879 not give schools credit for this foundational work or provide you with the means to evaluate the effectiveness of your k 2 programs
8285880 it sounds like a downward extension of whatevers good but also whats bad about standardized testing in the higher grades with more risk because we know that standardized testing isnt appropriate at those ages
8285881 now theyre venturing into territory where many more people say that the negative will far outweigh any positive
8285882 this is a substitute for something that is already taking place and has been for years and which schools have found to be very powerful but want to be more powerful because they want to be able to measure progress
8285883 if you told a doctor i want you to treat me but i do not want you to take my temperature i dont want you to take any blood samples i dont want you to do any diagnosis just treat me the doctor would be at a loss to know what to do
8285884 will provide an important basis among others for deciding whether it would be appropriate in coming years to measure progress in grades k 2 and if so how best to do so

8285888 once you have a number behind a kid it becomes high stakes because teachers make judgments on kids oh this kid needs remedial help this kids not learning as well it ranks kids

8285890 well be going in as critical consumers and we will be making i think thoughtful decisions about whats going to be best for the children in our school
8285891 working in a very targeted way with children based upon assessment information can really have very positive results if its not used to shackle instruction but its used to enrich the learning opportunities

8285977 in 1996 the liberal government moved food safety out of health canadas mandate
8285978 food safety was handed over to the canadian food inspection agency cfia while the agency was also made responsible for promoting agri foods the end result is that safety regulations are now designed for a global food system not a more sustainable local food system the global food system is rife with dangers due the long distances food travels the impossibility of controlling food regulations and practices around the world and the long shelf life that is expected of food these days
8285979 many regions of canada have excellent local food economies but are hindered because small family farms are expected to adhere to the same safety standards as food that is transported all over the globe yet we know from common sense as well as experience that no matter what standards we impose of global foods safety issues persist when outbreaks occur repercussions are inevitable
8285980 food poisoning and bacteria outbreaks will occur from time to time

8286002 cada vez resulta m s insoportable asistir al silencio la indolencia y la ineficacia de los responsables institucionales y patronales ante el drama humano y social

8286017 in the absence of other policy options such as fiscal tightening or currency appreciation the onus will remain squarely on monetary policy to tackle inflation the rbi is aware of the balancing act it has to do as reflected in its policy statement on july 29th which not only raised the central banks inflation target for 2008 09 to 7 from 5 5 5 but also lowered its economic growth forecast to 8 from 8 8 5 we however expect the real gdp growth to noticeably moderate from 9 last year to 7 5 this fiscal

8286039 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
8286040 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant

8286087 in our second race with hendrick motorsports we got caught up in that early wreck with casey because the track wasnt dry yet and we were racing on it it rained out anyway and then we had to come back monday to run around the track in 40th all day i felt like we had a good car
8286088 we were good in practice but getting wrecked so early we didnt have a chance to run the race i felt bad for my guys and saw how hard they worked to get that car back out on the track
8286089 the biggest thing is you have to keep the guys fresh over the summer time and have them really prepared for the last 10 races
8286090 we do a lot just to give these guys time off it used to be a 20 race stretch now its 18 so you get two less races but that dont mean a lot when you get to california you need to have the momentum on your side

8286104 anecdotally it sounds like a good idea statistically its better to do it the old way
8286105 between 2002 and now the number of books sold because someone saw them on a website is 20 to 25 the number published because someone followed the submission guidelines are thousands and thousands people consider doing it via blog for the same reason people are more scared of being consumed by a shark at the beach than being hit by a car on the way to the beach people think anecdotally
8286106 blogs build communities and familiarity and can help build a core audience its a way to say to the world here i am im a writer and to connect you with other writers and people in publishing community
8286107 posting word counts with meters and whining about my productivity or lack thereof keeps me accountable and working even when i dont want to sometimes i even draw experts out of the woodwork to contribute helpful articles or information
8286108 i speculated that if the american civil war had gone on for oh say another decade it wouldve done remarkable things to the eras technology because nothing drives innovation and tech like warfare except possibly porn lo and behold a retired navy woman with a fondness for military history piped up with this amazing old book discussing the technological innovations of the civil war along with a fabulous quote that i have every intention of using at the beginning of my novel
8286109 several times in the last few years ive had readers cross that line from generally interested reader to practically a stalker which is always tricky and a little unnerving and its made me much more careful than i used to be
8286110 at one point i was receiving two or three full pdf manuscripts a month unrequested and unwanted
8286111 its fun and it feels like work because youre typing but youre probably not getting paid for it and your main job is creating short stories or novels
8286112 a blog is primarily a medium like print is a medium or books are a medium
8286113 information is transmitted through words but the fact is what youre producing through blogging is not writing per se its a presentation of your public persona
8286114 i try to add new pages to the seattle sketchbook blog every week
8286115 i started posting those online because i dont intend to publish them in print form also the sketchbook is a way to keep me disciplined in doing something consistently every week
8286116 it takes years to finish a long book and i thought a blog would be a good way to share with people what i was working on
8286117 blogs are quick hits and books are long form if the former is done right they can be a complementary experience for the latter certainly my own personal experience suggests so but otherwise its like asking if those homemade light saber duel videos on youtube are competing with the star wars films
8286118 not only will i pay the price of the scalzi family tickets to the creation museum i will donate an amount matching the price of those tickets to the charity of johns choice but only after he files a comprehensive report about his visit
8286119 i will go to the creation museum and file a full detailed and delightfully snarklicious report of the trip if and only if i receive at least 250 in donations via paypal
8286120 i thought id get 1 000 i figured my readers would be interested enough in the topic to want me to go and sadistic enough to force me to go i eventually went wrote the piece and put up a flickr slideshow and it was a hugely successful piece of writing
8286121 im amazed that nobody had ever done that in the history of the internet before that got hit by fark and two minutes after it went up it had been clicked on 2 000 times i got 200 000 hits in a couple of days although the blogs baseline hits didnt really budge
8286122 weve had three friendly games which have given me the chance to have a look at players
8286123 i have the team in my mind and we will see who is going to be available we need luck
8286124 weve been unfortunate with barry ferguson and alan hutton who are two key players
8286125 but we have other players who can take their place and its important they are all focused for the challenge ahead
8286126 i spoke to shaun and he feels with a couple of games under his belt he will be 100 and back to his best so i have no hesitation in bringing him back into the squad
8286127 when you move to a new club sometimes it takes time to settle but i suppose with shaun its not a new club
8286128 i think it has given him a new lease of life hes a little spark hes a very inventive player he can play off the striker and wide on the left
8286129 hes got ability and thats something you want in your squad he has missed a bit of football but he certainly looked lively on saturday
8286130 ive named a squad of 25 and we know we sometimes get call offs so they are certainly not out of the equation
8286131 both are experienced players christian is a player who can play in numerous positions and lee mcculloch is injured at the moment
8286132 each squad is different and as months go past its up to players to show that they are in form to get back into the squad
8286133 weve had a good look at it ive got a good idea of my team formation the way way we are going to play
8286134 thats something we will be working on once the squad gets together and we will try to get the right result when we are over there
8286135 we spoke to the players when we met up originally and spoke about 17 points from the group
8286136 its not about one or two games its about the whole campaign
8286137 we are very focused we have two tough away games we have had macedonia watched on a few occasions and they did very well in their last game against luxembourg
8286138 they are a good team and they have nine of the players who played against england in 2006 and they beat croatia 2 0 in 2007 at home
8286139 so its going to be a very difficult game but thats the world cup
8286140 its the biggest competition every country in the world takes part and its an exciting time
8286141 obviously they want to have a look at tom at loosehead and i am happy enough to play tighthead
8286142 there are a lot of guys vying for two positions and opposition is going to be incredibly fierce brendon botha is going to be coming in and he is going to bring his own dimension and his own ideas
8286143 i know clearly what i have got to do i have to get my aggression levels up i have got to be ruthless in there and get back to where i was 18 months ago where i want to hit people as hard as i can and get around the park and use my athletic ability

8286147 clubs know we have no interest in doing any business there so i presume thats why they havent bothered
8286148 atletico madrid hamburg and manchester city are highly interested in thiago

8286159 with all the optimism around campus all the promotions if we dont put on a good show for the fans itll be same old duke riley said
8286160 the biggest thing to begin with was just to generate the interest and have real expectations cutcliffe said tuesday
8286161 thank goodness there are expectations i like that ive never been afraid of expectations we welcome the challenge the administration has declared that they want to change the culture of football at duke and we are taking that seriously

8286164 cleaning up with children around is like shoveling during a blizzard

8286166 if evolution really works how come mothers only have two hands
8286167 playing good defense has a lot with how you do on offense
8286168 if our offense is able to control the ball if we make people go a long way to score points against our defense then we have the potential to be good
8286169 knowing where to be at and knowing where everybody else is going to be on the field
8286170 thats all you can really ask for come out and play fast
8286171 big plays are a result of a missed tackle or mental mistake
8286172 someone in the wrong place playing the wrong coverage thats a big emphasis of ours no gifts

8286176 sen obama and sen mccain have been focusing on pocketbook issues like 4 gas global warming and security issues like energy independence now the auto industrys financial crisis has their attention
8286177 it may seem like the candidates positions are closely aligned but they actually have radically different approaches to cafe the vehicle technologies they champion and the support theyre willing to lend to automakers
8286178 plug ins are the holy grail for fuel economy because they can be driven extended distances on battery power alone and deliver in theory more than 100 miles per gallon
8286179 however major players in the industry disagree if plug ins are the answer theres also the question if 4 billion for r amp d and 7 000 incentives for consumers will be enough to perfect plug ins and other technologies put them into mass production and make the vehicles affordable for consumers on an accelerated timetable
8286180 promises made on the campaign trail have a way of moderating if the candidate gets elected but its clear that a president obama will use a carrot and stick approach to force the industry to become as green as possible and do it faster than they may be able to contain
8286181 while sen mccains endorsement of loan guarantees r amp d tax credits and consumer incentives show support for the industry his proposal to enforce cafe rather than increase it may be more important in the long run
8286182 the industry is making massive investments on borrowed money to meet the stringent fuel economy targets already on the books and they need to strive for a return on their capital increasing cafe would only increase the risks facing the industry
8286183 the cost of complying with todays fuel economy regulations alone will make cars more expensive to buy in coming years and the inflation in vehicle prices will likely outpace wage growth between now and 2014
8286184 consumers will respond by buying smaller vehicles keeping their cars and trucks longer and financing them for seven or eight years
8286185 i cant think of a time when weve had a region emerge as suddenly to become as strategically significant as the caspian
8286186 this is about americas energy security which depends on diversifying our sources of oil and gas worldwide
8286187 its also about preventing strategic inroads by those who dont share our values
8286188 all strategic contracts in georgia especially the contract for the caspian pipeline are a matter of survival for the georgian state

8286190 we have seen the quality of wines in the absa top 10 pinotage competition improve year on year and what is more encouraging is that new winemakers are continuously joining the competition experience consistency commitment and focus can however never be replaced and this year we have seen a number of the more experienced winemakers come out on top
8286191 you dont know what you have until its real bullets flying
8286192 at this point i think i know how theyll respond but you dont know
8286193 weve got some more days to practice well get em ready theres a lot more learning to do we need to practice better than we did yesterday weve got to familiarize ourselves more with our opponent its a process and were not quite there yet
8286194 if you ever ask me on tuesday morning if youre ready to play the game on saturday id say no if you are then we could just pack it in and let them go to school the rest of the week
8286195 you just do what you do during the week over and over but to do that you have to practice the way youre going to play you cant just flick a switch and get ready you have to make the investment and do it during the week
8286196 he probably hasnt gotten a lot of sleep getting ready for the first game

8286212 theres always been an emphasis in pediatrics on prevention and immunizations are a big part of that but adult medicine has not caught up
8286213 i think people dont realize the number of deaths that occur because of infectious diseases every year
8286214 i think the flu and pneumonia vaccine are grossly underutilized
8286215 because adults havent been immunized against whooping cough in years the illness is now starting to show up in adults and so thats why theres been a new emphasis trying to immunize adults again
8286216 so although it seems were more concerned with heart disease and cancer i think the public needs to know that infectious diseases are still out there and are a potential cause of problems
8286217 however since 1978 more than 80 cases of lead poisoning associated with ayurvedic medicine use have been reported worldwide
8286218 several indian manufactured rasa shastra medicines could result in lead and or mercury ingestions 100 to 10 000 times greater than acceptable limits
8286219 a 2005 institute of medicine report concluded that the regulatory mechanisms for monitoring the safety of dietary supplements should be revised the constraints imposed on fda u s food and drug administration with regard to ensuring the absence of unreasonable risk associated with the use of dietary supplements make it difficult for the health of the american public to be adequately protected
8286220 new fda regulations and current indian policies do not specify any maximum acceptable concentrations or daily dose limits for metals in dietary supplements for domestic use we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing
8286221 it took six years for low and middle income californians to regain ground lost from the 2001 recession but those gains were too little too late
8286222 the data released today show that those gains diminished as the state slipped deeper into a downturn
8286223 what low and middle income californians gained in 2006 they began to lose in 2007 and theyre likely to continue to lose in 2008
8286224 the current downturn points to the importance of having a strong safety net in place for families to rely on during tough economic times
8286225 the big concern is that overexploitation is causing the fish to evolve the finding that humans can actually cause evolution of fish populations which in turn can drive their degradation is relatively new and is drawing a lot of attention
8286226 some fisheries including that for cod are now known to cause juvenescence or the evolution of younger smaller adult fish the ecological and economic consequences both appear to be negative
8286227 with cod populations at historic lows and challenges to rebuild them mounting it is important to explore the past for clues about characteristics such as stock sizes exploitation rates age and size structure etc and what ecological roles cod would have played when their populations were larger

8286232 nuestra casa fue allanada 27 veces en los gobiernos de balaguer

8286234 tambi n nos expropiaron nos quitaron una finca de diez mil tareas que ten amos en la provincia mar a trinidad s nchez nagua y que estaba sembrada de arroz
8286235 fue una situaci n normal en la que no tuvimos comunicaci n rec proca con sus gobiernos no se qu pensaba l
8286236 pero don antonio dijo que no porque eso se hab a a trav s de un decreto presidencial y no lo pod a derogar
8286237 luchamos mucho para que se nos devolviera la finca lo que el gobierno hizo fue darnos unos solares en la capital como forma de resarcir la p rdida de la finca
8286238 ten amos informaciones de que el permiso que trujillo hab a dado para que fu ramos a la c rcel a ver los presos era una trampa una embocada para asesinarnos si yo hubiera ido usted o cualquier otro hubi ramos muerto
8286239 los asesinatos de mis hermanas no fueron una sorpresa para el pueblo porque el traslado de los presos desde salcedo a puerto plata ten a la intenci n de matarlas
8286240 trujillo nunca perdon que una mujer lo enfrentara a l pero ella minerva lo enfrent con su forma pero lo enfrent
8286241 no eso no es correcto la bofetada que le dio fue sin manos porque se neg a bailar con el tirano y se fue antes que l de la fiesta
8286242 mi familia fue anti trujillista desde su nacimiento pero ellas marcaron con sus vidas la lucha por la libertad de nuestro pueblo
8286243 lo que pasa es que duramos muchos a os en los que la difusi n de la lucha de ellas no se pod a hacer con tanta libertad como ahora no es que estaba prohibido pero las condiciones no eran propicias
8286244 antes no se pod a hacer publicidad porque hab an cosas que no eran normales nosotros siempre quisimos que mis hermanas fueran sepultadas en el patio donde est n hoy
8286245 porque las condiciones pol ticas no eran las m s favorables siempre hubo gente que tem an a que hubiera represalias pero no exist an las condiciones para que el pueblo demostrara lo que sent a hacia el sacrificio de mis hermanas
8286246 ha tomado tiempo estoy agradecida del pueblo dominicano y de toda la sociedad

8286403 our work uncovers an achilles heel of influenza a viruses that cause human epidemics and high mortality pandemics
8286404 we have identified the structure of a key target site for drugs that could be developed to effectively combat this disease
8286405 the x ray crystal structure gives us unique insights into how the ns1 and human protein bind at the atomic level and how that suppresses a crucial antiviral response
8286406 these experiments validate the ns1 pocket as a target for antiviral drug discovery
8286407 because this ns1 pocket is highly conserved in all influenza a viruses isolated from humans a drug targeted to the pocket would be effective against all human influenza a strains including the bird flu
8286408 this work underscores the value of scientific collaborations between large scale structural centers and individual biomedical research labs
8286409 ein blick auf die letztj hrigen ergebnisse zeigt dass sich die megatrends mehr oder weniger unver ndert fortsetzen bei der generellen entwicklung der sportrechte f r die saison 2008 2009 genauso wie in den bereichen internet und mobile als ma gebliche vermarktungskan le der zukunft allerdings gibt es auch ver nderungen so sind die experten im hinblick auf die tv vermarktung der deutschen handball liga nicht mehr ganz so optimistisch wie noch im letzten jahr
8286410 betrachtet man die zahlen ber alle vermarktungssegmente und sportarten hinweg so zeigen sich vor allem zwei tendenzen fu ball und handball sind nach wie vor die sportarten mit den gr ten potenzialen die einsch tzungen f r eishockey und basketball sind dagegen eher zur ckhaltend insbesondere beim fu ball mit abstrichen auch beim handball sieht es sowohl bei der hospitality tv als auch der internet und mobile vermarktung gut aus vergleicht man die prognosen von 2008 und 2007 so ist jedoch eine gewisse ern chterung festzustellen das gilt insbesondere f r den handball wo der enthusiasmus seit gewinn der weltmeisterschaft beim publikum etwas nachgelassen zu haben scheint entsprechend vorsichtiger sind dann auch die experten in ihren erwartungen
8286411 wenn bei pr natalen untersuchungen eine bestimmte chromosomale auff lligkeit ein sogenanntes kleines markerchromosom bei einem ungeborenen festgestellt wird dann entscheiden sich fast 60 prozent der eltern das kind abtreiben zu lassen
8286412 um die rate der unn tigen schwangerschaftsabbr che einzud mmen haben wir unsere datenbank entwickelt durch deren ergebnisse k nnen wir angehende eltern besser ber m gliche und tats chliche risiken aufkl ren
8286413 nach der weisen nur 30 prozent der kinder die ein zus tzliches markerchromosom haben sp ter k rperliche und oder geistige auff lligkeiten auf
8286414 wenn bei einer fruchtwasseruntersuchung festgestellt wird dass das untersuchte kind tr ger eines 47 chromosoms ist bestimmen wir dieses n her
8286415 wenn sich dort in vergleichbaren f llen also solchen mit dem gleichen typ von markerchromosom findet dass keine klinischen auff lligkeiten vorliegen entscheiden sich die werdenden eltern in der regel f r das kind
8286416 wir wissen dass es weltweit etwa drei mio patienten mit markerchromosomen gibt von daher haben wir noch eine menge erfassungsarbeit vor uns
8286417 wir haben aber das gl ck dass uns die labore aus deutschland sterreich und der schweiz kennen und uns oft solche f lle zur untersuchung zusenden

8286419 surprisingly the median household is just as good as the average professional economist
8286420 im a little surprised because economists are using sophisticated models but the consumers know whats happening with milk prices
8286421 it means economists need to improve their forecasting or at least be a little humble
8286422 inflation expectations are one of the most important factors in the economic environment
8286423 so if consumers lose confidence that could bring us into a bad economic situation
8286424 when theres rising inflation its beneficial to be in debt to purchase real assets because youll pay your debt back with money that wont be worth as much in the future
8286425 with high inflation you want to avoid bonds like the plague
8286426 with the continuing decline of the ogallala aquifer water level and increasing cost of pumping water the use of drought tolerant and high yield corn hybrids is a key for sustainable corn production under limited irrigation
8286427 we hope to reduce the amount of water required for corn by at least 10 percent
8286428 the new multiple stress tolerant corn lines can be used to produce corn hybrids adapted to texas and other southern states
8286429 they can be a powerful tool to save water and produce crops with yield and grain quality under stressful environments
8286430 most of our breeding efforts start by crossing tropical corn with temperate elite lines
8286431 then we select for desirable traits to broaden genetic diversity and introduce useful genes from exotic corn to improve stress tolerance agronomic productivity disease resistance insect resistance and value added grain characteristics
8286432 at 75 percent evapotranspiration you have 3 to 4 inches of available moisture that is used where if you are watering at 100 percent it is wasted
8286433 one of our experimental hybrids produced the same amount of silage in both locations when irrigation was reduced from 100 percent to 75 percent
8286434 developing and using new corn hybrids with improved tolerance to drought and other stresses is important and a viable water saving approach

8286436 the eastern portion of the fault has moved at a predictable rate and the earthquake activity associated with it has been what we would expect
8286437 but the western part of the fault has been lagging in terms of the number and size of earthquakes it seems to be straining absorbing the motion
8286438 it could mean that the fault is getting ready for a large earthquake or it could mean that the movement has been so gradual that we couldnt detect it
8286439 land stations also detected a four fold increase in the number of earthquakes along the blanco fault in 2008 compared to background rates
8286440 our monitoring may be missing a lot of earthquakes that are less than 3 0
8286441 the western side of the fault may be experiencing a series of mini quakes that we cant detect or it could be slowing creeping along in a way we cannot measure
8286442 but we cant discount the possibility that its energy hasnt been released and it will some day in the form of a good sized earthquake
8286443 you need quite a bit of vertical displacement on the ocean floor to generate a tsunami
8286444 between the land based network the hydrophones and other instruments the threshold of detection for earthquakes has definitely lowered over the past 20 years
8286445 but we still cant tell whether the western part of the fault has thousands or even millions of infinitesimal slips or it is building up to a major earthquake
8286446 youve always said that the russians are bullies only thing the bear understands is a sharp rap across the snout i believe was the phrase what do you advise
8286447 clearly a tangible rebuke is needed a punishment we could stop them joining the world trade organization
8286448 but its in our interest to have them inside a rule based international organization and before you say it the same goes for the partnership agreement the eu is negotiating
8286449 thats happened on paper and what about our supply routes to afghanistan through russia
8286450 well at least speed up nato entry for georgia and ukraine if chancellor merkel hadnt blocked it we wouldnt be here now
8286451 no we might not or we might be in the middle of world war three or trying to wriggle out of clear commitments to go to war
8286452 warn them about the dangers of ignoring national sovereignty by invading another country they could end up being regarded by the rest of the world just like
8286453 mark youve always urged keeping the dialogue open with russia and not treating her as a pariah isnt that just appeasement
8286454 such a dirty word minister putin is not hitler no our outrage is clear but back channels can also make it clear this is a special case russia has special interests here and if it is regarded as a bit of tit for tat over kosovo well we agree to disagree on these two cases
8286455 but its not a one off is it it is pretty clear they want to push back into the old soviet space
8286456 its a one off if we say it is if we say it is part of a wider crisis then it becomes so do you honestly think they are going to march into ukraine we have to keep nato membership on the table for georgia and ukraine but these things can drag on when did turkey first apply to join the eu 1959 i think
8286457 heavens no ramp up the rhetoric and warnings stand shoulder to shoulder with every plucky country in the region words like illegal disproportionate and even untrustworthy are helpful or may be deployed within forty five minutes

8286468 the other puppy that was brought in with him is doing pretty well he had
8286469 she was to go last thursday at 1 p m
8286470 and she went into labor at 11 a m so she had been at my house until we could get her moved
8286471 this time i am looking for a foster we had another litter mom is a sweet white shepherd mix and she had six pups i would like to get them out of the shelter as soon as possible i need a foster home for them until i can find a rescue for them
8286472 after their mother was killed there are three males and three females one male with white markings two females with white markings the other three are pretty much black and tans the puppies have been living with a foster mom and were bottle fed from about a week and a half old they are now eating hard food and are ready for their forever homes
8286473 he is a wonderful dog just needs someone to give him that chance
8286474 im sad to say that sirius went missing over the weekend i went to water feed him daily and he was nowhere to be found on saturday morning went back again yesterday sunday nowhere to be found put out more food and water that remains untouched i dont know if ac picked him up or if the storms that came through scared him off or if he went somewhere to die but hes gone i searched the ditches and such near my office as hard as it was to do but there are no signs of him anywhere i dont know what to do
8286475 once it was all over i thought about it if anything i was really sorry for him that any man could live that way
8286476 so many of us have so much and some people are living like that
8286477 a man just pushed me luckily there was a wall behind me so i could right myself and he ran off with the money
8286478 i was selling programmes and he simply pushed me and stuffed the 5 notes down his shirt i grabbed him and just started sticking my hand down his shirt to get them back
8286479 i was really angry i thought youre making a blinking fool out of me
8286480 it wasnt my money it belonged to the queens hall that made me more determined to get it back i was responsible for it
8286481 it was the same time last year he came and he wanted money then as well
8286482 if he comes back again ill remember him next time ill keep well back maybe
8286483 vera is well known and loved in edinburghs theatres and we have no qualms employing someone of her age
8286484 the concert was part of the edinburgh international festival and we think the robber was waiting outside for a quiet moment to pounce
8286485 but vera has a great love for the theatre and stuck up for herself to the best of her abilities as well as give a good description to police which we really do thank her for
8286486 this woman has acted very bravely in trying to stop the thief getting away with any money
8286487 we would appeal for anyone who was in the area at the time and who saw what happened to contact police

8286498 argentina uruguay and el salvador have latin americas highest wireless penetration rates so products like the iphone will help operators get new business from existing clients
8286499 however despite the buzz around the iphone specifically and 3g services in general it will only be with a massive distribution of affordable third generation phones that the 3g market will start taking off in latin america experts say and that may not happen until 2010
8286500 managed to sell over 25 pieces of the glorified mobile phone
8286501 the cost of the phone is too high and moreover the phone is poor pretty low in features
8286502 the first generation iphone and the ipods have full metal bodies but the second generation iphone that has been launched in india has a plastic body and is prone to cracks and scratches the battery life is low
8286503 ah this one is a big issue considering that the new iphone has a 3g radio and gps the battery would last for a day but anything more than that is a miracle unless you turn off everything from wi fi to bluetooth gps and 3g

8286552 you can count on marques because he just goes hes the kind of guy thats annoying to an offense
8286553 it was the fourth game of the preseason and it was coming down to the final cuts
8286554 so i had to go out and show what i have
8286555 the thing about him that i like is hes got a non stop motor
8286556 i can remember two minute drills where hes impressed me there was a game situation and i remember on one drive he couldve had three sacks that just shows that attrition doesnt get to the guy
8286557 you have to keep the motor running at all times
8286558 because when you let it stop the play you let up on could be the one that changes the game for either side i want to be a game changer
8286559 i was trying to get off the ball and get the tackle on his edge a little faster
8286560 its a really good feeling thats hard to describe but once you hit the quarterback its a way to let him know that youre in the game
8286561 we werent happy that collins got hurt but we were happy that we got to the quarterback

8286577 ha mostrado muy poca sensibilidad con este drama que cada semana arroja numerosas tragedias familiares tal y como vimos ayer con las personas desaparecidas de la patera encontrada en el mar de albor n
8286578 si a este drama a adimos que en la regi n de murcia aument la poblaci n en 300 000 personas en muy pocos a os y aproximadamente el 75 de ellas es poblaci n inmigrante sin que el gobierno de espa a haya reconocido este aumento en el modelo de financiaci n nos encontramos con un agujero de 1 400 millones de euros que el estado adeuda a la comunidad

8286606 24 7 we receive as warranted electronic messages from the cfia in the recall notification it also provides directions and specifics of the product
8286607 to address the impacted product if its on the shelf its taken off the shelf and there are directions from cfia as to what to do with that if it was en route to the store then the process is such that it doesnt make it to the store all things being in the interest of minimizing any possibility that consumers would be able to buy the product
8286608 another route more risky it is true but more promising open dialogue leading to tangible progress
8286609 gold mining is a very complicated and expensive business and you really need to see the gold price a lot higher before you see any increase in gold production
8286610 gold should have a sustained price level of over 1 200 an ounce before we see any significant new mine build
8286611 we love gold we have a substantial part of our portfolio in gold mining companies
8286612 i think the gold price will surpass its previous peak
8286613 the platinum market is going to be in deficit until probably 2010 and that means prices will continue to be high

8286621 my friends it is time to take back the country we love
8286622 and whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8286623 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win
8286624 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8286625 race for the future and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8286626 two wars a warming planet an energy policy that says lets borrow money from china to buy oil from countries that dont like us how many people look at these things and wonder what the future holds for them their children their country how many
8286627 in george bush and john mccains america far too many
8286628 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8286629 thats why we must elect barack obama as our next president
8286630 because the race for the future will be won when old partisanship gives way to new ideas when we put solutions over stalemates and when hope replaces fear
8286631 this election comes down to a simple question do we want four more years of bush mccain or do we want the change we need
8286632 let big oil determine and even write our national energy policy
8286633 for the last eight years the bush cheney team stonewalled the taxing of oil company profits and prevented efforts to promote alternative energy production and guess who voted with the bush administration 90 percent of the time john mccain

8286667 but it was then that i was told i must have another operation on the dodgy cells on my cervix
8286668 theyd sent a letter to me ages ago telling me i needed to go in but id been too scared to come in and do anything about it
8286669 the doctor still seemed really concerned she said there was a chance it could be cancerous
8286670 i thought a lot of people would criticise me for going on the show but i have to pay my bills

8286680 in the event of an attack against iran the israelis know that with the capabilities that the islamic world and the shiite world have in the region they will suffer deadly strikes
8286681 our strategic assessment shows that if the zionist regime took action whether alone or with the united states in minimal time all of its territory would be vulnerable because this country lacks strategic depth and lies within the range of iranian missiles
8286682 irans ballistic capabilities are such that the zionist regime with all the means at its disposal has no way of countering them
8286683 israel will not tolerate a nuclear iran and no options are being taken off the table
8286684 i think there is a huge potential for e bikes because of it is economical their running cost is only 10 paise per kilometer while the scooter or motorbike costs around one rupee per kilometer it is value for money
8286685 they are safe you can travel at 25 km per hour you do not require license registration and do not have to pay road tax but we recommend a helmet for safety
8286686 people have been misguided in kashmir giving the politicians an opportunity the original mission is that the amarnath yatra should be conducted peacefully and with facilities all the kashmir leaders are saying this the amarnath yatra has not been stopped till date even when the militancy was at its peak in kashmir
8286687 recently also the amarnath yatra continued during the nine day shutdown in the valley and the kashmiris organised community lunches for the devotees during the shutdown when there was unavailability of food they kashmiris have been saying that they will never stop the yatra at any cost
8286688 every religious place should be respected and all the devotees should also be respected ive heard that the devotees going to kashmir are given a warm welcome and provided with food and other facilities by the kashmiris there is no communal feeling there what i feel is that the issue is political
8286689 it is common people who are the real sufferers the politicians can use them any way they feel like politics has been working behind this issue amarnath yatra is centuries old so why suddenly such an issue has been raised why not the issue was raised ten years ago or 20 years ago or 50 years ago it is all politics and we cannot understand it whats happening is bad and all religious places should be equally respected
8286690 journalists have been beaten up by security personnel there is gross misuse of curfew rules to harass and intimidate journalists while editors and journalists are also constantly threatened by the opposing groups
8286691 whatever its professed beliefs stance or role the publication electronic channel can maintain them only to the extent it sustains the credibility for presenting facts honestly and commenting on them fairly without any bias
8286692 your presence in the area represents a danger to the public order
8286693 the olive harvest season begins only at the end of my four month expulsion
8286694 the issue here is not a humanitarian one for me and my family but rather a national one the authorities cant take it when we show solidarity with each other
8286695 that the reason they got me is because of a pact that was recently made among the various shomron towns called mutual responsibility which states that whenever the army or police come to evict jews from a hilltop or town the jews of all the other towns and hilltops in the area do what they can to stop it even if it is only by standing in an intersection and reciting psalms or holding signs the general security service shabak seems to think that im involved and thats why they have given me these orders
8286696 the issue here is not a humanitarian one for me and my family but rather a national one the authorities weak point is that they cant take it when we show solidarity with each other
8286697 and i am about to plant a grape orchard of ten dunams 2 5 acres following the end of this shemittah year during which planting is not allowed by jewish law ed a few weeks from now in addition i also market flour and if i disappear for four months my market will be gone
8286698 it is sad that arab olives are more important than the lives of idf soldiers
8286699 the police have not issued any such orders to left wing activists who demonstrate in balin and endanger idf soldiers but they are quick to do so when it comes to arab olives
8286700 this is a grave blow to civil rights of israeli citizens
8286701 it only happens vis a vis one side of the political map
8286702 the three are not even allowed to remain in their homes and not leave they must leave their homes altogether
8286703 if there is evidence of a crime those suspected must be tried but not restricted in this arbitrary manner this is an intolerable blow to civil rights that must be stopped it is not rooted in any law but is rather given solely to the arbitrary decision of the military commander o c central command maj gen gad shamni in the area
8286704 and thats a really good rule of thumb to go by

8286711 its hard to believe he could have been that sharp with that much time missed
8286712 it wasnt fantastic but its something i can build on for sure and im glad to be back out here which is the main thing
8286713 theyre in better shape they we are but ive also said that this series in august isnt going to determine who plays in october
8286714 i think playing in this environment this atmosphere against these guys and the cubs we enjoy these games
8286715 if i can go out there and have nothing and get away with five innings and the bullpen does what they do and we get a win
8286716 sure that could be me if i had a personal chef trainer and household help too
8286717 i am of a strong belief that yes we need to learn to communicate
8286718 but whether or not you can communicate shouldnt determine whether or not you have a card on the lpga tour
8286719 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8286720 the players that are playing the best are international players and their play alone should help raise the level of the tour which it is
8286721 theres a group of younger players who all they want to do is play golf
8286722 to show emotion and be engaging they think it may affect their psyche we know that thats just not the case
8286723 it cant be that way to continue to sell our product
8286724 right now we have an awful lot of tournaments internationally and a lot of them are in asia
8286725 i dont speak any asian languages if we continue to play over there are they going to require me to speak korean
8286726 this brings to the state of utah a major astronomical initiative to survey distant galaxies survey the early universe to uncover the origin of the first galaxies understand the birth and evolution of our galaxy and discover planets in other solar systems that would have a suitable environment for harboring life
8286727 boosts the reputation of the department and the university and brings internationally important astronomers to utah to collaborate with u scientists and to design future instruments together
8286728 all faculty undergraduate students and graduate students at the university of utah will have access to the data from this survey to pursue research at the forefront of astronomy
8286729 elevating the university of utah to one of the premier physics and astronomy departments
8286730 would love to see more women get into the sciences into physics and astronomy
8286731 joining a recognized astronomy project like sdss iii is a stepping stone to a successful astronomy program at the university of utah
8286732 the wide scope of the sdss iii program from planet searches to galactic studies to cosmology offers ample choices of research topics to faculty and students
8286733 they are going to take light that comes from a star or galaxy pass it into a high resolution spectrograph and look at the specific color lines emitted by specific molecules in the star or galaxy
8286734 use those measured colors to determine the distance to the star or galaxy and the processes occurring within those objects
8286735 mapping the stars of our galactic halo the roughly spherical region with few stars surrounding the populous galactic disk
8286736 measures the abundance of the chemical elements in hundreds of thousands of stars in the milky way
8286737 these precise measurements will reveal how and when the various chemical elements formed in previous generations of stars
8286738 besides the scientific implications this kind of search has repercussions in the way humanity perceives its place in the cosmos

8286746 theres been a certain amount of pop sociology in america that the shia cant get along with the sunni and the shia in iraq just want to establish some kind of islamic fundamentalist regime theres almost no evidence of that at all iraqs always been very secular
8286747 were not in a civil war in iraq this is just not true

8286760 it was a u s proposal for the date which is 2015 and an iraqi one which is 2010 then we agreed to make it 2011
8286761 iraq has the right if necessary to extend the presence of these troops
8286762 as weve said negotiations are ongoing and we are not going to get into the details until an agreement is concluded
8286763 we hope that there will be flexibility and understanding from the two parties in order to reach an agreement

8286779 onetech storage assessments differentiate our partners from resellers who simply provide a standard quote
8286780 with a storage assessment our partners can offer their customers an actionable plan and roadmap to achieve results this strengthens our partners role as a trusted advisor and enhances their long term relationships with their customers
8286781 we partnered with avnets onetech services team recently to conduct a detailed assessment for a large healthcare client in northern california

8286783 our work showed that all nine antipsychotic drugs we examined uniformly and more potently block the beta arrestin pathway downstream of the d2 dopamine receptor
8286784 some activated it some blocked the g side totally some blocked it only 50 percent the drugs had different profiles for the g protein pathway
8286785 so with this new information drug manufacturers would want to make sure new compounds for antipsychotic use block the beta arrestin pathway
8286786 this work with antipsychotic drugs represents an entirely new approach for studying drug effects and developing new ones
8286787 using cells to monitor specific receptor signaling pathways could provide more selective medicines with fewer side effects
8286788 using these assays as a means to develop antipsychotics should be a useful way to target precise responses and improve patient symptoms
8286789 not all drugs used for schizophrenia have the same degree of movement related side effects
8286790 for some of the drugs these side effects may stem from interactions on the g protein part of the pathways

8286925 our strategic assessment shows that if the zionist regime took action whether alone or with the united states in minimal time all of its territory would be vulnerable because this country lacks strategic depth and lies within the range of iranian missiles
8286926 irans ballistic capabilities are such that the zionist regime with all the means at its disposal has no way of countering them

8286941 new orleans has experienced a profound change in who governs schools and a dramatic reduction of parent and local taxpayer control of schools

8286954 although 62 percent of respondents overall say they have women serving as members of their boards a majority of companies do not have women in upper management positions i think this finding would distress the generation of women who starting in the 1960s broke barriers into the workplace and hoped to find equality for themselves and those that followed

8287010 the interest in local sourcing food traceability and school gardens is on the rise and these elements of the farm to school movement have overwhelming support from food service directors and front line staff across oregon
8287011 we also were motivated to support this program because the foundational data that will be gathered will inform new policies supporting childrens health and nutrition in the upcoming legislative session and beyond
8287012 these two diverse school districts were chosen to study how different procurement regulations may apply and how agricultural operations will need to be scaled to meet the food demand of each district

8287014 portland is the first large urban school district in the country to make such substantial gains in the farm to school programming

8287023 esta serie es uno de los pilares de nuestra programaci n
8287024 la ficci n es uno de los pilares de la programaci n de telecinco llevamos a os invirtiendo en series y tenemos la suerte de poder combinar t tulos que ya tienen un recorrido consolidado con proyectos nuevos
8287025 todos alguna vez hemos tenido la fantas a de preguntarnos qu habr a pasado si hubi ramos nacido en otra familia en un entorno diferente o en otras circunstancias sta es la base de la historia que viven en sus propias carnes las protagonistas de la serie sara y rebeca son hermanas pero no lo saben ya que en el momento en el que nacieron fueron separadas el azar que tanto influye en la vida provoca que un d a cualquiera se produzca un encuentro fortuito entre las j venes dando lugar a una historia extremadamente entra able y divertida que combina elementos sentimentales y de comedia que es una de las claves que caracteriza a este proyecto y que ya hemos manejado en yo soy bea
8287026 las dos actrices se cruzan huyendo de sus problemas rebeca mendoza es una chica de clase alta con educaci n y formaci n que viene de una familia unida estricta exitosa y due os de una constructora ella est enamorada de un hombre que su familia repudia y huye de su padre por otro lado sara est cansada de las discusiones con su madre ella es una so adora que busca la fama y que cree que las cosas se consiguen con menos esfuerzo del que emplea rebeca
8287027 el contraste no estar s lo en las personalidades de las protagonistas sino en los ambientes en los que han crecido durante el tiempo que han estado separadas la constructora por un lado es el mundo de los negocios de la exigencia del xito y de condiciones econ micas de bienestar por otro lado el mundo del barrio y de la plaza est poblado por personajes que tienen su peque o negocio una tienda un restaurante o una peluquer a como es el caso de la madre de sara estos entornos presentan dos formas de abordar la vida produciendo inevitablemente un choque cuando estos universos entran en contacto
8287028 sta es una historia de amor hemos hecho una labor de adaptaci n de profundizar en el concepto realizando los cambios necesarios para que cumpliera con las expectativas y la parrilla de telecinco y con las caracter sticas de la sociedad espa ola
8287029 el producto adquiera una identidad y un car cter propios ya que de esta manera se compite con un producto muy fuerte y personalizado
8287030 al contrario que bea lalola ha ca do bien desde el principio
8287031 im marching because of the treatment hillary received during the primaries she was treated so unfairly by the media and the dnc and no one stood up to say anything about it until after theyd asked her to leave and that was ridiculous the media totally geared and led this campaign
8287032 obama wasnt elected he was selected if you look at all the caucus fraud youll see his delegate lead was only in the red states she won the popular vote and she should be the nominee
8287033 were here to represent hillary clinton and show her that were not going to follow the party line like weve always done
8287034 i will not support obama hes not qualified the whole system was totally fraudulent he claimed to be something before in the primaries that was different that was a new kind of politics but hes not hes not washington politics hes chicago style politics and thats even worse
8287035 these people are trying to scare us about roe v wade well you know what i am beyond my reproductive years i dont care its time for these young obama women who think its so cool to support him they can worry about their own reproductive rights
8287036 one of the basic fundamental platforms of the dnc is against sexism
8287037 because it was ok on the upper level the national level it was ok on the local level too
8287038 antisemitism lets have a little bit of that or next time lets have a little bit of racism or maybe have a little bit of gay bashing next time
8287039 they sacrificed women because they could take their vote for granted and that is not what democrats stand for

8287047 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security

8287062 im not in favor of getting into a tax credit war with other jurisdictions and having them try to one up each other
8287063 having a tax credit that does what it is intended to do will be very useful

8287076 if you are really interested in a hybrid which many people are there are several pros and cons you will really want to consider before you buy
8287077 one benefit is that hybrids obviously average better gas mileage than conventional gas vehicles however they are usually a couple thousand dollars more expensive and can take a few years to recoup the premium paid for them
8287078 due to limited supplies new hybrids are difficult to find consumers are sometimes required to make a deposit to be added to the end of a waiting list people interested in driving a hybrid should consider purchasing a used hybrid
8287079 to help find that perfect used car id recommend people look for an auto retailer with services that let you know when certain vehicles become available such as carmax coms inventory alert system and allows you to transfer used cars from one store to another
8287080 there are many vehicles that provide fuel efficiency beyond just hybrids
8287081 there are a number of non hybrid cars that can get more than 30mpg on the highway and we have the expertise and tools available to help people find a more gas friendly car

8287103 all fears to the contrary however american wife is no hatchet job no gossipy kitty kelley bio in disguise nor is it hagiography or the sort of seamy political pulp fiction in which denizens of the capitol have been known to dabble rather it is an intelligent well crafted psychologically astute novel that granted will anger the overly literal and the easily outraged but such people are unlikely to be eager readers of contemporary fiction this book is for those of us who are

8287211 this employment first represents a great step in our air forces ability to deliver precise effects across the spectrum of combat
8287212 the first combat employment of this weapon is the validation of the exacting hard work of an entire team of professionals who developed tested and fielded this weapon on an extremely short timeline based on an urgent needs request we established in the combat zone
8287213 we have consistently used precision guided weapons to engage stationary threats with superb combat effects
8287214 this weapon allows our combat pilots to engage a broad range of moving targets with dramatically increased capabilities and it increases our ability to strike the enemy throughout a much much broader engagement envelope
8287215 teamwork was the name of the game to accomplish this
8287216 from the experts in our air force materiel command who shaped our requirements then developed tested and fielded the weapon to our aircraft maintainers our munitions airmen and weapons loaders and everyone in between they made the operational employment of this weapon possible at end game on aug 12 the team of the joint terminal attack controller alongside his ground unit commander in this event ensured all criteria were met for the first combat delivery of the ljdam and finally our f 16 pilot accurately and precisely delivered and guided the weapon to desired weapons effects the disabling and destruction of an enemy vehicle and personnel

8287272 we coach little league in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states
8287273 the overwhelming support latinos gave to hillary clinton was a vote for hillary clinton and not a vote against barack obama
8287274 in three national polls barack obama is leading mccain by an average of 35 points so latinos are getting behind barack obama
8287275 our job is to make sure we increase that margin and increase the number of voters who turn out
8287276 if they vote in the 70th percentile barack obama will be the next president of the united states
8287277 it would definitely help if obama reached out to our communities and if the hispanic leadership brought him with them and stood by him
8287278 there are people who still want to hear it from hillary clinton then they need to hear from obama
8287279 this election demonstrates that latino voters have become a permanent element of the political landscape
8287280 you dont need the majority of the vote you just need a significant share
8287281 personal development and investing in your person is the most profitable investment to do
8287282 im going to pueblo colo this week to campaign for barack obama and im going to campaign as hard for his candidacy
8287283 it matters to angelenos who is in the white house if i have a voice to add to this debate i intend to use it
8287284 the purpose of the meeting is to talk about the significant role that villaraigosa will play in the campaign as it moves from now forward
8287285 the obama campaign wants to make sure that he plays a crucial role in the campaign they want to reassure the mayor that the obama campaign appreciates everything he is doing

8287287 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8287288 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8287289 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8287290 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8287291 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8287292 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8287293 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8287294 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8287295 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8287296 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8287297 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8287298 my goal is to provide an alternative not to free the mac os what we want to do is to provide an alternative an option its not that people dont want to use mac os many people are open to the idea but theyre not used to spending an exorbitant amount of money on something that is essentially generic hardware
8287299 now state officials want to upgrade the system by installing electronic tolling sensors that would allow motorists with small easy to install transponders to access the lanes

8287311 this just wasnt the elimination of a threat to iraq this was elimination of a threat to the west part of this titanic struggle we are in between western judeo christian values and principles and islamic extremists
8287312 in arguing for a strong defense of georgia in its struggles with russia mccain twice noted that georgia is a christian nation perhaps to distinguish it from other crumbling pieces of the former soviet union that are muslim such as chechnya and azerbaijan
8287313 martin opened a shop opposite us and it was a roaring success i got speaking to him as it was going up and he promised that when it was finished i would want one myself i laughed at the time but i looked into the idea and liked it
8287314 we may be heading for recession but confectionery is always popular the people in ipswich have been really friendly and we want to offer them a good product with good service
8287315 ipswich is our smallest build yet but the property had been empty for a good year and billy saw an opportunity
8287316 if i feel convinced that the business is feasible in an area i have to go there other shops will inevitably come and go but we wish to do business as professionally and sustainably as possible
8287317 its one of the things that make a place like ipswich more attractive suffolk homes

8287365 tv will fundamentally change how we talk about imagine and experience the internet
8287366 no longer just a passive experience unless the viewer wants it that way intel and yahoo are proposing a way where the tv and internet are as interactive and seamless as possible our close work has produced an exciting application framework upon which the industry can collaborate innovate and differentiate this effort is one of what we believe will be many exciting new ways to bring the internet to the tv and it really shows the potential of what consumers can look forward to
8287367 on the pc and mobile devices yahoo is a leading starting point for millions of consumers around the world
8287368 yahoo aims to extend this leadership to the emerging world of internet connected tv which we call the cinematic internet by partnering with leaders like intel we plan to combine the internet benefits of open user choice community and personalization with the performance and scale embodied in the intel architecture to transform traditional tv into something bigger better and more exciting than ever before by using the popular yahoo widget engine to power the widget channel we intend to provide an opportunity for all developers and publishers to create new experiences that can reach millions of tv viewers globally yahoo plans to enable the cinematic internet ecosystem which will benefit consumers device makers advertisers and publishers
8287369 as consumers look to stay connected and entertained regardless of where they are and what device they are using the web continues to affect our lives in new ways and is quickly moving to the tv thanks to a new generation of internet connected ce devices
8287370 as intel delivers its first ia soc with leading edge performance and internet compatibility for consumer electronics devices we are providing a powerful and flexible technology foundation upon which the industry can quickly innovate upon this technology foundation will help the high tech industry bring devices to market faster as well as encourage new designs and inspire new services such as connecting the tv to the internet
8287371 after five plus years of criticizing amds direct connect architecture our competition has effectively ratified it by developing a technology based on the core fundamentals of our design
8287372 amd is always skating to where the puck will be to borrow a phrase from wayne gretzky nine years ago we saw that efficient processor architecture was what customers needed and we led the industry there now intel is finally arriving to the architecture game late and weve moved on to delivering a truly superior balanced platform with todays leading graphics technologies like the 790gx and the ati radeon hd 4870 x2 and our industry leading processor architectures amd is delivering computing solutions today that are designed for tomorrows graphics intensive workloads while intel is sprinting just to implement technologies like we introduced in 2003 our focus is squarely on execution weve got the strongest products weve ever had and we believe our offerings will only get better in 2h 08
8287373 when considering something like intels larrabee their attempt at entering the graphics market it is important to remember product blunders like itanium and xscale in that context larrabee makes perfect sense as intels proposed graphics solution when all you can do is x86 processors then everything looks like a problem that can be solved by x86 processing cores unfortunately early analysis by industry experts point to larrabee being too hot and too slow to be an effective graphics solution
8287374 amd is on a roll in graphics leadership from the best mainstream hd desktop and notebook chipsets to high performance graphics cards for the most demanding graphics applications today
8287375 our engineers have put together an incredible processing family here that will include a tremendous amount of new processor features all centered on delivering faster computer performance and terrific energy efficiency
8287376 calpella will redefine how we compute on the go by giving users a stunning new computing visual experience better manageability and security enhanced turbo mode features and evolutionary power management for notebooks
8287377 technology is a tool to address some of the worlds most pressing challenges related to health care education economic development and the environment
8287378 no nations or individuals are untouched by these issues get involved be part of the solution

8287380 northrop grummans hornet system leverages the latest advances in real time coupling of human brain activity with automated cognitive neural processing to provide superior target detection
8287381 the system will maintain persistent surveillance in order to defeat an enemys attempts to surprise through evasive move stop move tactics giving the u s warfighter as much as a 20 minute advantage over his adversaries
8287382 the idea of this project is to build a visual device that is attentive that can do the kind of low level visual processing that your eyes do naturally
8287383 you would see a certain picture in your field of view but the device would actually be looking over a much wider space and if it found something interesting it would present you with that picture as well
8287384 neuromorphic engineering is interdisciplinary using fields that include biology physics mathematics and computer science as well as electrical and other types of engineering its aim is to develop artificial systems such as vision devices or auditory processors or even robotic systems based to a degree on natural biological systems
8287385 this is a highly interesting platform problem because you really are trying to build at least initially a simple representation of one layer of human brain cortex maybe multiple layers if you can
8287386 you need a great deal of computational power robustness and performance and it becomes possible because a configurable analog digital system has a power efficiency improvement of up to 10 000 times compared to an all digital system
8287387 the wests foreign policy priority is no longer terrorism it is to tame the new great power nationalisms and harness them to democratic ideals

8287394 we opened an immigration agency office to allegedly control and manage the undocumented haitians but it has never carried out its mission theres new furniture and a bus that hasnt done its first trip nothing has worked
8287395 the countrys number one and one of the caribbeans three most important
8287396 the problem we have is that we can monitor or respond to the haitians who are in hotel construction but those outside or informal those who have no work those haitians who dont know where they live we cant locate the streets are filled at all hours day or night
8287397 those who arent working are vagrants you see them day and night its gotten to the point that when you walk through some places you see signs in patois creole
8287398 of course in partly its our fault the hoteliers are the ones who hire haitians but what happens when they leave the work sites we automatically lose control of these people and haitians also come who arent working in construction coming to do business here when its payday you see fried food venders flea markets who come from haiti to sell here
8287399 they dont leave one peso here they send money to their families or spend on prostitutes and rum you will you never see a haitian in a formal business in a restaurant or anything like that
8287400 it goes completely against a set of united nations resultions that they themselves voted for

8287449 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
8287450 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
8287451 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
8287452 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
8287453 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8287454 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8287455 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8287456 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8287457 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8287458 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8287459 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable

8287463 youll never know which part of the internet youll need all parts of the internet are on the iphone
8287464 we considered that because the ad had not explained the limitations viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a website normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the website we concluded that the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone
8287465 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
8287466 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
8287467 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
8287468 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
8287469 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
8287470 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
8287471 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
8287472 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
8287473 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
8287474 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
8287475 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
8287476 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that

8287478 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
8287479 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
8287480 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
8287481 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
8287482 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
8287483 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
8287484 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them
8287485 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
8287486 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance

8287497 for the future of the human race against the fiercest force they have encountered
8287498 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride
8287499 this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store
8287500 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8287501 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8287502 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8287503 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8287504 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8287505 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8287506 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8287507 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8287508 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8287509 oftentimes one brings in celebrity for a sense of making a campaign look like its young and vibrant and visionary and all the rest of it you give it a bit of that showbiz juice the problem is that the last thing that barack obama needs is showbiz juice
8287510 hes got all the charisma hes got the speaking the whole idea of this rock star candidate is now to some extent being reframed to become a liability the democratic party has to be really careful that they dont paint themselves as a hollywood presidency kind of thing
8287511 a lot of people are beginning to realize that celebrity endorsements are doing a lot more to get you to change your mind about the celebrity than they do to get you to change your mind about a candidate
8287512 most people come to candidates with pretty set ideas of what their party is and who they like and who they dont
8287513 just because one of their favourite actors endorses someone or speaks for one of them i think its more likely that the average voter is going to say oh i used to like that celebrity but they like candidate x so i dont like that celebrity anymore
8287514 if the youth vote turns out as it did with the primaries for obama i think youre going to see a president obama
8287515 if the youth vote does as it has done in the past and that is that it always promises and looks like its going to be behind john kerry or al gore then what youre going to see is president mccain
8287516 i think it cuts both ways the candidates want celebrities there because it brings media attention but they dont want them around too much because they dont want to bring negative attention as though it is just a celebrity kind of endorsement
8287517 depending on the celebrity you might be able to register three votes but you might lose three votes there are people in hollywood who are very divisive in terms of their politics
8287518 the celebrities use it as a means of getting themselves back into the limelight
8287519 its what i would call a synergistic relationship where both sides probably benefit in a celebrity spectacle culture
8287520 moreover since bill is not and has not been for years gainfully employed he will be scrounging around for cash everywhere but that wouldnt be exactly new would it
8287521 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8287522 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8287523 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8287524 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8287525 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming

8287528 mother nature in the form of planet earth is about 4 5 billion years old way older than even madonna
8287529 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8287530 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8287531 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8287532 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
8287533 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
8287534 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
8287535 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
8287536 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
8287537 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
8287538 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
8287539 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
8287540 you know it was once said of the first george bush that he was born on third base and thought hed hit a triple
8287541 well with the 22 million new jobs and the budget surplus bill clinton left behind george w bush came into office on third base and then he stole second
8287542 and john mccain cheered him every step of the way
8287543 i am old fashioned i love the sport the way it is
8287544 but the time has come for this i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay
8287545 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play
8287546 that any change is very very difficult in the nfl the rules change every year weve had one significant rule change in the last 35 years the dh and were still arguing over that
8287547 the ballparks have just gotten tougher and tougher over the years
8287548 youve got all of the new ballparks and fans are sitting closer to the outfield there are different colors and lines and ground rules
8287549 its going to be nice having help with instant replay
8287550 i think its a rush to judgment to implement it at this stage in the season the timing is terrible
8287551 i think that it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8287552 with the ballparks getting smaller so fans can be closer its getting harder and harder for umpires to make the right call
8287553 whenever theres a disputed call you always have one manager out there arguing
8287554 and then the umpires get together and if its overturned then the other manager comes out
8287555 why not give the umpires all of the help they can get and increase the accuracy in the calls
8287556 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8287557 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8287558 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8287559 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8287560 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8287561 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8287562 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection

8287571 its very dangerous there are other objectives that one can suppose are the objectives of russia in particular crimea ukraine and moldova
8287572 while russia sent aid to flood hit ukrainian regions ukraine failed to help russia to force georgia to peace and took an openly hostile stance
8287573 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8287574 moscow has acted brutally in georgia but when the united states and britain backed the independence of kosovo without un approval they paved the way for russias defence of south ossetia and for the current western humiliation
8287575 what is sauce for the kosovo goose is sauce for the south ossetian gander
8287576 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
8287577 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
8287578 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
8287579 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
8287580 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
8287581 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
8287582 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
8287583 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
8287584 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
8287585 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
8287586 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8287587 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
8287588 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
8287589 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
8287590 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
8287591 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8287592 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8287593 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste

8287595 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
8287596 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
8287597 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
8287598 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
8287599 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8287600 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8287601 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8287602 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8287603 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8287604 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8287605 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8287606 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8287607 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8287608 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8287609 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8287610 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals

8287612 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8287613 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8287614 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8287615 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8287616 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8287617 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8287618 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8287619 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8287620 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8287621 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
8287622 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
8287623 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
8287624 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
8287625 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
8287626 we categorically deny that the sudan liberation movement has carried out the hijacking
8287627 say anything now but we are considering everything so that the passengers the 100 passengers are protected
8287628 the spot was not approved for broadcast in the format the advertiser requested because it contains a controversial political message
8287629 commercials with controversial political messages cannot go on the air
8287630 articulates uncontroversial norms acknowledging the supreme importance of higher education as well as the duty of the state of israel to facilitate the realization of aspirations for those seeking to pursue education
8287631 theres also a chilling effect because the longer students are prevented from leaving the fewer apply
8287632 exposing palestinians to a pluralistic and democratic academic environment can only have a positive impact upon the students who could help bring such values back to palestinian society
8287633 if someone is studying chemistry at the university of tehran or advanced religious texts at an extremist madrassah in south asia these are not the kind of things we want to facilitate
8287634 our troops carried out an operation this morning and we have reports that 30 militants including some uzbeks were killed
8287635 yes but he may need to work on energy and taxes two economic issues that have been the target of several recent mccain ads obama has a comfortable eight point edge on economic issues overall 51 to 43 percent
8287636 but the mccain ads may have come with a cost half the public thinks mccain has attacked his opponent unfairly while only a third feel that way about obama
8287637 neither candidate scores well on that measure and the conventions are the first and best chance to present clear solutions to current problems
8287638 dif cil falar o que precisa ter mas igual o ltimo jogo derrota para o santos na vila belmiro que n o pode acontecer mais a gente foi muito disperso desligado pode ter sido isso tamb m mas entrar mais ligado e determinado

8287711 quite frankly young marines join our corps to go fight for their country
8287712 they are doing a very good job of this nation building business but its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going some place else in a much more expeditionary environment where the marine air ground task force really seems to have a true and enduring value then thats where we need to be
8287713 this has been a very important and a very encouraging meeting said de boer
8287714 the process has speeded up and governments are becoming very serious about negotiating a result
8287715 accra shows that overcoming the muddle of conflicting views and crafting an effective deal to tackle climate change is possible
8287716 the issues are still contentious but ideas have been put on the table
8287717 i honestly thought as i wrote in an email home that if the people of america could see what ive seen thered be troops here in one week man i am so naive because thats not true at all theyve seen it now and weve still done nothing
8287718 all the information the dispatches the websites the columns the books the films have not roused anybody with the power to stop this tragedy actually to stop it
8287719 and if i was looking through a scope instead of looking through the lens of my camera these sudanese military vehicles would be done these people could return to their village and theyd be safe
8287720 true we were poorly served by a small minded president and his bungling administration but did liberals demand the right things of him did we push for what would really save the people of darfur or did we get trapped by the inclinations of our worldview and advocate for too little
8287721 i would use american force now i think its not only time not to take force off the table i think its time to put force on the table and use it
8287722 genocide is happening on our watch what are we going to do about it what were doing now is not working

8287725 current world bank president and then united states deputy secretary of state robert zoellick who by that time had become bushs point man on darfur its a tribal war and frankly i dont think foreign forces want to get in the middle of a tribal war of sudanese if omar bashir the president of sudan knew of zoellicks comment then he would also have known that he would win in darfur and he has won

8287727 he was held under terrible conditions his tongue was cut and he was even physically attacked
8287728 to argue successfully for the postponement of a now defunct english high court case in which pakistans government was suing zardari over alleged corruption
8287729 it refers to something three years old he is fit and well he was jogging around the prime ministers house just a moment ago
8287730 i dont know if someones going to raise it or not but being of sound mind is a condition of becoming president
8287731 his opponents may bring it up to attack mr zardari and submit a petition to the election commission
8287732 first sergeant hatley then made the call to take the detainees to a canal and kill them
8287733 the bottom line is he has to come to the negotiating table and negotiate with the mdc as representatives of the people of the country to find a way forward
8287734 they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating and that in six months time the government will collapse i do not know when that day will come i wish main opposition leader morgan tsvangirai well on that day
8287735 but unfortunately he is a driver who is so determined to crash the vehicle hes trying to take us into a ditch
8287736 its clear hes trying to create any reason to rush to an election to hide how much he is ill prepared to face the difficulties of the country this prime minister is panicking inventing reasons to try and trigger an election and breaking his word
8287737 it was the best feeling in the world just to know she was alive
8287738 shes talking and just asking about her kids all the time and letting everybody know how much she loves them and appreciates the searching for her and not giving up she said she knew that everybody was looking for her
8287739 she had children here that she loved dearly as well as her husband and her family with the small children she had the will to carry on
8287740 i cant thank tommy enough for his help and the people that helped look for her
8287741 hes my hero i love him more than anything my wife loves him more than anything and i know her kids do for bringing their mommy back home
8287742 we focused on the area right around her house the buffalo cove mountains which is some pretty rough terrain
8287743 we had a lot of folks up here my staff at caldwell county emergency services along with all of the volunteer agencies the fire departments the rescue squads the law enforcement we had hundreds of man hours invested in this
8287744 it was something we all wanted we were praying for an outcome like this and for it to become a reality that was a blessing for all of us
8287745 faith hope and will those three things i think got her through it
8287746 this is an operation that hasnt been done before it took a real team effort
8287747 we also took a skin graft from his thigh area to help fill in the large indentation of his lower lip to rebuild the area
8287748 its really the work of the doctors in ireland that have helped alan come this far they were essential in his early life saving resuscitation and permanently maintaining his breathing and feeding tubes throughout the years
8287749 we suspect based on what we were able to see that the tongue is so undeveloped its unlikely at this point that we will be able to restore swallowing and breathing and his mouth
8287750 his mom bernie has been so supportive throughout this entire process
8287751 she had the biggest smile on her face when the surgery was completed
8287752 his tenacity is what really propelled him to have the operation
8287753 initially i think there was some concern on part of his parents but it was alans motivation that gave him the support to get him through these procedures
8287754 its a great success not only physically but a new chance for his self esteem and self confidence
8287755 tymoshenko is the arch pragmatist whereas both yanukovich and yushchenkos positions are much more positions of principle i think you have to interpret her silence as an effort to gauge where the swing voters are on this issue
8287756 its ok if i make money or dont hurt anybody too bad
8287757 persistently low fertility and an increasing number of survivors to higher ages
8287758 projections such as these are proof that we are right to be carrying out the biggest shake up to the immigration system for a generation
8287759 centre stage is our new australian style points based system which means only those we need can come here to work or study
8287760 essential we develop a coherent strategy to deal with population growth
8287761 this strategy must bring together policy on issues from the family to border control housing to skills and planning to immigration control
8287762 we not only need to ensure that our population grows at a more sustainable rate but that we also prepare properly for that sustainable rate of growth
8287763 the government have shown that they have no answers to the challenges we face by failing to plan for our increasing population this makes them part of the problem not the solution
8287764 population statistics are predicted by using recent figures so this report will have used the statistics of immigration in the uk in the last few years the level is high so the prediction will be high
8287765 there are signs that immigration in this country is starting to tail off if you were to do this again in 2010 or 2011 i think it would be different
8287766 check your departure airport to see if your flight may be affected

8287768 airline passengers are sick and tired of delays and cancellations
8287769 were not going to let an unsafe condition exist its just going to be slower
8287770 the president susilo said that this mission only fail if all of us quit
8287771 as our experience in handling aceh rebellion there was a setback the key to handling this business is never give up
8287772 president susilo said that indonesia wanted gambari to keep plying his constructive role under the support of the focus group
8287773 the president hopes for a resumption of dialogue between the myanmar government and aung san suu kyi
8287774 its probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their child words
8287775 the language center of most right handed adults is located on the left side of the brain
8287776 this is consistent with our finding with newborn babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently
8287777 it was stressed that the deal should include the entire issues without any exception and without any partial or interim agreements
8287778 we are extremely privileged to host such a prestigious event and are looking forward to welcoming some of the finest examples of mercedes benz vehicles in existence today
8287779 classic days will offer car enthusiasts and the general public alike a chance to see the finest cars from the past century some of which have been transported from across the globe to appear at out event
8287780 as a team we do try and score at least 300 runs a day in test cricket
8287781 in honour of bradmans legacy thats the least we can do
8287782 his name is a by word for brilliance soccer has pele cricket has bradman no name in cricket conjures up such widespread awe and respect as that of sir donald bradman
8287783 even people with just a passing knowledge of the game or in countries where he never played will invariably recognise the name bradman as a by word for brilliance that name says all that is best about the game and it is synonymous with cricket soccer has pele and cricket has bradman
8287784 even now 60 years after his final test match and with time to put his achievements into context his batting average of 99 94 still seems scarcely believable especially when one compares it to those of the many other players to have graced the game at the highest level
8287785 we should also remember the way he gave back to the game after he finished playing as a selector and as an administrator with the australian cricket board and the imperial cricket conference

8287795 sterreich muss somit als hochsteuerland eine geringere abgabenquote fixieren um wettbewerbsf hig zu bleiben

8287803 spoke greek even though he had a name of latin or roman origin
8287804 and perhaps for this reason as well was able to mediate between cultures in a true universality
8287805 profound orthodoxy that saw a risk a threat in the man called jesus
8287806 this explains the fact that he clearly persecuted the church of god he was on the road to damascus precisely in order to prevent the spread of this sect as he himself said
8287807 became a tireless apostle of the gospel and passed into history for what he did as a christian or rather as an apostle
8287808 is subdivided on the basis of the three missionary voyages to which is added a fourth when he was taken to rome as a prisoner
8287809 in the ancient cultural capital he preached to the pagans and greeks in the agora he gave a model speech for explaining to the greeks that this god is not foreign and unknown but one they had been waiting for the deepest response to their anticipation
8287810 dedicated himself to the proclamation of the gospel without holding anything back
8287811 can be explained only by a soul that is enraptured with the light of christ
8287812 it is truly necessary to proclaim the light of christ to the world to give a glimpse of the beauty and necessity of the gospel for all of us
8287813 that the lord may show his light to us as well and that we may also give the world the light of the gospel the truth of christ
8287814 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
8287815 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
8287816 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
8287817 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
8287818 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
8287819 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8287820 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8287821 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8287822 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8287823 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8287824 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8287825 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8287826 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
8287827 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
8287828 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8287829 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates

8287837 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
8287838 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
8287839 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8287840 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8287841 he that covereth his sins shall not prosper but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy
8287842 there are people who will buy the water when they need it and the people who have the water want to sell it thats the blood guts and feathers of the thing
8287843 the idea that water can be sold for private gain is still considered unconscionable by many
8287844 but the scarcity of water and the extraordinary profits that can be made may overwhelm ordinary public sensibilities
8287845 theres been an upsurge in ascii spam in the last week its quite effective in getting through filters
8287846 the downside is that 9 times out of 10 its completely useless because its almost impossible to read or its a really bizarre picture of a naked lady thats not clickable
8287847 we expect spammers to use every means possible to try to send spam thats why we have a very robust spam fighting effort at google

8287849 theyve got this great idea for getting past the servers but they dont seem to know how to employ it as effectively as they could
8287850 combining this with effective spam techniques might be more effective
8287851 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8287852 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8287853 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8287854 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8287855 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8287856 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8287857 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8287858 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8287859 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8287860 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
8287861 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
8287862 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
8287863 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
8287864 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator

8287868 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8287869 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8287870 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified

8287940 generalmente los consumidores se lo han pensado a la hora de comprar y han mirado mucho el precio
8287941 que hace un tiempo que llevan notando un temor al gasto por parte del consumidor se est observando que ante los continuos mensajes de crisis los ciudadanos tienden a enfrentarse a la situaci n recortando sus gastos
8287942 primavera inusual que hemos tenido los peque os comercios esperaban ilusionados la temporada de rebajas para efectuar un incremento de las ventas que son fundamentales en las cuentas anuales de los comerciantes ya que suponen el 20 por ciento de lo que se factura todo el a o sin embargo han constatado un descenso de facturaci n porque a pesar de que s que se han producido ventas los descuentos eran tan bajos que no les han compensado

8287945 los grandes eventos que se est n celebrando en la comunitat valenciana son la f rmula perfecta para atraer turistas y promocionar as la comunitat a nivel internacional
8287946 ha superado las previsiones de ocupaci n hotelera alcanzando niveles muy satisfactorios para el sector
8287947 han alcanzado niveles de plena ocupaci n gracias a la llegada de turistas de todo el mundo que han visitado la ciudad con motivo de la f rmula 1
8287948 la ocupaci n tanto en la ciudad de valencia como en su entorno metropolitano ha alcanzado el 99 74 por ciento
8287949 en el litoral de valencia la ocupaci n se ha situado entorno al 93 21 por ciento ligeramente por encima de las previsiones iniciales
8287950 muy superior a las previsiones que se situaban entorno a 3 4 puntos menos
8287951 la llegada de turistas extranjeros que se da de esta forma tan destacada ratifica la importante labor de promoci n de la conselleria y que los grandes eventos tienen una rentabilidad tanto en la ocupaci n del momento como a lo largo del resto de los meses

8287962 mientras el gobierno de espa a puso de manera inmediata tres millones de euros el consell de camps no ha puesto la otra mitad tal y como reflejaba el convenio firmado entre las dos administraciones
8287963 la comunitat es escaparate al mundo de grandes eventos pero tambi n hemos de ser ejemplo de justicia y solidaridad
8287964 parece ser que atender las necesidades b sicas y de justicia no son una prioridad para camps
8287965 el nico que ha puesto el dinero encima de la mesa y ha cumplido su compromiso con afectados ha sido el gobierno de rodr guez zapatero
8287966 tampoco ha ejecutado los proyectos anunciados para paliar los da os provocados por el incendio de l alcalat n

8287975 a lo que supone el partido socialista en la comunitat que parece m s un juego de risk en el que cada uno juega por su lucha de poder y por tener su peque o espacio y que creo que se eleva a cinco el n mero de jugadores que en estos momentos est n optando a la secretar a general del ps
8287976 unidad y a la solvencia del pp y del presidente camps llevamos un a o y cuatro meses de digesti n pol tica de una derrota por parte del pspv
8287977 no han sido capaces de articular una propuesta un proyecto y una alternativa ni de defender los intereses de los valencianos a trav s de su labor de oposici n llevan un a o y cuatro meses sin hacer oposici n y eso no es bueno para la comunitat
8287978 s lo hay un partido pol tico que apuesta claramente por la defensa de los intereses de la comunitat por nuestras infraestructuras demandas las necesidades h dricas que tienen los valencianos mejorar nuestra financiaci n y pide temas tan importantes como la seguridad
8287979 vamos a entrar en grandes temas y en grandes proyectos
8287980 necesario que las fuerzas pol ticas de la comunitat se planteen posiciones comunes en la defensa de los intereses de los valencianos
8287981 est escondiendo la cabeza frente a a una situaci n econ mica de crisis
8287982 es el m ximo exponente del principio de arqu medes
8287983 flotar sobre una situaci n como es la crisis econ mica sin dar ninguna respuesta ni ninguna alternativa
8287984 nos parecer a bien si en la comunitat hubiera un partido socialista que apoyara los intereses
8287985 no he o do todav a ninguna respuesta a la propuesta de dec logo que el grupo parlamentario popular hizo que inclu a las medidas tanto del gobierno de espa a como del gobierno valenciano para afrontar de forma inmediata la situaci n de crisis econ mica
8287986 apoyar lo que sea bueno para los valencianos pero no estamos dispuestos a que una vez m s los presupuestos supongan una excusa para llegar a acuerdos en no s qu otras cosas con otras formaciones pol ticas nacionalistas y de su propio partido y que adem s convierta la comunitat valenciana en un residuo de inversi n cuando es una de las m s ponentes y aporta riqueza y crecimiento al conjunto de espa a
8287987 las reivindicaciones en inversiones que est haciendo el partido popular de la comunitat valenciana no por motivos partidistas sino por inter s general de los ciudadanos y ciudadanas de la comunitat
8287988 sigue el partido socialista girando la cabeza cuando hablamos del trasvase del ebro
8287989 no se puede hablar de pactos en materia de agua si del que queremos hablar nosotros se cierra la posibilidad desde un principio
8287990 apoyan que se reconozca que somos cinco millones de valencianos s o no apoyan como ha hecho tambi n el pp en otras comunidades aut nomas a los gobiernos de otros partidos pol ticos que se reclamen m s fondos al gobierno de espa a en funci n de la poblaci n en este caso 1 000 millones de euros s o no
8287991 m s preocupadas por saber si van a tener un minuto de gloria desde el estrado y desde la tribuna de les corts pero hay cosas muy importantes que se tienen que ver y hablar

8287994 lo que est n defendiendo es una comunidad valenciana marginada que no existe para l y que no cuenta para ninguno de los grandes aspectos que se est n debatiendo en el conjunto de espa a

8288007 jesse jackson all the things hes done great for our people you commend him for it but the way he spoke about obama jesse jackson was wrong for what he did
8288008 i wanted to expose a little of his dark side dont forget he had a baby out of wedlock awhile back everybody is imperfect but when you do something like that disrespect a situation thats affecting us all on an everyday basis people like me with voices gotta step in

8288019 he logic behind the zach randolph to memphis rumors is simply trading bad for bad if the grizzlies can get new york to take on some of memphis unwanted contracts then its worth looking at the rumor as it stands is memphis would assume the remaining three years and 43 9 million on zachs deal with a 2008 2009 salary of just under 14 7 million if the grizz could send out the final two years and 14 5 million owed to darko milicic and the final two years and 18 7 owed to antoine walker it seems like thats what memphis is looking at marko jarics boat anchor of a deal could easily be subbed in for walker because you can argue that walkers contract which is the highest on the team is the best deal as the final year is a non guaranteed year

8288053 rats have destroyed food and crops largely in areas along the indo burmese border lines but in many other parts drought has brought severe difficulties for farmers
8288054 though we could not confirm of the deaths it is very much possible because people in some villages have lost all of their food stocks and are dependent on jungle fruits and roots
8288055 in some of the cornfields nothing is left but the stems of the corn
8288056 the reports we have received tell us that the situation is grave as indeed the rats have destroyed crops and continue to impact on the future food security of people living in those townships particularly in the western more remote parts of the state kaye said

8288207 killing an unborn child is never the right answer to a womans or societys problems acts of violence create a culture of violence and abortion is the most intimate form of violence there is it wounds the woman it kills the unborn child and it poisons the roots of justice and charity that bind us all into one human family
8288208 catholic public leaders inconvenienced by the abortion debate tend to take a hard line in talking about the separation of church and state but their idea of separation often seems to work one way in fact some officials also seem comfortable in the role of theologian and that warrants some interest not as a political issue but as a matter of accuracy and justice
8288209 speaker of the house nancy pelosi is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettable knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
8288210 catholics especially politicians who publicly defend abortion should not receive communion and
8288211 from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong
8288212 of course we now know with biological certainly exactly when human life begins thus todays religious alibis for abortion and a so called right to chose are nothing more than that alibis that break radically with historic christian and catholic belief

8288278 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8288279 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8288280 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8288281 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8288282 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8288283 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8288284 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8288285 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8288286 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8288287 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

8288301 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8288302 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8288303 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8288304 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8288305 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8288306 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

8288311 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8288312 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8288313 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8288314 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8288315 in the first half of 2008 the domestic petrochemical industry was faced with a serious situation where international oil prices soared to high levels repeatedly hitting record highs prices of production materials rose continuously refined oil products prices and crude oil prices were seriously inverted as a result of the governments stringent control over the prices of refined oil products and market competition was ever intensifying as a result all domestic oil refining businesses posted losses and the petrochemical industry witnessed an obvious decline in profitability in light of such grim situation the group fully implemented the overall cost leadership strategy as its main course of action the group further improved its production operation adjusted the assets and product mix enhanced internal management and strove for cost and expense reductions in the first half of the year the group maintained stable operations and production without encountering any major incidents in production safety or environmental protection the performance of major technical and economic indicators was satisfactory with total production output reaching 5 0687 million tons up 15 43 year on year whereas operating results posted a substantial decrease over the same period last year due to impact of changes in the external operating environment and policy related factors
8288316 in the second half of 2008 the average cost of crude oil may continue to climb since the significant loss in the companys oil refining operations arising from the inversion between refined oil product prices and crude oil prices in the country may not be reversed within a short period of time on one hand whether the states financial subsidy policies to ensure the supply of refined oil products will change or continue remains to be seen on the other hand in line with the recent sharp drop in international oil prices prices of downstream petrochemicals witnessed a decline and the company has yet to process these already purchased expensive crude oil in transit and in stock the group cannot be optimistic about the extremely tough production and operation environment in light of the above unfavorable conditions the group will continue to strengthen management work to ensure smooth stable and optimized production operations further implement the overall cost leadership strategy amid the challenges posed by high oil prices dedicate efforts on corporate development tasks steadily pushing ahead reforms on the companys internal systems and mechanisms and strengthen team building among staff to further improve the companys operating efficiency
8288317 the ability to interoperate with public health agencies on behalf of participating medical practices that use primesuite is a key component of greenways clinical research and public policy strategy
8288318 the reporting functionality offered through primesuite enables us to relay critical public health information to registries that in turn can relay warnings and alerts that are relevant to the entire community demonstrations such as the phin conference highlight the many ways that ehrs are improving healthcare in america and we are extremely pleased to be participating

8288324 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8288325 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8288326 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8288327 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8288328 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8288329 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8288330 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8288331 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8288332 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8288333 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8288334 who are open to doing something on the production side
8288335 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8288336 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8288337 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8288338 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8288339 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8288340 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8288341 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

8288401 orthopaedic intervention for stroke patients can help to maximize the chances that the affected arm for example may still be useful for activities of daily life
8288402 it is critical for the orthopaedic surgeon to become involved in the management of these patients immediately following the stroke to ensure the best possible outcome
8288403 during this time patients and families are primarily focused on the cognitive effects of the injury
8288404 but it is important to remember that there are numerous non surgical treatments that should be employed to maximize the functional use of the affected limb
8288405 it becomes crucial to consider surgery to reduce or eliminate painful muscle spasms and correct deformities the type of surgery performed depends on which areas are affected and whether or not the limb has been determined to be functional

8288420 in this difficult housing environment real estate professionals and home sellers need to do all they can to differentiate their property
8288421 while perceived value is not the same as what someone ultimately pays for a property it sets the benchmark as to what this property is worth in a buyers mind compared to other homes in the same neighborhood first impressions often have a big impact on a buyers decision making process on which homes to visit and how much to offer
8288422 professional photographs and videos are just as essential as a yard sign
8288423 the small investment made by my real estate agent was absolutely worth it and really set my home apart from other properties in the area
8288424 more than 84 percent of prospective home buyers start their search on the internet so the use of video to market a property is essential
8288425 videos are free to create on propertypreviews com so the return on investment is significant and home sellers should be demanding it

8288457 the proposed solution to a 100 year flood risk is a permanent solution so were going to have to live with it for the 99 and 3 4 years that we dont have floods
8288458 i think what weve found is that weve been having 100 year storms a lot more frequently than every 100 years
8288459 in fact some of the locations that were looking at weve had numerous instances of flooding over the last year year and a half two years and so we need to do something
8288460 we worked with the arts commission we worked with the landmarks preservation commission they liked those designs were hoping the public will and were interested in some of the feedback when we put the prototypes out

8288464 there was obviously evidence of sexual abuse that was not investigated by many people before the final episode
8288465 i started to wonder if a special procedure had not been performed if any of the professionals would have addressed the issue of sexual assault
8288466 all of the people who came into contact with the family gave emotive descriptions about her parents and how lovely they were
8288467 if a risk assessment was performed there would have been quite a bit of concern about the possible perpetrator given that one might be concerned that that person consenting to the abortion had a vested interest in lying
8288468 audi was already on a roll with the launches of the r8 and the a5 and were continuing that trend with the entirely new a4

8288480 zo is er een zaak waar iemand een game heeft gemaakt met een bepaald lettertype dat lijkt op het teken van een groot frans modehuis deze laatste vond het een inbreuk op hun merkrecht dan vraag je je als starter af wat je moet doen of je de game uit de handel moet halen bijvoorbeeld
8288481 maar vaak vinden ze de tarieven te hoog en kunnen ze dat niet betalen het is waar dat wij relatief duur zijn
8288482 net ontving ik nog een mail van iemand die een probleem had met zijn weblog

8288484 dan vind je nog wel een advocaat of een rechtsbureau die je daarbij kan helpen
8288485 we hebben nagedacht hoe we dit konden oplossen we doen al een deel pro deo maar dat willen we niet aan de lopende band doen we werken met een aantal grote nederlandse internetbedrijven waar we ook een goede relatie mee willen opbouwen
8288486 het gaat om praktisch advies de studenten kunnen niet procederen dat gaan wij ook niet doen dat is te tijdrovend hoe we de bedrijven daarin verder kunnen helpen daar zijn we ook al mee bezig het idee is om met verschillende advocaten een grote groep op te zetten waarbij iedereen een beetje tijd investeert

8288501 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8288502 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8288503 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

8288507 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8288508 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8288509 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8288510 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8288511 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8288512 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table

8288518 sustained partnerships by governments the private sector and international organizations are needed to provide these children with access to the education and resources to enable them to overcome the poverty and exploitation that has defined their childhood

8288537 in this difficult housing environment real estate professionals and home sellers need to do all they can to differentiate their property
8288538 while perceived value is not the same as what someone ultimately pays for a property it sets the benchmark as to what this property is worth in a buyers mind compared to other homes in the same neighborhood first impressions often have a big impact on a buyers decision making process on which homes to visit and how much to offer
8288539 professional photographs and videos are just as essential as a yard sign
8288540 the small investment made by my real estate agent was absolutely worth it and really set my home apart from other properties in the area
8288541 more than 84 percent of prospective home buyers start their search on the internet so the use of video to market a property is essential
8288542 videos are free to create on propertypreviews com so the return on investment is significant and home sellers should be demanding it

8288549 if you are really interested in a hybrid which many people are there are several pros and cons you will really want to consider before you buy
8288550 one benefit is that hybrids obviously average better gas mileage than conventional gas vehicles however they are usually a couple thousand dollars more expensive and can take a few years to recoup the premium paid for them
8288551 due to limited supplies new hybrids are difficult to find consumers are sometimes required to make a deposit to be added to the end of a waiting list people interested in driving a hybrid should consider purchasing a used hybrid
8288552 to help find that perfect used car id recommend people look for an auto retailer with services that let you know when certain vehicles become available such as carmax coms inventory alert system and allows you to transfer used cars from one store to another
8288553 there are many vehicles that provide fuel efficiency beyond just hybrids
8288554 there are a number of non hybrid cars that can get more than 30mpg on the highway and we have the expertise and tools available to help people find a more gas friendly car

8288565 i may not be twenty anymore but age is just a state of mind in my mind im twenty and holding
8288566 your mind may be twenty but your body is thirty six

8288574 good evening im from chicago the hometown of the next president of the united states barack obama
8288575 in the 2006 election democrats independents and even some republicans scored a victory that president bush himself called a thumpin
8288576 the truth is the bush crowd has been giving the middle class a thumpin and this november the middle class is going to give it right back
8288577 a strong economy depends on a strong middle class but george bush has put the middle class in a hole and john mccain has a plan to keep digging that hole with george bushs shovel
8288578 an online system operated jointly by the department of homeland security and the social security administration ssa participating employers can check the work status of new hires online by comparing information from an employees i 9 form against ssa and department of homeland security databases more than 69 000 employers are enrolled in the program with over 4 million queries run so far in fiscal year 2008

8288580 windows allows people to express their individual personalities while managing their lives and connecting with others
8288581 today consumers want their technology purchase to reflect their personal style and they appreciate the wide range of product choices that only pcs with windows deliver
8288582 were interested in bringing choice and innovation to the total end user experience
8288583 the design of your computer is as important as the design of your handbag or living room couch after all if a customer isnt attracted by a pc theyll never get to experience our software
8288584 we give these companies early feedback on the prototypes they show us and we help showcase some of the most fashionable pcs as we are here at project
8288585 its a two way street our partners are constantly encouraging us to be as innovative as we can be
8288586 we dont think customers should be limited to pcs that are black white or silver pcs with windows are available in a wide variety of sizes shapes colors designs and accessories so you can have a pc that reflects who you are your personal style and fashion sense theres a pc with windows out there for everyone and with any style
8288587 we want to reach fashion trendsetters with the message that pcs with windows can really help them do so much more and do it with style
8288588 and pcs with windows are available in a broader range of design choices
8288589 the pcs that we will be highlighting are not just beautiful to look at they are also highly functional pcs that offer a great overall experience
8288590 like with many automobiles you are not only getting beautiful paint and design you are also getting a high performance vehicle with state of the art features
8288591 in fashion one day youre in and the next youre out
8288592 i think this is going to become an important part of how pc vendors differentiate themselves going forward
8288593 once a design consciousness hits a market it never goes away look how important design and style have become in the car industry
8288594 in fact i wouldnt be at all surprised if five years from now well be able to look at a pc from across the room and immediately know what brand it is like recognizing a prada bag
8288595 you can see and understand the businesses involved for example ships come into the port unload containers reload containers and leave
8288596 ten to 20 years from now infrastructure could be larger than real estate
8288597 we took a sample and discovered 80 employees had filed approximately 170 claims
8288598 thats an average of two or more claims per employee that seems very excessive
8288599 and more than half of the claims were single vehicle accidents many involved windshield damage which appeared to be excessive that just seems very high
8288600 the review found we were lax in our fiscal oversight and authorized a number of reimbursements without ensuring the required procedures were followed
8288601 this failure to follow procedure negatively impacts our integrity as a fiscally responsible agency this is especially troublesome at a time when we are expecting reductions in our county and department budget
8288602 we have over 3 000 social workers who are responsible for visiting children in their homes schools and communities and interacting with approximately 35 000 children under the supervision of the county
8288603 as a result there are a lot of individuals on the highways but we dont know if all of these were legitimate or if fraud has been committed but the action plan we have instituted will reveal that
8288604 for example one employee submitted four claims in one year all single vehicle accidents totaling approximately 6 000
8288605 the employees vehicle required minor bumper repairs for 1 100 which included eight hours of labor
8288606 for example an employee approved her own field itinerary by signing her supervisors name and putting her initials next to the signature
8288607 another claim had three different signatures for the division chief but the division chief only signed one of the forms
8288608 i had told my administrative staff that i wanted a 100percent audit of every process weve got to make sure we are using our money wisely

8288611 shopping around is the best way of cutting the cost of your insurance but make sure you shop around and find a policy that actually has the cover you want

8288613 the new superb has achieved much improved ratings thanks to enhanced vehicle security competitive pricing and low cost of parts and repairs all of these factors contribute to lower insurance premiums for our customers
8288614 theologian john dunne tells of a group of early spanish sailors who reached the continent of south america after an arduous voyage their caravels sailed into the headwaters of the amazon an expanse of water so wide the sailors presumed it to be a continuation of the atlantic ocean it never occurred to them to drink the water since they expected it to be saline and as a result many of these sailors died of thirst that scene of men dying of thirst even as their ships floated on the worlds largest source of freshwater has become for me a metaphor of our age
8288615 be yourself and dont talk about yourself too much thats not sexy dont tell me about your private jet im not interested
8288616 is how id describe this beer there is no need to even start the evening off with the hard stuff if you have a 120 in hand the 120 minute was everything it was hyped to be caramel super high alcohol content and enough bitter to please by far this was the standout of the evening

8288620 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8288621 hillary clinton just gave the most amazing speech it was perfect in every sense
8288622 i have catch phrases now that i will be using to bash any mccain supporter that comes near me in a 10 mile radius
8288623 she proved why she is in a league of her own
8288624 hopefully now the democratic party will move forward unified as one
8288625 mrs clinton gave one of the most brilliant speeches tonight
8288626 although i enjoyed the speech i really thought that hillary should have been a little stronger in her words in support of barack obama
8288627 it was very clear right from the beginning within the first minute of her speech she said im for barack obama
8288628 she said it over and over and over again throughout the speech
8288629 dont believe it when they talk of bitterness there werent any bitter hillary supporters among us
8288630 we all said of course we were going to support our partys candidate sen obama
8288631 its going to be difficult to cast a vote for somebody who i thought made a wrong choice
8288632 if i do vote for obama it will definitely be because sen clinton asked us to do it but its not going to be a joyous vote
8288633 hillary clinton gave her speech and ive got to say it was fantastic she did an amazing job
8288634 she did a very good job of talking to her supporters and winning them over for barack obama
8288635 but i also think that she won a few barack obama supporters as well
8288636 i did like and found somewhat impressive the email this to chris example how does the email integration works does it require gmail or it launches any available client
8288637 we are pleased to add the gallo line to the rapidly growing edge assortment of products gallo is an extremely well respected name in loudspeakers that sound and look great and fit into a wide range of installations our dealers are always looking for quality products and edge will give gallo increased exposure and penetration in the custom installation market
8288638 the word good is like the new bad why settle for even smart when you could instead call your child gifted
8288639 people dont always recognize a gift because theyre expecting a prodigy
8288640 when its fun and playful thats when it gets into your head
8288641 you can make your language a little more complex use more adjectives
8288642 i talk a lot i tell him what were doing what were eating where were going
8288643 rather than ask is this kid counting better than others
8288644 says alison steier ph d director of clinical training at the arizona institute for early childhood development
8288645 i think were here to support their development whatever their interests are
8288646 you also want your child to be resilient empathetic and creative
8288647 then once in a while he gets a little whiny and i remember
8288648 whats happened has happened theres no use crying about it
8288649 well go there next weekend i love that circuit id love to race there all year long
8288650 its the best of them all and i hope to have a good car there ill do my best to win there once again
8288651 if anyone doubts my motivation they can be sure of this i want to win now more than ever
8288652 it does seem that the street circuits havent been favourable to me in four races ive only claimed one point in melbourne in a race i didnt manage to finish because of an engine failure
8288653 then there was the incident with adrian sutil in monaco and hamilton crashing into me at the exit to the pit lane in montreal
8288654 eestlastega ei nnestunud gaasijuhtme panekus kokku leppida nad ei lubanud isegi merep hja uurida
8288655 the disciplines that are required to win a championship were not there i felt that the team were quite capable and were good enough to win a championship i had a hard core of about ten players who were committed the rest were only coming and going and i wasnt going to stand for it any more
8288656 at the end of the day i spoke to pat and bernard who were very committed but i wasnt going to come down from dublin if i wasnt getting the commitment from the players the sad part of it is that i genuinely believe that we were capable of winning the championship we played thomas davis in a friendly they played really well and i was very happy
8288657 we had had a friendly game against sarsfields on the previous saturday and we could only muster up 12 or 13 players i felt that i had no option i told pat and bernard a letter was drafted by the three of us we gave it to the executive and each of the players i am disappointed and particularly so for the genuine players
8288658 i am gone two weeks i have nothing lined up i played a junior game with my club last night thursday there was no row no fight or anything like that with ohanrahans it is just that a number of players were not putting in the effort it is as simple as that
8288659 there was no effort to get me back i spoke to bernard and he half hinted at it but this will not happen i told them that it was final
8288660 david was involved with other clubs in dublin foran denies this and he felt that he couldnt give us the commitment
8288661 training is going well 18 to 23 players training is not bad for a small club we had 22 players up at 9pm last sunday morning
8288662 he has not left us in the lurch and there is no problem with foran and us he appreciates that we are a small club and this is happening to a lot of small clubs in the county i dont think there is any issue between us he didnt say there was a problem
8288663 g will tell a lot about the mental and physical condition of the players
8288664 i was very surprised really im always up at around 6am and i noticed nothing odd on friday morning until i saw the guards
8288665 this is a very quiet estate we are lucky in that it is a cul de sac so people cant drive through really the first i heard of it was that evening when the guards knocked on the doors and then i saw it on teletext
8288666 we never have any trouble here so i am surprised but ill be locking the door at night as usual
8288667 so far we have not made any arrests and enquiries are continuing
8288668 i left because the commitment wasnt there and the numbers werent turning up
8288669 now the soccer season has started the players are more interested in playing soccer and football in ballinabranna is only secondary to them i was left with no choice and i told the players last tuesday night
8288670 that was it there was no reaction it is the first time that i have had to leave a club in mid season
8288671 i feel sorry because they are my own club no matter what they are a great club and there are people working very hard but the players dont seem to be putting in the effort i am not sure whether it is lack of effort or just no interest they are not willing to make the sacrifices and only the clubs who are willing to do this are succeeding
8288672 i dont know how they are going to rescue the situation
8288673 the situation came to a head on one occasion when a 14 year old kid could have been hurt
8288674 an executive decision was taken on the matter to the effect there will be no more warm ups or parking at carlow town hurling club
8288675 we have no problem in accommodating teams when it has been cleared by the county board
8288676 thats not a problem because we would know whos coming we can plan it open the dressing rooms cut the pitches and put up the flags but that wasnt possible when teams were coming without consulting the club
8288677 it is a private club people cant come into the club with cars parked in the courtyard the money for the facilities was collected by the members of the club
8288678 unfortunately it is the case that we have to upgrade our security weve had a huge amount of vandalism
8288679 at the weekend a car was burnt out at the back of the cathedral in the car park destroying the tarmac unfortunately we had no camera there so thats another area where a camera has to be installed
8288680 it has come to the point where a lot of churches have had to close but we dont want to consider that
8288681 go on barry hit it and win us the championship
8288682 last and not least i just want to say this was done for se n brennan who could not be here with us today
8288683 this is a long time coming to killeshin and it means so much to us as a team we have been down in the dumps for about 15 years and now we are back here where we belong
8288684 relief 100 relief things were going against us up until that point when the goal went in the heath had a run on us and they were very clever by putting a lot of men behind the ball when the goal went in it was a relief because it kind of opened them up
8288685 an under 14 b medal is all i have won so i have never been in a county a final before
8288686 he was probably our best player ever it was an honour to wear the jersey for him too we go up to his grave before every match so this is for him as much as the rest of us
8288687 he sent me a text message this morning to wish me luck so this is for him too
8288688 it went well i played for the full 80 minutes against padova midweek and was really happy with my performance on saturday we had another game and shane jennings played a half and i played most of the second half i felt that i did okay
8288689 i have got used to the intensity it was a step going up from the academy to the senior squad and i feel that i have adapted well
8288690 i would be a lot more nervous when you have the likes of those lads around i would be conscious that i didnt want to make mistakes i tried to concentrate on my own game and just play rugby
8288691 having said that after i had been training with them i just eventually blended in after the initial few outings it is no big deal they do encourage the newer players with words of encouragement and bits of advice
8288692 it was a trial for the world championship one athlete had already been pre selected mark ryan and sean hehir from rathfarnham in dublin and brian mcmahon from cork filled the first three spots and i took fourth
8288693 i held fourth place for the last four kilometres and felt comfortable throughout there were only 20 seconds between the top four positions
8288694 i am only back in training for the last 16 weeks or so i was out for over a year things happened at home and my father died
8288695 my father terence was a great support for me he used to go to all the races i didnt know until after he died how interested he was
8288696 he wasnt the kind of man who used to open up much
8288697 people said to me that you are the runner your father never stopped talking about you i was thinking about him during the race
8288698 i was on the national team two years ago where i competed in turkey and got a second cap in innsbruck later on
8288699 i have looked up to liam kealy in gowran i also ran with st laurence otooles and pl curran and james orourke were very good to me tommy payne and pat byrne were great runners and i did a lot of work with them my father and mother may were inspirational
8288700 my brother did a lot of the logistical work such as booking accommodation abroad
8288701 i never had to worry about transport and where to stay he did most of it and it was a great relief not to have to worry about any of that kind of stuff
8288702 when you get to the start remember me and what i cannot do
8288703 seamus ocarroll in the springhill hotel in kilkenny gave me use of the leisure centre in the hotel while i got some gear from him as well local businessman stephen murphy also gave me financial support
8288704 sean treacy the horse trainer has a 3 5km racing track and he allowed me to do a lot of my training there
8288705 we have one daughter mikala they both mean so much to me
8288706 there will be around 240 runners it is hell for leather and it is important to get a good position early on

8288708 if he had continued the slowest he would have run would have been 9 52
8288709 this is his first year of running the 100 metres

8288727 i represent an area where democrats havent done very well in the last presidential races
8288728 barack obama doesnt need to win all of those rural areas he just needs to do better than in the past he can and will and ill be working with him to see that it happens
8288729 i was on the set around one in the morning firing an automatic weapon when the gun wrangler said youve got to stop shooting

8288731 i kept thinking my son and my wife were at the hotel so i walked off the set woke them up and i took them to the airport
8288732 i left my family at the airport got back to bangkok on another plane flew back to the set not knowing if i was going back into gunfire or tanks shooting and finished the movie there were tanks on the street it was a terrifying experience

8288792 government troops had monitored in many occasions that milf forces had been utilized to act as blocking force to npas terror offensives particularly in the provinces of sultan kudarat north cotabato and south cotabato
8288793 the secretary general urged the parties to the conflict to rapidly return to the negotiating table and continue working together in the same positive spirit that led to the conclusion of the agreement
8288794 the parties need to preserve and build upon the accomplishments so far achieved in a bid to reach the just and durable peace desired by all
8288795 we urge president arroyo and the milf to resume the peace talks and put an end to the fighting in mindanao
8288796 the focus of our talks shall shift from the armed groups to the communities the parameters governing our negotiations shall be a balance between the constitutionality and public sentiment
8288797 in spite of all that is happening in mindanao we remain focused on our goals and that is to achieve lasting peace in mindanao

8288810 an update on the burgeoning private sector role in u s highway and transit infrastructure
8288811 we are struggling to have enough money to hold together what we have let alone be able to think about the level of investment that would be needed to provide new infrastructure
8288812 private investment is playing an increasingly larger role in public infrastructure innovative public private partnerships are appearing around the country bringing much needed capital to the table
8288813 i am convinced that private dollars administered through public private partnerships are a significant part of the answer to our transportation infrastructure challenge
8288814 since congress is not likely to come up with adequate resources to help us meet our future infrastructure needs we have no option but to move on our own and find new ways of funding our capital needs
8288815 does not and will not have the resources to meet our future national infrastructure needs
8288816 unleashing the investment locked in the private sector by partnering with business is the most efficient path to the transportation future this country needs and deserves
8288817 unless the project sponsor first compared the projects lifecycle costs under conventional public procurement with the projects lifecycle costs if procured under a p3 procurement
8288818 our challenges are so immense that we cant afford to think about investment and financing as an either or proposition a false choice between private capital or public funds we need new partnerships new ideas new sources of revenue
8288819 a coalition of change agents at state level will bring about a fundamental reorientation in the way we approach transportation funding
8288820 a federal centric approach does not offer an adequate long term solution to closing the huge infrastructure funding gap
8288821 whats killing us all is the soaring cost of maintaining existing infrastructure
8288822 ppps dont offer a lot of help on this score
8288823 will look to their portfolios of leasable assets as a source of considerable new revenue people will come to realize that the lease of the chicago skyway the indiana toll road and the chicago parking garages were not flukes
8288824 i think we ought to reconsider the perverse incentive that the tax code creates for such long leases if current depreciation rules lead to forms of investment that we judge to contravene public policy then the finance committee should consider changing those rules
8288825 yea always looking for a bargain do you like them
8288826 the operation took place at the hampshire clinic in basingstoke and was performed by james calder a consultant orthopaedic surgeon specialist in foot and ankle surgery

8288833 newcastle can confirm that it has received a written transfer request from james milner
8288834 the club is very disappointed that james sees his footballing future as away from st james park
8288835 we have yet to receive an offer for james that has matched our valuation of him
8288836 however should such an offer be received then the club will be reluctantly forced to consider it given james apparent desire to leave
8288837 a strong financial position backed by good progress on delivery will continue to ensure high quality services for patients

8288849 for any project to proceed to get the final permits developers have to deal with about 90 different agencies which are federal provincial and municipal

8288924 after being nearly stable for four weeks this rise has come as a major disappointment
8288925 the annual rate of inflation calculated on point to point basis stood at 12 44 percent for the week ending august 2
8288926 in the commodity group of fuel and power the rate of inflation has risen to 17 99 from 17 12 percent
8288927 the trends of moderation in inflation should begin in december
8288928 inflation is expected to moderate below the double digit mark by the end of the current fiscal
8288929 the payout is not a new development it has been factored into when the budget was prepared and the prime ministers eac and the rbi reserve bank of india gave their estimates
8288930 directly invest up to 15 percent of their investible funds in shares of companies on which derivatives are available on the bombay stock exchange and the national stock exchange
8288931 this is a very healthy sign because in inflationary times when the rate of interest is below the rate of inflation then provident funds which are guaranteed return funds become guaranteed risk funds
8288932 so if these funds can invest in equities which can provide a high rate of return then the overall returns on the funds can be maintained at a rate higher than the inflation rate
8288933 the 15 percent ceiling also seems just right because even if the equities investment goes wrong the total capital is still protected
8288934 if the fund loses say at the most by 50 percent then 7 5 percent of the total funds will be lost but it will earn at least 9 percent on the 85 percent that it will be forced to invest on debt instruments
8288935 since 9 percent of 85 percent is 7 65 percent of the amount invested it will cover the possible loss of 7 5 percent
8288936 greater flexibility in terms of a wider variety of financial instruments as well as greater freedom to actively manage the portfolio
8288937 some of the stocks like hdfc bank and larsen and toubro are logical buys because they have been beaten down badly in the market

8288947 was wenige wissen der radsportweltverband uci war bei der einf hrung neuer methoden schon immer vorreiter und meist ging die initiative sogar von den athleten aus das war 1997 so als die uci als erster verband die 50 prozent h matokritgrenze im blut einf hrte die uci hat auch zum ersten mal die sehr empfindliche methode f r testosteron doping eingef hrt die isotopen massen spektronomie es bleibt dennoch ein ewiger kampf einige athleten versuchen immer wieder etwas neues zu finden
8288948 was wir brauchen dass ist nicht unbedingt ein engeres aber ein unberechenbareres kontrollnetz au erdem sollten wir mit ganz einfachen schritten vorangehen ich f nde es sehr gut wenn beispielsweise bei olympischen spielen die start voraussetzung w re dass der athlet sich in den drei monaten zuvor mindestens drei unangek ndigte trainingskontrollen unterzogen hat damit h tte man schon mal enorm viel bewegt das ist meilenweit entfernt von dem was wir jetzt haben wir fordern das schon lange dass es nicht m glich ist das ist mir ein r tsel es sollte wirklich in der macht des ioc liegen

8288960 the obama campaign knows it cant argue the facts of the link between obama and ayers so it is instead resorting to a desperate campaign of intimidation and legal threats the scary queston this raises is if barack obama demonstrates this little regard for free speech from his opponents during the campaign what could the american people expect from him as a president the tremendous amount of time money and effort the campaign is expending to run its own ads on the ayers controversy and dispatch its hired guns all over the country during the democratic convention speaks to the fear they must have that this issue is resonating with american voters

8288980 a lot of people are concerned about sea level rise in coastal areas which is obviously a very serious and legitimate concern but i think that the kinds of problems were projecting here in new mexico in some ways are worse and they are going to hit us faster
8288981 that were going to get hit harder and faster than the coastal areas that get so much attention

8288985 historians are going to look back on this and call it the big bonfire
8288986 the price point of energy is going upwards and staying upwards so we have to put all resources into play
8288987 at dow the solution we provide is people i know the innovation capability of this nation
8288988 i believe very strongly that building sustainable local economies is about our survival in the age of climate change and peak oil which will increasingly disrupt and weaken long distance supply lines ive seen a huge increase in interest building local economies people instinctively know that gaining local self reliance by producing basic needs at home especially food and energy is important to our long term health and security
8288989 contrary to the theory oil production shows no signs of a peak oil is a finite resource but because it is so incredibly large a peak will not occur this year next year or for decades to come
8288990 that much of our increase in driving stems from trips to the mall
8288991 the build up of nato forces in the black sea area
8288992 meanwhile ignoring russias warnings western countries rushed to recognise kosovos illegal declaration of independence from serbia we argued consistently that it would be impossible after that to tell the abkhazians and ossetians and dozens of other groups around the world that what was good for the kosovo albanians was not good for them

8288998 our welcome in china has always been extremely warm and it is very gratifying that we have been invited to race at our fourth different track in this amazing country by the chinese government the chinese fans are some of the most passionate as can be seen by their support for the series and a1 team china also as we have seen with the recent olympics china knows how to put on great events

8289000 a cheap public relations stunt that may lead to more attacks on gays and lesbians
8289001 the young men who come in from outer suburbs to drink alcohol and assault gay people are not going to be deterred by a sticker in a window
8289002 because they already have homophobic and violent tendencies its more likely to be a provocation
8289003 lots of people in the gay and lesbian community fear it will provoke more violence weve had enough of these pr stunts
8289004 at this point the ball is with council staff to develop a proposal that will come back to council over the next few months but it could involve stickers badges posters and t shirts similar to the safe place pink triangle campaign
8289005 we have to create awareness that homophobia is not acceptable
8289006 most dealers know what they have so be sure to not insult them by pointing out each and every little scratch im sure you wouldnt do that but im always amazed by the littany of complaints potential buyers sometimes make regarding a piece they want to buy
8289007 domestic abuse has the highest rate of repeat victimisation of any crime even though only a proportion of all incidents are reported to the police
8289008 every call represents an opportunity to identify a pattern of abuse and an opportunity to intervene to prevent further or escalating acts of violence in the future
8289009 thats why effective record keeping and ease of access to information are key to an effective response to domestic abuse we believe that a national database of victims and offenders would help the police to better respond to potential domestic abuse cases
8289010 we found many examples of good practice across scotland and this report is designed to help make sure that all forces can learn from that
8289011 in particular the role of the domestic abuse officer varied between forces and wed like to see all forces review their own posts against this good practice to make sure we have consistency across scotland
8289012 i hope these recommendations can help our police forces to respond more effectively and consistently to potential incidents of domestic abuse and ultimately help make sure that fewer scots end up suffering this crime
8289013 cutting waiting times is a clear priority for this scottish government to ensure patients get the treatment they need as quickly as possible
8289014 its also important that they have a clear understanding of when they can expect to receive their treatment and our new ways of publishing waiting time statistics does just that
8289015 todays statistics released by isd scotland show an overall impressive performance from the nhs in scotland effectively meeting all our challenging national maximum waiting times targets
8289016 this is very good news for patients but it is not the end of the story
8289017 we cannot afford to be complacent and thats why we are supporting boards to further cut waiting times for patients we are currently working towards a whole journey maximum waiting time of 18 weeks from gp referral to treatment to be delivered by the end of 2011
8289018 climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing us today both here in scotland and across the world we want scotland and its local communities to be part of the global solution
8289019 there are many things we can do as individuals to reduce our carbon emissions but by acting and working together as communities we can do much more
8289020 thats why supporting communities such as barra and vatersay through the climate challenge fund is so important it will empower people to take action to reduce their carbon footprint and make a real difference to the local and national environment
8289021 the scottish government with the scottish greens has launched the 18 8 million fund to deliver innovative solutions at a local level such as improving energy efficiency promoting renewable energy and producing local sustainable food
8289022 as well as significantly reducing emissions these measures will also bring wider social and economic benefits to improve the quality of life in communities this is part of an exciting new era for community empowerment and id encourage others who want to make a difference locally and globally to come forward with their ideas
8289023 the western isles have a crucial role to play as scotland starts to tackle climate change
8289024 however barra vatersay and the other isles are also uniquely blessed with the potential for renewable energy
8289025 greens believe local economies are stronger economies and this project is no exception
8289026 people on barra and vatersay have a vision for how they can make radical improvements to their quality of life reduce their costs and live more sustainably this project shows theyre at the cutting edge on climate change and their work will inspire others across the country

8289034 we need to raise the question about the lease payment and new financial conditions because those old conditions were set when there was no market for land deals and assets which the russian fleet uses were not considered as assets which must be paid for
8289035 we regret the decision it is unacceptable for ukraine therefore we cannot back this position
8289036 such aggravation may lead to complications in different parts of the world the point is that mutual trust can be questioned and lost because of poorly thought out steps when diplomacy and peaceful regulation are replaced with policy of force
8289037 the uk government welcomes the publication of the unodcs 2008 afghanistan opium survey and the news that opium production has decreased the afghan government and the unodc estimate that 157 000 hectares were cultivated in 2008 a 19 reduction on last years figure
8289038 this shows that the afghan governments drug control strategy is starting to pay dividends
8289039 we urge the international community to provide support to afghanistan

8289051 with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8289052 im a united states senator because in 1848 a group of courageous women and a few brave men gathered in seneca falls new york many traveling for days and nights to participate in the first convention on womens rights in our history and so dawned a struggle for the right to vote that would last 72 years handed down by mother to daughter to granddaughter and a few sons and grandsons along the way these women and men looked into their daughters eyes imagined a fairer and freer world and found the strength to fight to rally and picket to endure ridicule and harassment to brave violence and jail and after so many decades 88 years ago on this very day the 19th amendment guaranteeing women the right to vote would be forever enshrined in our constitution my mother was born before women could vote but in this election my daughter got to vote for her mother for president this is the story of america of women and men who defy the odds and never give up how do we give this country back to them by following the example of a brave new yorker a woman who risked her life to shepherd slaves along the underground railroad and on that path to freedom harriett tubman had one piece of advice if you hear the dogs keep going if you see the torches in the woods keep going if theyre shouting after you keep going dont ever stop keep going if you want a taste of freedom keep going

8289071 it is sometimes claimed that dissent from the magisterium is totally compatible with being a good catholic and poses no obstacles to the reception of the sacraments
8289072 this is a grave error that challenges the teaching office of the bishops of the united states and elsewhere
8289073 the speaker agrees with the church that we should reduce the number of abortions
8289074 to the extent that catholicism is a thinking mans faith we are constantly called to review our beliefs and seek a fuller understanding of truth

8289086 in 2011 i think canadians should not expect everything in kandahar will be fixed
8289087 i think it will look pretty much as it does now but the key difference will be that afghan institutions afghan army and police and government will actually be in charge and in the lead in building from what we helped them build together over the last few years
8289088 we have to continue to do what weve been doing which is build up the afghan national security forces provide basic humanitarian assistance and to work on border security

8289094 i know kara and she speaks her mind so she will be speaking her mind
8289095 i wore pyjamas the girls wore negligees and we kind of broke the ice
8289096 there are inspectors all over the country as well as public health officials visiting establishments restaurants and institutions to ensure this product is removed from the marketplace
8289097 that would be an investigation by the public health agency of canada and the local health units
8289098 they do the food history so they would make the linkages
8289099 i think all of us and obviously i include my own family in this we expect that when we shop that the things we buy or that we eat are going to be safe
8289100 this is a serious concern thats why i indicated that its necessary to reform and revamp our food and product inspection regimes
8289101 i think all members of the government has been on top of this
8289102 i think we all feel tremendously for those who have been affected by this terrible development and i want to express my condolences to those families that have been affected
8289103 all sorts of people have eaten the meats and have the reasonable expectation that they may be endangered
8289104 so for the next 90 days theyre not even going to know if they have a problem
8289105 we believe that in this kind of an instance there may be millions of people who are entitled to compensation

8289117 there have been tangible improvements in the standard of council services over the past 10 years yet consumer expectations also continue to rise the new challenge for councils is to deliver better community engagement and a real increase in levels of customer satisfaction
8289118 councils need to put people at the heart of service delivery and take complaints seriously where things go wrong people should be able to expect swift and fair redress getting this approach right should also help ensure that there is less need for redress going forward
8289119 councils have become highly attuned to the needs and wants of their inspectors but perhaps less so to the demands of their customers now we have an opportunity to put the customer back at the heart of our business
8289120 even the best businesses sometimes give their customers problems it is the quality of solutions which truly define customer care this is not just about financial redress the value of a sincere apology and swift remedy is often overlooked
8289121 we put our customers at the very heart of everything we do and build our business around them
8289122 we are feeling the impacts of global economic factors beyond the control of any one individual or government
8289123 while over the course of the year we are projecting positive economic growth the outlook for real gdp growth in canada based on private sector forecasts has been revised down to 1 1 per cent in 2008 from 1 7 per cent in the budget projection

8289132 los invitamos a la reuni n que se realizara el d a 4 de septiembre del corriente a o en la calle honduras 5770 a las 18 hs en la asociaci n de dermatolog a pedi trica el motivo de la misma es presentarnos y desarrollar los objetivos que nos hemos trazado para ello necesitamos contar con la presencia de todos los padres y profesionales que quieran compartir con nosotros el inicio de nuestro proyecto
8289133 im hesitant to compare him to an emo band but i feel like brian has that sort of connection to the audience
8289134 had so many ideas and not enough time to put them to paper
8289135 id like a home draw so our fans can see us play
8289136 coventry beat united last year then played west ham we had a good cup run and generated a hell of a lot of money at the same time
8289137 the fans that paid to come here tonight will have been very pleased with how emmanuel played
8289138 he is a very gifted kid he pops up in areas that can hurt people he has a decent left peg and he likes shooting when he has a chance
8289139 but he is still learning his trade and my only concern is that it might turn out to be a long arduous season for him
8289140 gary was hauled to the floor but you either get them or you dont
8289141 the referee said no and we had to get on with it
8289142 we knew they were a good team but we thought if we could pinch a goal we could cause them problems and up until half time we gave a good account of ourselves
8289143 but that changed totally in the second half and they have given us a tanking
8289144 if we can get him over in good time then i have no doubt that he would be involved on sunday at some stage
8289145 i think he will be fit he only just missed out on being involved at aberdeen so after a few days on the training ground we would be hopeful of having him for this weekend
8289146 when i first met him he came across as one of these boys who would not be fazed by a great deal
8289147 he should take things softly he has done well in the olympics and should be commended for his efforts but he should not think that he is the best coach in nigeria he is not
8289148 there are two things that make a coach one the coach must have very good players at his disposal and two he coach must be technically sound siasia is a good coach with a sound technical know how
8289149 era una oferta interesante pero mi prioridad era seguir en el getafe por respeto a muchas cosas como la afici n y el club que me ha dado la oportunidad de estar en primera divisi n la oferta econ mica del equipo que me quer a era muy interesante triplicaba mis emolumentos pero lo dej en manos del club y en este caso lo han rechazado y voy a seguir trabajando como siempre
8289150 yo tengo dos a os de contrato aqu y voy a cumplirlos
8289151 pienso que era un oferta en la que pod an salir los dos ganando pero yo no soy un jugador que se haya cerrado en banda que haya dicho que se quer a ir porque no es as ten a que aceptar o rechazarla y en este caso se rechaz yo sigo aqu con toda la ilusi n del mundo
8289152 dir a que ojal nos meti ramos en la uefa y en la final de la copa del rey porque equipo puedo decir que hay pero en esto del f tbol hay que ser cauto y prudente e ir paso a paso el principal objetivo no digo que sea el final es la permanencia
8289153 saldr a por todas por la ilusi n que van a tener y porque es en su campo
8289154 the main focus of the program is for the kids to get about 50 minutes of activity with 100 of participation for 100 of the time
8289155 when we first introduced phd the kids wanted nothing to do with it they didnt want to move some of the kids would go two blocks and they were winded
8289156 the kids have a lot of fun just when we transition into doing the calisthenics from the games we switch it up so they do stay engaged
8289157 the popularity of the guinness premiership is on the increase and we are delighted that we have been able to work with itv to ensure fans can get a timely weekly highlights fix of all of the weekends action
8289158 mi hanno trattato come uno str o era disponibile un solo container per tutta la mia band e non avevamo n acqua n un bagno n cibo il colpo finale mi arrivato quando lorganizzazione mi ha negato dei voucher per prendere qualcosa da mangiare o da bere a quel punto ho chiamato il promoter e gli ho detto che gli concedevo massimo due ore per risolvere tutto o me ne sarei andato dopo due ore non successo nulla mi sembrato giusto entrare nel suo ufficio e pis are sul suo divano
8289159 je ne fais pas lamour ici jai les couilles trop relax
8289160 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8289161 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8289162 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8289163 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8289164 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8289165 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8289166 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8289167 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8289168 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8289169 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8289170 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8289171 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8289172 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8289173 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8289174 no one works for someone we all just work together
8289175 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8289176 the open source development model is unique end users not only give feedback on the software theyre a fundamental and critical part of the community submitting patches and developing new features themselves
8289177 before this event however there was no neutral forum that would advance and optimize this collaboration the end user summit will fill this gap and accelerate problem solving for linux
8289178 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8289179 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8289180 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8289181 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8289182 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8289183 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8289184 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8289185 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8289186 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8289187 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8289188 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8289189 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8289190 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8289191 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8289192 student driven development of an online graduate school honor code
8289193 watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places
8289194 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8289195 la medida se presta a la manipulaci n y a la presencia de elementos ajenos a las comunidades el gobierno quiere privatizar las tierras y puede convalidar la presencia de intrusos en las decisiones que se adopten
8289196 que hasta el momento a pesar de nuestra solicitud no se da
8289197 el ejecutivo ha hecho un uso extensivo y abusivo de la delegaci n de facultades el art 2 2 de la ley 29157 indica que tiene que haber una relaci n estricta entre las materias delegadas y su vinculaci n con la implementaci n del tlc
8289198 ello hace que tales decretos puedan ser calificados de inconstitucionales por razones de forma al haber incumplido los par metros fijados en la ley 29157 lo que ameritar a su derogaci n en el congreso o que se declare su inconstitucionalidad en el tribunal constitucional
8289199 some critics have pointed to the conflict in georgia as another example of botched bush administration foreign policy but in fact americas real strategy was brilliantly executed and it achieved exactly the intended outcome unfortunately its not an outcome that makes the world a safer place first its important to note that this dispute is not about georgia or south ossetia both victims of collateral damage in geopolitical manoeuvring it is not about georgian president mikheil saakashvili miscalculating the russian response to his attack or overestimating the amount of support he would get from the west mr saakashvili is really just a colourful bit player nor is this entirely a case of an emboldened russia striking back at the west for its support of kosovo independence or the orange revolution or the eastern european missile defence shield though all of these things are factors
8289200 this is truly shocking its exactly the definition of a police state the police will have the details of a whole generation for so called crime prevention
8289201 it raises a lot of issues and we havent had a debate in parliament about it
8289202 an investigation of a crime toward or by the child
8289203 this is yet another revelation about the database state that is shocking but not surprising
8289204 the police have always been able to look into whatever they want but the information age changes the scale of that completely
8289205 parents should know that this is not for the protection of their children it could be used to prosecute them this is a serious step on from what little has been told to the public
8289206 the purpose of contactpoint is not crime detection it is to help improve services to children including safeguarding vulnerable children
8289207 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8289208 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8289209 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8289210 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8289211 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8289212 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8289213 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8289214 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8289215 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8289216 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8289217 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8289218 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8289219 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8289220 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8289221 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8289222 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8289223 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8289224 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8289225 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8289226 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8289227 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8289228 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8289229 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8289230 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8289231 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8289232 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8289233 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8289234 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8289235 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8289236 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8289237 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8289238 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8289239 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8289240 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8289241 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8289242 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8289243 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8289244 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8289245 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8289246 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8289247 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8289248 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8289249 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8289250 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8289251 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8289252 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8289253 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8289254 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8289255 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8289256 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8289257 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8289258 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8289259 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8289260 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8289261 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8289262 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8289263 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8289264 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8289265 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8289266 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8289267 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8289268 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8289269 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8289270 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8289271 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8289272 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8289273 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

8289301 in the first half of 2008 the company minimized the negative impact caused by the heavy rains and snowstorm at the beginning of the year upon the operation of railway transportation through implementing measures to increase traffic and revenues consolidating and optimizing transportation resources and improving transportation efficiency the company achieved safety and stability in its operation of transportation as well as a stable growth in transportation revenues profit attributable to equity holders decreased year on year due to an increase in both finance costs and income tax expenses over the corresponding period last year

8289340 its not like i can sell it everyone loves this bike it keeps bringing in the customers it must have paid for itself five times over by now its like an old hoodrat they need love too i have to hold on to my oldie but goodie

8289396 there was an advertisement at that time that said keep your daughters and wives dresses clean by using anthracite
8289397 it was found in eastern pennsylvania just above us so the reading railroad builds lines to those counties and thats why port richmond develops the way it does with all those lines to the water running down along lehigh avenue
8289398 it was such a desirable coal it was distributed to the world
8289399 we were one of the last of the original colonies founded and theres a reason for that
8289400 we were the only colony with no atlantic frontage all the great ports were taken by the time william penn gets pennsylvania
8289401 but have you ever heard of philadelphia harbor there isnt one
8289402 this doesnt negate the fact that we had the largest freshwater port in the world for quite a long time
8289403 the governor and the delaware river port authority want to dredge our channel to 45 feet our channel is 103 miles long
8289404 so our geography does not exactly work for us were not a great natural harbor the harbors that really do well on the east coast are the ones right at the piedmont where you have the atlantic coastal plain meeting the piedmont right at the harbor
8289405 containerization forced ships to be not only enormous but to actually be stacked really tall
8289406 you can take the containers off at elizabeth and newark make trucks out of them and send them everywhere apparently we cant get a containerized ship below the walter whitman bridge the tioga marine terminal does have containerization but it has to be a specific kind of ship
8289407 when ships didnt need a very deep draft we did fine now our channel is just too shallow
8289408 that area will remain very important from a freight handling standpoint and as a working waterfront
8289409 theres nothing incompatible with increased port activity including intermodal rail truck ship connections in the civic vision
8289410 but there will be no change to function it will improve function in fact
8289411 sort of neutral territory for all the railroads so the shipper could choose which one it wanted to use the belt line allowed for interchanging among the different railroads
8289412 to break up the monopoly of the pennsylvania railroad which controlled the philadelphia waterfront
8289413 to make sure the waterfront was open to competitive rail service
8289414 part of the game plan anticipates new or expanded terminals
8289415 it will actually neaten up a lot of operations over time
8289416 the vision plan established the idea of potentially having a waterfront light rail line
8289417 light rail generally means fast higher capacity modern service and more efficiency
8289418 it holds more people it doesnt interfere with traffic and it moves with its own power
8289419 there is not much in the way of industry anymore
8289420 we do not operate at all were in a sort of holding pattern our main purpose in life is to make sure there is competitive business on the waterfront
8289421 thats almost twice what a car lane would have carried
8289422 so youre not losing capacity youre just shifting people from automobiles to transit
8289423 tourists will have to park just once they can access all the destinations on the waterfront by riding light rail if they come by mass transit theyd need zero parking spaces
8289424 residents wouldnt need as many cars because car share and light rail would be available to them so it will help with congestion and it will cut the high cost of building parking lots
8289425 an alternative analysis study is now under way which is the first step in the process for applying for federal funding
8289426 were looking at potential ridership cost factors and environmental impacts
8289427 these are street level or underground lines all complementary to systems already in place weve had good experience with the river line in new jersey this is what light rail is built for
8289428 the cost of these alternatives is in the high hundreds of millions of dollars up to a billion dollars we would look for the rest to come from drpa the state of pennsylvania their trust funds potential private alternatives and public private partnerships
8289429 funding challenges it comes down to federal policy other cities have funded such projects themselves or they figured out ways to fund it with minimal federal money those tend to be cities in major growth markets philadelphia and other east coast cities tend not to be
8289430 its hard to find places that have not created light rail systems
8289431 what most cities are striving for is access to the river
8289432 it could extend upward from oregon avenue as a major east west railroad that ends up at the sports complex
8289433 probably in conflict with the value of that real property unless the community makes some acquisitions
8289434 we dont have any specific project in development at this juncture
8289435 we havent met or sat down with pennpraxis about their vision at this point
8289436 if we have vacant property and there is an opportunity to develop rail service that is certainly our preference
8289437 meanwhile if an opportunity arrives for developing rail business we will certainly look at it we are always open minded for new rail business
8289438 the idea is that the boulevard and light rail initiatives would bring you all the way to this area so you would set the framework for development in the southern portion of the conrail site
8289439 allows two powerful properties to work together to create a more seamless television viewing experience for their respective audiences

8289453 our goodwill to keep turkeys eu path open is not without limit
8289454 if we see that turkey is not being positive or constructive in its stance at a time when a new phase in finding a cyprus solution has begun then we should reconsider our general policy towards turkeys eu accession
8289455 above all lets not forget that turkeys european prospects depend on cypruss consent because from time to time this is forgotten especially by our european partners
8289456 from 2004 cyprus has continually accepted turkeys accession course but weve seen absolutely no goodwill gesture from the turkish side either towards the cyprus republic or its eu obligations towards cyprus

8289463 it is difficult to see how the executive can demonstrate that it has a substantial likelihood of success on appeal or even that a serious legal question is presented
8289464 simply calling an issue important primarily because it involves the relationship of the political branches does not transform the executives weak arguments into a likelihood of success or a substantial appellate issue

8289467 in england people dont have time to feel the joy of life throughout the week they work so hard they only talk to people at lunch
8289468 then in the evening they watch tv so they can get up early for work the next day
8289469 in manchester the main attraction is a timetable at the railway station where trains leave for less rainy cities
8289470 id like to clarify that i did not make these particular remarks i spoke about the difficulty i had settling in to life in manchester but that does not reflect how i feel now
8289471 i enjoy my life very much as a footballer at manchester united and im very happy to be a part of this great club i think i show that in the way i play every week
8289472 ingozzatevi pure di ananas e filetto potrebbe essere il vostro ultimo banchetto
8289473 at the halfway mark of the season we probably thought that we were going to play finals the way we were going
8289474 we had a bit of an easier run you could probably say after our first half and thats when we struggled a bit to finish those games off
8289475 id have to say wed be pretty disappointed with the way we finished off the year
8289476 we still knew we had a job to do and we had to win the games to do that but we certainly did drop off towards the end of the season
8289477 if we get away with a win this week well miss out on the finals but well go into next year with a bit of confidence
8289478 next time we play sydney well have a bit of confidence as well knowing we can knock them off
8289479 i guess you have a look now at the guys who we consider greats of the game and their performances and then you look at what hes done
8289480 i think the highest test average is about 66 and then you look at his at 99
8289481 were on covered wickets were on pitches that are prepared and all the technology
8289482 they were on uncovered wickets and i guess the technology and the manpower we now have to prepare for a game and get it right they didnt have
8289483 obviously injuries and a few personal circumstances have come in
8289484 theyve done if before so weve got to play well
8289485 were off a break and were under a bit of pressure so i guess its us to put our hands up and perform well and if they play good cricket we have to match it
8289486 well sit down at the end of the season at the appropriate time and talk about our list
8289487 i havent thought about it to be honest were just worrying about now
8289488 i dont know much about it im not involved in it
8289489 the atp board can confirm that it has regrettably accepted a petition from the bangalore open to suspend the 2008 event due to the local promoters security concerns
8289490 the total event prize money of us400 000 a470 000 will now be paid into the atp player pension fund
8289491 our view on whether we send sides is based purely on security advice as the safety and security of our players and staff is paramount
8289492 but the advice at the moment is that the situation in india is significantly different to pakistan its chalk and cheese
8289493 the critical issue with the game of twenty20 cricket is how do we make it work
8289494 we definitely need a carve out period the reason i say that is not because i want to go off and play its not about that
8289495 i want to play for australia as much as i can i want to play as many tests for australia as i can
8289496 i want the next generation of australian players to have that dream to put on the baggy green cap and play 100 test matches and 300 one day games
8289497 im worried if theres not that period of time be it in the ipl or the epl or whatever competition it might be that this next generations opinions might change
8289498 they might see the dollars and think maybe its more appealing to me that i go and play ipl instead of playing for my country
8289499 that would be the saddest thing ever to happen to this great game
8289500 i actually think its inevitable twenty20 cricket will be an olympic sport
8289501 you think about the audiences in the sub continent 22 or 23 per cent of the worlds population is based in that area
8289502 the ioc could do a lot worse than put cricket into the olympics
8289503 right at the moment australia really hasnt got a total grasp of the game of twenty20 but were learning and improving all the time
8289504 in my opinion sir donald bradman is golfers tiger woods and jack nicholas combined and more
8289505 i have seen four or five dvds of uzbekistan at the moment so for me it is not a big surprise anymore
8289506 for the players probably yes but we will have enough time to prepare for the game
8289507 i have always said that quality wise we are one of the best teams in asia it is about circumstances it is about the trips we have to make and this time we will be well prepared
8289508 we have to find out how the circumstances are when we arrive in tashkent
8289509 the china and middle east games we had to play under difficult circumstances so i am not so worried about that
8289510 it can never be worse than it was in dubai and qatar last june so the players will go there and adapt quite soon they will be ready
8289511 its not done yet and when it is announced it will be announced by the club
8289512 it could be a day or it could be a week
8289513 once i help todd decide where he wants to be well get a deal done relatively quickly but were not at the stage
8289514 my bid was 12 weeks behind the gold coast so we have been running to fill the criteria and a business plan
8289515 given the fact they approve us tonight we would still need two to three weeks to put the legal agreement together and do a bit of branding
8289516 the inclusion of gold coast will mean local derbies and much like sydney against mariners and mariners against newcastle i would expect big crowds for our local derbies which will spark further interest in south east queensland so i think it is a great thing
8289517 hes more unlikely than likely at this stage but theres still a chance that he will play
8289518 hes running pretty strong but ill wait until the end of the week
8289519 weve worked very hard to put ourselves in a position where were playing better football and were not going to flirt with that
8289520 the benchmark team in the competition is geelong theyve clearly got a strong mandate to playing their best football and playing honest football and not falling into any habits they wish to
8289521 so i think if its good enough for geelong its clearly good enough for this group who are still trying to build to their best football
8289522 first 30 minutes the emotion of robert harvey who had his tribute match last weekend didnt mean much
8289523 we were behind by about 24 points at one stage and it could have easily been 30
8289524 theres intentions to meet with greg and his management company yes

8289698 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there
8289699 a number like 32 minutes average viewing time suggests that these past two weeks may ultimately be looked back on as the moment when the lines between the tv and web viewing experience began to disappear

8289703 we have increased performance and also consolidated and we have only been in operation for a year
8289704 we did look at the high performance servers from hewlett packard co they are very good but they do not get to the performance we get on the verari and they are not as energy friendly
8289705 using verari blades we should be able to stay in our space for the next five years without having to build out the data center
8289706 the blade design is really energy efficient because of the way they cool so you are maximizing the air conditioning of your data center
8289707 raised floor is expensive and not required anymore it is more efficient to cool rackmounted servers with water chilled air
8289708 water chilled air is heavy air and floats from the ceiling down this takes less energy than pushing air up through the racks the result less cooling required less power helps energy companies in california and it also saves us money

8289716 oh i definitely think the eds acquisition will be better i think mark hurd is extremely operationally focused i think his predecessor carly fiorina was more at the strategy level hurd has a very strong focus on looking at operations looking at the minute details
8289717 you may not have the same level of culture shock
8289718 eds has a much deeper and broader set of services offerings and experience than hp does
8289719 eds has not been as profitable for the last couple of years as they had been in the past and mark hurd has already said that one of his efforts you know the first thing that he plans to do is to make the company more efficient or financially efficient and that usually translates into layoff notices for eds employees
8289720 if you go in slicing willy nilly you may only end up dispiriting employees of the company
8289721 eds is going to have to shift very quickly towards an automated service model that ibm and others are pursuing
8289722 hasnt been a gigantic growth engine for a past while
8289723 so when you spend untold billions on an acquisition people want to see that youre either mopping up a market buying all the market share or buying a lot of growth as it stands eds doesnt really do either
8289724 one of the things im sure hurd and company will be working on is changing edss business revenue mix the big outsourcing deals tend to generate good cash flow if not the most spectacular profit numbers but the real potential is in building up hp services to replicate ibms services position success higher up the value add margin ladder and which would also create a high end big dollar distribution channel for hp platforms and software
8289725 no one around here will do it after 12 weeks
8289726 with what others here and there have reported more and more women seem to be self inducing abortion or at least attempting to
8289727 while many may believe that the landmark 1973 roe v wade supreme court decision that overturned laws restricting abortion put an end to improvised abortions the medical community worries there still may be a problem
8289728 now advocacy groups ibis reproductive health are launching a study in san francisco new york and boston to find out how many women go outside the normal clinic abortions and why
8289729 ive seen a real increase in the blogs and the chatter in the herb chat rooms about this lately
8289730 the most common way is that women take herbs that are poisonous and take enough to poison the baby but not themselves
8289731 this is not easy to do unless the woman is sick enough to be throwing up and in serious pain its not going to work
8289732 even with ongoing global economic pressures we continue to be upbeat but very cautious about the outcome of this deal as weve said from the time this deal was announced in may hp faces a laundry list of integration issues with eds financial organizational operational and cultural and interestingly cultural issues may present some of the highest hurdles hp has already said it intends to merge the two companies outsourcing groups which will clearly make hp an even more dominant force in infrastructure and increasingly application related services while an economic slowdown may force customers to delay some it investments it can also open up new outsourcing avenues as customers turn to third parties to operate various aspects of their it more efficiently lucky for hp then that it will soon have one of the worlds largest outsourcing operations under its roof in a few weeks

8289784 the question was asked is it more difficult to go 10 3 or to sustain that level
8289785 for me its much more difficult to sustain it because you have to be able to build your program to a level of consistency that gets your players to react on a day to day basis on a level of un conscious competence that is habit forming going into year two we want to get to a habit forming where our kids perform and compete on a day to day basis in a consistent fashion its what were excited about in year two
8289786 i want our players to have a habit of how they prepare each and every week we dont have to tell them how to practice and how to prepare for a game when you get to that level of consistency within your program you know what to expect on game day you dont worry about it you dont worry are we ready or are we not ready it comes down to just playing the game
8289787 we definitely need some game time before you can get to that point
8289788 thats a peak you try as much as you can to get to that point where youre out there and not thinking about it while youre playing thats all in the preparation we know the checks we know that we do this we know where to be at the right time thats what were preparing to do the test is to see if were at that level yet if we can continue to work as hard as hes pushing us we can get to that level
8289789 once you get in the playbook and get to know things it just comes faster now that we know coach kellys philosophy on what he wants done everybody knows how to work fast and get it to where he wants to be un conscious competence its just understanding what he wants

8289819 and ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the berlin wall
8289820 now that has to be the kind of approach that we take you know iran they spend one one hundredth of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serio us threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance and we should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen that doesnt mean we agree with them on everything we might not compromise on any issues but at least we should find out other areas of potential common interest and we can reduce some of the tensions that has caused us so many problems around the world

8289897 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8289898 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8289899 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato

8289935 of the nearly 1 6 million letters that have gone out since november 1 to borrowers 60 days past due more than 80 of borrowers still had not called their lenders a month after receiving the letters
8289936 borrowers have to talk to their lenders thats the most important message we communicate
8289937 we are committed to helping as many borrowers as possible and were not going to let anything including a tropical storm get in the way
8289938 and theyre smart to go to ground zero for foreclosures to hold these events but theres only so much they can do they cannot change peoples circumstances in enough cases to stave off the correction that has to occur
8289939 the participating lenders have come to grips with the idea that the market is not going to get better soon so they are cooperating more with borrowers hope now numbers reflect that

8289950 este comportamiento refuerza las sospechas generalizadas del p blico en general que las decisiones verdaderamente las toman los lobbys correspondientes y no despu s de un proceso racional de toma de decisiones
8289951 sie war gut und es war sch n etwas zeit mit der familie verbringen zu k nnen der f1 kalender ist vielleicht nicht so vollgepackt wie der nascar kalender h lt uns aber ziemlich auf trab weil die saison kompakter ist und man sich zwischen den rennen auf die testprogramme konzentrieren muss wegen des testverbots im august haben wir die gelegenheit genutzt durch die usa zu reisen ich habe mir zwar keine rennen angesehen wir haben aber einen tag mit juan pablo montoya und seiner familie in miami verbracht es war sch n sich einmal abseits von der rennstrecke zu treffen anstatt im fahrerlager zu stecken hatten wir mit unseren frauen eine tolle zeit am strand
8289952 ich glaube die leute haben gute arbeit geleistet und valencia ist ein hervorragender neuer austragungsort f r die formel 1 es ist immer sch n ein rennen mitten in einer stadt zu fahren die atmosph re war nett und das diesj hrige rennen war sehr speziell weil es eben das erste war
8289953 sie ist nicht was man als einen typischen stra enkurs mit langsamen durchschnittsgeschwindigkeiten bezeichnen w rde der sieger ist im durchschnitt 193 km h gefahren und es war auch mehr auslauf vorhanden als man sonst von stra enrennen gewohnt ist ich hatte erwartet dass es einige unf lle geben w rde erstaunlicherweise sind wir aber ohne einen einzigen safety car auftritt durchgekommen
8289954 erstaunlicherweise sind wir ohne einen einzigen safety car auftritt durchgekommen
8289955 warst du mit deinem f nften platz im rennen zufrieden
8289956 ja ich glaube das war eine starke leistung des ganzen teams das wochenende begann nicht gut f r mich weil ich am freitag mit der balance des wagens nicht zufrieden war man muss auf einem stra enkurs immer besonders vorsichtig sein vor allem wenn er neu ist weil immer eine menge staub auf der fahrbahn liegt und am ersten tag der grip nicht da ist ich lerne neue strecken ziemlich schnell das war also kein problem aber man bekommt die strecke besser mit wenn erst einmal gummi auf ihr liegt das merkt man gerade in monaco und ich hatte hier dasselbe erwartet f r den samstagmorgen hatte ich allerhand nderungen vorgenommen bekam aber nicht mehr die gelegenheit das auto im letzten training noch zu beurteilen
8289957 wir hatten schwierigkeiten mit der lpumpe des getriebes sie wurde zweimal ausgewechselt fiel aber wieder aus weshalb wir auch einige der nebenaggregate ausgetauscht haben das bedeutete im wesentlichen dass ich am samstagmorgen das freie training verpasst habe und praktisch blind ins qualifying gehen musste
8289958 unter den gegebenen umst nden konnte ich eigentlich nicht unzufrieden sein
8289959 wie berrascht warst du denn dass du im q1 der schnellste warst und auch im q2 nur 0 1 sekunden an der besten zeit gefehlt haben
8289960 es war eine sch ne berraschung weil ich nicht wusste wo ich stand ehrlich gesagt hatte ich den eindruck dass sich das auto bei weniger benzin viel besser handhaben lie als mit gro er last besonders nach dem verpassten dritten training weil ich das setup komplett ge ndert hatte und am samstagmorgen nicht ausprobieren konnte musste ich im qualifying mit dem auskommen was ich hatte
8289961 im q1 habe ich alles richtig gemacht und die runde im q2 dann wiederholt im q3 hatte ich zu anfang eine brauchbare runde und war auf dem letzten run im ersten sektor um drei zehntel besser habe dann aber gepatzt und die runde aufgegeben potentiell w re vielleicht der f nfte startplatz drin gewesen unter den gegebenen umst nden konnte ich aber eigentlich nicht unzufrieden sein
8289962 nach einem ziemlich guten start steckte ich gleich im punktekampf ich lag hinter sebastian vettel und hatte das gef hl dass ich schneller gehen k nnte an ihm war aber nicht vorbeizukommen allerdings habe aber nicht zu viel boden verloren und hatte sprit f r zwei runden mehr als er wodurch ich nach den boxenstopps vor ihm lag ich konnte eine starke pace halten ohne hart ans limit zu gehen und habe auf meine reifen und bremsen aufgepasst so dass alles in ordnung war
8289963 es ist sch n an jedem rennwochenende mit einem wettbewerbsstarken auto antreten zu k nnen
8289964 dann kam ich noch an kimi r ikk nen vorbei weil dieser nach seinem zweiten boxenstopp mit versp tung aus der gasse kam das kam unerwartet und ich erwartete dass wir nun einen hei en kampf um die position haben w rden bis ich dann sah dass er aufgeben musste der f nfte platz war ein gutes ergebnis wenn man bedenkt von wo wir gestartet sind und besonders gut war dass wir mit beiden autos gepunktet haben
8289965 toyota hat seinen vierten platz in der konstrukteursmeisterschaft weiter gefestigt bist du optimistisch f r den rest der saison
8289966 ich bin definitiv optimistisch weil das team so engagiert bei der sache ist unsere j ngsten resultate zeigen wie stark wir geworden sind und es ist sch n an jedem rennwochenende mit einem wettbewerbsstarken auto antreten zu k nnen toyota hat dieses jahr sehr gute arbeit geleistet und sieht mit jedem rennen st rker und konkurrenzf higer aus wir treiben weiter die entwicklungsarbeit voran und ich bin zuversichtlich dass wir unsere form auch in den kommenden rennen halten und weiter punkte machen werden ich werde zwei testtage in monza fahren wo das setup etwas aus der reihe f llt weil er abtrieb sehr niedrig sein muss dann geht es weiter nach spa das ist mein lieblingskurs ich habe immer ein gutes gef hl dorthin zu gehen

8289975 why isnt she the vice presidential candidate why isnt she the
8289976 the surgeon doing our wound healing trial remarked how an increase in collagen was helping to heal wounds we wondered if it might work on fixing wrinkles and lines on the face so we had some copper woven pillows made up and noticed that over a few days of lying on a copper pillow lines on the face started to soften

8289991 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

8289993 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8289994 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8289995 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8289996 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8289997 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8289998 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8289999 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
