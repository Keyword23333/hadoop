1040215 spam trap hits do hurt deliverability they are one of the major ways that isps and filtering companies detect spam and spammers
1040216 most of the systems that use spam traps use a more nuanced approach than this ip address hit one spam trap im going to block this ip
1040217 typically spam trap hits are one of several factors considered and it requires more than one spam trap hit for there to be major deliverability issues unfortunately some systems arent that nuanced
1040218 as you noted closed loop opt in doesnt mitigate the risk of hitting spam traps with welcome confirmation messages there are some techniques that do mitigate the risk
1040219 1 use a different mail server with a different ip for confirmation messages there are two benefits from this approach
1040220 first if you do hit spam traps the damage is limited to your confirmation messages
1040221 second it is easier to make a case with an isp blacklist to take action if you run a closed loop opt in service and that can show that a low er volume of only welcome messages come from that ip
1040222 2 check the email addresses for obvious malicious entries scan for addresses with and other keywords that might lead to trouble
1040223 3 check for and prohibit mass additions of email addresses from a single ip at return path we have run various services over the years with email sign up forms we have noted that when we see a mass submission of addresses from a single ip that is usually followed by hitting a spam trap

1040233 a counter letter is a document that actually reflects facts that are different from those filed into the public record
1040234 in several of the ongoing or recently wrapped up public corruption cases in new orleans counter letters played a role
1040235 in the barre case and others weve seen counter letters used on occasion to otherwise secretly modify obligations set forth with clarity in contracts
1040236 they have been on occasion really more than on occasion used as tools for execution of improper agreements and improper obligations things like that
1040237 but people think this is a civil law tradition and we just need to have it i dont agree with that

1040268 the floods of 2007 show just how serious flooding can be and i am glad to see that this project has been developed to enable people to have a greater understanding of the risk of flooding
1040269 including our annual spend on flood defences where and how we build new houses and the emergency response procedures we have in place for times of flood this game gives the game player the opportunity to make informed decisions about all of these policy areas
1040270 we are extremely pleased to have been involved in this project this is a new way of making people aware of an issue of huge importance to the uk and we hope that players will not only enjoy the game but it will also encourage them to be more interested and engaged in the tough political decisions needed to deal with flood risk through the website we want people to respond to consultations write to their local mp find out their flood risk and make their voice heard
1040271 we are delighted to have worked with playgen on this project keeping this issue in the public eye is vital around 45 000 norwich union customers were affected by the floods in 2007 our job is twofold to put things right for our customers as quickly as possible and secondly work in partnership with the government agencies and the general public to ensure the uk is better prepared for the effects of flooding in future

1040286 the whole game of reporters and their confidential sources has gone so far in washington that too many of us have forgotten our first obligation its not to the oliver norths of the world and the reporters protecting them its to readers and viewers and yes to the truth

1040689 increasing options for content the heavy buying of expensive flat tvs and rational prices for the mid level remote have all played to increase consumers willingness to purchase and desire for the more capable control benefits
1040690 u s households are spending more on their entertainment equipment as well as on content options than in the past
1040691 so spending some hundreds of dollars on a urc that allows easier use and management of their home theater systems makes more sense to them than in the past
1040692 there is a middle market for advanced universal remotes now emerging that will continue to see growth for at least the next 5 7 years
1040693 people arent hearing all the music artists and producers work hard in the studio perfecting their sound but people cant really hear it with normal headphones most headphones cant handle the bass the detail the dynamics bottom line the music doesnt move you with beats people are going to hear what the artists hear and listen to the music the way they should the way i do

1040695 we are concerned with the continuing patronising attitude of the west towards the rest of the churches
1040696 the lambeth conference is required to do something rather than live down to the worst expectations of the bishops who stayed away
1040697 everybody knows that whether its me or senator clinton or bill clinton that when you travel to other countries they ask you to try on traditional garb that you have been given as a gift
1040698 my most rewarding experience was training younger american and iraqi soldiers to be the best leaders
1040699 so that when i left they would be the experienced ones and the cycle would continue
1040700 i serve because i have pride in my country confidence in my government and faith in my fellow soldiers to bring me home safely
1040701 a new state emerged from the long and bloody unraveling of yugoslavia when the serbian province of kosovo declared independence on sunday its ethnic albanian leaders promised to embrace kosovos embittered serb minority and forge a multiethnic democratic nation
1040702 the move was immediately condemned by serbia and its ally russia but the united states is expected to quickly recognize the new state as is most of the european union in return for an agreement by kosovos leaders to submit to european union supervision
1040703 it makes financial sense for all hospitals to install a computerized ordering system despite the 2 1 million up front costs and more than 400 000 annual operating costs the study estimated that the average victim of a medication error stays in the hospital at least four extra days the researchers also looked at how often doctors at the six community hospitals ordered more expensive drugs when a cheaper generic drug would do or when they ordered an intravenous delivery of a medication when a less expensive oral pill would have been just as effective redundant lab tests were also documented
1040704 ten percent is a low percentage so rather than seeing the negative stakeholders should be thrilled that patients were only given the wrong medicine ten percent of the time
1040705 you can spend your life trying to be popular but at the end of the day the size of the crowd at your funeral will be largely dictated by the weather
1040706 it was a send off that would have made brian teigland proud
1040707 why would i box for a 1m when i can fight for 10 million cuban people
1040708 gold medals are wonderful but athletes cant eat their gold medals
1040709 the circumstances force you to make sacrifices and its a shame
1040710 in the old days olympic athletes were well taken care of and lived a more privileged life in cuba but things had gotten so bad that we werent much better off than anyone else
1040711 i will always be cuban and proud of my heritage but i had to follow my dream
1040712 we will not expose a cuban team again to the excesses and provocations that in this case would occur in chicago in us territory an ideal location for merchants and traffickers to act freely with the complicity of us authorities
1040713 i wouldnt say the cuban boxers are weak because even when they lose great fighters there are other ones coming up behind them but this team is not as experienced as theyve been before
1040714 and the defections might continue because kids are more aware of the world now with the internet promoters are going after those cuban kids and its hard to keep them from chasing their dream
1040715 the government took care of felix savon and he was very loyal but those were different times i have trouble keeping kids amateur in my gym so imagine how hard it is in cuba
1040716 we cant talk at this moment about grand goals or compare them with the athens team this team will enjoy their experience in the ring without thinking about medals
1040717 the situation today is very similar to that of barcelona 1992 when we arrived with no olympic experience due to our absence in los angeles 1984 and seoul 1988 and returned with seven gold medals
1040718 i didnt have many problems getting acclimated to law enforcement
1040719 what athletics did for me it prepared me physically because where i grew up i played a lot of basketball with guys
1040720 it taught me about teamwork confidence and all those things you need to be a police officer all those things you see in athletics are very closely related to law enforcement
1040721 where i grew up we didnt have tennis courts swimming pools or golf courses
1040722 she played a big role in the success of that team and she embraced it
1040723 shes got a low key approach to things and in communications where its 9 1 1 calls and radio calls and one call could be about a barking dog and the next about a person whose life is in jeopardy her approach has a very calming effect
1040724 i stay calm and collected thats the best way to de escalate most situations
1040725 you were challenged it was exciting i didnt know what was going to happen from day to day
1040726 i thought it would be a hobby and id work with high school kids
1040727 but before i knew it i was working college games
1040728 you have to be able to maintain a demeanor and confidence about yourself if officials arent skilled in those areas the game could really be a disaster so this job does translate

1040734 pese a los avances y el crecimiento del salario real el informe muestra que estamos lejos de la propuesta que el propio gobierno se ha comprometido que es recuperar lo perdido en la crisis
1040735 el compromiso lo mantenemos pero tambi n hay que cuidar el empleo
1040736 lo que escuchamos de astori es lo que ha venido diciendo desde hace tiempo en algunas cosas coincidimos y en otras no
1040737 en algunos temas importantes no dio opini n como el caso de las pautas salariales y de la negociaci n que estaba en la discusi n
1040738 este gobierno no va a poder alcanzar lo perdido durante el gobierno de batlle
1040739 reafirma lo que el pit ha venido diciendo todo este tiempo y las preocupaciones entorno al salario empleo e inflaci n hay que tenerlas en cuenta
1040740 los per odos de recesi n todos perdemos y al final lo que es f cil perder r pidamente no es tan f cil recuperarlo
1040741 lo que importa es la tendencia que marque el proceso
1040742 lo que dice el informe es que no est f cil recuperar lo perdido incluso en las pautas si hay voluntad pol tica y tambi n del sector empresarial se puede recuperar
1040743 we know that we all possess knowledge knowledge puffs up but love builds up

1040781 gang violence continues to plague too many of our communities and disturb the peace of too many neighborhoods and we must do everything in our power to ensure public safety and bring the perpetrators of gang crime to justice
1040782 thanks to the strong collaboration between the lapd and our state and federal partners more gang members are behind bars las streets are safer and our children and families are more secure
1040783 the warrants served this morning are an outstanding example of a collaborative effort to make our cities safe

1040789 if you were a los angeles police department officer for a day what would you do that would have the greatest impact on the community
1040790 deputy chief mike hillmann is a great credit to the los angeles police department
1040791 for more than 42 years chief hillmann has served the people of los angeles with courage conviction and distinction chief hillmann is a renowned national and international expert on emergency and incident management and the department will greatly miss his expertise
1040792 its good news for the professionals in emergency and incident management that chief hillmann will continue to lend his considerable talent to the field despite his new position with the orange county sheriffs department
1040793 i spoke with sandra hutchens on monday and fully support chief hillmanns decision to accept a position as assistant sheriff while he officially retired from the lapd in june 2008 chief hillmanns plan was to pension with the department utilizing the bounce program and he had another 10 months left with us however this new position with the orange county sheriffs department is a significant opportunity for chief hillmann i am very happy for him and wish him all the best

1040797 barack obama coming up here and competing here is going to force john mccain to make a choice
1040798 for everything that mccain does up here thats a little bit less that he can do in these big battleground states we always hear about
1040799 there is a real sense of energy coming off that campaign that is completely lacking from the other side

1040803 new data confirms growing influence of internet on politics but not quite the deciding factor new data from the pew research center puts some numbers around the growing influence of the internet on political campaigns none of this is too surprising but it quantifies what we already know that the internet is becoming more important in political campaigns especially among younger people each election the internet grows stronger and stronger this data suggests that in 2008 the internet may still not be the deciding medium in the election but it certainly points to that being the case in 2012 here are some tables from the report which is based on a survey of 1 430 adults in the u s

1040815 so the crowd learned many strange things that have happened in number land but they learned much more than this for the story teller told them much that was interesting about the way in which boys and girls used to write in centuries long past how ching wrote on palm leaves and lugal on bricks and hippias on parchment
1040816 he also told them about many of the number puzzles that have delighted boys and girls for thousands of years so that the tease found new tricks to play on all her friends and the crowd found much to think about as the stories were related by the great log fire

1040862 we astrologers feel that there is a meaningful logic behind the movement of the planets in our solar system which deeply affects us as human beings by somehow relating to our endocrine and nervous systems the planetary cycles thereby establish a framework which we have come to refer to as fate behind fate we feel lies a certain programme and the goal of this programme the game plan or meaning of it if you will is to reach a genuine state of happiness brought upon through a healthy and mature dedication to the individual and collective growth of human potential on one hand we are asked to grow inside ourselves moon where we find out who we really are as a person by digging down deep into the core genetic truth pluto we carefully learn to accept the fact that we are evolutionarily trapped into a state of animal nature as soon as we have come to terms with being this lonely vulnerable creature who desires to merge with other such vulnerable creatures we can eventually become content as human individuals we can then emotionally and spiritually open up to other content people without fear of being rejected or otherwise hurt but at the same time we all continuously grow outside as well sun we expand our reach into the world around us and with an ever increasing lightness and confidence express our true inner selves like worry free innocent children we want to unleash our dormant potential so that we can all be stars in the end in our own individual drama called life the skills to achieve this as western psychological astrology sees it are represented by the planets in our charts and all the way through this spectacular concept of living we humans also experience another somewhat sad and strange concept time passing slash ageing saturn we feel we are caught up in a reality we have to submit to a prison ruled by jealousy and decay which we cannot seem to escape we astrologers believe that only through the existence of pain are we humans compelled to get our act together and eventually play a more confident active and fun part in our own individual slice of reality

1040870 en buena parte el gobierno de jos luis rodr guez zapatero ha ocultado a los espa oles la crisis porque hab a elecciones generales y lo que todav a es peor no ya el enga o sino la falta de capacidad para tomar decisiones reales y efectivas para parar esta sangr a y c ncer de la econom a que es el paro

1040886 after all it was senator obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
1040887 no se publicaron los decretos con fuerza y rango de ley en el plazo estipulado por la ley habilitante antes del 31 de julio
1040888 lo que la carta magna ordena para la asamblea nacional con mayor raz n debe ser cumplido por el legislador unipersonal
1040889 fuimos sorprendidos en una madrugada cualquiera en estos d as con una hilera de leyes 26 leyes en una madrugada entre cantos de gallos a media noche leyes que nadie conoce que ning n venezolano supo que se estaban horneando sab amos que se hab a otorgado nuevamente al ejecutivo nacional una facultada para otorgar leyes especiales esta caracter stica que hemos venido observando se parece mucho a aquella cosa de la ii guerra mundial cuando hitler entr en el poder el parlamento alem n le otorgo a hitler la facultad para otorgar leyes especiales el parlamento desapareci
1040890 la gente me ha preguntado que contienen esas leyes cual es la intenci n del gobierno yo les he explicado que estas leyes salieron a ultima hora nadie conoce su contenido y todos nos sentimos extra ados porque no se sabe para donde va esto cual es la intenci n es aprovecharse y abusar de una ley habilitante que ten a 18 mese y que en el ltimo d a meten todo corriendo todo apresurado como cuando a los muchachos le raspan ocho materias y las quiere pasar todas en reparaci n algo as esta haciendo el gobierno ch vez ha tenido tres habilitantes pero lo de esta ltima ya es una groser a
1040891 no sabemos que hay en esas leyes lo nico es que se van a publicar alg n d a en una gaceta extraordinaria lo l gico y lo sano despu s de 18 meses es que haya aparecido cada texto de las leyes se habla de una ley de seguridad social pero no sabemos su contenido y lo que nos angustia a todos los venezolanos es precisamente el no saber para donde vamos con estos decretos ley ojala sean en beneficio para todos
1040892 lo que retrata son los niveles de ineficiencia am n del contenido de los decretos leyes que no pueden ser analizados porque no se conocen sus contenidos
1040893 es inconcebible que habiendo pr cticamente la asamblea nacional autodeterminado su cierre t cnico mediante una delegaci n legislativa absoluta y total y un tiempo que no se le hab a dado a ninguno de los presidentes anteriores que gozaron de poderes extraordinarios no fueron capaces de legislar durante diez y ocho meses y mediante un procedimiento expedito
1040894 se habla de que quieren materializarla no puede ser pasada de contrabando porque al intentar esto entra en evidente contradicci n con la constituci n y tiene que ser objeto de lo que se llama el control de la constitucionalidad es decir que todo aquello que colida con el texto constitucional es inconstitucional
1040895 el bolivarianismo en teor a nos arropa a todos solo que como lo ha planteado hugo ch vez es una manipulaci n infame del nombre y el legado de nuestro libertador y lo utiliza como instrumento de un proyecto que es la negaci n de bol var de querer imponerle a los venezolanos a supresi n de las libertades el autoritarismo y de quedarse en la presidencia para siempre
1040896 i believe the fact that wright state received these photographs is a testament to our strong arts program and the galleries commitment to sharing contemporary art with the public
1040897 of course its very exciting to add warhols name to the already impressive roster of artists we hold in our collection
1040898 the program offers institutions that do not have the means to acquire works by warhol the opportunity to bring a significant number of photographs into their permanent collections while allowing those institutions that do have warhol in their collections to enrich the breadth and depth of their holdings
1040899 the polaroid photos often served as source material for his silk screened prints and paintings
1040900 because warhol used photo based screenprint stencils for his artwork he continually needed source images to reproduce most of his black and white photographs on the other hand were documentation of a time and place and their spontaneity a refreshing contrast to the staged polaroids
1040901 dress codes sure have changed since i was a kid
1040902 tuvimos que sentarnos a reformular las leyes de manera tal que se mantuviera dentro del texto constitucional vigente con un estricto apego a la constituci n
1040903 el cronograma electoral genera una serie de prelaciones para los eventos subsiguientes es decir si las postulaciones se prorrogan va a haber un efecto domin sobre todos los otros eventos y eso implicar a retrasar el cronograma
1040904 lo aconsejable ser a no modificar el cronograma lo aconsejable es que se mantengan las fechas de las postulaciones tal cual como est n concebidas por un problema de organizaci n de cronograma y para cumplir los pasos como est n previstos y as no poner en riesgo la elecci n ni ninguno de los eventos subsiguientes
1040905 en todo caso toda elecci n implica la preparaci n de un cronograma que en el caso del cne se rige por una maquinaria al estilo de la relojer a suiza es decir con mucha precisi n milim trico de manera que cambiar el cronograma
1040906 esperamos que el tribunal supremo de justicia se pronuncie antes que se inicie el proceso de postulaciones
1040907 so who is that guy you are standing with and why is wearing peach mc hammer shorts
1040908 it has to work with her because it worked with him
1040909 i believe with great conviction that barack obama should be the next president of the united states he was against the war when it was an unpopular position is for energy and environmental conservation and supports real health care reform he has awakened a massive grass roots movement and engaged the creative community in a way unseen before art provides the perfect platform to express our collective enthusiasm and commitment for change the manifest hope gallery will shine a light on artists using their works to engage their community and challenges other artists to do the same
1040910 our members have used creativity really effectively to help in elections and were excited to partner with shepard and his crew to bring more artistic voices to help elect obama
1040911 the contest the gallery and the event will add energy to an already vibrant movement for progressive change in our country

1040936 can i ask you a question without you getting mad at me
1040937 is mickey one of those people who doesnt believe in marriage
1040938 our school board members have really pushed for this to happen
1040939 every year as theyve set budget goals prior to the ibft process one of their primary goals has always been to reduce class size
1040940 in our district its just not a question of reducing how many students per class but also having enough classrooms to accommodate additional teachers
1040941 even if we had lots of money to hire if we could hire 300 additional teachers wed also have to have 300 additional classrooms
1040942 weve always used all of the money given to us from the legislature to maintain the lower class sizes
1040943 if we didnt have the legislative money for example class sizes would be even larger than they are
1040944 annually we survey our members and every year class size reduction is listed as a top priority
1040945 we know that when class sizes are lower teachers and students can be more effective and productive we continue to seek more money from the state legislature to help with this issue but until a significant amount of money is allocated from them for class size reduction we are very pleased to have money from the voted board leeway which is county money to help in this effort
1040946 todays central managerial challenge is to inspire and enable knowledge workers to solve day in and day out problems that cannot be anticipated
1040947 managers to strike the right tone of openness humility curiosity and humor in ways that encourage their teams to learn
1040948 while i was still a child i remember hearing a number of older people offer the following explanation of the great disasters that have befallen russia men have forgotten god thats why it has all happened and if i were called upon to identify the principal trait of the entire twentieth century i would be unable to find anything more precise and more worthy than to repeat men have forgotten god

1040958 to be honest with you lucy i dont think ive ever felt better in my life
1040959 thanks rachel yeah its definitely been a wake up call i cant carry on like this any more
1040960 i havent done anything else in my life apart from modelling and i know it sounds pretty pretentious because you know we are stars and stuff and we should be able to do anything we want
1040961 but at the end of the day we still always hang out with the same kind of people and the rest of the world is considered a threat in a way do you know what i mean
1040962 anyway good to be back and lets catch up soon are you going to giorgios party tonight well perhaps see you there bye
1040963 to say im shocked would be a complete understatement zoe
1040964 its for six months francoises no big deal is it why dont you just look at it as a long holiday i havent had any for ages anyway
1040965 you should get one francoises it really doesnt help anybody if youre not happy
1040966 in a way your whole life is like an endless series of addictions
1040967 and at some stage your career your hobbies your friends and your love life simply become yet another series of bad habits which are increasingly difficult to break the older you get
1040968 so ill take bookings again from the 1st of january 2006 is that correct
1040969 youll get over it francoises there are lots of other hot models under your roof to keep you happy
1040970 ill see you in a couple of months again francoises

1040973 well david ill see you again in winter my baby have a good time until then i know you will thanks byeee
1040974 the only thing you need at the retreat is yourself
1040975 for me its the first time im here and to be honest with you im totally blown away by the whole thing
1040976 for me its also the first time and im also absolutely loving it
1040977 im working in fashion basically selling clothes with my looks
1040978 this photocopying process seems to be the bottom line of life as we know it
1040979 every minute we photocopy several kilometres of our dna can you imagine in a way this awesome rate is like the heartbeat of the universe
1040980 any sloppy photocopying alters the initial code and thereby results in mutations some of these mutations are in fact advancing us making us better if that makes any sense but most of the time theyd simply just fuck us up ageing itself science tends to believe now seems to be only such a mutation
1040981 hence life on earth is merely a 6 million year long history of photocopying primordial soup recipe code to eventually look like you and me here sweatily sitting in this icelandic sauna chamber and while im chatting away and youre listening either interested or bored were actually photocopying ourselves into the future
1040982 i know the realisation that our life is utterly futile and pointless is a lengthy and very painful process
1040983 youve got a whole business model built up around malware
1040984 and then we dont know what happens to these people then the government comes with another list and theres a good chance that the same people appear again as bdps who need help we have no way of knowing

1040987 why should we pay one dollar to the rcd when they dont even pay the civil servants they make work for them
1040988 look the rcd g admit you rwandans are in the country get out
1040989 this is the anniversary of our countrys independence you dont have a country
1040990 we want to give people a chance to celebrate their independence
1040991 what do you want to buy all of this is for sale just name your price
1040992 well one man who does not agree with mr kumute kindu is raymond mokeni ecopikani a very active man who is one of the few to have rebuilt his house after the destruction of the war and who tries to keep his economic activities going
1040993 the only thing the prophylactics would accomplish is hide the malaria from the test
1040994 it is not a problem so many die from malaria in the congo because we have more than enough children to make up for them
1040995 you allow them to live and they over populate then even more die off than before
1040996 the rcd g have their army yet and their soldiers are still robbing and frightening the people but there are examples of tolekas refusing to give soldiers free rides and others talking back at check points
1040997 the un are really false hearted de mauvaise foi and dont care about us
1040998 i have to go to a wake on the other side but i dont have the money to give them and i will miss the funeral
1040999 the hassling of the population but that nothing had come of it we aired everything third region military commander general bora uzima told me a few days later that he could have me arrested for interrogating his soldiers
1041000 you have every right to ask that i be repatriated
1041001 it is time to turn the page and forget the past
1041002 the presence in lubero of units of the rcd goma is the result of their own military offensive denounced by the international community
1041003 he says a white man has come to visit us today in our village
1041004 when they see a white they automatically think you have money to give them they have no idea how much twenty dollars is
1041005 why dont you un people do something to get the rwandans out of here
1041006 you can see them here they walk past all the time
1041007 in a state of rule of law you need rule of law because rule of law will not work without rule of law
1041008 a pygmy will break his plate after eating because he cannot understand he will need it again tomorrow
1041009 essentially silences the special nurturing voice of mister rogers in the daily lives of todays children
1041010 we will just buy from fina and continue to sell on the street

1041035 tax consultants grant thornton estimated that in 2006 at least 32 of the uks 54 billionaires paid no income tax at all
1041036 how much we asked our group would it take to put someone in the top 10 of earners
1041037 it would have been absurd to expect mea culpas from these people just because they earned so much
1041038 a lawyer admitted that he couldnt imagine surviving on an income as low as 100 000 and in discussions about higher tax bands his colleagues objected to any such low sum being used as a benchmark
1041039 john hillss charts showed how the modern uk tax system can barely be called progressive with the top 10th of income earners paying a smaller proportion of their total income in tax than the bottom 10th

1041096 this record felt like and still feels like from the writing to the recording a reclaiming of my own independence
1041097 you begin to get yourself hung up on other peoples expectations and i dont think i do my best work when i think about what other people might think of the work im doing when you do that i think the process is robbed of its freedom a little bit so i kind of found my way to an independent streak on this record i was making the songs for the songs themselves and for me alone i never played them for anyone else and i didnt obsess about them too much id write a song and move on so theres a truthful feeling to the album
1041098 when i make a record i finish it and i sit with it for a little while and inevitably ill write a couple more songs and its happened just about every time those other songs really shape the record and almost every time theyve had the title track of the record
1041099 to me its a rock record in the vein of people that ive always loved like weezer or the pixies but i guess those bands have great pop sensibilities but to me i view them as rock bands
1041100 if rock is popular at the time it becomes pop and i embrace pop music but it doesnt sound poppier to me so i just dont know if it is or it isnt ill take it if it is though because i think people enjoy that
1041101 hes a fine producer in his own right and id never worked with a producer who had written their own songs and had success with them
1041102 so i thought that that gave him a unique perspective on what i was doing and i thought he might work as a good sounding board for the songs ive got he taught me a lot because he has a great sense of melody
1041103 im writing about the journey i have been on and my life has taken me in some weird directions
1041104 some have been great some have been hard and i looked to those things and to the people that surround me and have drawn stories out of those experiences thats the one thing when you write about what you know as long as you keep living your life you dont run out of creative impetus
1041105 we are not going to comment on whether there is a criminal investigation
1041106 yo can i take it back to where it all started
1041107 it was hard for me to perform the first song because when i see 100 000 people singing along theres only one person i could think of whos missing tonight
1041108 this performance is for my mama the woman who drove me to chicago at the age of 3 and said baby
1041109 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life
1041110 pressure build up in a small sealed sample bottle in a storage safe
1041111 all indications are that there was no release of radioactivity to the environment further monitoring around the laboratory will be undertaken
1041112 this pressure build up of toxic gases that plutonium produces could have happened in the most modern lab as well
1041113 the laboratory is equipped with multiple safety systems including an air filtering system to prevent the release of radioactivity to the environment
1041114 thats the beauty i think of writing vague but powerful lyrics that someone like a movie director can interpret it in his own way and obviously someone creative is able to take the metaphors and apply them to whatever he needs in his own life
1041115 the main theme of the video is the human element of forgiveness and someone doing you wrong you feeling resentment and you being able to see through that in the next situation that might be similar and not take your rage or resentment out on the next person and basically keep spreading the disease of that through life
1041116 the one thing that i wasnt keen on here was metallica plugging into a modern war or a current event that might be construed as some sort of political statement on our part
1041117 there are so many celebrities that soapbox their opinions and people believe its more valid because theyre popular
1041118 metallica has never plugged into any current event visually but this one is kind of a hotbed people have very high opinions about this war and were trying to cut through all of that the politics and the religion tend to separate people and what were trying to do is bring it together with the common thread of resentment and forgiveness
1041119 its a story about human beings who dont know each other in a particularly tense situation
1041120 it could be a contemporary war setting but its really about forgiveness and redemption and understanding what goes on in peoples minds we really feel that this was such a beautiful and epic way to treat the song in something that was really radically different than the specificity of the lyrics
1041121 nooo we are human if i have a problem in italy i hope someone will help me
1041122 eh lontano 3 km at the end of the port
1041123 digli che e tutto a posto qui non ci facciamo fare nessuna puntura da questi
1041124 we once again ask that the press respect his privacy and that of his family
1041125 im proud of him because politics is dirty especially with republicans
1041126 i probably feel like with my limited vocal range and limited topics that im even interested in singing about its logical that id rather just get to the instrumental part
1041127 i like singing and i like melodies and stuff and in concert i like to let it go and feel the singing but in practice you dont really want to do that over and over again with guitar theres always something to discover
1041128 he knew all of the key players surrounding and protecting al qaeda
1041129 he knew that terror was going to occur before it happened
1041130 we havent had the time because of the tour to concentrate on a whole album but we wanted something out that denotes the fact that the band is alive and taking this seriously
1041131 i have daughters and ive been thinking about this a lot and if they were faced with this decision i decided that at the end of the day i just want them to be happy
1041132 do you think theyd be happy as part of the undead
1041133 this is the coolest thing ive ever done by far

1041136 household consumption surged in june but much of that went to purchase higher priced food and energy
1041137 troubles with the financial sector the economy the u s consumer theres no quick fix
1041138 it means there is some inflation leaking into the system and it puts the fed in a difficult position
1041139 but given the weakness of the economy it means theyre going to have to tolerate more inflation than they like
1041140 the citys looking shabby id rather have clean sidewalks than not be able to buy a pack of cigarettes in a pharmacy its not any of their business theyre not the surgeon general or the centers for disease control
1041141 theres crime on the streets homeless people congregating a lot of grime id rather see them concentrate on that
1041142 are you now or have you ever been a communist oh sorry i meant have you ever been a liberal
1041143 our white paper on post secondary education says memorial university is an autonomous organization but it relies on government funding do you agree or disagree with this statement
1041144 do you understand that in this context autonomous means you report to me
1041145 while answering these questions do you understand that our governments position on this hiring competition is proud strong and pre determined
1041146 whatever government pays the money gets to pick the bosses of autonomous agencies

1041152 hey what a great idea to codify this profiling taste profiling and put it up on the web
1041153 ok when you do a rate setting here are the things you need to consider
1041154 somethings gone haywire you guys get back around a table and figure it out if you dont were going to legislate a solution
1041155 hey congress you said sit down good faith negotiations and if it doesnt happen were going to legislate
1041156 its nice that you have an encyclopedic knowledge of music no one cares now sit down

1041197 if i wanted to i could go that route and be respected not for my success respected for my music and my lyrics or whatever
1041198 i did a mixtape called teen of the south with dj scream and i did that just to step my game up a little bit on that lyrical side but i wasnt really going into no album and just full fledge trying to switch my swagger and try to get respect from the game cause why would i show love to the game the game dont show you love back so i wasnt gonna do that and come back out and mess up my image and mess up myself i was going on the strength that i want respect from people who probably dont like me anyway so im gonna stick to what i do and stay being successful and ill do some mixtapes and some futures something like that
1041199 polow da don did the beat thats all ill say polow did the beat i aint saying whos featured on it or nothing like that im just saying when it comes out we aint doing no leaks we aint doing nothing when it comes out straight video straight radio all in the same day
1041200 im from south atlanta shawty lo from west atlanta gucci mane is from east atlanta and basically you know its swagger its all about your swag dudes going louis dudes going gucci dudes going prada so i was like let me go gucci real quick we hooked up went into the studio knocked the song out and basically its like three 12 bar verses we just spittin about how swagged out we are basically just a swag record i went in i did the beat
1041201 that was gonna be my first single leading into my second album
1041202 it was a hot record three million views on youtube two million plays all that but i didnt wanna go back that route no more like i was already successful with a big dance song this record was incorporated with a dance it was another big dance and it was about to take over again i told the record company i was like stop i dont wanna come back dancing cause the question that everybodys asking is like what am i gonna come back with so i could have took back over with that record but i think dancing is starting to get a little corny so i was like man im gonna hold off on that tip so i just threw it on the mixtape its heavy in the streets we gonna shoot an underground video to it
1041203 basically the record is just talking about the fact that im successful in the industry so i got a lot of cheese
1041204 i made 6 mil at 16 so basically im just saying im on a shopping spree just talking cash money thats all
1041205 i went to barack obamas office right before he started running for president

1041207 its great i want it back i want the records back
1041208 he has the music its right there in the computer
1041209 i stop by his studio every time and get something that adds something significant to my project each time im about to put a record out and i spend three or four days there to me hes the best producer in the game
1041210 when i walk in the studio i record the first beat that comes on regardless if i think its a hit record or not
1041211 we get in work mode get comfortable and go through the material thats in the computer dre always has hit records sometimes artists that need producers they need someone to create a direction for them musically i need the jewels hes just got laying around he dont gotta tell me what to do with it all he has to do is say track six or go to track eight hell have hits playing there you just have to get in and get them
1041212 im waiting for the detox all i can say is dr dre is the best producer in my eyes just the consistency over the years he knows what he wants hes such a perfectionist that it becomes difficult for him to put it out
1041213 when we came out i can say it now i actually hated puff daddy
1041214 i can say that now cause puff is my man i was disgusted at what they was doing with the shiny suits and the blow up dolls and looking like missy i didnt agree with that i felt the shiny suit movement was destroying the grimy movement as i got older i learned to respect people for doing different things at that time pone was actually locked up i was on the streets and i would turn on bet and mtv it would be the shiny suit dudes it was a messed up time mase was killing them
1041215 yall can say what yall wanna say about mase but he was killin them you almost wanted to throw on something shiny they caught remember jay with the sunshine video he had the ferris wheel the cyclone whatever it was real hard

1041221 thats the beauty i think of writing vague but powerful lyrics that someone like a movie director can interpret it in his own way and obviously someone creative is able to take the metaphors and apply them to whatever he needs in his own life
1041222 the main theme of the video is the human element of forgiveness and someone doing you wrong you feeling resentment and you being able to see through that in the next situation that might be similar and not take your rage or resentment out on the next person and basically keep spreading the disease of that through life
1041223 the one thing that i wasnt keen on here was metallica plugging into a modern war or a current event that might be construed as some sort of political statement on our part

1041225 metallica has never plugged into any current event visually but this one is kind of a hotbed people have very high opinions about this war and were trying to cut through all of that the politics and the religion tend to separate people and what were trying to do is bring it together with the common thread of resentment and forgiveness
1041226 its a story about human beings who dont know each other in a particularly tense situation
1041227 it could be a contemporary war setting but its really about forgiveness and redemption and understanding what goes on in peoples minds we really feel that this was such a beautiful and epic way to treat the song in something that was really radically different than the specificity of the lyrics

1041242 my experience is that when youve got all these documents and the possibility that other jurisdiction may be involved this takes time and the length of time it takes depends on the co operation of the other jurisdictions we have a lot of documents to go through and when we have gone through these documents then we will make a judgment whether or not we should proceed further

1041322 when i received the eucharist my intention was to bring it back to my seat to show him
1041323 i took about three steps from the woman distributing the eucharist and someone grabbed the inside of my elbow and blocked the path in front of me at that point i put it in my mouth so theyd leave me alone and i went back to my seat and i removed it from my mouth
1041324 she came up behind me grabbed my wrist with her right hand with her left hand grabbed my fingers and was trying to pry them open to get the eucharist out of my hand

1041387 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
1041388 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
1041389 although there has been uncertainty regarding bretts return ted thompson and coach mccarthy had previously discussed this and have had a plan in place coach mccarthy will talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly

1041448 the rally tells us that they are ready to go and we are not
1041449 mr harper was of course in a friendly crowd but we have to consider that he was in quebec for the conservatives to put 2 000 people in the same room in quebec is bad news for the liberals
1041450 so while the conservatives have prepared their strategy for the fall the one for the liberals is still up in the air this week dion is on holiday and next week he has the meeting with top strategists to set the course for the following months unfortunately for dion his problems are numerous and complicated there is still quite a bit of disagreement on the most important part of his electoral platforms the green shift or carbon tax and the party has financial fundraising and organization problems

1041458 when we began this effort in 2002 with the orange county board of supervisors unanimous designation of september as child awareness month it became evident that there was a larger need for a national spotlight on the issues and needs facing kids across the country
1041459 i appreciate the efforts of representatives calvert and sanchez for their efforts in making children part of the national discussion and agenda and look forward to working with the senate on a similar bill and ultimately a presidential proclamation
1041460 we agree that recognizing september as national child awareness month will provide an excellent collaborative opportunity for childrens charities and youth serving organizations by bringing national attention to issues of vital concern to children
1041461 you and your team at festival of children foundation are to be commended for your determined initiative and leadership on behalf of this effort
1041462 the remittance id tagging feature not only adds a connection between the check and the remittance document for added search functionality it also connects with the users accounting system for improved cross referencing and simplified payment reconciliation
1041463 tracking the remittance invoice or other relevant payment information at the point of scanning adds a level of control to accounting departments
1041464 reconciliation processes are usually labor intensive tedious and prone to a high level of exceptions the ability to capture a remittance tag at scanning brings a new level of efficiency
1041465 integrating the remittance feature throughout the entire process makes it easy for an accounting professional to access a live transaction real time
1041466 this includes deposits that are returned and later collected and paid attaining this level of detail in the check management process is often a manual process for most accounting departments now there is a single place for documenting and automating the lifecycle of a check payment even when returned

1041482 the uk regulators were fully aware for a decade that equitable life was effectively insolvent yet they allowed the society to suck in another 20 billion in pension contributions from more than one million new investors
1041483 principally the society was the author of its own misfortunes regulatory failures were secondary factors
1041484 building false expectations of regulators can lead to a destruction of public confidence
1041485 those responsible for undertaking financial regulation should act in a way that is compatible with the duties and powers which parliament has conferred upon them those responsible for the prudential regulation of equitable life failed to do so throughout the period covered in my report
1041486 misleading and unbalanced with assurances being provided that the society was solvent when that was in considerable doubt and was not the view of always held within the fsa
1041487 secondly there is a public interest in encouraging people to make long term financial provision for themselves so that an aging population looks less to the state for its pensions

1041572 t he professor gave the copyshop the materials of which the coursepack was to be made up and the copyshop did the rest
1041573 by selling access to a system that automatically produces copies on command cablevision more closely resembles a store proprietor who charges customers to use a photocopier on his premises and it seems incorrect to say without more that such a proprietor makes any copies when his machines are actually operated by his customers

1041576 could well have been a factor in msps decision to initiate an investigation
1041577 however it is pretty clear that the groups and individuals under surveillance were not a threat in the intelligence field a lot of decisions come down to judgment calls in retrospect the msp should have ended the surveillance much earlier than it did quite clearly continuing the operation was a bad call
1041578 a special legislative oversight committee similar to congressional oversight committees would be good start to ensure that the msp is following both federal and state guidelines

1041585 hey how come he is so stupid he does not know
1041586 everyone is so insecure amp unsure of themselves it is easy to accept anyone into your life amp especially a negative person since if theyre on your side you theoretically will never be the person they tear into the problem with this concept is that negative people are on no ones side but their own nobody is safe
1041587 the world is a stage but the play is badly cast
1041588 my favourite story is him taking the sailors out of the pub and making sure they got back to their ship on time
1041589 from what i have read he physically pushed the sailors out of the pubs there are stories of him nudging them along the road and anyone who tried to escape was herded into the crew again until they got back to the thorrod
1041590 its better than a lassie film in many ways its an extraordinary story the average dog in my experience has a loyalty for his master and the family he lives with but bamse was a dog that appeared to have a loyalty for a wider family
1041591 he had a sphere of concern for those people that he loved and he looked after them very well
1041592 i was in a fortunate position being a gp in this town that many of my patients remembered the dog and were very keen to talk to me about it
1041593 i knew it wasnt good to pay off the car in five years id be paying almost double the asking price
1041594 they dont have enough financial education to know about their credit score or high interest rates or the real amount theyre paying on a loan
1041595 if our personnel are worried about their credit card debt or making the next mortgage payment it will affect their military readiness with potentially deadly consequences
1041596 we want to change the spend first borrow to buy mentality that so many americans grow up with
1041597 the subprime market caught a lot of military families in a real lurch just like any family
1041598 when a husband or wife is deployed theres less income and less financial help available
1041599 many enlisted folks are straight out of high school and theres no financial literacy training
1041600 all of a sudden they get a paycheck every two weeks but at the same time theyre underpaid as a result they go to payday loan stores to fill the gap and get into deeper and deeper debt
1041601 everyone in military service needs to be vigilant on what kind of financial transaction theyre getting into
1041602 we cant help everyone in some cases they need to sell the house and face reality
1041603 ive had guys who put just 10 a week 20 a paycheck into savings thats two burger king meals

1041610 i continue to be surprised bythe number of educated people many of them biologists who think that offering explanations for human behavior in terms of culture somehow disproves the suggestion that human behavior can be explained in darwinian evolutionary terms fortunately we now have a book to which they may be directed for enlightenment it is a book full of good sense and the kinds of intellectual rigor and clarity of writing that we have come to expect from the boyd richerson stable
1041611 not by genes alone is a valuable and very readable synthesis of a still embryonic but very important subject straddling the sciences and humanities
1041612 and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from the evil one
1041613 when tempted no one should say god is tempting me for god cannot be tempted by evil nor does he tempt anyone
1041614 then jesus was led by the spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil
1041615 everybodys worried about where our employees are going to live
1041616 this is one answer thats dedicated to a combination of apartment dwellers and homeowners that can be serviced within the community as far as restaurants maybe a grocery store day care center and can be in close proximity to work
1041617 its a great location its just that no ones doing anything with it
1041618 youre seeing new retail youre seeing housing being rehabilitated and youre seeing new construction the community is starting to take on its own heart beat
1041619 we tried to look for ideas in every choice that we make in our homes hoping that everyone who goes through it will be inspired to make some change on some level
1041620 some people will walk away and want to do an entire new home or some people will think when they go for their towels next and go for organic linens
1041621 it is happening but the industry needs to do a better job of getting information into peoples hands when theyre looking for it
1041622 i like not making a negative impact on the earth
1041623 its got so much to be said for it because it uses nature and natural materials
1041624 its open you bring the outside in and you can even bring the inside out its a house built for humans its plausible in real life
1041625 the impression that green building has to be modern weird solar ugly
1041626 one of the things thats fundamental to green building is that it can look like anything it can be a regular craftsman house or a cape cod house in new england or an adobe house in santa fe you dont have to change what the home looks like to make it green
1041627 but we hope people will make informed decisions when theyre building when theyre renovating
1041628 once i can see in real time how my behavior translates to my usage i can make changes
1041629 if youre very clever if youre a do it yourself kind of person you can do one room at a time and achieve your ultimate goal
1041630 its no longer a question if people want to go green or not they do

1041636 weve got bargain priced properties in choice neighborhoods in many parts of the country so this could be an advantageous time to buy that fantasy place youve always wanted
1041637 you might get beat up on the selling end yet make out like a bandit when you buy that bigger home but remember it could be the kiss of death to your moving plans to hold out for too high a price on your present place
1041638 these days people who try to jump the gun on a purchase can get in a lot of hot water thats because in this market you cant plan accurately as to how long it will take to sell your place
1041639 some people have an entitlement mentality about what they deserve to get when they sell they refuse to consider any price lower than what the neighbor down the street got two or three years ago
1041640 many builders with unsold houses are really hurting these builders are dropping their prices to fire sale levels especially if they owe a lot to the bank for their construction loans
1041641 people like a floor plan that flows nicely from the front entrance of the house all the way through to the back this is especially nice for entertaining
1041642 when you buy an over improved home you may pay as little as 30 cents on the dollar that sellers spend for ritzy improvements
1041643 never trade off your chance to move to a better neighborhood just to get extra space or a fancy kitchen living in a strong neighborhood always trumps the amenities inside the house

1041898 bill ive just handed the south to the republicans for fifty years certainly for the rest of our life times
1041899 t his year 2004 is the 50th anniversary of the modern civil rights movement which most people date to the brown v board of education supreme court decision that opinion was written by a republican chief justice appointed by a republican president dwight eisenhower
1041900 the democratic party has built its power base on the backs of poor blacks and they want to keep blacks poor angry and voting for democrats
1041901 every election cycle they go into the black community and preach hatred against the republican party and get blacks to cast a protest vote against republicans

1041907 like spoiled angry children they rebel against the normal responsibilities of adulthood and demand that a parental government meet their needs from cradle to grave
1041908 a social scientist who understands human nature will not dismiss the vital roles of free choice voluntary cooperation and moral integrity as liberals do
1041909 a political leader who understands human nature will not ignore individual differences in talent drive personal appeal and work ethic and then try to impose economic and social equality on the population as liberals do and a legislator who understands human nature will not create an environment of rules which over regulates and over taxes the nations citizens corrupts their character and reduces them to wards of the state as liberals do
1041910 the roots of liberalism and its associated madness can be clearly identified by understanding how children develop from infancy to adulthood and how distorted development produces the irrational beliefs of the liberal mind

1042142 the one thing we dont want is for kevin to change he averages 50 plus in test and one day cricket and he is an unbelievable talent
1042143 everyone will ask will his batting be affected but knowing kevin he will probably average 70 as captain
1042144 you know what he is like as soon as he is put under the pump and people start saying things about him he comes back and gets a big score i would imagine he will do that this time
1042145 the first innings against south africa in the first test at lords earlier this summer was the one for me a lot was said going into that series and the finger has been pointed at him by a lot of people
1042146 he is a bit nervous at first but gets his head down and blazes a hundred that is a measure of the man when you see things like that i am sure he will take to captaincy in the same way he will take it in his stride
1042147 it is a tough job it is not just about being on the field moving the field about and changing the bowlers around
1042148 the thing is trying to leave it on the cricket field there is a lot off the field as well and i took it home with me from time to time that is what i found a bit hard about the job
1042149 michael said it affected him at home and he took the work home and i did that as well it is hard not to it is a hard job but it can be very rewarding as well if you get the results
1042150 you also need help from the rest of the side you also need a few people to lean on when i was doing the captaincy i took too much on myself and didnt have too many sounding boards or people to speak to about the job
1042151 kevin will be fine he is confident single minded and will have a definite approach to how he is going to do it the team have got to perform as well and there is no reason why we cant all be successful together
1042152 if you see when michael took over it was in similar circumstances to kevin now against south africa michael quickly stamped his authority on things and the overriding thing was he wanted people to express themselves and enjoy playing cricket
1042153 that is how the england side played through his reign and we were successful michael helped me as a cricketer and tried to take away the fear of failure and let the players go out there and play
1042154 it is inevitable i suppose when a captain resigns or goes it is under poor circumstances i think vaughany deserved more than the circumstances he is going in now
1042155 it would have been nice to go after a series win or go out on a high which i think he definitely deserves and i just hope we havent seen the last of him
1042156 he is a fine batsman and has shown that on numerous occasions and i know he will be fighting to play for england again

1042158 does anyone understand why obama suggesting that people keep their tires properly inflated is some sort of hilarious gaffe
1042159 mccain supporters in michigan will distribute tire gauges at obamas energy speech in lansing the rnc will also deliver gauges reading obamas energy plan to washington newsrooms
1042160 inflating your tires and getting a regular tune up sounds more like obamas plan for ego maintenance than it does for helping american families
1042161 obama refers to big oil and the need to reduce our use of oil by 35 over the next twenty years how do we get there keep inflating those tires folks
1042162 is the obama ad a reaction to this roll mccain ad
1042163 john mccain statements on his foreign policy positions are often confused
1042164 barack obama has consistently argued for x y and z
1042165 wow didnt realize obama is that popular guess i have to vote for mccain instead
1042166 barack obama stood up at a speech recently and said that one of the things that is really important from energy policy from his standpoint is to check the pressure in our tires so heres a tire gauge and you can go out in the parking lot here and check your tires now thats an interesting thing we want you to have good pressure in your tires you know it will very mildly add to your fuel efficiency but checking the air pressure in your tires is not an energy policy for the united states of america
1042167 wow didnt realize obama is that popular guess i have to vote for mccain instead
1042168 there was a deep roaring sound like a bomb raid

1042171 we agreed that in the absence of a positive response we have no choice but to pursue further measures

1042175 no enemy vessels would be able to escape it within a 300 kilometre radius from the borders of iran
1042176 dhoni has been declared the recipient of the rajiv gandhi khel ratna award the countrys most prestigious sports award

1042179 it is no longer the worker who employs the means of production but the means of production which employ the worker
1042180 we assume throughout not only that the value of an average labour power is constant but that the workers employed by a capitalist are reduced to average workers
1042181 the court issued a tro temporary restraining order restraining the respondents from signing the moa memorandum of agreement
1042182 we submit to the sound discretion of the court which is the ultimate arbiter of issues and so effectively the signing of the agreement will have to be cancelled
1042183 its ill timed and there was already a lot of opposition to this deal
1042184 this is a setback but could also be a blessing since the high court could finally solve the legal questions on the draft agreement
1042185 is a very emotional issue this might revive old wounds

1042351 the contacts were initiated by the georgians who asked moscow to persuade tskhinvali to show a maximum of restraint apparently this has been done

1042380 i had goosebumps every time i played in hamburg its clich d to say that hsv will always remain in my heart but this really is the case and it should remain so
1042381 weve been solid and havent given up a lot of chances and weve still been making chances

1042383 my plans for the team are just to maintain my starting spot to perform great and to make them win all the time
1042384 for a long time they the doctors thought that i had a weak abdominal muscles there was simply nothing to be seen on the scans

1042395 i have not heard anything from amsterdam and i just cant imagine that theyll ring us now only a week before we play in the european champions league that would not be very tidy i think

1042399 i think we can be happy with the result we know sunderland are a club with a great history a club that are improving and we knew they would provide the sort of test they did

1042441 not right now like brett favre ill never rule anything out

1042449 we chose to bring this game to the west because we believe in its potential the guaranteed fun promotion is our way of showing our belief in the game and is even better than a money back guarantee because you dont have to spend a penny to play asda story

1042454 these figures show the treasury is in for a real windfall at the expense of some of the poorest people in the country pensioners on fixed incomes are bearing the brunt of bumper rises in fuel and shopping bills it is therefore outrageous that the government has targeted them to claw back millions of pounds

1042466 this is a true heavy album one for people who would rather actually plug a real les paul into a marshall and just lay waste than those who would merely simulate shredding on their playstation 3 although they too are invited to the party
1042467 we aint talking about the perverse concept of freedom in dubyas sense were talking about freedom in the purest hobbesian sense a free man is he that is not hindered to do what he hath the will to do and metal
1042468 its uncomfortable now but you wont notice in the air
1042469 it is so choice if you have the means i highly recommend picking one up
1042470 not many presidents could say in the history of u s diplomacy that relations with south korea japan china and thailand are strong and robust
1042471 a lot of times if youre friends with one you made it hard to be friends with another
1042472 the north koreans have 11 000 artillery tubes and rockets aimed at the south korean capital so any little thing that we do with north korea makes the south koreans very jittery
1042473 on the other hand the u s has to worry a great deal about where terrorists might get nuclear weapons or nuclear material
1042474 the more ive seen the more critical i see the need is for the world to pay attention to the people of burma and for the world to put pressure on the military regime
1042475 i think its best for u s chinas relations that i go i know its important for me to send a clear signal to the chinese people that we respect them

1042478 in the absence of a clear positive response from iran we have no choice but to pursue other measures against iran
1042479 the pressure on iran to comply with the demands of the international community and the u n security council will only grow
1042480 there is one way for the iranians to make clear that they have found common ground its to come and say we accept the proposal this is a good basis for the beginnings for pre negotiations within a six week period and then we can suspend our enrichment and reprocessing and we can begin real negotiations and the united states will be at the table

1042486 we had a warm winter followed by a rainy spring which caused high levels of planktonic plant life to develop this meant that the oysters were particularly well fed and spent a lot of energy developing their sexual organs to the detriment of their natural reserves leaving them vulnerable to oshv 1

1042495 el primer d a de la pretemporada tiene un aliciente especial y todos vienen con muchas ganas
1042496 ahora lo que queremos todos es que llegue pronto el 13 de septiembre para jugar porque la pretemporada es muy aburrida pero sirve para coger el tono f sico y el tono con el bal n y hay que hacerlo
1042497 hay un entrenador nuevo un preparador f sico nuevo y jugadores nuevos y eso lleva un tiempo m s del que tenemos pero espero que el 13 de septiembre eso no se note
1042498 la idea original era traer a un jugador para reforzar o mejorar el nivel de lo que hab a en la plantilla y actualmente en el mercado no lo hay y estoy satisfecho con lo que tengo

1042501 many lower skilled workers are single mothers with children who dont have reliable transportation their kids get sick so they miss a couple of days of work and then they get fired so finding ways of breaking down this kind of barrier so they can work can really make a difference
1042502 you tend to find out about jobs from your friends coworkers and neighbors but if you live in an area that is downtown and the jobs are being created out in the suburbs it will be more difficult to find out what jobs are available
1042503 in some suburbs there are particular kinds of zoning that make it difficult to create affordable housing lot size requirements and zoning that keeps out apartments puts limits on where people can move if they have limited resources all of these three barriers public transportation information about new jobs and housing barriers keep the people from low income households from getting the jobs that are available far from home

1042526 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
1042527 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
1042528 the scientific community is really going to run with this
1042529 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science

1042537 norm coleman is spending a lot of money trying to fool people into thinking hes an independent voice but on every issue from the economy and the war in iraq to privatizing social security and selling out to big oil he hasnt been a voice hes been an echo for george w bush and his special interest friends
1042538 lets talk about the campaign ad i mentioned in which the senators wife brings up the point that a lot of people think that he is a rubber stamp for the bush administration if you look at the record definitely for the first four years he was i mean he really did vote with the president in the past two years he has clearly distanced himself
1042539 we do however have a problem with colemans behavior in boston on behalf of the bush campaign the senator has morphed into an attack dog for president bush and in the process he has demeaned the u s senate and embarrassed many of his constituents
1042540 it takes time and privacy especially working out the methods which i wouldnt have guessed anyone really knew in the lab at that time
1042541 the changes really began to accelerate in the last year he would sit at his desk weeping
1042542 he really couldnt do his work any more the pressure was tremendous
1042543 people given these kinds of responsibilities with this kind of power at their fingertips we have to make sure that they are not likely to do harm to others or misuse that authority be it intentionally or be it because of some mental problem
1042544 these kinds of situations cry out for re examination of our standards
1042545 youre basically going to scare off any scientist from wanting to work in this field if it becomes even more stringent
1042546 it is a balance its a policy decision about how stringent we want to be

1042553 a fraud a racket in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out thats what autism is
1042554 the data shows that enforcement can work as an alternative to amnesty
1042555 we are not faced with the false choice of legalizing everybody or arresting every single illegal alien and throwing them out
1042556 comprehensive enforcement of immigration laws is working and we need to keep it up
1042557 with the state of the economy and a lack of jobs we do have a situation where many undocumented immigrants are going back home
1042558 when the situation here gets worse than in their hometowns they think its better to be home
1042559 the data shows the drop in the illegal population started before the uptick in the unemployment rate of those same people the decrease began because of enforcement it could well be picking up because the economy
1042560 once the economy picks up you will have a restart of the so called migrant exodus as long as people are hungry as long as people see there is opportunity in the united states of america they are going to make the journey north
1042561 despite the success we still have almost 90 percent of the illegal aliens who were here last year
1042562 he space remains adamant that any proposal to address the immigration crisis should not provide a gift to immigrants who have already broken the law
1042563 such an action would burden american taxpayers and increase competition for jobs
1042564 theyre hoping that by talking tough and trying to define democrats as soft on illegal immigration that it will mobilize more of their base and maybe even win swing voters

1042568 the tsa is well aware that the removal of shoes is not our most popular policy in fact it probably ranks up there with root canals and doing your taxes
1042569 last year tsa tested a shoe scanner from general electric in orlando today were testing shoe scanning technology at los angeles international airport if all goes well these tests could lead the way to quelling of one of our most unpopular policies

1042572 things have gotten pretty bad when u s companies relocate to europe to cut their tax payments
1042573 but a research analysis by morgan stanley finds the combined companys corporate tax bill will be lower than in the u s and that the tax differential indeed figured into the economics of the sale
1042574 state leaders will have tough decisions to make in 2009
1042575 unless we speak up and join a movement to change the states course and put more revenue on the table yes this means tax increases for those who can afford it the disinvestment for the common good will continue in our state

1042592 this was how they were brought up that was effective as a piece of evidence because it was controversial
1042593 theyll find out do you go to parent teacher interviews what are the names of the teachers do you go to dance class do you go to the dance recitals
1042594 would it have been as effective if she had said of course im involved with my children i do homework science projects that would have been enough
1042595 it would be nice to do it instead because your child wanted to see it one day

1042605 so you wouldnt have to know all the grown up stuff

1042615 they let him out of jail without giving back my baby
1042616 the judge told me my ex husband has spent eight days in jail so they cannot keep him anymore as they have certain procedures the judge said there was nothing he could do if he wont return the baby
1042617 i cannot even get a search warrant for his sisters house because the judge said it is against the law as they are not involved in the case
1042618 the judge said there is no evidence that they are the ones keeping sarah but everybody knows that is where she has been
1042619 i want to make sure we have all the reports as well as medical records to decide if charges are warranted and if so what they would be
1042620 it is vital that the child be placed in a safe permanent living arrangement with a caring family
1042621 we remain concerned for the continued well being of the three siblings due to the circumstances and reason for the abandonment of the infant
1042622 the circumstances and reason for the abandonment will remain confidential at this time
1042623 we believe this is an issue of extreme public interest such that the need for keeping these hearings on this matter open far outweigh the need for confidentiality
1042624 in the days after the child was abandoned in richland county children services arranged for a full page advertisement in the news journal to explain how ohios safe haven law works
1042625 the agency should not seek to have it both ways
1042626 secondly theres a good chance the woman who abandoned the baby could face potential criminal charges
1042627 should that happen it certainly will not be done in secret there will be full disclosure of the incident at that point
1042628 third richland county children services attorneys submit there is sufficient alternative means available to the media to obtain updates as of the status and process of this matter that does not require disclosure or identity of any party involved
1042629 while we appreciate their interest in our work we certainly dont think children services attorneys are in a position to judge how and why we perform our crucial first amendment responsibility
1042630 coverage of these hearings in the newspaper and other media would generate more discussion about the states safe haven law it will lead to a greater understanding of this law and how it protects newborn babies
1042631 in essence it is up to the sound discretion of the juvenile court in finding a balance between preserving the competing interests of the publics interest in judicial proceedings and the childs interest in confidentiality
1042632 will full and open access by the media create a chilling effect on the safety of yet to be born children whose mothers may be contemplating use of ohios safe haven law
1042633 if a mother who finds herself in a situation where for whatever reason she does not want to keep her soon to be born child might the fear of extraordinary media attention inadvertently promote a personal decision to abort or kill the child or to abandon the child in an unsafe location
1042634 and a comparatively hairless manny ramirez was still unhappy albeit in cleveland

1042636 i believe that politics and sports shouldnt mix and it is best for the politicians to work out these types of issues
1042637 im not so far into it i dont feel i need to be hands on into it
1042638 im giving the maximum donation to obama then it might have been hypocritical this wasnt an announcement it was a reporter doing his job and kpd i think you are simply looking for an argument if you believe that article was in any way slanted towards either of the candidates
1042639 barack obama is the kindest bravest warmest most wonderful human being ive ever known in my life
1042640 boy he can put up a triple double at will im going to vote the way he votes
1042641 as a washington wizards fan theres no way ill ever vote for anyone that lbj would consider
1042642 i believe that politics and sports shouldnt mix and it is best for the politicians to work out these types of issues but if sports can create awareness and shed light on this issue then thats a good thing
1042643 i didnt sign the letter right then and there so now its blown up
1042644 no one heard my side of the story but automatically its lebron didnt sign the letter he doesnt care but for me to try to create awareness of the situation thats going on in darfur and other places for me in the position i am i should speak on it and i am gonna speak on it
1042645 at the end of the day were talking about human rights
1042646 and people should understand that human rights and peoples lives are in jeopardy were not talking about contracts here were not talking about money were talking about peoples lives being lost and that means a lot more to me than some money or a contract

1042715 i heard some medics talking once about how they had to meet the incoming ships mostly lcis and lsts and spray delousing powder on the koreans before they were allowed to board trains for their home towns
1042716 division sent us an explosives expert who was to supervise the job of reducing the dump an engineer lt in charge of repair of a nearby bridge said that the last he saw of the expert just before the explosion he was standing on top of a pile of explosives directingthe korean firemen in their attempt to put out a fire in the rice stubble inside the dump
1042717 division said it was ok to use the japs to dispose the ammo at sea they did it without incident gave me no trouble followed all the rules i laid down to the letter i even took my guards off their compound
1042718 captain hillenmeyer certainly must be henry reiling hillenmeyer also know as
1042719 camp hillenmeyer was established on the site of the old japanese kunsan airdrome when the 6th infantry division first arrived they called it camp iri and later camp kunsan then in honor of an infantry captain who was killed while in a japanese ammo dump at the site while being cleaned up in 1945 46 the camp was named hillenmeyer and was called that while i was there 1947 48 today the site is the kunsan united states air force base at the time i was there camp hillenmeyer was about ten miles by bumpy dirt road down along the yellow sea coast from the wolmyong park tunnel in kunsan we lived in quonset huts which were not far from the beach of the yellow sea
1042720 i included in the book as much of the early history of american troops in the kunsan area as i could find not much is available even in military archives lots of records seem to have been lost but there is evidence that the first americans arrived in september october of 1945 and established themselves at the japanese airbase where japanese airplanes were still sitting out on the field troops from the 6th also located units in buildings in kunsan iri and chonju these troops were from the 63rd infantry regiment that had just finished a very long period of active combat in the philippine islands they came by lst from the philippines landed at inchon and i think got to iri chonju and kunsan by truck convoys they were not equipped for the cold weather and used surplus japanese army clothing and blankets according to one guy mclogan that i have talked to who was there at that time
1042721 it took all day to make the trip from seoul to kunsan some 130 miles it was dark when we arrived at the japanese air base near kunsan where the third battalion was billeted in wooden barracks
1042722 very long and constructed of wood the interior walls were made of paper tin plywood a long narrow central hallway ran the length of the barracks some 250 or 300 feet there were small rooms on both sides of the hallway housing offices and sleeping quarters of the men six or eight to a room they were unheated and veritable fire traps
1042723 apparently the japanese military were hardy souls who could live in that climate without heating the barracks
1042724 one building which must have been officers quarters had a mini swimming pool in it which turned out to be a communal bath tub the story was that the japanese all bathed together and sat around on the ledge the cranked the heat way up and the last one to get out was considered to be the toughest we used it as a reservoir of hot water and dipped buckets out of the pool to bathe
1042725 the yellow sea was within walking distance and we often walked down to the shore the tides in this part of the world are enormous sometimes running as high as 30 heet when it was at low tide we could stand on the beach and look out over miles and miles of mud flats with the ocean barely discernible on the horizon
1042726 the latrines we built did not have flush toilets or sewer connections the toilets used at the time were open topped 50 gallon steel drums with a flat piece of plywood laid on top of each drum these pieces of plywood had a hole in it of about the right size
1042727 the drums were emptied every week by korean contractors they came with a horse drawn honey wagon to empty the drums the contractor lifted off the plywood top set it to one side brought the barrel outside and dumped it into the honey wagon all of the latrines in the camp worked this way i do not think the new latrines were intended to house these steel drum toilets they i think remained in their own separate tin shacks the new latrines were really washrooms if i remember correctly i do remember them being called latrines insofar as their identity for construction purposes
1042728 the houses were built by korean labor using japanese materials
1042729 betty grenig of scottsdale arizona remembers that the electricity supplied by north korea was very intermittent at night and her kids took a bath in the kitchen in a washtub
1042730 there are no formal real estate documents predating 4 april 1955 and the first building inventory was completed in 1957
1042731 it would be safe to assume that these buildings are of japanese construction

1042736 if i am reading cornell correctly he is arguing that early americans believed that the right to keep and bear arms was guaranteed only to enrolled militiamen and that it applied only to a single weapon per militiaman
1042737 wide ranging laws prohibiting the sale of pistols dirks and sword canes
1042738 in the view of the aymette court the legislature enjoyed the widest possible latitude to regulate pistols
1042739 the object for which the right to keep and bear arms is secured is of general and public nature to be exercised by the people in a body for their common defence so the arms the right to keep which is secured are such as are usually employed in civilized warfare and that constitute the ordinary military equipment

1042764 we know that stress can have a dramatic effect on the immune system
1042765 and quite often that can create immune related responses in the skin
1042766 in todays world the physiological changes that are part of the stress response get misrouted
1042767 instead of helping you attack or run away theyre triggering inflammatory autoimmune or allergic reactions
1042768 stress seems to disrupt the skins antimicrobial barrier and reduce the production of chemicals necessary for the synthesis of fats
1042769 that means stressed out skin loses its ability to defend and rebuild itself
1042770 we dont fully understand the biological mechanisms that might be involved but we know that relaxation does improve your outlook and helps you do things like eating healthier food sleeping better and getting more exercise that improve the health of your skin

1042827 but republicans commandeered the floor and held a rump session to lambaste the democrats and nearly 50 house gopers did just that for the next several hours it was an extraordinary scene i ran out to the press gallery that overlooks the floor to soak in the spectacle the speakers office had ordered the chamber closed and were on the verge of kicking out the press but they wouldnt do that so long as a member of congress asked them not to house minority whip roy blunt r mo stationed himself in the press gallery
1042828 blunt then escorted yours truly and congressional quarterly reporters liriel higa and ed epstein to the floor reporters generally arent allowed on the floor of the house but again this was different house aides looked shocked as blunt paraded us into the chamber epstein an excellent reporter and good friend then suggested i ask blunt if i could bring a camera into the chamber i asked the whip and he demurred arguing that the rules are very strict about cameras in the chamber this was the irony republicans were stirring up all sorts of trouble inside the chamber but no one could see it that is except for the aides and the tourists watching the show from the gallery i later put the same question to rep mike pence r in he told me that lawmakers had to obey the rules
1042829 white house correspondent wendell goler was preparing a package about energy i asked him if he wanted stuff from the house he pointed out that it would be a hard tale to tell without video i then ran into mike majchrowitz hes the capitol hill correspondent for fox news radio mike told me he gave his radio recording gear to an unnamed member and persuaded him to record some audio inside the chamber that was a start then i was on a mission we had to get video from inside the chamber ive always known that the best way to get what you need in journalism is to rely on guerilla tactics and like any reporter worth their salt i dont reveal sources and methods but fox was able to sneak in a comvu phone into the house chamber to broadcast live video from inside the chamber this was historic because live video and rarely private video has never been streamed from the house chamber ever but we did that today on fox

1042850 those who should get in get in those who should be kept out are kept out and those who should not be here will be required to leave
1042851 the thing about this research is that this work has confirmed that our economy based on parasitic capitalism where the small elite sits atop the heap of men and gorges on their lifeblood is destroying the social fabric of america
1042852 this system is based on a stacked deck where the top elites always reap the profits that are made to rise to the top through the corporate profits based system
1042853 the research confirmed that the rowing inequities of such a system were ever increasing and with them elevated social tensions
1042854 despite all the reports shortcomings and its hypocrisy it does make some sound observations about what is needed for our immediate survival we should take it as a guide to what our government knows about the coming mega crisis and a template to help us see what changes we could make if there were truly a new economy a new social contract a new american state for it is obvious to all those who take the time to look that we are headed into a period of national freefall when american society plunges head first into a dark abyss of uncertainty as the old order passes away and the new world order rushes in to fill the void we are seeing the planned collapse of america coming down the road we are on what are we going to do to get our nation off that highway to hell

1043481 his explanation for her blood found on his jacket resulted from the girl suffering from a nosebleed a week before the incident and the accused will say he carried her home because it was a very hot day
1043482 that evening he brown came home and he was very drunk he started shouting at me and hitting me then he pulled my baby child off my back i was so afraid i fled to my aunts place

1043525 how they cant seemed to learn anything properly cant take instructions some cant even take a step forward in field duty some refuse to cooperate with the team
1043526 that i was under depression for a few months before i could continue my job
1043527 its the part where you were just a waiter before you had your first field duty
1043528 i guess rumours do run around faster than cleaning lava
1043529 were you afraid when you had to face that wurm alone on your very first field duty
1043530 it was actually a dragon a white fang and yes i was afraid i even thought of changing my job directly after that
1043531 well look at you now youre a captain with your own squad
1043532 that was because im lucky to be able to stick to my job
1043533 i dont think it has much to do with luck
1043534 i believe you simply given the right chance to prove yourself it might not be just a single chance that given to you
1043535 it was not unheard of that inexperienced members were recruited into the swarm force but it was almost unheard of that a member with no prior experience could stay so long and be promoted twice not to mention surviving so much depressing situations in his line of this dangerous and life threatening job
1043536 if youre saying youre here because of your luck then i must say it has long passed your luck did get you into the swarm force in the first place but it was not because of your luck that youre still here our line of work is a very dangerous one news of members death is just as common to us as customer complains our capabilities are the measure of how well we can stay in this job not our hypermage abilities mutant powers or our history its how well we handled what is being thrown at us not how many fireballs that one can throw these young recruits managed to make it for a reason and many of them may not recruit for the same reason but i believe that they are recruited for a good reason in life not all of us grow at the same rate some of us are early bloomers some of us are late bloomers some of us need to be cracked like a throny hard shelled fruit often times the late bloomers are discarded because people made early conclusions which are wrong about them sometimes people simply fails to believe in them or even want to see them or worse nobody bother to check whether they bloom late or needs to be crack just because people dont see certain things it does not mean those certain things are not there thats one of the things with talent sometimes they need to be crack open you of all of the available squad captains should know these
1043537 a couple of meetings ago i receive news that the insane squad captain proposed this program of giving the new recruits practical training during their probation stage so that the newbies have a good idea what they are about to face in their actual field duties new recruits would be given a hand ons on real situation and should they pass this probation stage they shall be recognized a swarm force member and should they fail they will be given a second chance before their own captain have a proper say in whether or not to drop them from the force psyche the vice captain of insane squad was rather against it but his co captain
1043538 his co captain was very firm on it i find that this idea was plausible so i approved the proposal without hesitation
1043539 it was a better filtering system than the one we had before because the previous system was being slightly judgmental
1043540 have you ever imagined what it would be like if during your training stage you were rejected even before your first field duty i dare say your success might come later or at least come in a different form though that might be a good thing imagine if you were rejected after your first duty or even before that what will happen
1043541 i heard youre a waiter before that if you had been rejected you might struggling with money and still be job hunting and chances are you might be wandering from job to job given the countrys policy of hiring mutant not that i see you as the type who drift from job to job
1043542 first of all i would like to apologize to all of you
1043543 you all may be aware that this job is not easy job like myself all of you have your own expectation and i know most of our opinions do not match well at the moment i know how disappointed one can feel when ones reality does not match up to ones expectation everyone here has seen how disappointed i was im sorry for venting my anger on all of you this is my fault on my part like all of you here im still at the process of learning myself learning how to be a better teacher learning how to be a more capable captain learning how to be a more reliable leader and learning how to be a trustable friend im sorry for im ignorant of all your feelings and your expectations truth is i should be grateful to have such an opportunity to learn myself and to guide others but alas i am but a human with his own faults and feelings for my own ignorance i was blinded to your capabilities and talents perhaps this training is not just a learning experience for one side but for both the parties leaders and freshies perhaps these training sessions can see to it that my behavior and wisdom improved and to show my most humble apologies all of you maybe leave work early today again i hope that you guys can forgive me for unkind behavior earlier i cannot promise the anger will not return in the future but i can promise that i will be cooler to handle them in the future
1043544 woah how come i never hear say damn speeches when youre angry at us
1043545 how bout a dinner all of us together just me and you guys its about time that we get to know each other
1043546 the reality of the matter is gold fields wished to move the 2 050 workers from south deep to some other operations such as kloof and beatrix
1043547 it is therefore inaccurate to argue that gold fields intends dismissing employees the num has repeatedly fought and will continue to fight against any form of retrenchment
1043548 all the retrenchments at south deep are completely voluntary 1 885 workers need to be made redundant because the area of the mine at which they are working has been depleted
1043549 gold fields came to an agreement with the unions on july 22 to create a monitoring committee to oversee retrenchments and review each and every application for retrenchment

1043552 our study found that several cm types are used by nearly half of cancer survivors
1043553 surprisingly other methods such as acupuncture and hypnosis were used by fewer than 2 of cancer survivors even though recent studies found them to be useful in relieving some cancer related symptoms such as pain we also found that the use of various cm types is significantly influenced by gender race age education cancer type and how far the cancer had spread
1043554 what the people on the other side are saying and thinking
1043555 will remain for us an example of genuine devotion and selfless serving to the people fatherland and the ideals of freedom justice and humanism
1043556 its not globalization or immigration or computers per se that widen inequality its the skills gap

1043567 the recycled umbrella project came to be because i entered treehuggers ethical fashion show contest two years ago
1043568 i designed a wedding dress for a rainy day which didnt win put in preparation i spent weeks picking through trash cans with the help of friends collecting over 100 umbrellas in the face of necessity i now had a pile of broken umbrellas taking up space in my shop and studio apartment i decided to create something fun hip and wearable out of them the recycled umbrella bomber
1043569 i focus primarily on recycled umbrella wear because it allows me to have a vision and purpose in design it feels bigger than just making trendy disposable clothing walk ten blocks in new york city on a rainy day and count the umbrellas in trash cans and gutters or just littering the sidewalks id be willing to bet my metrocard youll find a dozen thats two bombers
1043570 i decided i no longer wanted to be at the whim of property owners faced with high rent and shackled to a concrete location
1043571 well host an umbrella recycling drive in every city we stop in and turn them into clothing jewelry and art to sell along the way

1043573 of the 18 transport helicopters required by the force not a single one has yet been offered this compares to an estimated 350 such helicopters in use in iraq
1043574 the report identifies more than 20 countries with surplus aircraft that could be made available for the mission
1043575 the six countries best placed to provide transport helicopters italy ukraine india spain romania and the czech republic between them have an estimated 71 helicopters available four times the requirement
1043576 nato member states alone could jointly provide 104 such helicopters almost six times the requirement
1043577 nonprofit organization that creates innovative ways to access nonbiased political information
1043578 if you really think about it the 100 miles per gallon innovation isnt as immediately effective as making a simple switch from a suburban to a civic just do the math if you raise a guzzlers fuel efficiency from 15 miles per gallon to 35 miles per gallon you save almost four gallons per 100 miles but boost a fairly efficient car from 35 mpg to 100 mpg and you save less than two gallons in the same distance more importantly the technology for all cars to reach 35 mpg is already here the same innovations that in the last 30 years have made family cars into muscle cars can be easily deployed to save gas rather than boost performance
1043579 in our islamic culture we have a simple equation whatever the devil does we do the oposite for example since the devil is left handed we eat write and do everything we can with our right hand

1043584 labyrinths are not mazes intended to confuse the walker but a single path that leads to the center and back out again
1043585 that female canaries rarely sing the males sing to court the females i think its a powerful statement about the females self confidence
1043586 its obvious they choose from the available males not the other way around
1043587 and male birds are more colorful than the females proving the females dont feel the need to make themselves stand out with bright colors or beautiful voices
1043588 funny how that behavior doesnt carry over to human females
1043589 the females have no one to blame but themselves if things go sour they pick a guy based on superficial reasons right
1043590 well that cant be dustan that could never actually happen to anyone any minute now ill wake up and none of this will be real

1043598 the science of human behavior particularly the psychology of risk perception robustly shows that we use two systems to make judgments about risk reason and affect facts and feelings it is simply na ve to disregard this inescapable truth and presume that reason and intellect alone will carry the day thats just not how the human animal behaves

1043667 it doesnt matter where the 2020 olympic games are held
1043668 but many of us whove experienced international twenty20 cricket and the ipl are convinced that cricket should bid to become an olympic sport in time for the games
1043669 we have a responsibility to grow our game in new territories and amongst the women of the world
1043670 i believe the olympic games is the vehicle the sport should use to aggressively sell the message of our sport to all 202 competing olympic nations
1043671 so that our sport is strong and robust in countries where it is currently played and exciting and ground breaking in countries who havent yet caught the cricket bug
1043672 with twenty20 cricket here to stay now is the time for the 10 full member nations of the icc to plan for the development of the sport over the next 100 years
1043673 take it from someone who has won almost everything cricket has to offer the olympics is the absolute pinnacle in sport

1043692 at this time of year there should be hundreds and hundreds of adults and fledglings on the rocks diamond says

1043699 the scientific case is now clear that the abolition of set aside is severely harming the environment we applaud the uk government for admitting this and finding the courage to start addressing the problem other eu member states governments should follow the example and the eu council must adopt similar measures across the eu when it discusses the cap health check in the autumn

1043728 la autoridad de las personas no est basada en la sujeci n y abdicaci n de la raz n sino en un acto de reconocimiento y conocimiento que el otro es superior a uno en juicio y visi n insight y por esta raz n su juicio toma precedencia esto es tiene prioridad sobre el juicio propio
1043729 autoridad en este sentido propiamente entendida no tiene nada que ver con obediencia a las rdenes en efecto la autoridad correctamente entendida tiene que ver no con la obediencia sino m s bien con el conocimiento
1043730 la distinci n de la ilustraci n entre la fe en la autoridad y el uso que uno hace de la raz n es en s misma leg tima si el prestigio de la autoridad reemplaza el juicio propio entonces la autoridad es de hecho una fuente de prejuicios pero esto no excluye que sea una fuente de verdad y esto es lo que la ilustraci n no percibi cuando denigr toda autoridad

1043748 fujitsu advanced technologies ltd is pleased to see that easic is delivering a 45nm product
1043749 this new asic is able to deliver the right combination of performance power and price combined with low up front cost we find the power reduction especially important as we look to add more functionality to our world class ict infrastructure products
1043750 gartner has tracked asic design starts for years and the trend has been unmistakable downward to the right
1043751 leading edge asic design costs have risen to the point where many small to medium sized companies have no choice but to use fpgas new approaches are being developed that lower asic design costs and have the potential to bring the benefits of asics back to the masses
1043752 judging from the magnetic draw we are seeing from the market we are confident that fpga designers asic designers and semiconductor companies will find nextreme 2 to be an irresistible platform for their new designs
1043753 the new asic era of high performance low power and dramatic cost reduction with fast time to market is just beginning and we are already driving a reversal in the trend of declining design starts
1043754 commagilitys amc d4f1 was chosen because it provides superior processing power and density commagility delivered working product quickly enabling our development to start early it combines technical excellence with speed of development for example it was the first subsystem vendor to support tis new 1 2 ghz c6455 dsp commagility has also consistently provided excellent technical support from day one of our engagement with them
1043755 commagility is quickly becoming a leading provider of wireless advancedmc modules with their tms320c6455 tms320tci6482 and tms320tci6487 processor based products
1043756 this current design win is a key endorsement of their capabilities in the wireless test and measurement arena
1043757 aeroflex is an established user of cots boards based on embedded standards to enable the fast development of complex leading edge systems and the tm500 lte is the latest example this approach has helped it cut time to market for its products and focus its development effort on applications for its customers
1043758 the markets will interpret this negatively even if the fed does tolerate it its going to increasingly put a bit of uncertainty into the situation unless the fed they can spin it whats the spin on this going to be it creates another element of uncertainty on the market
1043759 that number was pretty high the year over year 4 1 percent number i really think that number is what the fed is probably going to take a look at the core was up a bit its certainly not good news for the inflation picture but i think the fed is locked between a very slow economy with this rising inflation environment i cant imagine they would do anything based on this number or based on future inflationary numbers because the economy is so weak
1043760 the treasury market right now is going to be driven by people involved in the auctions looking for an excuse to cheapen things up so the focus seems to be on the inflation side of the data which was firm
1043761 the consumer is in really bad shape but that is being masked by the inflation story which dealers are focusing on so they can get these auctions done
1043762 it was better than expected but its not great data it doesnt show a real lot of strength so the market was little changed which is an appropriate response i dont think theres that much to cheer about
1043763 troubles with the financial sector the economy the u s consumer theres no quick fix markets are adjusting to that many have hoped wed see the bottom of a v shaped decline but i think theres now a realization that its going to be more like an l in terms of economic growth
1043764 were all friends here and the passwords portland whats the matter
1043765 i hate talking to a man when hes shaving i dont want to have you cutting your head off
1043766 dont worry about me this is a safety razor and anyhow whats the excitement going to make my flesh creep
1043767 then whenever there was a rag on and a bonner in the quad you always knew you could help yourself to my chairs
1043768 you know what i mean what do you think i came here for to play cricket rot id much rather have gone on tour with the authentics i came here to propose to dolly burn
1043769 you oughtnt to have noticed a thing like that it oughtnt to matter to you what i call her i always think of her as dolly
1043770 dont be a fool there are some things one cant bet on as you ought to have known
1043771 this thing has got to be settled you say im trying to cut you out i like that we may fairly describe that as rich as if my love were the same sort of passing fancy that yours is you know you fall in love as you call it with every girl you meet
1043772 very well if the subject is painful we wont discuss it still how about that girl you used to rave about last summer ethel something
1043773 a mere platonic friendship we both collected autographs and if it comes to that how about dora thingummy you had enough to say about her last winter
1043774 we were on good terms nothing more she always sliced with her brassy so did i it formed a sort of bond
1043775 i dont see the point of all this why rake up the past you arent writing my life
1043776 well to drop that what do you propose to do about this youre a good chap tom when you arent making an ass of yourself but im hanged if im going to have you interfering between me and dolly
1043777 cards on the table ive loved her since last commem
1043778 we went up the char together in a canader alone
1043779 she gave me a couple of dances at the oriel ball
1043780 so she did me she said my dancing was so much better than the average young mans
1043781 she told me i must have had a great deal of practice at waltzing
1043782 we must agree on something or we shall both get left all were doing now is to confuse the poor girl she evidently likes us both the same what i mean is were both so alike that she cant possibly make a choice unless one of us chucks it you dont feel like chucking it dick what
1043783 you neednt be more of an idiot than you can help
1043784 i only asked so we are evidently both determined to stick to it we shall have to toss then to settle which is to back out and give the other man a show
1043785 but we must do something you wont back out like a sensible man we must settle it somehow
1043786 ive got it we both seem to have come here and let ourselves in for this rotten little village match on a wicket which will probably be all holes and hillocks simply for dollys sake so its only right that we should let the match decide this thing for us it wont be so cold blooded as tossing see
1043787 whichever of us makes the bigger score today wins the loser has to keep absolutely off the grass not so much as a look or a remark about the weather then of course after the winner has had his innings if he hasnt brought the thing off and she has chucked him the loser can have a look in but not a moment before understand
1043788 theres one objection you being a stodgy sort of bat and having a habit of sitting on the splice always get put in first im a hitter so they generally shove me in about fourth wicket in this sort of match the man who goes in fourth wicket is likely to be not out half a dozen at the end of the innings nobody stays in more than three balls whereas you going in first will have time for a decent knock before the rot starts follow
1043789 i shant need it well see drew after breakfast and get him to put us both in first
1043790 that i want the bowling broken a bit before you go in then your free aggressive style would have a better chance i was thinking of putting you in fourth wicket would not that suit you
1043791 youll regard what im going to say as said under seal of the confessional and that sort of thing wont you
1043792 i shall of course respect any confidence you impart to me my dear henley what is this dreadful secret
1043793 is such a contest quite is it not a little um
1043794 we must settle the thing somehow and neither of us will back out if we didnt do this we should have to toss
1043795 well is it a deal will you put us in first
1043796 would you mind taking first b b ball old man
1043797 just one solitary single miss burn may i call you dolly do you remember that moonlight night on the char in my canadian canoe we two
1043798 i know all about that why i could hear the click from where i was sitting the point is whats to be done now we shall have to settle it on the second innings
1043799 oh therell be a second innings all right theres another man out on a wicket like this we shall all be out in an hour and well have the other side out in another hour and then well start again on this business i shall play a big game next innings it was only that infernal ball shooting that did me
1043800 if the umpire has got over his fit of delirium tremens or been removed to colney hatch shall almost certainly make a century
1043801 were in precisely the same hole as we were before
1043802 i didnt tell you before for fear it should put you off your game but miss burn is engaged already and has been for three days
1043803 household consumption surged in june but much of that went to purchase higher priced food and energy
1043804 troubles with the financial sector the economy the u s consumer theres no quick fix
1043805 it means there is some inflation leaking into the system and it puts the fed in a difficult position
1043806 but given the weakness of the economy it means theyre going to have to tolerate more inflation than they like
1043807 the combination of limos transparent governance model balanced development model and extensive mobile industry heritage sets it apart and has garnered strong industry support and engagement this next wave of limo handsets points to the innovation that will flow as the industry coalesces on the limo platform

1043809 all indications are that there was no release of radioactivity to the environment further monitoring around the laboratory will be undertaken
1043810 this pressure build up of toxic gases that plutonium produces could have happened in the most modern lab as well
1043811 the laboratory is equipped with multiple safety systems including an air filtering system to prevent the release of radioactivity to the environment

1043818 la verdad es que van a vivir en la capital china una experiencia sin igual los deportistas chilenos han dado lo mejor de s y en ese sentido uno puede decir que ya han dado un paso muy sustantivo han dedicado a os de esfuerzo con mucho sacrificio para ellos y sus familias y han salido adelante
1043819 es cierto que es importante competir pero tambi n hay que ponerse metas altas hay que tratar de ganar y eso implica seguir el camino que abrieron el atleta manuel plaza el equitador scar cristo la atleta marlen arens los boxeadores ram n tapia claudio barrientos y carlos lucas el equipo de f tbol que encabez iv n zamorano en sydney y c mo olvidarlo nuestros tenistas fernando gonz lez y nicol s mass que consiguieron el oro en atenas
1043820 es un bonito desaf o que nos pone la presidenta en eso estamos trabajando y espero que podamos tener resultados conforme al trabajo y a la dedicaci n que han tenido los deportistas
1043821 what role could the fed have played in 2006 2007 from some regulatory standpoint in the financial system
1043822 how about saying things like wait a minute the assumptions underlying subprime securitization are completely wrong
1043823 the existence of liquidity facilities at the central bank can undermine normal incentives for maintaining liquidity buffers and the more extensive the access the greater the degree to which market discipline will be loosened and prudential regulation will need to be tightened
1043824 because his framework had to do with the great depression had to do with channels outside money supply and interest rates in this sense he was perfectly suited to do this
1043825 si la directiva de mi partido cree que hay que pasarme al tribunal supremo por apoyar buenos candidatos bueno asumiremos ese mal rato innecesario mientras otros se dedican a la cacer a de brujas yo ocupar mis energ as en tratar de hacer la mejor campa a posible con los mejores candidatos que son como en todo democracia aquellos que cuentan con m s respaldo entre la gente
1043826 al candidato que la dc inscribi a ltimo no lo conozco pero creo que considerando que la vez pasada ni siquiera fue candidato creo que objetivamente las mejores opciones las tiene guti rrez

1043829 a m me gustar a que con esa misma energ a con que algunos como burgos pontifican sobre quienes deben estar o no en la concertaci n cuando ni siquiera le ganan a la derecha en sus distritos hicieran respetar acuerdos escritos y firmados por dirigentes y parlamentarios de sus partidos ratificados ante notario y publicados en la prensa comprometi ndose a realizar primarias para decidir sobre las mejores opciones alcaldicias

1043839 ajax enabled pages provide a slick responsive user experience making web based applications function more like desktop based ones
1043840 the ajax engine allows the users interaction with the application to happen asynchronously independent of communication with the server
1043841 asp net ajax is a set of technologies to add ajax asynchronous javascript and xml support to asp net it consists of a client side script framework server controls and more
1043842 although ajax is essentially a client side technique most of its real world deployments call for server side processing
1043843 the framework includes two distinct yet not mutually exclusive apis client and server which enable the developers to accomplish ajax functionalities using direct client side programming traditional server side programming or any combination of both
1043844 the asp net ajax control toolkit provides a set of sample controls and extenders that makes it a snap to spice up your web site with rich functionality
1043845 many are unaware that uitm is the first institution in the country to offer furniture design so it is not surprising that only 13 per cent of course graduates work in the furniture manufacturing sector
1043846 i observe that most bumiputera products are unsuitable to market needs due to the lack of market research bumiputera involvement in furniture export is also low
1043847 there is market potential in south america india africa and the middle east we have also been to dhaka and there is a big opportunity to market our products there
1043848 they shouted that they will kill us all and chanted in tamil you all have overthrown samy vellu

1043850 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1043851 after all it was senator obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election

1043854 we have many visitors at the resorts during the peak season and this presents us with a good opportunity to get the message across as most of the guests are environment conscious
1043855 its also a good way to remind visitors that terengganu was once referred to as the turtle state
1043856 they have always wanted to be a part of turtle conservation but did not know how to approach it thats why they were enthusiastic about taking part in the campaign
1043857 if possible i want to extend this campaign to resorts outside terengganu
1043858 a new system should be created before we leave the old one which is no longer credible or efficient as a menteri besars job is not to sign letters or give approvals
1043859 i am not a menteri besar who is appointed to just sign letters i want to work using my brain
1043860 the system has caused delays in the application process made developers incur losses and increased workload as there are more files and records to keep

1043866 so how do you find out more about ajax and how it interacts with the system

1043869 our project seeks to deliver electric power that is not only reliable but also compatible with a natural environment in harmony with people and animals
1043870 although the electricity grid has been designed for a one way transfer of power from central station generators to consumers with the distributed generation system being developed at the zoo using on site renewable energy sources such as photovoltaics the grid
1043871 this partnership offers a great opportunity for the zoo to lead by example by developing and testing a renewable solar energy system we hope to reduce the impact on the environment by conserving conventional power

1043886 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to this song is not only outrageously offensive to senator clinton reverend jackson senator mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
1043887 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death
1043888 we are in a position to have a dialogue about more

1043893 on this card a well to do gentleman is tossing a few coins to a beggar while another supplicant waits to the side the giver holds the scales of justice as if claiming the
1043894 in this picture we see both sides what it means to give and to receive to dominate and to submit to be on top and to be on the bottom it seems clear who has and who hasnt but is it life is not that simple and how quickly fortunes change
1043895 asks you to look very deeply into the whole issue of what having really means both materially resources and immaterially knowledge power love you may see yourself on one side or the other but this card asks you to reconsider think of the successful businessman who suddenly declares bankruptcy the tyrannical invalid who dominates through weakness the teacher who learns from her students the parent who controls by giving money
1043896 you will get the gift you want you will have to defer to another in all cases though you should question the obvious and go deeper why are you in the situation youre in and where is it leading who is really in charge whats really going on
1043897 we agreed that in the absence of a positive response we have no choice but to pursue further measures
1043898 we are disappointed that we have not yet received a response from iran as requested in geneva on july 19
1043899 they also emphasized that preserving this path talks needs a positive and constructive atmosphere
1043900 if its in 16 days instead of 14 its not a problem we are not obsessed with a date
1043901 no enemy vessels would be able to escape it within a 300 kilometre radius from the borders of iran

1043909 overall this is a great situation and i love playing for wade phillips
1043910 hes treating me as a human being its all about respecting me as a man and treating me as a man period ill play hard no matter what the situation but when you have a head coach who treats you like that youll go above and beyond
1043911 i didnt make a big deal out of it you just chalk it up for what it is
1043912 honestly of all the head coaches ive had i can definitely say yeah this is by far the most respect ive ever been given
1043913 mooch mariucci i felt showed favoritism toward the quarterback in certain situations in philly it was a battle from the start ive been wearing spandex in practice my whole career and right away he wants me to wear shorts i guess they tried to throw their authority around
1043914 its probably like one of the worst experiences that ive had i didnt show it but it was hard but i dealt with it
1043915 look its not just me youve heard so many comments about how this team is much different under this coach and how weve responded to him im not alone trust me overall this is a great situation
1043916 i personally dont think parcells used him in a way where we could win more ballgames
1043917 you could see that in seattle they had guys off the street playing corner and we didnt even go after them i dont think parcells couldve been any worse for t o in order to get respect youve got to give it wade gives him a lot of respect as he should he hasnt done anything not to deserve it
1043918 oh yeah from when he first got here things are completely different
1043919 he used to get by with his sheer athletic ability but now hes concentrating on running excellent routes and being a complete receiver some of that was because terry glenn was here and he was a playmaker too it was equal opportunity and if he wanted to get more balls he had to step it up
1043920 hes a real positive teammate and hes a real plus from the leadership standpoint of the team hes in the best shape hes been since hes been here and he still has his gear and with the type of player he is someone who doesnt rely on blinding speed or quick cuts to get his edge im not worried about a dropoff
1043921 theyre asking for it they stepped up to go first in this drill and line up against each other and what it does is it lifts everybody else up when people see the way they want to compete they raise their level of competition and pretty soon you get what you had when michael irvin was here
1043922 through a lot of repetitions theyre on the same page theyre so connected its starting to look like troy aikman irvin
1043923 its just that now weve been through so many together and he cares about everyone around here and is totally invested in what were all trying to do
1043924 hes done a tremendous job for us one of the things i learned playing here in the 90s was this when your marquee players are the hardest workers it sets the tone for the entire group as a coach its great when you can say watch 81 run this route and know that everyone else will aspire to that standard
1043925 so am i ive worked very very hard for this we all have
1043926 hes never been in a fight and would never hurt anybody ever
1043927 hed only have one article of clothing on him and hed give it to you if you asked
1043928 i just want people to remember him as a good guy he lived life to the fullest
1043929 in that situation i had to believe he was trying to hit me even with the bases loaded
1043930 we were leading by six runs they come inside hard three times that is the team that has hit me three times already it seemed so obvious to me
1043931 i hope not but if its coming i need to take it because i charged the pitcher
1043932 im a man i take my consequences i know what i did i think i did the right thing
1043933 i wonder why a guy plate umpire tim timmons thought we were going to hit the guy with the bases loaded with a pitch in on the hands this is my 20 something year in the big leagues and i still dont understand what common sense they have when they make those decisions
1043934 im not going to bring a guy in that throws 85 miles an hour to hit somebody i guarantee it ill bring octavio dotel ill bring matt thornton then i will tell them to throw at them thats the way i do business
1043935 i came in and im trying to get a double play ball
1043936 i threw him my sinker in to try to get him to get a ground ball out of that and it got away from me i went to pick up the ball and hes charging at me
1043937 i was just standing on the mound and the umpire came up to me and said youre out of here they might think there is something stemming from before but i didnt think i was being thrown out of the game obviously they thought differently and they make the call
1043938 we dont play like that ozzie doesnt play like that this team doesnt play like that
1043939 o cr dito para as grandes empresas t m crescido acima das nossas expectativas existe ainda uma demanda forte e n s vemos que as grandes est o desengavetando projetos

1043946 we always used to watch the olympics as a family growing up
1043947 now even though the dream changed a little bit its been kind of bigger than i expected in a way because this story has caught the world by storm im wondering why this girl from south dakota got caught up in this worldwide story
1043948 i need to learn the language im working on it ive only been over there for a year or two and its a difficult language i know a few words but i need to get a lot more words most of the girls speak english so its fine
1043949 if people really do have a hard time with it they should take it up with the olympic committee or fiba im playing well within the rules and i think its a little strange it happens all the time in the olympics for people to get maybe upset or bent out of shape about me is strange because this is something the united states has done many times
1043950 there have been many foreign athletes that have come and competed for the u s and won medals
1043951 i think everyone wants to see the russia america matchup
1043952 if i have to play the united states obviously im going to go out there and compete to win but thats not what i want i know its what everyone else wants but its not what i want
1043953 once the ball went up it was just another basketball game
1043954 you want to meet the u s as late as possible
1043955 i have been playing against those players for 10 years i think when the ball goes up its just going to be another basketball game you just go out there and compete and enjoy the moment since its not going to happen again
1043956 this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and im really looking forward to it
1043957 im glad im not doing as many interviews now just being able to be here and play basketball i think its been put off in the back of my mind for so long just concentrating on what weve been doing in the wnba and now is the first time ive been able to be over here and enjoy the experience
1043958 id love to go watch even if were not taking part in it i hear its pretty tremendous
1043959 im still learning most of the girls on the team three or four of them ive already played with and i have a history with them they are really a good group of girls they are really sweet they have made me feel very welcome and tried to get me accustomed to them very quickly and build chemistry on and off the court

1043985 we are surprised by what has happened these players have been asked to play for their national teams
1043986 twenty years ago we made the decision that the olympic games should be for players under 23 we have never had a complaint or put into question the automatic qualification of under 23 players
1043987 let the players play the players are the actors without the players there is no spectacle
1043988 its not only a question of solidarity but of respect for the olympic spirit and to let such young players have the experience

1043992 i cannot understand how an argentine player who has been in pre selection for the olympic squad and has played in the

1044000 this tournament has elevated the sport of tennis in the countrys heartland while providing significant contributions to community causes this is a legacy we look forward to building upon
1044001 i am upset over the plans or risks to close off rivington and it begs the question what can we do said brian cook who has raised more than 1million with help from an enthusiastic local community for a new development
1044002 were currently scoping another site in essex and working painstakingly with the federation on that
1044003 its the same process that goes on pretty much for all our venues we have to sign them all off with the international federation both in scope and in scale
1044004 weve got two things in mind win gold and get softball in peoples minds
1044005 there are 128 countries that play the sport it is important the ioc sees that
1044006 we can prove softball should remain in the olympics if we just go out and play to the best of our ability and win
1044007 the biggest thing we can do is show them the best softball they have ever seen
1044008 to me thats disrespectful that they would remove a sport without knowing about it
1044009 thats where i think the ioc needs to do us right we dont take steroids were not turning down the olympics to make millions of dollars
1044010 my challenge is to get the ioc to come and watch a game look these girls in the eye and tell me this sport should be taken from the olympics
1044011 interest in the game is at an all time high
1044012 more for outside the us its important for dreams of girls in places like beijing as a world class stage to prove we belong
1044013 im amazed at what i have accomplished i must thank my sister yih mei for forcing me into the pool when i was young
1044014 believe me there was a time when i thought this would never happen when i was young i wasnt always up for what i would call constructive activity
1044015 my earliest memories of swimming are that i hated it i was one of those lazy people
1044016 i was five or six years old and id be in the pool thinking hey i could be home playing counter strike a computer game right now so i had what you would call a bad attitude
1044017 i wouldnt come out i would be in the shower for an hour i just didnt want to be out there
1044018 during this period my parents wanted me to venture into a different sport but i let them know that i was uninterested
1044019 however my liking to the pool grew when my sister started winning state level competitions
1044020 i must credit my coach lewin lim then for making swimming fun for me he taught me the basics of swimming and i begin to value training and now im reaping the seeds of my labour
1044021 i have been under intensive training under national coach paul thomas birmingham at the national aquatic centre in bukit jalil im training hard as im determined to break my own national record in beijing
1044022 i plan to do well in my exams im rather undecided whether to continue swimming or concentrate on my studies in the future
1044023 however that is a decision i will make later as my focus now is on the olympics
1044024 her babies are cute eventhough they are light racial lightskined etc
1044025 im sad this incident happened because it interrupted a beautiful and loving party im happy none of my people or friends got hurt and the party continues
1044026 ummh chile i want to suck you like a neck bone
1044027 they speedo international have promised to get one swimsuit each for our five swimmers and deliver them when we reach beijing but we will keep our fingers crossed and hope the swimsuits will be delivered in time
1044028 but if we cant get them then we will have to settle for other swimsuits
1044029 we were suffering from poor form when we lost to sakamoto ikeda the japanesewon then not because they were better but because we were slow and hasty
1044030 however the olympics is a different ball game altogether as all pairs will be 100 per cent focused and determined and we need to start playing in our best possible form right from the first round
1044031 we cannot afford a bad day in beijing i believe our form has improved tremendously and as for me im going to get aggressive and play hard in every match
1044032 we cannot put unnecessary pressure on ourselves the best policy is to think about our opening match fir st
1044033 overall i would say this has been our best preparation the athletes have been granted their every request when it comes to training and tournaments
1044034 bam is very confident that the shuttlers will win a medal or medals for thatmatter and the recent draw gives them a fighting chance to achieve their objective
1044035 lee chong wei is injury free and in ideal condition while the other players have also been gearing up well
1044036 we dont expect other sports to deliver medals but they are getting better
1044037 we will witness some quality performance from them and some may even come to winning medals
1044038 hell just be a little tropical storm tike compared to big mammas that rip things up and spike gas prices
1044039 were on the water right now just putting on extra lines in case it comes up
1044040 its not going to be a huge issue for anybody in this area

1044053 if were going to spend this kind of money id like to see a little more return on our investment
1044054 building a new building on the current site wont help the community nearly as much as a new combination library could
1044055 whats important to me are things that will strongly help the village move forward
1044056 the opportunity to make a brand new community center does nothing but enhance this village
1044057 id like to see if we can find a way to partner to find a north side solution
1044058 the library is one of the most heavily used buildings in the community
1044059 its an important resource especially for people of modest means expansion is the way we need to go
1044060 we are disappointed that we have not yet received a response from iran
1044061 we agreed in the absence of a clear positive response from iran that we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran
1044062 the incentives package contained everything iran needed to pursue a modern civil nuclear power program which irans leaders claim is their aim the pressure on iran to comply with the demands of the international community and its u n security council obligations will only grow
1044063 but to begin again to prepare sanctions resolutions for the u n security council

1044066 last night everything came together and i am now moving to real madrid
1044067 i have always wanted to move to spain because i have a strong bond with that country
1044068 now im going to play for real madrid its a dream come true tomorrow afternoon i will be presented
1044069 whoa you have a lot of follicles growing this is an iui cycle right
1044070 oh youre going to get much worse before you get better with all of those eggs
1044071 i found the course playing a little easy it helped having preferred lie on the closely mown areas although the course played long the fairways were wide which allowed me to hit strategic spots from the tee box
1044072 now that we are in the semi finals we have to maintain our momentum it doesnt matter who our opponents are as we are prepared
1044073 after this all teams are the same so i think we will be ok
1044074 were both low key and keep to ourselves i think were both level headed and i think thats huge because guys get fired up and then they try to pound the ball into the sand
1044075 everybody is improving and getting better and so are we the game is at a higher level now and were getting challenges from all over the place
1044076 they are hard working they have the passion and the drive
1044077 the increasing number of foreign airlines which outsource their aircraft to us is a testimony of our success in this field
1044078 part of the comfort level or the confidence that states need to bring to the international system is that their judicial systems are indeed responsive to rule of law and are transparent and fair
1044079 the junior team have just returned from the asia cup in hyderabad india and we do not know if any of them are injured or unable to play in the razak cup
1044080 that is why muralee will select his 18 players soon and release the others to play for their respective states
1044081 the rules are still the same all players must represent the state they were born in and if any player wishes to represent another state he must get a release letter to be eligible
1044082 our main priority of sending bowlers for high level competitions is for them to gain exposure before next years womens world meet
1044083 it will be a bonus if shalin and esther can go one step further by making the womens series cut
1044084 kwame is a player that gives us depth at the center position and we feel that he will have an opportunity to grow within our system
1044085 he clocks incredible times when i measure them with a stop watch
1044086 he seems to go faster than two minutes seven seconds in the 200 metres we want to aim for the gold and a world record in the first event 100m
1044087 we want to crack world records in both 100m and 200m
1044088 i think it is a kind of pool where you cannot win with a mediocre time
1044089 the sun keeps on appearing and disappearing leaving us in a cloudy mood
1044090 but it has nothing to do with the competition and the site is really clean
1044091 there is unrest in the forest there is trouble with the trees for the maples want more sunlight and the oaks ignore their pleas
1044092 the trouble with the maples and theyre quite convinced theyre right they say the oaks are just too lofty and they grab up all the light but the oaks cant help their feelings if they like the way theyre made and they wonder why the maples cant be happy in their shade
1044093 there is trouble in the forest and the creatures all have fled as the maples scream oppression and the oaks just shake their heads
1044094 so the maples formed a union and demanded equal rights the oaks are just too greedy we will make them give us light now theres no more oak oppression for they passed a noble law and the trees are all kept equal by hatchet axe and saw
1044095 this years competition was very close and we had to work extra hard to ensure the title came back to malaysia
1044096 i am really grateful and proud of the performance of every pilot this time the challenge from the europeans was a lot stronger
1044097 accelerometers to measure both speed and orientation which led to autopilots in airplanes navigation for apollo moon landings and guidance for submarine missiles
1044098 one of the biggest issues in drug development is liver toxicity polizzotto said experimental drugs require extensive clinical trials on animals and humans to measure side effects particularly on the liver
1044099 we can skip the animal tests and go right to your liver polizzotto said
1044100 we can take a tiny piece of your liver grow that in a dish and make a drug thats perfect for you this can absolutely lead the way for personalized medicine
1044101 they are an up and coming university there is great research an engineering department that is growing all those hospitals doing all those clinical trials
1044102 if we can get draper engineers in the same buildings and work side by side with their engineers said center director daniel lim
1044103 the tomato outbreak took several weeks to identify what caused it and where it came from lim said
1044104 if they had more rapid ways to detect bacteria within a few hours we wouldnt have to worry about tainted tomatoes or spinach going out to the public
1044105 folks here are very excited by it said progress energy spokeswoman cherie jacobs
1044106 it could be plug in vehicles or smart grids whatever they need
1044107 multichip modules minute computers known as mcms that cost 2 000 to 15 000 apiece
1044108 we have exceeded our capacity to make them russell said
1044109 as we were talking to the florida folks we said lets do that there too
1044110 any landing you walk away from is a good one
1044111 its exciting to be in hong kong as were getting closer to the olympics and i expect to be fully match fit by then
1044112 i think it will be quite open as every team playing there has a good chance
1044113 most have done their bit during their holidays but others have been flat on their backs for a few weeks that was the outcome of the tests we did with the players they werent all positive results
1044114 for this tournament you must be totally fit and healthy otherwise youll fall through after five seconds
1044115 at the olympics our objective is to reach the quarter finals the team have been playing good attacking football and the players are finding each other very well when pushing forward
1044116 we only had a light workout as i wanted to just give the players a feel of the pitch
1044117 the players must not lose the ball easily as we will be up against a world class team
1044118 you can feel the strength chelsea have but our players musnt be discouraged our focus should be on playing to our best
1044119 we are preparing for the asean championship and thats what matters most we should keep working no matter what happens tonight and hope that with the commitment shown by the players we can do something in december
1044120 i will be playing here in macau and in shanghai preparing myself to get ready for beijing
1044121 they arrived last year in three finals thats very good for me
1044122 we have four competitions and i will try to win four competitions and the players are the same
1044123 it will be very difficult but we have the team and the players for this chelsea have given me everything i want
1044124 i now have some idea but i need to be with them for more training to finish this tour and then i will have my ideas for the team to play portsmouth on aug 17
1044125 i have a minimum of 75 per cent of the team in my mind
1044126 eleven goals in two games is a stepping stone and i think the match on tuesday today will be more difficult than the last and then the russian team knows everything about us
1044127 it is then that i will know whether this team are ready but my team are growing up and they are more free in the field now
1044128 we are working very hard to return the game to the programme in 2016 even in london if we can
1044129 we feel confident that we can present to the ioc and the programme commission reasons for baseballs inclusion
1044130 our sport has not chosen to shut down to make this possible i think there are people trying to come up with an answer for that
1044131 if some of these smart guys can come up with a way to get these major league guys without stopping the season we can have a chance to go forward
1044132 the best thing we can do is put on a great show at the olympics with great enthusiasm and go about it in a way that makes people want that in 2012 and 2016 and going forward
1044133 cuba is blesed with a lot of great young talent
1044134 japan has come a long way korea taiwan and now china they have the fever with the great athletes they have it wont be long until they have great players
1044135 there was a lot of pressure for us to bring back the us to where we belong on top
1044136 you cant afford to make a mistake in selecting the team the level of competition is too good around the world
1044137 i came to watch the band which was promoting its album
1044138 i am just a driver someone else was supposed to bring them but when the other person did not turn up i became the substitute driver
1044139 there is a conspiracy to do us in why they see us as a threat
1044140 people all have inhibitions and hate them we just ignore them every man wants to chase a pretty girl if he sees one he doesnt i do most people at some time want to throw things around recklessly they dont but we do were sort of a safety valve through which people can blow off steam
1044141 the democrats have used this quite dishonestly to get at the current government
1044142 this of course is a very dangerous game a troop buildup is a very dangerous game its a very stupid way for thailand to deal with an important neighbour
1044143 the dark side of nationalism is as dangerous as ever
1044144 is a continued violation of thailands sovereignty and territorial integrity
1044145 the preah vihear temple is part of a wounded history of thailand and cambodia
1044146 we want to put a stop to all this malay bashing the ideology of a malaysian malaysia and all this racialist talk
1044147 the yang di pertuan agong is the protector of the special position of the malays whatever the results of a general election this special position will not be affected
1044148 the king has the power to choose whom he views can command the confidence of the dewan rakyat
1044149 it is because there is more talk about the special privileges and there may come a time where even though they are in the constitution there may be people who want to ram into them
1044150 they have mistakenly associated the welfare of the malays with umno and thats why there is all this talk about a crisis so if umno does not do well in the elections they interpret this as the malays being threatened
1044151 it was not the malays that lost out in the election it was umno
1044152 malays are actually asking what has umno really done for them despite being in power for the past 50 years the largest segment of the poor are still the malays
1044153 whether the malays will subscribe to a politics of enthnocentric dominance or something more inclusive
1044154 against a basket of currencies the dollar has fallen by 25 per cent since 2003 and considerably more since its peak in 2001
1044155 if a writer of prose knows enough about what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader if the writer is writing truly enough will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them the dignity of movement of an iceberg is due to only one eighth of it being above water
1044156 how i learned to stop worrying and love bobby kennedy
1044157 in this difficult time for the united states its perhaps well to ask what kind of a nation we are and what direction we want to move in
1044158 we can move in that direction as a country in greater polarisation black people among blacks and white among whites filled with hatred towards one another
1044159 or we can make an effort as king did to understand and to comprehend and replace that violence that stain of bloodshed that has spread across our land with an effort to understand compassion and love

1044167 if the government had more justice we would receive more care from them
1044168 impunity has always been the root cause of this kind of alienation and anger
1044169 all thats important for the radicalisation and recruitment of insurgents
1044170 feel that theyve been physically abused by the government so they suddenly turn a blind eye to whatever insurgents want to do
1044171 i want more justice why dont they try to find some suspects
1044172 the shooting was not done by the army but by separatists dressed as soldiers to cause hatred of the authorities
1044173 we try to find out the facts from both sides to stop violence and misunderstanding

1044207 the fact that this computer is acknowledged as coming from anti islamic republic iranian terrorists the mek and the fact that a proper forensic investigation would probably demonstrate the fabricated nature of the data contained are why the u s government will never agree to such an investigation being done

1044227 a majority of our members around the world feel that the beijing olympic games will do much to intensify chinese development and enhance beijings image as a development hot spot
1044228 beijing will soon join sydney atlanta and athens as economic development laboratories for vancouver london and sochi russia as these cities join an elite group of olympic hosts poised to benefit from one of the worlds greatest development spectacles
1044229 however some of the best firms to work for have turnover rates significantly lower than that so bringing that number down is certainly possible and that doesnt happen by accident driving down your firms turnover rate is a result of strategic investments and initiatives with the goal of becoming one of the premier employers in the industry
1044230 while a well structured employee survey is extremely valuable firms must be prepared to take action on this information if employees sense that their sincere and candid feedback has gone to a file never to be seen again the end result could be an overwhelming sentiment of skepticism and cynicism among the staff
1044231 make the investment of time resources and money to address the key issues that have come to light and communicate what the changes are why they are being made and how they will impact the employees this action signals a strong commitment to being a great place to work

1044240 compared with men in urban areas rural dwellers are more likely to be ignorant of disease symptoms and they more often worry about having surgery should they be diagnosed
1044241 as in any disease early detection and treatment will reduce the risks of complications men should know the importance of prostate specific antigen screening
1044242 we will provide free screening for those living in pahang which was chosen because its closer to us and easier to organise
1044243 quite a number of those with the disease had never been treated we want to know exactly how many fall into this category
1044244 for those with a family history of the cancer it can strike at younger ages if you have urinary problems its best to go for a screening
1044245 it is a relentlessly terrifying descent into madness and all things forbidden
1044246 weve got some wonderful performances and marvellous actors its a complex take of a man giving in to evil a choice all of us sometimes make
1044247 in developing the script clive and i were driven to create a new personification of horror
1044248 i have scrap books on such films and figurines of michael myers freddie krueger jason voorhees leatherface pinhead ash from evil dead all characters from the 80s the likes of which we havent seen since
1044249 i knew that if i play it right i can can become a legend
1044250 im a fan of horror movies even though it scares me watching them
1044251 we want people to understand the current local film industry and how it can be upgraded by having discussions and getting feedback
1044252 i suggested the first topic i thought it would be interesting to discuss aspects of the industry that people are not very familiar with such as money and financing from the perspective of film producers and using information and communication technology for filming
1044253 the panellists come from various fields and their opinions can make an impact on the film industry
1044254 i think you guys are in for a surprise for now all i can say is were going to have a good fun rock show
1044255 when you get up pretty much every single day in a tour bus and airplanes with guys its kinda like a summer camp you get to know them like brothers well be on the next record and were all writing for it it will be great
1044256 from the beginning chris was the one who has always wanted a band he didnt want to be chris daughtry the solo artiste so here we are
1044257 were just a rock band with good melodies good hooks it might get a little bit heavier at times but still its going to be a lot of fun to rock
1044258 i dont think any of us thought that we would be even nominated in a grammy for a new artiste and a first album its been tremendously amazing
1044259 we just love to play and we have written so many songs were just excited to get it out weve been touring for the last three years we just love doing what were doing and were not rushing to release our second album until its done
1044260 the coolest thing about bon jovi is that they still love doing what they do i dont know if there is any kind of amazing luxurious racy rock star qualities that ive gotten from them but i do hope to be around as long as they have
1044261 its a sacrifice doing this and that is the number one thing that we all feel but we love what we do and its worth it to us a lot of people see us a lot more on tv and videos before you wouldnt necessarily get recognised anywhere so its kind of cool
1044262 in children below five years old diseases that are transmitted through unhygienic conditions can be fatal if these communities are not taught about proper sanitation we might not be able to reduce the mortality rates
1044263 hand hygiene remains a pre requisite for preventing the transmission of disease
1044264 it is so easy to stop the spread of germs and infectious diseases by washing your hands while many of us do make the effort to ensure hand hygiene there are also others who take it lightly
1044265 we should no longer think of hand hygiene as insignificant

1044305 we believe mr jha has a proven operating execution history and see this as positive for motorola

1044359 to put this on par with any of the human rights issues is an absolute insult to the integrity of the people who fought and went through the human rights movement

1044403 you wont hear me say this too often but i couldnt agree more with the explanation that senator mccain offered a few weeks ago
1044404 what senator mccain neglected to mention was that during those thirty years he was in washington for twenty six of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil he voted against increased fuel efficiency standards and opposed legislation that included tax credits for more efficient cars he voted against renewable sources of energy against clean biofuels against solar power against wind power against an energy bill that while far from perfect represented the largest investment in renewable sources of energy in the history of this country so when senator mccain talks about the failure of politicians in washington to do anything about our energy crisis its important to remember that hes been a part of that failure now after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices the only energy proposal hes really promoting is more offshore drilling a position he recently adopted that has become the centerpiece of his plan and one that will not make a real dent in current gas prices or meet the long term challenge of energy independence
1044405 if i am president i will immediately direct the full resources of the federal government and the full energy of the private sector to a single overarching goal in ten years we will eliminate the need for oil from the entire middle east and venezuela to do this we will invest 150 billion over the next ten years and leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy that harnesses american energy and creates five million new american jobs

1044423 the kiosk format and ability to manufacture commercial dvds on demand brings countless benefits to retailers in terms of reduced overhead and increased customer satisfaction
1044424 many have argued that digital downloads would serve this need but while consumers have seen the benefits of downloads there are still limitations to how they can be used across devices today the dvd still offers the greatest flexibility in terms of playing it on multiple devices or sharing it with others a secure download to burn solution such as what nero offers unlocks the potential of greater access to premium content in a secure format
1044425 over the last decade nero has enabled innovations delivered by the worlds largest consumer electronics brands

1044430 we always used to watch the olympics as a family growing up
1044431 my dream was winning a gold medal for the united states

1044434 if people really do have a hard time with it they should take it up with the olympic committee or fiba im playing well within the rules and i think its a little strange it happens all the time in the olympics for people to get maybe upset or bent out of shape about me is strange because this is something the united states has done many times
1044435 there have been many foreign athletes that have come and competed for the u s and won medals
1044436 i think everyone wants to see the russia america matchup
1044437 if i have to play the united states obviously im going to go out there and compete to win but thats not what i want i know its what everyone else wants but its not what i want
1044438 once the ball went up it was just another basketball game
1044439 you want to meet the u s as late as possible
1044440 i have been playing against those players for 10 years i think when the ball goes up its just going to be another basketball game you just go out there and compete and enjoy the moment since its not going to happen again
1044441 this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and im really looking forward to it
1044442 im glad im not doing as many interviews now just being able to be here and play basketball i think its been put off in the back of my mind for so long just concentrating on what weve been doing in the wnba and now is the first time ive been able to be over here and enjoy the experience
1044443 id love to go watch even if were not taking part in it i hear its pretty tremendous
1044444 im still learning most of the girls on the team three or four of them ive already played with and i have a history with them they are really a good group of girls they are really sweet they have made me feel very welcome and tried to get me accustomed to them very quickly and build chemistry on and off the court
1044445 maria stepanova came up to me and said i was initially against having an american on our team but now that i know you you can play with us any day

1044508 what does it mean to you to be black in america
1044509 honestly what the hell am i supposed to do with that type of info
1044510 were no different than other races we as americans all want the same thing a fair chance we love our families and our country and we work hard to make it whether were pulling 6 figures or 4 figures
1044511 also did anyone see michael eric dyson about to get to the light skin dark skin amp opportunity discussion before it was quickly changed shut down
1044512 also they did have that one super successful family who all went to college and daddy and momma were present that was cool
1044513 the more i think about it i just dont think cnn had the tools or knowhow to approach this type of endeavor the problem is they dont know they dont know how to approach this type of endeavor
1044514 i have never had a black male in my family that had a record
1044515 there was plenty of positive there from the superintendent and his sons and their success to what the the professor was doing with the young kids and even the doctor at the end even with that this really was nothing but a for your information piece for other cultures hello white folks to understand black america
1044516 unless of course the stereotype is the truth and are we ready to make that statement
1044517 i dont know how you can have a whole segment about health problems then have commercials about fast food and then have them
1044518 it seems like they were trying to throw everything into four hours which we all know isnt possible
1044519 she should find someplace else to live should have made a plan not to be in that situation
1044520 taking away the cringe worthy name of the organization i think what shes doing is a great thing instead of sitting around and complaining about the overwhelmingly disproportionate amount of kids born out of wedlock in our community she took action and is actually marrying people
1044521 i would really like to see if these couples are still married in 5 10 years
1044522 champ my perception aside from that gawtawful name is that this
1044523 im also nominated for the best author site www sheliagoss com so if you and the vsb family get a chance dont forget to cast a vote my way too i know a shameless plug signing off now smile
1044524 and you know im actually glad they cut of mike dyson as he was about to discuss the difference between where he and his brother ended up because it was bullshit
1044525 times are tough my auntie got enough problems of her own
1044526 for example we all know that drugs overwhelmed our communities in the 80s and early 90s but it was never mentioned how they got there or politically what was going on at that time coughing regan no speculations no theories just our communities suck and our men are going to jail
1044527 everyone knows that there is white blood mixed with slave roots and that to me did nothing to add insight to the black in america plight
1044528 i totally disagree these concepts are addressed in basic american history classes the sireing of mulatto children by slave maters is any an text related to american history or slavey in america history materials
1044529 as someone whos been in education for my entire adult life 3 years as a high school teacher and i currently run a non profit
1044530 and i agree that many people are ignorent of the facts but if you can explain why that segment was important then please do
1044531 for one if you actually gained insightful information from this documentary you need to read more point blank period
1044532 just because its in a history book doesnt mean people know it
1044533 it also left the feeling that a white man was the patriarch of the black family and that without him this family would not exist
1044534 i have always had the belief that things that seem to be
1044535 what the hell am i supposed to do with that type of info
1044536 always have forums on shyt but rarely put things into action to effectively make a difference in improving our situations
1044537 before we get up turn off the tv and do something about what we see everyday anyway
1044538 cnn did something that many networks would not have attempted
1044539 the show was entirely generic but i must say that it did not necessarily harp on the negative it harped on the facts blacks in america are doing poorly i think that we as educated black people take offense too quickly with generalizations that blacks are doing poorly because we know that we dont fall into that category but the majority of blacks do if you are black and educated and make over x amount of dollars in a year you are not only in the minority of the black community but in the nation as a whole
1044540 a topic that i was wondering about how in the world did they choose the
1044541 yes there are tons of black people doing great things but its completely disingenuous and dangerous to suggest that everythings all hakuna matata and shit
1044542 i feel like the baby boom blacks still have this
1044543 godfather part 2 this was exactly what i expected a cnn series on black america to be
1044544 well nobodys done this in two weeks lets do a documentary on black in america
1044545 well panama has a government job so maybe he cant really say what he wants
1044546 but the real point is that most white people didnt watch it and most of the ones that did either dont care or dont believe things are
1044547 i wont even truly get started on this because it brings out my inner huey so lets just say f ck cnn and soledad obrien for making me think it was going to be worth my time
1044548 in other words have some damn standards by not letting any random negro nut inside you men stop hooking with with these suspect women who wont pass down good ethics to your children
1044549 this is probably my conservative self talking but at the end of the day people regardless of color determine the direction of their lives it all comes down to personal choice
1044550 now one lady i was dating would faht as i call it whenever she laughed hard
1044551 wooooooo to be the man you gotta to beat the man woooooooo
1044552 whether you like it or not learn to love it because its the best thing going wooooo
1044553 i think after it occurs during sex its pretty much fair game anytime else
1044554 secondly queefing and butt thunder arr two completley different things no
1044555 hey lets walk this way you dont wanna go that way
1044556 or we purposely lay a cloud of funk and then move and watch people walk into it

1044569 my girl says she cant have a good bm when im there though i just dont get it
1044570 yes bodily functions happen however i run the water in the sink just so the guy doesnt here me pee
1044571 its all bodily functions and i would be damned if i walk around bloated and uncomfortable to appear ladylike
1044572 guys i dont care what you say you know that any bodily explosions are absolutely unacceptable because if you didnt care we wouldnt be having this debate right now
1044573 however i have full on pissed in front of someone but he enjoyed it so i dont find that crass at all

1044591 is a multiethnic community based longitudinal cohort study of the natural history of the menopausal transition in 3302 women enrolled at seven sites throughout the united states
1044592 the impact of the hormonal changes on the incidence of metabolic syndrome was similar in the different ethnic groups
1044593 for every one standard deviation increase in bioavailable testosterone levels the odds of developing metabolic syndrome increased by 10
1044594 it was previously thought that estrogen exerted a direct positive effect on cv disease risk in women a benefit that was lost as women transitioned from a premenopausal to a postmenopausal state and experienced a loss of estrogen
1044595 however these data show that the change in estrogen level is at best a weak and nonsignificant predictor of metabolic syndrome risk
1044596 the increase is apparently steeper before a woman reaches menopause than after and we were a bit surprised about that
1044597 we have produced important new information that opens up a new perspective on reperfusion injury there have been many failed attempts at preventing reperfusion injury in the past leading some to suggest that this may not be a real target but i think our current results will shake the field up again
1044598 of course our results will have to be confirmed in a larger study but i am optimistic as we believe our approach targets a novel mechanism while the existence of this pore has been known for years its importance in cell death after ischemia reperfusion has only recently been realized and we have drugs that can inhibit it thats very exciting
1044599 we believe it is now time to take myocardial reperfusion injury seriously since it provides a new target for reducing the size of a myocardial infarct and potentially improving the clinical outcomes in patients with st elevation myocardial infarction
1044600 reperfusion in mi patients has always been considered a success story which of course it is but it is thought that about 10 of the mi injury is actually caused by the reperfusion
1044601 after reperfusion this pore opens and this is associated with cell death if we can keep this pore closed in the first few minutes after reperfusion it appears that we can salvage heart muscle
1044602 this involves inducing several bouts of ischemia immediately after perfusion which has been achieved with a few inflations of the angioplasty balloon this sets off a process that ultimately results in the pore staying closed but a pharmacologic agent that brought about the same result would be more convenient all round and could also be used in patients not undergoing pci

1044610 in the murky world of middle east politics there are a number of possible motives for the assassination
1044611 to the best of my knowledge we didnt do it
1044612 look its outside the rules of course assassinations take place but to hit a general in his own country is close to an act of war and we just dont want a war with syria we are busy talking to them
1044613 an iranian spy might be killed in lebanon a hizbollah guy in syria but not a syrian in syria with a sniper
1044614 the sniper might miss he might get caught there would have to be retaliation and neither side wants to get caught up in that game

1044724 la altura no nos asusta ya que por la geograf a de nuestro pa s universitario est acostumbrado a jugar en cualquier terreno
1044725 chocar n dos equipos con muchos logros internacionales y hay que respetar la trayectoria
1044726 hicimos buenos campeonatos en el primer semestre del a o y es normal que esperen m s de nosotros daremos lo mejor para presentar batalla en todo en la sudamericana y en el apertura

1044732 didier no jugar en nuestro primer partido y probablemente se perder el del wigan
1044733 espero que pueda estar listo para empezar a entrenar la pr xima semana pero no jugar hasta que no est en condiciones

1044740 no s si se ha mejorado pero con la llegada de leo estando rom n riquelme el kun ag ero y estando bien las cosas creo que la selecci n va a salir adelante
1044741 no estuvimos juntos mucho tiempo pero ahora los que estamos ac somos todo el plantel as que nos vamos conociendo y eso es bueno

1044743 uno cuando ve f tbol europeo ve que hay argentinos en todos lados y siempre tiene una caracter stica el deseo de poder agarrar la pelota y sacarse un jugador de encima

1044746 the following is a copy of the letter sent to the church at luppitt in devonshire the place where the present church at upottery then met
1044747 we the elders and ministering brethren of the churches in and about london being several times assembled together to consider of the present state of the baptized congregations not only in this city but also in the country cannot but first of all adore the divine wisdom and goodness of almighty god in respect of his late most gracious providence for our deliverance from that dismal dispensation which threatened us from the continual and unwearied attempts and designs of the enemy of our sacred religion and civil liberties by which means our sinking and drooping spirits are again revived and our earnest hopes and long expectations raised and afresh quickened in respect of the more full and perfect deliverance of the church of god and his more glorious appearance for the accomplishing of those gracious promises and prophecies contained in the holy scripture relating to the latter days
1044748 but in the second place we cannot but bewail the present condition our churches seem to be in fearing that much of that former strength life and vigour which attended us is much gone and in many places the interest of our lord jesus christ seems to be much neglected which is in our hands and the congregations to languish and our beauty to fade away which thing we have some ground to judge you cannot but be sensible of as well as we and from hence we have been put upon most mature and serious considerations of such things that may be the cause thereof and amongst others are come to this result that the great neglect of the present ministry is one thing together with that general unconcernedness there generally seems to be of giving fit and proper encouragement for the raising up an able and honourable ministry for the time to come with many other things which we hope we are not left wholly in the dark about which we find we are not in a capacity to prevent and cure as instruments in the hand of god and his blessing attending our christian endeavours unless we can obtain a general meeting here in london of two principal brethren of every church of the same faith with us in every county respectively

1044750 from a strategic perspective it made sense to purchase aeration technologies
1044751 aqua control is a leader in the floating fountain and aerator market and by acquiring aeration technologies we have accomplished two goals the first is an immediate presence in the growing lake bed aeration market and the second fulfills our need for a regional sales manager to support our growth
1044752 our distribution benefits immediately from having a superior product with the same high level of service and support that they expect from us cary martin brings to aqua control many years of lake and pond management experience in addition to strong sales and customer service skills he is an industry expert and has tremendous knowledge of aeration and water quality
1044753 at naturalawn of america we focus on being experts at one thing safer lawn care
1044754 we dont mow lawns we dont landscape yards we do lawn care and we do it well by focusing on one aspect of the green industry instead of branching out into several fields we are able to provide a better quality product and service businesses can run the risk of failure if they lose focus of their core competencies
1044755 why would you offer products that you wouldnt use yourself when you have a service like ours that offers homeowners the choice of getting a greener lawn without all the harmful unnecessary pesticides why would you consider anything else
1044756 trugreens acceptance to pesp establishes our commitment to lead the industry in the research and development of environmentally responsible products and services

1044774 provides contract manufacturing services for medical companies at a facility in east texas where it used to produce its own patented medical products before exiting that business several years ago
1044775 morningstar considers it distressed which it defines as companies that are having serious operating problems despite that designation the chicago firm gives sten a b grade for financial health and a b minus for profitability while the stock gets a d grade for growth theres nothing in the balance sheet that makes any sort of default on the notes look imminent
1044776 a renewable unsecured subordinated note is a promise by sten to pay principal and interest to the holder when due by purchasing a note you are lending money to sten the note represents stens obligation to repay your loan with interest
1044777 the notes earn incrementally higher interest rates when the aggregate principal amount reaches 25 000 50 000 75 000 and 100 000
1044778 there is no active secondary market for the notes the notes are not negotiable instruments and cannot be transferred without the prior written consent of sten if you decide to liquidate your investment prior to maturity you would have to request that sten consent to a transfer or repurchase your note early
1044779 up to three months of simple interest for notes with three month maturities calculated at the current rate and up to six months of simple interest for all other notes the early repurchase penalty does not apply in the event of the note holders death or total permanent disability
1044780 an investment in the notes we are offering involves a high degree of risk
1044781 because the notes are unsecured subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness and do not restrict our ability to incur future indebtedness the notes may not be a suitable investment for you based on your ability to withstand a loss of interest or principal
1044782 you lack priority in payment on the notes which rank junior to substantially all of our existing and future debt and other financial obligations
1044783 understand an issuers business and believe in it under normal circumstances with corporate bonds theres a credit rating to review but sten hasnt been rated by the major agencies
1044784 in stens case unlike subprime mortgage companies that have been in the news the financing deals are secured by a depreciating asset namely the car
1044785 sten has a system in place that dramatically limits its potential losses effectively having a reserve fund from the dealers it works with the dealers in turn put a locating device in each car so that they can be repossessed if the buyer defaults

1044825 the capacity of interfacial water layers to impose order was exposed in the process of formation of supercubane carbon nanocrystals
1044826 it is important that the order imposed to molecules landing on hydrogenated diamond is more durable and superior to that realizable on any other origin of life platform for instance graphite hydrogenated diamond advances to the best of all possible origin of life
1044827 origin of life models starting with a primordial soup work from two assumptions which do not exclude each other chemistry which could trigger the self assembly of abiotic organic compounds and transfer of order from preexistent orderings
1044828 clearly both organization processes must occur in a bio relevant environment that is a wet milieu and both are energy consuming interestingly a hostile planetary environment such as the primitive earth subject to rapid changes including but not limited to volcanic and hydrothermal activity acidic atmosphere and virtually planet sterilizing meteorite impacts favours precisely the conditions necessary for the formation of first ordered structures regarded as possible starting points of biological evolution
1044829 in our study the conductivity on natural diamond was better by a factor of 10 than that on synthetic diamond
1044830 we conclude that current ideas of surface conducting diamond should be expanded to include the crystalline water layer
1044831 the emergence of bio organic molecules under primitive earth conditions is one of the major unsolved origin of life questions
1044832 the principal problem is to identify physical and chemical conditions that are favourable for the formation of life precursor structures panspermia tries to circumvent the problem by assuming that primitive life forms such as bacteria have arrived on earth from space as star dust or via comets

1044847 the palazzo together with the comprehensively renovated venetian las vegas and sands expo and convention center now comprise the largest integrated resort and convention destination in the world with approximately 7 100 all suite rooms 2 3 million square feet of meeting convention and exhibition space and world class dining retail and entertainment amenities we expect the significant back of house and other operating efficiencies that have been resident in our master plan for the combined complex since its inception to enable us to deliver industry leading operating margins we believe that our flexible and adaptable integrated las vegas facilities will provide an excellent platform for profitable growth and industry leading returns both in todays somewhat challenging economic environment and in periods of more robust economic growth in the future

1044876 archbishop williams told reporters that he hoped anglican leaders could agree on a draft covenant within a year but said that winning approval for it among the 44 national and regional churches of the anglican communion could take until 2013 that period might coincide with a push among the bishops here to hold another lambeth meeting after only five years in the meantime the archbishop said agreement was widespread for continuing moratoria on the ordination of gay and lesbian priests and blessings of same sex unions and for matching restraint by conservatives who threatened to walk out unless traditional views proscribing church acceptance of homosexuality prevailed a document published as the conference ended spoke of the moratoriums ushering in a season of gracious restraint while the covenant is negotiated

1044878 about 56 300 people are now thought to be infected with hiv annually a startling 40 percent jump from the governments previous estimate of 40 000 the new figures represent improved assessments not evidence that infection rates are going up officials said but the news had aids advocacy groups in chicago calling for additional funding to combat the outbreak among gay men and african americans among whom cases of infection are increasing fastest the study shows advocates also called for a national strategy to combat the epidemic the new numbers compiled in 2006 were derived from a sophisticated blood test that determines when a patient was infected previous studies depended on a medical diagnosis that did not give the time frame of infection making it difficult to compile yearly data
1044879 new cases are rising fastest among gay and bisexual men according to the report representing about 53 percent of the infections african americans represent about 45 percent of the cases about 60 percent of the victims are younger than 40 and 73 percent are men
1044880 these new figures should bring new focus to our efforts to address aids and hiv here at home as president i am committed to developing a national aids strategy to decrease new hiv infections and improve health outcomes for americans living with hiv aids across the nation we also need to prevent the spread of hiv and get people into treatment by expanding access to testing and comprehensive education programs this report also demonstrates the need for more timely data about hiv transmission so that we can effectively evaluate prevention efforts combating hiv aids also demands closing the gaps in opportunity that exist in our society so that we can strengthen our public health we must also overcome the stigma that surrounds hiv aids a stigma that is too often tied to homophobia we need to encourage folks to get tested and accelerate hiv aids research toward an effective cure because we have a moral obligation to join together to meet this challenge and to do so with the urgency this epidemic demands
1044881 the u s centers for disease control and prevention cdc yesterday announced that in 2006 there were 56 300 new hiv infections in united states significantly higher than the previous estimate of 40 000 cases more than a million americans live with this devastating disease as president i will work closely with non profit government and private sector stakeholders to continue the fight against hiv aids by focusing efforts on reducing drug costs through greater market competition promoting prevention efforts encouraging testing targeting communities with high infection rates strengthening research and reducing disparities through effective public outreach we as a nation can make great progress in fighting hiv aids

1044885 any time an athlete does something extraordinary anymore its how can that be
1044886 because its happened so many times the heroes keep crumbling under the weight of scandals
1044887 i have the perception that you want to believe and you should give someone the benefit of the doubt
1044888 but unfortunately other athletes in the past have ruined that for a lot of people
1044889 its interesting to me how effective sports fans are at being in denial
1044890 now its become harder and harder for people to do that
1044891 we like those comeback stories we like people overcoming odds

1044898 given their checkered past and the difficulty that they had in getting to this point the bungling of the hatfill part of the investigation leads me to be very skeptical

1044907 mmmmmmmm anderson hes dreamy just dreamy ive been a fan of his since season 1 of the mole i just thought he was so cool when he talked in this cool low secret agent voice if you can accomplish this task listen no one can tell anyone how big their steps should be or when they can take them you can take issue with someone making overtly denying statements and you can take issue with people straight up presenting themselves as someone that theyre not because i think thats kind of shady and not very stand up but you cant fault someone for going through the process at their own time you cant but again to speak to the public nature of things it is in our capacity to respect the job descriptions that people have separate from the life that they live and i dont care about the person on the news i literally tune in to hear the news i might find them dreamy but i dont really need to know much more about them

1044920 the complaint is to be resolved the paper has amended some online articles and removed others
1044921 the newspaper wishes to make clear that it wasnt in any way anti polish
1044922 we are pleased that the daily mail could see that some of the wording they had in their headlines was harmful and they have taken far more care
1044923 if you take the balance of articles published by us the polish migrant has not been identified as a hate figure and we have often and continuously drawn attention to the benefits britain has and does derive from the skills that immigrants bring us
1044924 we ran an in depth series the new britons by fiona barton which had a very balanced and fair assessment of the virtues of polish immigrants

1044930 an entire generation of pupils at primary school over three million children have been failed on labours watch
1044931 pupils who have taken their sats tests this year were born in the same year that labour came to power yet hundreds of thousands will not have reached the basic level of literacy and numeracy in the 3rs and the gap between the most disadvantaged pupils and the rest continues to grow wider

1044943 many complementary methods are extremely popular among cancer survivors who are spending a lot of their time money and attention on them
1044944 for this reason it is important to determine which are helpful not only for shrinking tumors and extending survival but also for relieving symptoms and improving quality of life
1044945 in general younger more educated and more affluent cancer survivors were more likely to use complementary methods
1044946 people with more advanced cancer were more likely to be complementary method users
1044947 scientific studies of complementary methods have become much more common during the past few years but there is still a lot of uncertainty about the effectiveness of many complementary methods
1044948 as more studies are done to evaluate effectiveness we will want to know whether men are missing opportunities to use some effective complementary methods that are far more popular in women or whether women use ineffective complementary methods more than men or whether some complementary methods are more effective for women than they are for men
1044949 this study like many before it confirms that cancer patients actively pursue a variety of alternative and complementary therapies usually in conjunction with standard approaches to cancer treatment
1044950 it is not known but it is not thought that these have an impact on cancer related outcomes though many patients report deriving comfort solace or symptom relief with such practices

1045144 it appeared as if the occupants had just stepped out and would be back shortly it was described as eerie
1045145 came back and said there was an empty bottle of spirits on the floor he said it looks as if thered been a scuffle
1045146 but when you look at the video there is no bottle of spirits they ask him if he looked at the fridge and he said he didnt want anyone lunging at him with a knife i would like to know if there were any knives on the floor
1045147 if they are fair dinkum and if we recognise there have been decades of systemic policy failure we must stop now and completely assess current policy implementation
1045148 this is not the time for false assurances its a time for honesty
1045149 the unacceptable truth is that too often too many aboriginal kids at homeland centres dont attend school and of those who do attend too often there is not a qualified teacher in front of the class
1045150 the clps answer to tackling indigenous issues is to establish another committee
1045151 this hollow announcement with no funding attached to it shows terry mills is not up to it
1045152 the best chance weve learned is with a different city and given that were talking 20 to 30 years before we could do it again i think a lot will come down to how brisbane develops in terms of further infrastructure hotels and whatever by then
1045153 i couldnt and wouldnt say to the queensland government or the brisbane city council to go out and build a new swimming pool but infrastructure is important villages in the past have been around university sites for instance it would be smart to at least have somewhere in mind but certainly i wouldnt be counselling them to go building anything because what you build now would be outdated by then
1045154 my view is that this is something brisbane should throw its hat in the ring for
1045155 it is a 10 15 years thing and something we would have to work through
1045156 there are significant issues with brisbanes infrastructure apart from sporting infrastructure hotel roads public transport and water infrastructure needs would have to be addressed
1045157 im very positive about this and quite pleased that john coates has the confidence that brisbane could stage a future olympics
1045158 its very very expensive to build for an olympic games now because of the added security element
1045159 we were 300 million in sydney by the time it went to the athens games it was 1 6billion plus whatever fleet of the us navy was sitting off the coast and i imagine london is also having to spend big

1045162 i think he is still considering his position yes i do
1045163 the cartoonists who presented him as a hamlet like figure were at least right for a period he may have decided on this recent holiday i havent spoken to him since he returned it may well be that was a period of finally getting things together
1045164 yes that was certainly his mood on november 25th i cant point to a date that he changed his mind i think melbourne university press publisher louise adler had something to contribute to that because she persuaded him to write the book
1045165 and that gave him the opportunity to really do more than brood but to actually settle down and sort out his ideas so the book is a sorting out of ideas
1045166 look let me put it this way there are two views one is that i did these 12 years and thats an important episode of my life and now its time to move on that makes perfect sense rather than revisit the old battlegrounds the other view is that i still have so much more to contribute that i really ought to do it
1045167 theres a touch of that and theres touch of plain narrative a touch of apologia you know apologia is the wrong word its a fancy word for autobiography you apologise to god not to your colleagues
1045168 my own preference would be for him to stay on and defeat this dreadful government but i can well see the other point of view
1045169 she will support her husband shes a loyal wife in that sense not that she doesnt have views of her own she would say its after all his life and he has to live it if he goes back to canberra
1045170 its pretty well established you do a count of the votes and the support and you either expect to win and if you havent got the numbers you dont do it or you think there would be some advantage in splitting the party which was something that peter would never do between those two he was stymied the third thing being the prime ministers unyielding attitude
1045171 at the beginning peter was providing the autobiographical information and i was doing the writing
1045172 there were no barneys there were disagreements and they are continuing but they were all amicably settled or put aside
1045173 i am not in a position to speculate on the nature of her admission
1045174 i would appeal to the media to show appropriate restraint
1045175 i have spoken with a member of paula wriedts family this afternoon and i need to inform the public of recent events
1045176 however i have received advice that she will require a period of treatment and recuperation it is clear that in the short term paula will be unable to perform her duties as a minister
1045177 focus on getting well with the support of her family and friends
1045178 my first and only priority in these circumstances is paulas health and wellbeing and that of her family
1045179 i have offered paulas family my personal support and that of the government my thoughts and those of all government mps are very much with paula

1045201 sexuality has always been very complicated and when you have to prove it as a matter of life and death you will use any resource you have available to you
1045202 during pride we took hundreds of pictures and we have a facebook group and when people sign up to that group we encourage them to show their membership to the irb member
1045203 i have used facebook because people put stuff on there about themselves and who they are and in a relationship with
1045204 basically its like a jigsaw puzzle and you just try and take the little pieces here and there and you try and construct a larger picture of a persons life
1045205 a refugee claimant may not have typical documentation to support their claim
1045206 a member of the board can accept any relevant evidence and then assign an appropriate value to that evidence

1045208 those people who make a living out of short selling stocks are bordering on criminality
1045209 those stock market players who have no interest in the company who spread or propagate rumours that they havent been bothered to check and then sell into the back of those rumours i dont think theyre doing anyone any good
1045210 and of course when we hear that weve got cracks in the bottom of our ore cars or even a ship has sunk at the berth
1045211 we know those things are being put out to scare the mums and dads into selling their shares and of course the people whove shorted their shares then go and buy those shares off
1045212 the investment banks who defend short selling are defending real personal interest
1045213 we had a huge number of people who were in a position to see the atrocities that were going on in bosnia
1045214 theres going to be a lot of focus on srebrenica but there were a lot of other things that karadzic should be held accountable for the canadians were directly witnessing the ethnic cleansing going on more generally
1045215 the canadian involvement in the analysis of the remains is huge
1045216 my role largely throughout much of that time was monitoring the mass grave exhumations some related to srebrenica of course and other mass graves
1045217 at this time we have excavated and examined 23 secondary mass graves related to one execution event
1045218 we are aware that there are several more graves that need to be exhumed
1045219 the reassociations are extremely complex and one persons remains may be recovered from several secondary mass graves dozens of kilometres apart
1045220 we dont really need to put them back together we associate them for identification purposes but we certainly reassociate them as much as possible for the victims themselves and their family members
1045221 perhaps part of it is that it does not change the fact that those men and boys were executed and we are still in the process of trying to recover identify and repatriate them to their family members
1045222 it was considered at the time that i went there as an undesirable posting
1045223 i would like to think that it continued but i dont know if it did

1045282 and the word of the lord came to the prophet so and so
1045283 the lord has hidden this thing from me that i do not know what is happening
1045284 out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water
1045285 lord what happens if im going out there into the world in my day to day life and experience what happens if i am rubbing shoulders with people what happens if somebody is visiting me or i am visiting them and there is a need for the anointing how am i going to go about getting in the spirit getting into the anointing getting the flow to take place like you did when you walked down the streets and healed people like peter and john did at the beautiful gate with the lame man and they reached out and just lifted him up and spoke life into his body
1045286 all you need to do is sink a pipe down into your underground stream and set up a channel for the water to flow then put a windmill on top
1045287 well theres plenty down there if we just knew how to take it out i could let you have some
1045288 you set up your windmill and ill provide the wind all you need to do is set up the windmill and when it is time for the water to come out i will provide the wind and when i blow my wind on your windmill and it begins to turn the water will come out provided the pipe is there provided the pump is attached to the pipe the water will come out
1045289 if you set up the internal anointing correctly when the time is right ill blow the external anointing on you and when i blow the external anointing on you the internal anointing will come gushing forth and the power will be there
1045290 and they were all filled with the holy spirit and began to speak in tongues
1045291 when i speak in tongues my spirit prays but my understanding is unfruitful
1045292 well i have the spirit of god when i was saved why must i receive the baptism of the spirit
1045293 you dont get the spirit until the anointing has come upon you
1045294 it is stupid i dont like it why should we do it

1045329 the orator cant be perfect unless hes a good man
1045330 any subject can be analyzed in this way structuring arguments by division or dichotomy moreover such arrangement renders other arts of memory unnecessary for since this arrangement bodies forth the natural structure of both the world and the human mind anything organized in this way is retained easily and thoroughly
1045331 what then can be said against this definition of an orator i assert indeed that such a definition of an orator seems to me to be useless and stupid why because a definition of any artist which covers more than is included in the rules of his art is superfluous and defective for the artist must be defined according to the rules of his art so that only as much of the art as the true proper principles cover this much is attributed to the artist and nothing further
1045332 for all that quintilian continues and maintains his own opinion that since dialectic is a virtue so therefore is rhetoric quintilian should turn the whole thing around and should more correctly conclude that since dialectic is not a moral virtue which can shape a good man so neither is rhetoric
1045333 he teaches nothing about memory and delivery in the exordium and statement of facts he confuses the very few instructions concerning style and arrangement and so i say that a theory of invention is left which not only has nothing that could be referred to the true art of invention but is one which i declare to be completely unreliable sophistic pedantic and utterly puerile

1045341 especially in the eight weve done a lot of work with psychologists this year just so that were all really clear on what were doing and that theres never any outside distractions or issues between us

1045358 weve done a reasonable amount of research which shows that depending on the sport you can get up to 2 3 per cent extra performance over a prolonged period and that sort of margin is huge in sport
1045359 it can be the difference in medalling or not quite easily
1045360 as athletes get more tired as the competition progresses we aim to manage that fatigue so that on finals day youre less tired than the opposition thats where the benefits come in
1045361 so if we can bring that down more quickly immediately you speed up the rehabilitation process every day
1045362 with what we do out in the heat so long and diving around with all our muscles used constantly the difference is dramatic
1045363 after sessions in the cold pool and a massage by night time we feel great and ready to go the next day
1045364 without that you tend to feel sluggish and lethargic and its a lot harder to back up day after day
1045365 its a cumulative effect you might not notice the difference if you dont do it today but after three or four days youll feel it hugely
1045366 it really can make all the difference in terms of success its a big advantage for us
1045367 im pretty good and the hamstrings coming good but with the travel factor it just didnt make sense to try to get up and play
1045368 the focus has always been round 1 against sydney and thats what im aiming for
1045369 it is tempting to play because it is a cup and we want to win it but this gives me a few extra days to get treatment and get maximum strength under my belt for the first game
1045370 i can stay at home and get three quality training sessions and treatment
1045371 ideally i would have liked to have played in half of the pre season games
1045372 i did play in a couple of friendlies prior to the pre season cup but im happy with everything else about my fitness
1045373 at this stage theres just no point taking any chances
1045374 vaughan is crucial for england to regain the ashes next year because he is such a good captain
1045375 my biggest worry with pietersen is that he gets a bit far above himself and doesnt keep his feet on the ground
1045376 hes got to remember who his friends are if he keeps that in mind he will be all right he has as much talent as anyone that has ever played the game
1045377 i felt very confident i really had this feeling i was going to make it i liked it all the way but it just didnt come left
1045378 my dreams come true now i was planning to play in japan but maybe now i change my plans and play in america
1045379 queso is nice and melted and gooey and tortilla is nice and brown
1045380 i gave him an easy time but he finished full of running right on their heels
1045381 it would be a dream result if both came to australia to race against our best thats what the world pacing cup is trying to achieve
1045382 mister bigs owner joe muscara is very familiar with australian and new zealand racing he races a lot of horses down here
1045383 weve already had preliminary talks with joe and signs are very positive
1045384 the prizemoney were offering is a big incentive a horse like mister big can race in two races worth 1 million each in less than a month here while the big race he won last weekend was only worth about 300 000 aussie dollars
1045385 its the same story with artistic fella his connections are keen to know more about our races
1045386 high fructose corn syrup used in american coke is actually sweeter but it leaves a film in the mouth that film automatically diminishes your palate blocking the sweetness sugar cane sucrose is cleaner and crisper so if you are used to coke made with corn syrup the difference is striking
1045387 the sanction imposed on heath by the club on monday was a result of information stated by both heath and alan after being repeatedly questioned about the incident
1045388 given the club has now found their information to be false it strikes at the principles of honesty and integrity that the collingwood football club is built on
1045389 i was in a bit of shock when i pulled over
1045390 hes not a five year old he is a grown man and must take responsibility
1045391 coach mick malthouse breaks his neck week in and out and is dragged down by clowns
1045392 he chose not to be responsible on sunday we will make him responsible
1045393 we prefer the clubs to deal with these instances themselves mr demetriou said im pretty sure collingwood has taken this matter very seriously
1045394 i believe whatever doesnt kill you simply makes you stranger
1045395 and in your darkest hour i hold secrets flame we can watch the world d trackback from your own site
1045396 die nutzung erneuerbarer energien hat zukunft ich danke den mitbeteiligten gemeinden schruns tschagguns und bartholom berg sowie dem stand montafon forstfonds und der montafoner bergbahnen beteiligungs gmbh f r diesen wichtigen meilenstein der energiezukunft vorarlberg
1045397 holz als nat rlich nachwachsender rohstoff ist gerade in den schutzw ldern des montafons reichlich vorhanden
1045398 no ones going to come after me right now im bad at competitions
1045399 as far as im concerned this was a bogus competition

1045402 richard was a little bit taken aback but then they started to talk about whether victoria could pilot the craft

1045404 bernie mac is still alive and being treated at a chicago hospital for pneumonia and is expected to make a full recovery

1045411 my verdict though apple computers can produce excellent results for small business expect issues macs remain a niche product your transition from windows will not be without bumps
1045412 no matter what you do with a mac you have to face apples peculiar vision of all things computerish
1045413 once out of the box the imac is lovely the keyboard in particular is my hands down favorite
1045414 but as ever with apple boxes there were not enough usb ports i was forced to dump my usb hard drive in favor of an ethernet enablement unit
1045415 then came the software issues we found that citrixs ctxs gotomypc my shops vpn virtual private network tool was unstable on our imac our web based backup service mozy did not support mac solutions when i started testing but has since released an upgrade
1045416 offsetting all this speed are some curious features clearly not aimed at the average small business the desktop is divided into quadrants that extend beyond the screens edge only with some complex keyboard commands can i slide from one to another
1045417 all the goofy apple centric commands leave pc trained users constantly fighting to parse out what the control option and command keys do
1045418 apple devotees swear by the touch sensitive shell of the mighty mouse but its top left and right click buttons still look an awful lot like just one
1045419 the real eye rolling winner is time machine quite possibly the silliest operating system extension in history must i really sit through a full round of special effects the desktop slides away to reveal some mysterious star in full supernova disappearing into infinity behind my various backups just to find a what i said to a client in a lost e mail honestly
1045420 listen up jimi hendrix ive played guitar hero and i can tell you you are holding it the wrong way around you are clearly not at all experienced now are you
1045421 that was the stupidest statement ever made by a white woman
1045422 es tan claro como que dos y dos son cuatro
1045423 se trata de crear una conexi n entre los objetos romper la estructura del mundo industrial
1045424 es un h bitat informacional que pretende explicar c mo reprogramar el mundo desde una arquitectura m s inteligente
1045425 porque cada vez la utop a est m s cerca de la realidad
1045426 el desembalse de 21 hect metros c bicos de agua que se aprob el pasado mes se ha demostrado ya como insuficiente
1045427 evitando as que un pleno o junta de gobierno se pronuncie al respecto
1045428 esto es un esc ndalo y un despilfarro ya que el ayuntamiento no s lo dispon a ya de un servicio jur dico que a n mantiene sino que tambi n cuenta con el asesoramiento del secretario interventor
1045429 los ciudadanos de campos del r o no pueden permitirse el lujo de pagar esos servicios ni las acciones caprichosas del alcalde
1045430 el alcalde est esquilmando y dilapidando los limitados recursos econ micos del ayuntamiento y pisoteando el principio de eficiencia que debe regir en la gesti n de los fondos p blicos
1045431 el alcalde utiliza los fondos p blicos para buscar salida a problemas que ha generado l mismo
1045432 solo nos hace pensar que desconocen la realidad puesto que estos trabajadores tienen asegurado su trabajo con la instalaci n de la nueva pista y con el resto de las obras que terminar n en 2010
1045433 estas reformas permitir n ampliar el n mero de trabajadores en este aeropuerto y mejorar las condiciones de movilidad de todos los murcianos

1045585 we evaluated a variety of synthetic turf products for lead and found children are not at risk based on the testing we did consumers should not be concerned about using these fields
1045586 we examined samples to determine the presence of lead and to test for hand to mouth exposure by simulating repeated skin contact the synthetic turf either had no detectable lead or would not expose hands to levels of lead which would present a risk to children

1045594 they told me that from the off that there could be a possibility that i couldnt play again but everything came back positive after having my neck in a brace for 12 weeks so it was all about the specialist having a look at it and giving me the all clear which he did

1046046 you wont hear me say this too often but i couldnt agree more with the explanation that senator mccain offered a few weeks ago
1046047 what senator mccain neglected to mention was that during those thirty years he was in washington for twenty six of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil he voted against increased fuel efficiency standards and opposed legislation that included tax credits for more efficient cars he voted against renewable sources of energy against clean biofuels against solar power against wind power against an energy bill that while far from perfect represented the largest investment in renewable sources of energy in the history of this country so when senator mccain talks about the failure of politicians in washington to do anything about our energy crisis its important to remember that hes been a part of that failure now after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices the only energy proposal hes really promoting is more offshore drilling a position he recently adopted that has become the centerpiece of his plan and one that will not make a real dent in current gas prices or meet the long term challenge of energy independence

1046097 the committee cited one exchange between white house political chief karl rove and ron fournier then a political reporter for the associated press

1046147 we must all fear evil men but there is another fear that we must fear most and that is the indifference of good men
1046148 in this case the editor determined that the letter writer was voicing an opinion as to the motivations of radack and was not asserting that he had actual knowledge of an ulterior scheme so she decided to publish the letter
1046149 a cynic is a man who when he smells flowers looks around for a coffin
1046150 everyone is entitled to his own opinion but not to his own facts
1046151 a cynic is a man who when he smells flowers looks around for a coffin
1046152 the chronicle believes the community benefits from a vigorous debate of public issues and of the actions of public officials therefore the paper welcomes letters containing strong opinions
1046153 the june 12 editorial on oil confused profits and taxes
1046154 where is the report on this incredible piece of news in the chronicle or at chron com

1046157 or maybe you would prefer them to be silenced or only people with whom you disagree
1046158 a lot of people look at a redesign and just see that the colors may be different that the typography maybe changed a little bit but there is a lot more going on in our redesign
1046159 were really trying to tell stories in new ways that are more appealing to readers and were going to try and tell the story so that its not long and dense and instead tell it in terms that can be visual yes but also write better more incisive writing

1046163 hilarious joe proves that the insane at times are not without their charms
1046164 stevie considered your convoluted reasoning an embarrassment and he actually was doing you a favor by denying it
1046165 id say goofy pompous jibberish puts me in pretty good company
1046166 far from emerging from a legitimate democratic process where the public interest is identified and articulated
1046167 the project is the product of a developers dream and a conscious effort to bypass city procedures mandating meaningful local review planning democratic oversight and community input
1046168 new york courts have a proud history of interpreting the new york constitution as providing greater protections for individual rights than the federal constitution this case presents an opportunity to continue that tradition by declaring that the new york constitution prohibits the government from seizing private homes simply to turn them over to a developer who covets them for a massive luxury condominium project
1046169 we are confident that the court will see this for what it is government officials bending to the will of bruce ratner allowing him to wield the power of eminent domain for his personal financial benefit

1046176 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
1046177 the democratic party has always stood up for the principle of counting every persons vote
1046178 is the right position for the democratic party and for the country
1046179 a shared responsibility between employers workers insurers providers and government all americans should have coverage they can afford
1046180 while there are differing approaches within the party about how best to achieve the commitment of universal coverage we stand united to achieve this fundamental objective through the legislative process
1046181 the fact that virginia is even up for grabs tells you a lot
1046182 if you had told me four years ago that a democratic presidential candidate would be running a competitive race in virginia and would open 10 offices i would say that is spectacular
1046183 now we have a guy who has opened 20 to 30 offices around the state youve got to be kidding me
1046184 its a state that we have to win if barack obamas going to be president
1046185 youre going to see another round of office openings in the next couple weeks

1046191 the largest field operation in the history of american politics
1046192 the climate has made millions of americans who havent been involved in a political campaign ever in their lifetimes very active
1046193 we estimate that 70 percent of our grass roots volunteers havent worked in a campaign before were somewhere just shy of 2 million volunteers and we think we can potentially triple that on election day
1046194 we think the turnout will be beyond record turnout and if were effective we will have done two additional things brought in millions of new people who are registered to vote and we will increase the percentage of registered voters who will turn out
1046195 this allows us to increase the volume of voters were talking to and have it be done with people who live in their community
1046196 people tend to believe information delivered by people they know and who live in their neighborhood more than an ad they see on television or what some third party from out of their state is telling them
1046197 you know that you cant take that seat at the front of the bus if you cant afford the bus fare you cant live in an integrated neighborhood if you cant afford the house and it doesnt mean a whole lot to sit down at that lunch counter if you cant afford the lunch
1046198 id be delighted to have you because i expect that in the next administration the white house will be the peoples house

1046204 our research is motivated by the fact that microscopes have been around since the 16th century and yet their basic design has undergone very little change and has proven prohibitively expensive to miniaturize
1046205 the oil companies need to know that there is a limit on how much profit they can take in this economy
1046206 dont wear white socks with black leather shoes shake hands for only three seconds maintain eye contact for 30 to 60 per cent of the conversation dont wear more than three colours in your clothing and above all please stop spitting chinas long march to better etiquette has been under way for years promoted zealously by millions of campaign volunteers and official booklets including the rules listed above but yesterday the government declared victory announcing that chinas personal manners have improved enough to reach olympic standards
1046207 to drill the civility rules into every family china has distributed four million booklets to homes in beijing the 109 page booklet gives dozens of recommendations on what to wear and how to behave in social situations the workplace the family the street and meetings with foreigners

1046271 youre just wasting time chief if she looks like a killer and smells like a killer then shes probably your killer youd better lock her up before she skips town
1046272 sure you do i wasnt saying that you didnt but youre dragging your feet lets get it done
1046273 ive been doing research on everyone who had the opportunity to poison him i particularly wanted to see if any of them had any prior arrests
1046274 its my second time to lose him when he turned twenty one and got his trust fund money he just went listen to reason
1046275 i suppose but these days it seems like anything goes more and more parents want something original i can understand that i guess
1046276 no sadly i dont lester and i couldnt have children of our own we talked about adopting but we just kept putting it off
1046277 nigel was half drunk when he saw navy for the first time in the hospital he said look at the kids huge belly button lets name him navy he laughed out loud about it i tried to tell him that it wasnt a big navel it was just a birth mark around his navel but he insisted that his sons name would be navy end of discussion
1046278 i hated the name and as soon as nigel left the hospital that night i started trying to think of some other name he would like better than navy
1046279 but apparently you werent able to talk him out of it
1046280 when he left the hospital and was walking across the street a greyhound bus hit him and killed him the driver said he was only going 30 mph but he still killed my nigel
1046281 i couldnt bring myself to deny my husbands last request of course he didnt
1046282 well there was nothing wrong with the name it was a perfectly good name
1046283 and now ill have to get used to seeing it on his headstone
1046284 so what was it that you wanted to see me about
1046285 well i hope this wont upset you but one of my employees has been accused of killing navy
1046286 but she didnt do it and im trying to prove it by figuring out who did kill him
1046287 ive already told the police everything i know but ill be glad to answer your questions too
1046288 thank you what can you tell me about his allergy
1046289 he was highly allergic to shellfish although i didnt realize that fish oil supplements would be a problem for him
1046290 so did he carry an epi pen around with him
1046291 yes always he kept it in the glove compartment of his car i told him he should carry one in his pocket as well but i dont think he ever did he said he didnt like shirts with pockets and he would break it if he carried it in his pants pocket he wore jeans a lot
1046292 so its pretty likely that he had an epi pen in his car on saturday morning or at least that he thought he had one in there
1046293 well i havent seen him much over the past few years but im sure it would have been in his car he knew how dangerous it was to be without it one time in high school he nearly died after eating a crab cake at a friends house the epi pen saved him you know how kids are they think theyre invulnerable but he took it a lot more seriously after that
1046294 its his old room he hasnt spent a night in it since his twenty first birthday
1046295 hang on just a second i need to go outside
1046296 one of my employees told me you came around earlier looking for me
1046297 i told you not to ever come to my place of business and besides i dont owe you anything you didnt do the job
1046298 yes i did not the way you told me to but i did it now i want to get paid
1046299 fair enough but we cant be seen together in public
1046300 theres an illegal dump site three miles south of town
1046301 yeah i know where it is about a quarter mile off the highway right
1046302 right eleven oclock tonight dont be late and dont tell anybody where youre going
1046303 oh come on baby you know you dont really mean that
1046304 i told you i didnt want to see you again and i meant it so either you leave or im leaving
1046305 oh how stupid of me youre here with a date
1046306 no its not that im here alone i just dont want to intrude
1046307 i mean i didnt run that guy off just so
1046308 wait the kory mantra the guy who lost a ton of weight by doing yoga and put all those videos on youtube about it
1046309 but dont talk too loud if people realize im here they might come over and start bugging me for autographs
1046310 wow thats cool i watched a few of those videos how much weight did you finally lose
1046311 ninety pounds i started at 275 and lost down to 185
1046312 no i also rode a stationary bike and cut my calories of course but without the yoga i would have ended up with a lot of flab hanging off my bones
1046313 yeah and you sure dont have any flab your body looks lean and sculpted
1046314 no im not a guru im just a guy who was desperate to get into shape who went out and bought a bunch of yoga books and got serious and now i have my own book
1046315 yeah its doing pretty well but i only wrote about twenty percent of whats in there the publisher hired other people to write the rest of it
1046316 well that doesnt seem very honest to put your name on the book when you really only wrote a small part of it
1046317 i know i have mixed feelings about it but havent you ever heard of ghost writers publishers do this all the time with celebrities and they told me that my name would sell millions of books which would lead to millions of people getting healthier and happier
1046318 yeah sort of but i knew there was some truth to what they were saying and hey i was out of work i needed the money
1046319 computer programming but the small company i was working for in the woodlands went out of business about a year ago my girlfriend worked there too so we both lost our jobs at the same time
1046320 i dont anymore she took a job in austin and moved out of the house while i was on an interview i came home and she was gone along with all her stuff the only thing she left was a very short goodbye note
1046321 yeah we had been together for almost a year so it was tough for a while but im over her now
1046322 so ive met a few women online and some of them sound nice
1046323 do they know who you are i mean do they know youre rich and famous
1046324 oh im not rich im comfortable but no i dont talk much about money im hoping they dont know about the yoga guy from youtube
1046325 yeah cause they might just be interested because of your money
1046326 sorry i didnt mean to embarrass you but its nice to see you havent let the fame go to your head
1046327 ive thought about trying online dating but im just not ready ive spent the past two years caring for my grandmother full time i lived at home with my mom and grandmother while i was in college but during my senior year mom was diagnosed with breast cancer shortly after graduation she died
1046328 yeah she hadnt had a mammogram for a couple of years she stayed so busy taking care of grandma that she didnt take good care of herself i felt guilty that i hadnt made sure she was getting regular checkups
1046329 you must have really loved her most women would have put their grandmother in a nursing home they wouldnt have given up two years of their life the way you did
1046330 well she had been suffering with heart disease for years and i really didnt think shed hang on for more than another six months but then she started feeling a lot better and we were having fun together we developed little rituals like certain tv shows wed always watch certain meals wed eat on particular days and every saturday night wed get all dressed up and come here for dinner this was her favorite restaurant
1046331 so thats why youre here on saturday night by yourself
1046332 yeah this is the first time ive ever come here without her i thought it would bring back good memories but its just making me sad
1046333 so what are you going to do with your life now that shes gone
1046334 yeah but i was a kid i thought i could fix anything that was wrong with the world now i know its not that easy my mom and grandmother left me the house and some money so im doing okay but i cant just sit around every day doing nothing now that grandmas gone my life is empty
1046335 yeah i wish id never met him i had a leaky pipe in the kitchen but i didnt know any plumbers so i just randomly picked one out of the yellow pages i wish now i had fixed it myself he kept flirting with me and he was quite charming when he asked me for a date i told him i wasnt ready to start dating again but he begged me to have just one dinner with him
1046336 fine actually until he took me home he asked to come in for a while and when i told him no he forced his way in
1046337 no but a hard kick in the shin and a few screams made him change his mind he called the next day and apologized but then he asked me to go to a movie and i said no thanks and ever since hes been following me around and showing up at my door several times a week hes driving me nuts
1046338 im trying not to do that but i might not have any choice
1046339 call me anytime and please let me know if you need any help with evan
1046340 thanks kory and thanks for dinner i really enjoyed it

1046344 on its initial seven month deployment the osprey unit recorded a mission availability rate of around 70 and a monthly flying rate per aircraft of around 65 hours
1046345 a boroscope inspection of the combustion chamber showed that the liner had broken into pieces these pieces entered into the gas generator causing significant damage
1046346 the engine was breaking up not a good thing but whats more interesting is the indication that the troubled engine was still putting out considerable thrust but the aircraft couldnt maintain altitude
1046347 the v 22 is supposed to be able to fly at least some distance and land on just one engine but in this case it was unable to hold altitude while still getting significant power from the damaged engine
1046348 you might have expected that a showpiece deployment of just ten aircraft one with high priority for spares and personnel could do a bit better than that
1046349 its broke bad we dont have the parts here to fix it get us the damn parts now
1046350 you might have expected that a showpiece deployment of just ten aircraft

1046352 for a long time the navy vigorously defended their decision against a huge amount of criticism for the osprey to be fielded without weapons then in march the service reversed their view and decided that a 7 62 minigun will be installed after all but not until the third deployment to iraq
1046353 for articles that quote the pilots that are have been flying them
1046354 aa my issue was that the osprey was fielded without fixed weapons
1046355 whereas now a fixed weapon mount is seen as essential
1046356 so it is of very limited use even as a defensive weapon
1046357 aa if i wanted to be rude about the osprey as you know there are a lot more things deaths delays scandals cost i could have gone into

1046394 ive made the decision today to resign as leader of the parliamentary liberal party because i believe its in the best interests of the western australian liberal party he said
1046395 there is a massive political opportunity at the next state election and i think i owe it to our candidates to my fellow members of cabinet and to the liberal party to make sure we have every opportunity to win government at that election
1046396 most observers of politics would know that my six months as parliamentary leader has not been without its challenges he admitted
1046397 however during that time i feel that weve done a good job in holding the government to account when theyve made mistakes
1046398 im confident that ive made the right decision im confident ive made an honourable decision
1046399 i do not want to give the government the opportunity to take the focus off of its failings by engaging in cheap personality based politics

1046456 over de kosten ons standpunt over de oorlog is bekend we vinden dat de nederlandse regering niet had moeten meewerken aan de amerikaanse agenda om daar te gaan zitten maar los daarvan accepteren wij het politieke feit dat we er zijn maar dan is vervolgens aan de orde of de zaken wel goed worden voorgesteld en daar maken wij ons zorgen over
1046457 ik ga hiervoor terug naar een rapport van de rekenkamer uit 1997 over de kosten van vredesoperaties daarin wordt gesteld dat defensie met niet betrouwbare ramingsmethodieken werkt ze zijn onvolledig en niet controleerbaar het betekende dat de kosten van vredesoperaties altijd hoger uitvielen dat zie je nu ook weer in uruzgan de eerste twee jaar zijn de kosten opgelopen van 380 miljoen naar 580 miljoen
1046458 ik denk dat we bij de begrote kosten voor de komende twee jaar nog een heleboel moeten optellen
1046459 wij hebben steeds gezegd dat het geen opbouwmissie is maar een vechtmissie het accent ligt op vechten en dat is nu eenmaal veel duurder dan patrouille lopen of men heeft bij defensie weinig geleerd van eerdere opmerkingen van de rekenkamer of de zaken zijn bewust rooskleuriger voorgesteld omdat men de zaak wilde presenteren als opbouwmissie dan kan je niet van tevoren al rekening houden met zware militaire verliezen of een fors aantal doden en gewonden
1046460 dan is de politieke vraag aan de orde of defensie dit niet van te voren had moeten weten of dat hier sprake is van boze opzet want het was natuurlijk van meet af aan duidelijk dat de regering de pvda alleen over de streep zou kunnen trekken voor deze missie als aannemelijk kon worden gemaakt dat het een opbouwmissie was en de pvda heeft dan ook een ander probleem want het zou wel eens kunnen betekenen dat defensie dan geen geld meer heeft voor de door die partij zo gewenste missies in afrika
1046461 jawel nazorg is ontzettend kostbaar zeker als er sprake is van blijvende invaliditeit reken maar dat bij mensen die gebroken uit deze oorlog komen ook sprake is van psychische nood die kunnen niet naar een riagg of zo want die instanties hebben geen ervaring met oorlogstraumas ze moeten naar defensie de kamer stelt terecht steeds hogere eisen aan nazorg het betekent dat ook na verloop van tijd contact wordt opgezocht met militairen die zijn afgezwaaid en die aanvankelijk geen klachten hadden dat brengt allemaal stijgende kosten met zich mee

1046552 kent police has been increasingly concerned about the lack of safe access or emergency exit routes from the field used by climate camp protesters in dux court road hoo particularly where vehicles are blocking the only usable gate
1046553 we raised this concern with their representatives yesterday and their response was to increase the number of vehicles obstructing this gate
1046554 protesters were given three hours to move the vehicles but made no attempt to resolve the problem
1046555 we used absolutely the minimum force necessary to ensure safe access and entry routes to and from the site
1046556 however the response from protesters including those who have locked on to the vehicles causing the obstruction has required us to increase our presence on the site
1046557 as i have already stressed our wish is to police lawful protest sadly the evidence from today and equipment we found last week suggest that some people at the camp are intent on breaking the law

1046583 the figures will reinforce the ecbs concerns that there are still serious inflation pressures
1046584 the ecbs main concern has been on wages and whether they will trigger higher inflation but as the slowdown in the euro zone deepens and widens and unemployment grows workers will have less bargaining powers and this will keep the prices steady
1046585 these figures are an alarming sign that the economy is falling to stagnation
1046586 this means that if companies have the opportunity they will pass their costs to consumers
1046587 companies mainly dependent on transport and economy will feel more constrained but carmakers are a good example of a sector that wont be able to pass costs to consumer so easily as the demand is low

1046594 the district court committed legal error in assuming market definition must depend on marginal consumers
1046595 the district courts error of law led it to ignore ftc evidence that strongly suggested whole foods and wild oats compete for core consumers within a pnos market even if they also compete on individual products for marginal consumers in the broader market
1046596 inexplicably the ftc now asserts a market definition is not necessary in a 7 case
1046597 market definition is a means to an end to enable some measurement of market power not an end in itself

1046640 det blev nog ett felaktigt utslag som ni b r r tta och h va utslaget
1046641 we should sell 70 million barrels of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve for less expensive crude which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks
1046642 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency
1046643 i also believe that in the short term as we transition to renewable energy we can and should increase our domestic production of oil and natural gas but we should start by telling the oil companies to drill on the 68 million acres they currently have access to but havent touched and if they dont we should require them to give up their leases to someone who will
1046644 in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month most of which came after he announced his plan for offshore drilling in a room full of cheering oil executives his initial reaction to the bipartisan energy compromise was to reject it because it took away tax breaks for oil companies and even though he doesnt want to spend much on renewable energy hes actually proposed giving 4 billion more in tax breaks to the biggest oil companies in america including 1 2 billion to exxon mobil
1046645 he always demanded that female workers signalled to him with their eyes that they desperately wanted to be laid on the boardroom table as soon as he gave the word

1046648 the kiosk format and ability to manufacture commercial dvds on demand brings countless benefits to retailers in terms of reduced overhead and increased customer satisfaction
1046649 many have argued that digital downloads would serve this need but while consumers have seen the benefits of downloads there are still limitations to how they can be used across devices today the dvd still offers the greatest flexibility in terms of the ability to play it on multiple devices or share it with others a secure on demand manufacturing solution such as what nero and polar frog digital will be offering unlocks the potential of greater access to premium content in a protected format
1046650 the democratic congress is taking a month off rather than providing the american people with the relief at the gas pump that we need
1046651 congress has a comprehensive energy bill pending but democrats chose to retreat rather than debate we deserve better than this
1046652 provided oil and natural gas drilling opportunities for new refineries and nuclear power tax incentives for fuel efficient vehicles improved home energy efficiency and a permanent alternative energy production tax credit
1046653 if the democrats voting to recess saw how high gas prices in ohio are hurting businesses and families away from the marble steps of the capitol they would have a very rude awakening
1046654 i think that if congress today would start exploring drilling off the coast of anwr and throughout the country where we have oil i think you would see the future markets drop immediately
1046655 i think its going to have a tremendous effect on the world market and it would make our economy stronger to be less dependent on foreign oil
1046656 the democratic congress literally turned off the lights and left the capitol because republicans were demanding action to lower gas prices
1046657 i theres tremendous opportunity to help produce new jobs with alternative energy
1046658 the other thing thats important is whats happening right now the high price of gas the high price of energy is hurting this area
1046659 im a focused person and if i were neglecting my duties that would be one thing but i absolutely am totally confident that im working hard and doing everything i can to benefit the state of ohio

1046687 the treadmill is going faster than the legs at least when it comes to consumers and their spending household consumption surged in june but much of that went to purchase higher priced food and energy
1046688 the first half of 2008 saw the most difficult financial markets for several decades marked by significant declines in profitability throughout much of our industry with consequent recapitalisation and restructuring
1046689 the outlook for the near term remains highly challenging with significant uncertainty
1046690 globally consumer confidence is declining and despite the short term success of the recent fiscal stimulus the us economy continues to be weak driven by continuing housing market difficulties
1046691 the uk and other economies in europe which had enjoyed housing market booms have also weakened the decline in credit availability is accelerating this process
1046692 ultimately the real economy will recover from this crisis although it may get worse before it gets better
1046693 in the emerging markets where hsbc is the leading international bank growth remained strong in the period as real asset prices continued to rise and infrastructure development continued to boost economic growth which supported consumer confidence and spending

1046697 as the fight against aids nears the end of its third decade we are still facing a huge shortfall in resources
1046698 the responses to hiv and aids require long term and sustained financing as more people go on treatment and live longer budgets will have to increase considerably over the next few decades in the most affected countries donors will have to provide the majority of the funding

1046703 i am equally confident that the games will leave a great legacy for china
1046704 china is a nation in transition with a great future tremendous potential and some challenges i believe history will view the 2008 olympics as a significant milestone in chinas remarkable transformation
1046705 some of the changes are easy to see the birds nest the main stadium and the water cube the swimming complex are already architectural landmarks
1046706 long after the games end these and other olympic venues will encourage the youth of china to participate in sport spectators will be inspired to become athletes and athletes will be inspired to achieve their best in world class venues
1046707 the venues are just a small part of the construction legacy that will benefit china after the games
1046708 new airport terminals new roads and highways new parks and a host of other projects that were initiated or accelerated because of the games will improve the quality of life and contribute to chinas economic development over the long term
1046709 many of the infrastructure investments and other steps taken as a result of the olympics will help china deal with environmental challenges

1046816 i am equally confident that the games will leave a great legacy for china
1046817 china is a nation in transition with a great future tremendous potential and some challenges i believe history will view the 2008 olympics as a significant milestone in chinas remarkable transformation
1046818 some of the changes are easy to see the birds nest the main stadium and the water cube the swimming complex are already architectural landmarks
1046819 long after the games end these and other olympic venues will encourage the youth of china to participate in sport spectators will be inspired to become athletes and athletes will be inspired to achieve their best in world class venues
1046820 the venues are just a small part of the construction legacy that will benefit china after the games
1046821 new airport terminals new roads and highways new parks and a host of other projects that were initiated or accelerated because of the games will improve the quality of life and contribute to chinas economic development over the long term
1046822 many of the infrastructure investments and other steps taken as a result of the olympics will help china deal with environmental challenges
1046823 chinas role as our olympic host has opened a window to the worlds most populous nation
1046824 we have already seen the courage and determination of the chinese people in another context
1046825 the world mourned the staggering loss of life from the earthquake in sichuan province and marveled at the courageous response by the chinese people

1046852 whats going on is that the relaxed gentled attention of centering prayer is allowing some interior rearrangement to go on we all carry a lot of pain deep inside us buried in our emotions and in our bodies through your willingness to consent to the presence and action of god the tight repressive bands that the egoic mind keeps wrapped around these shadow places within you begin to loosen up and some of the trapped material can release itself most often in tears while this may initially feel disconcerting it is actually a sign that a process of inner healing is underway
1046853 upbeat sounds like air france and its got a kinda caribbean vibe
1046854 congratulations upon your knowledge o by the one in whose hand is my soul it has a tongue and two lips and it glorifies the sovereign i e allaah at the foot of the throne
1046855 i greeted him with salaams and he returned my greeting then i asked him what are you a jinn or a human
1046856 you wouldnt get many luxury handbags out of leptotyphlops carlae
1046857 there is no one who is afflicted by distress and grief and says allaahumma inni abduka ibn abdika ibn amatija naasyati bi yadika maada fiyya hukmuka adlun fiyya qadaauka asaluka bi kulli ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw anzaltahu fi kitaabika aw allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw istatharta bihi fi ilm il ghayb indaka an tajal rabee qalbi wa noor sadri wa jalaa huzni wa dhihaab hammi o allaah i am your slave son of your slave son of your maidservant my forelock is in your hand your command over me is forever executed and your decree over me is just i ask you by every name belonging to you which you have named yourself with or revealed in your book or you taught to any of your creation or you have preserved in the knowledge of the unseen with you that you make the quraan the life of my heart and the light of my breast and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety but allaah will take away his distress and grief and replace it with joy
1046858 or you have preserved in the knowledge of the unseen with you
1046859 indicates that there are beautiful names of allaah that he has kept with him in the knowledge of the unseen and which none of his creation has come to know this indicates that there are more than ninety nine names
1046860 this indicates that allaah has more than ninety nine names
1046861 verily allah has ninety nine names which if a person safeguards them he will enter the garden
1046862 he is allah besides whom there is no other deity the merciful the compassionate the forbearing
1046863 allah the unique the absolute the one who has nothing like unto him
1046864 this version of the hadith is gharib it has been narrated from various routes on the authority of abu hurairah but we do not know of the mention of the names in the numerous narrations except this one
1046865 al walid one of the narrators of the hadith related the names from the saying of one of his syrian teachers specific mention of the names is not from the words of the prophet may allah bless him and grant him peace by the agreement of those familiar with hadith
1046866 an explanation to the beautiful amp perfect names of allah
1046867 as for the hadeeth which mentions 99 names its meaning is that whosoever memorizes understands and implements in his daily life this number of names will enter paradise
1046868 go tell mohammad and ask him if he can save you
1046869 we are in the process of concluding agreement to distribute auto wudu washers awws to saudi arabia kuwait oman and bahrain as well as we have got 600 requests from all over the muslim world

1046873 and allah has brought you out from the wombs of your mothers while you know nothing and he gave you hearing sight and hearts that you might give thanks to allah
1046874 we ask not of you a provision we provide it for you and the good end is for the muttaqeen the ones who fear allah
1046875 and i allah created not the jinn and mankind except they should worship me alone i seek not any provision from them nor do i ask that they should feed me verily allah is the all provider owner of power the most strong
1046876 and whatever of blessings and good things you have it is from allah then when harm touches you unto him you cry aloud for help
1046877 and strive hard in allahs cause as you ought to strive with sincerity he has chosen you to convey islam and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship it is the religion of your father abraham islam it is he allah who has named you muslims both before and in this the quran that the messenger mohammad may be a witness over you and you be witnesses over mankind so offer prayer perfectly give zakat compulsory charity and hold fast to allah he is your lord what an excellent lord and what an excellent helper
1046878 so keep your duty to allah as much as you can
1046879 stand while praying if you cannot then while sitting and if you cannot then while laying on your side
1046880 so whoever of you sights the crescent on the first night of the month of ramadhan he must fast that month and whoever is ill or on a journey the same number of days he misses from other days
1046881 and whoever is removed away from the fire and admitted to paradise he indeed is successful the life of this world is only the enjoyment of deception
1046882 lets set aside for a moment the first two sentences and begin with verse 39b but if anyone strikes you on the right cheek turn the other also why does jesus specify the right cheek imagine you are a poor slave in ancient palestine and your master is facing you and about to strike you he cannot use his left hand since it was used only for unclean tasks therefore he must use his right hand he cannot strike you on your right cheek with a fist or with the front of his right hand since this would require him to twist or contort his arm thus in order to strike you on your right cheek he will have to use the back of his right hand in jesus culture hitting someone with the back of the hand was a gesture that had a very specific meaning this gesture was used only by those in a position of more power to humiliate those with less power masters would backhand slaves romans would backhand jews husbands would backhand wives and parents would backhand children the message was remember your place beneath me if you do what the passage says and turn your other cheek your left cheek and your master must still use his right hand then he can no longer backhand you if he hits you again he will have to use a fist hitting another with a fist was a gesture used between equals thus by turning your other cheek you have reclaimed your dignity and communicated that you refuse to be humiliated you have also invited your master to reclaim his true dignity by examining the lie by which he lives that one human being is better than another and you have done all of this nonviolently without striking back
1046883 yes you hurt me but i refuse to give you the power to let that hurt continue
1046884 the epidemic is far from over let me repeat the epidemic is far from over and we are going to be in this for the long haul first and foremost we must do a much better job of prevention this is the only way to get ahead and ensure an adequate long term response
1046885 homophobia is a societal sickness which impedes development limits expression and human rights such is the hatred for hiv aids that public health policy has been significantly slowed
1046886 they really wanted to blame somebody in the middle east
1046887 i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
1046888 and some of those tactics very frankly you mention the war in iraq are somewhat like that we use in the military you go into neighborhoods you clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control and you provide them with a stable environment and then they cooperate with law enforcement
1046889 repatriation is pretty much a death sentence in some of these cases ive seen patients bundled onto the plane and out of the country and once that person is out of sight hes out of mind
1046890 what we have today could in no way be described as a democracy today we have an oligarchy power limited to a closed circle
1046891 in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same us government that you aspire to lead and were talking about attacks like the subprime mortgage that you spoke of that wasnt just a general ambiguous kind of phenomenon but a phenomenon that targeted the african community and latino community attacks like the killing of sean bell by the new york police department and javon dawson right here in st petersburg by the st pete police and the jena six and hurricane katrina and the list goes on in the face of all these attacks that are clearly being made on the african community why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community or black community in this country
1046892 ive been talking about predatory lending for the last two years in the united states senate and worked to pass legislation to prevent it when i was in the state legislature and i have repeatedly said that many of the predatory loans that were made in the mortgage system did target african american and latino communities ive said that repeatedly number two jena six i was the first candidate to get out there and say this is wrong that theres an injustice thats been done and we need to change it thats number two when sean bell got shot i put out a statement immediately saying this is a problem
1046893 but in a nation in which 66 dell plans re entry into mp3 player market

1046907 were trying to clean up the place and hopefully not have people who are intimidating thuggish looking in the past weve had people come in with gangs and stuff like that we just want to provide a safe environment for our employees and our customers
1046908 we have turned away white people who were wearing those kind of clothes its not a race thing everything thats going on down the street henderson and capitol its attracting a different kind of customer were just kind of trying to roll with that and make sure when these people come in that theyre not intimidated in anyway and that kind of look can be intimidating we know were a dive were not trying to be upscale or turn it into an ultra lounge but again its about making sure that the customers we have feel safe and comfortable as well as our employees
1046909 finished files are the result of years of scientific study combined with
1046910 for annabel goldie to have spent last years election campaign claiming to be the only person who stood between alex salmond and the break up of the union and now to be exposed as having been in secret talks with the snp on scotlands constitutional future shows the sort of cynical disregard for the electorate which tories are often quick to accuse others of having
1046911 over the last year the tories have tried to defend their support for the snp administration by claiming that the relationship was open and transparent
1046912 i am pleased that the scottish government is consulting on using the powers introduced by the previous administration to introduce a licensing scheme for knife retailers
1046913 ministers should also consider introducing maximum seven year combined custody and community sentences for possession of a knife
1046914 it is impossible to take this governments claims that it is committed to cutting waste seriously when the snp has slashed funding to reduce waste

1046919 it was with great sadness that i learned of the death of russell johnston a friend and colleague for the best part of the last thirty years
1046920 it was during my last year at secondary school when i read russells pamphlet to be a liberal and joined the scottish liberal party the core liberal values which he articulated then together with his commitment to scotland and europe still resonate today that is why his memory will be cherished within the liberal family at home and abroad for a very long time to come
1046921 i am shocked at the news because judy and i last week spent the evening with him before we left on holiday russell johnston was the most powerful exponent of liberalism of his generation and a gifted orator his three great passions to which he devoted his life were the highlands scotland and europe
1046922 russell johnston was a great highlander a great liberal and a great european he was an inspirational figure whose example led many including myself into liberal politics in the highlands and across scotland
1046923 we are not trying to cause the economic collapse of the roman catholic church but to illustrate to the court the magnitude of the plot against our order

1046989 weet je dit is echt iets nationalistisch van de laatste jaren dat zag je vroeger helemaal niet in de communistentijd kwam alles uit blikken dat smaakte ook prima
1046990 ze kan eigenlijk helemaal niet tegen zoveel drank we moeten er voor uitkijken dat ze niet zoveel bestelt ze valt echt om zometeen

1047001 het feit dat je weer terug bent gelopen om iets over die wijn te vragen werd door haar natuurlijk als een pass ervaren waartegenover zij niet onwelgevallig stond
1047002 ik denk niet dat ze zelf begrijpt wat er op haar t shirt staat
1047003 kijk je wel uit zometeen bij het naar de wc gaan of je moet het lekker vinden maar dat moet je natuurlijk helemaal zelf weten
1047004 je bent een beetje stil heb je nog last van je kater

1047011 ja ik zag duidelijk hoe je het aan haar gaf
1047012 piet zeg dat nou niet anders houdt ze nooit op

1047143 we were basically aiming to do facial capture on set
1047144 and not just to get a general look but to be pixel perfect the work we did was new and at the edge of anything done before i think in terms of the way we tracked it onto the face we used a mixture of commercial software chiefly movimento tracking software designed for use with multiple cameras in house developed software and some new techniques we devised
1047145 because of the logistics it was sometimes impossible to get many witness cameras in place for example when the action was taking place in the back seat of a car
1047146 was to get enough detail into our cg to give it realism in doing so we worked at much higher texture resolution than we normally use and we also rendered our cg work at 4k even for the 2k anamorphic shots
1047147 we believe its important for film enthusiasts to decide on the winner rather than a panel of jurors or film critics everyone who watches the selected films has an opportunity to voice their opinion
1047148 after many years of development and production its exhilarating to have such a positive reception from audiences
1047149 seeing the reactions from festival attendees as they watched our film made all our hard work worthwhile

1047153 cgi can be really great and i think its a great tool but i think we should have been more involved with makeup in the transformation
1047154 because basically we arent involved with the transformation at this point which is one of the more fun things to do in a movie
1047155 at this point nothings really been done that is permanent
1047156 so im lobbying to be part of that ive been talking to the producers and saying its my creation in the end theres a certain logic in the design of it i know its different between benicios face and the wolf face because i sculpted that face i know how the anatomy changes i should at least be giving some guidance to the guys who are doing the transformation in cgi
1047157 i saw on my last day at pinewood studios some of the work they were doing and i wasnt crazy about some of the direction it was going in
1047158 they had things right in front of me that they werent seeing for example we have between our canine teeth four teeth dogs have six teeth and the wolf man has six teeth between his canine teeth they had some illustrations they did scans of the makeup and some transformation things and they had the actual canine teeth drawn in the wrong stage of the transformation
1047159 and they said really it doesnt look like it and im like well 1 2 3 4 you can just count
1047160 if chinese officials see the benefit of that im sure we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement

1047168 we are disappointed that we have not yet received a response from iran
1047169 we agreed in the absence of a clear positive response from iran that we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran
1047170 the incentives package contained everything iran needed to pursue a modern civil nuclear power program which irans leaders claim is their aim the pressure on iran to comply with the demands of the international community and its u n security council obligations will only grow
1047171 but to begin again to prepare sanctions resolutions for the u n security council

1047181 thats an awful lot of carbon we do not want emitted into the atmosphere professor mackay said
1047182 we need to look at forests through fresh eyes prof mackay said
1047183 the policy can no longer be blind to the green carbon thats in these natural forests he said
1047184 we need to start factoring in the carbon value of these forests when deciding what to do with them
1047185 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
1047186 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
1047187 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
1047188 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
1047189 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
1047190 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
1047191 i think its come to the point where there needs to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans

1047193 specifically merrill lynch permitted its sales and trading including auction desk managers to unduly influence and pressure the research department in a number of ways first it allowed sales and trading to directly request and advocate for written research to be published endorsing the safety and high quality of nearly all types of ars and recommending investors buy ars
1047194 in one instance a managing director in charge of merrills auction desk frances constable directly emailed martin mauro a fixed income analyst in the research department with the following
1047195 any renewed research focusing on the high quality of closed end fund preferreds of all tax status auction municipal bonds and student loan backed bonds wrapped around the value added proposition of todays rates would be extremely helpful
1047196 suggest he call outside the call he is focusing attention away from your positive message
1047197 we are disappointed that massachusetts filed this action because it ignores the only reason our advisors sold auction rate securities they believed they were good investments for clients willing to trade some liquidity for higher return the inarguable fact is the number of auctions that had failed in nearly two decades of ars sales was small in 2007 there were no failed auctions of securities sold to retail clients and in fact none to these clients until late january 2008
1047198 i had called him after he had won the nomination we joked about the fact that if youd asked the pundits a year ago who were going to be the two nominees it wouldnt have been me and john mccain

1047203 the oil markets main focus right now is on any weakness that signals a slowdown in the economy and this personal spending report is further evidence of that

1047215 i mean youre pale and your hair is dull and lifeless but im guessing you always look like that
1047216 as i can tell from your silly little scrunched up face and crossed eyes you are obviously trying to fathom why im here
1047217 im going to cut to the chase abigail jake told me to stop by and make sure you were alright but i have a few things id like to get straight with you
1047218 jake mcintyres wide eyed secretary doting on him making his calls and hiding his dirty little secrets and now every fly in his web has had that first little movement that captured his attention hes good looking powerful cocky with balls to back it up there are lots of girls like you i bet you dont know that hell his wife is like you so obedient never asking questions though between you and me she knows everything the funny thing is shes not even on his radar so the question little girl is what you did to you so to make the big guy take note
1047219 the mousy girl who writes down all sorts of shocking little secrets in her little book i can imagine what happened knowing jake he saw it and he told you to bring it to him you fought it and beat yourself up and eventually you did
1047220 youre wrong i didnt fight it i gave it to him right then and there
1047221 poor thing do you think of jake being the one
1047222 you are completely unaware arent you you are just getting his coffee and keeping a schedule of his rendezvous and writing in your little diary all the dirty things you think about
1047223 you dont even know that men would fall over for you if you just dressed yourself up look at those lips big pouting bee stung lips those eyes huge and innocent not to mention that bottom
1047224 you think jake wouldnt fuck you he would he will youre just not ready yet hes not for beginners jakes a bad boy he can trample a woman i see the boys in your office they fuck the nineteen year old cigarette girls and the coat check girls and the doe eyed junior secretaries jake likes women he likes someone who can take roughness and isnt going to break
1047225 no he spanks me he slaps me he never hits me
1047226 no i suppose he wouldnt he has a lot of rules in that head of his anyhow i dont want to know if i dont read it then i can just think the worst the dirtiest
1047227 well mister jacob mcintyre asked me to stop by and wanted me to give you the message that he is sorry you are feeling under the weather and he hopes that his assignment yesterday wasnt too difficult and he hopes it wasnt that which led to your absence
1047228 he said that when you come back tomorrow everything can go back to the way it was but if you return with what he requested he may have additional responsibilities for you
1047229 i think because of my relationship with your employer and the fact that we hardly know each other you should probably answer me in a way that your bosss clients and friends are used to being addressed
1047230 well i suppose i will be seeing you abigail or not
1047231 its great our dams are a few inches short of being full and coming up for the summer that will be the best thing

1047233 the phone conversation has not been conclusive we do not exclude new contacts in the coming days
1047234 they emphasised continuing the course of the geneva talks the preservation of this course requires a constructive and positive environment
1047235 we agreed in the absence of a clear positive response from iran that we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran as part of this strategy
1047236 unless tomorrows answer is unambiguous and positive we will have no choice but to proceed with further sanctions measures
1047237 when it comes to our inalienable rights we will press ahead
1047238 demonstrating or fundraising activities including but not limited to commercial religious political military territorial human rights and animal and environmental protection activities
1047239 any kind of demonstration or political religious or racial propaganda in any olympic sites venues or other areas
1047240 the signage does feel a little bit aggressive and in your face
1047241 i can definitely think of more welcoming signs they could have put up
1047242 welcome olympic games with joyfulness and construct a harmonious society

1047246 the federal government says they had money to help the irrigators and we could help growers move pumps to the river murray to access fresh water
1047247 we need to have access to that now so we can plan strategies across private land to the river and be ready to go when the weather warms up
1047248 the commitment by the previous government is currently under review
1047249 many of the concerns expressed by panel members when the original proposal was refused last month
1047250 adelaide house prices never fall in dramatic fashion and seem to hold up very well
1047251 on a superficial level the bush administration leaves the us on better terms in asia than in other regions
1047252 but at a deeper level theres been a hollowing out of our capabilities and a deteriorating of our strengths that will require full attention at home
1047253 will reduce our attraction in such a dynamic region as asia
1047254 in certain cases it might be a place which is an upmarket area and they have a really nice property and they have a lot of valuables and they want an armed guard there to protect their property while the teenage party is going on
1047255 but armed guards are only there to protect property theyre not there to screen guests and control fights thats just not the case thats what the crowd controllers are there for
1047256 but the worst part was we had another 200 or 300 kids outside trying to get in and they were climbing on the next door roof and ripping palings off the back fence
1047257 it destroyed them but by the power of god it did not destroy me
1047258 it was the result of a late night jam session and something we did for a bit of a laugh featuring a blues riff we have been playing live recently upon which skinner recorded some vocals

1047262 it is time to recognize the incalculable value of wetlands to all species ours included
1047263 if we dont plan and invest properly now the cost to recreate artificially the services wetlands provide will dwarf the cost of preserving and protecting them in the first place
1047264 inadequate national development policies lack of implementation of existing laws and the lack of long term land use planning that negatively affect wetlands on public and private property
1047265 freshwater biodiversity is declining faster than terrestrial or marine biodiversity and wetland species are especially prone to decline and extinction
1047266 a modern wetland policy based on sound scientific knowledge and able to reconcile economic development with environmental protection and social welfare is required in all countries
1047267 some countries have high standards for wetland management restoration and protection however many others are far behind joint efforts across political boundaries are needed to combine all our efforts to stop and reverse the loss and degradation of wetlands sound policies and activities are needed now
1047268 we call attention to the fact that many signatories have not yet fulfilled theses requirement and ask for immediate action from the respective governments
1047269 we encourage non member states to join the convention and strengthen the global effort needed to sustainably manage wetlands
1047270 it is time to recognize the incalculable value of wetlands to all species ours included
1047271 if we dont plan and invest properly now the cost to recreate artificially the services wetlands provide will dwarf the cost of preserving and protecting them in the first place

1047282 for me he was a good buddy at the park and away from the park we always had a lot of great laughs he will be very sorely missed
1047283 i believe the likelihood of rescheduling sporting events due to air quality concerns is very low
1047284 should environmental departments foresee serious air pollution during the olympics beijing and neighboring areas will temporarily close more factories and pull more cars off the road

1047287 desde mi ltima gira mundial hace unos cuantos a os atr s he estado anhelando el grabar un proyecto de adoraci n en vivo que refleje algo m s global algo que nunca antes hab a hecho una colecci n de canciones y voces que transmitan lo que experiment esos a os hab a tenido la esperanza de crear una tarde de adoraci n que refleje las esquinas de nuestra naci n y del mundo pienso que capturamos eso
1047288 mi gran amigo israel houghton el renombrado y mundialmente famoso coro africano de ni os un joven e incre ble l der de adoraci n como coalo zamorano y un coro de 250 voces elevaron las canciones a momentos asombrosos de alabanza y adoraci n fue m s de lo que pude haber esperado

1047292 you must be kidding me this country really needs a new president this country is so messed up its such a joke and its quite upsetting frankly how hypocritical this country has become its ok for children to see people killed by guns spreading a little love right now would be a good idea she is being a little sexy but they are not provocative they are really well done the spot is really beautiful i really cant believe this is happening i dont know what else to say
1047293 it was good to come out tonight and help the team out to get some points
1047294 i got a goal without defenders and crossbars in my way tonight i finished it well so i was happy
1047295 when hes on the field we just try to trick out the other team he plays to his strengths and that allows me to get a bit more freedom and get past some defenders it also gives me a bit more time and space with the ball nates been doing a great job so i hope we can continue to do that the rest of the season and continue to score goals
1047296 i thought we had enough chances to win the game in all the times ive coached columbus in the three times weve played here this is the most chances weve created here and if we finished i think were in the game
1047297 the other one they called it an offside but i took a look at the replay and im not positive it was the right call the one i did make i saw i found myself in right position just inside the box it always feels good to get that first goal in we got the win with that and that makes it twice as good
1047298 the kid has matured a lot in the last three weeks and has built confidence hes a goal scorer hes always looking around and can make plays because hes also a good passer he got himself in two good spots tonight the first was taken away from him and the second he was calm enough to put away
1047299 when you come out the way you did the first 45 minutes against a good team with players like moreno emilio and fred you set yourself up for a difficult night
1047300 so i think our approach and our first half mentality ended up being the reason we lost the game
1047301 it was nice to have a full week to work on things especially with so many guys out we wanted to make sure we maintained the discipline and work hard and make sure everyone took defending first i dont think we created as many chances but the dedication to work and get back behind the ball and competing was ten fold better and thats what you need to get shutouts and obviously the shutout goes right along with it
1047302 the ball was just loose and i was hanging around the area i almost gave up on it but i thought i would stay down there and hopefully something would come up

1047317 they vion have obviously a huge role to play in the sector and in the future of scottish agriculture there will be an announcement by the end of this month certainly
1047318 we did not have enough foreign currency us dollars to pay our suppliers because the banks sold us dollars at such a high level

1047330 i am also convinced of the need for the scottish government to make its own case on regulations affecting scotland directly to the eu rather than relying on westminster departments
1047331 that is something we will take forward at both eu and uk level
1047332 red tape is a very real problem for firms and one of the most significant avoidable constraints on competitiveness and business growth
1047333 the finance secretarys announcement is most welcome reflects much of what cbi scotland wanted to hear and is a testament to government and business working together
1047334 it is crucial that these reforms apply not only to government inspired regulation but also to legislation emanating from parliamentary committees and backbench members bills
1047335 this is advance planning for 10 20 or more years down the road
1047336 women are more than smart enough to see that mccains policies are a disaster he is anti every reproductive issue weve ever fought for

1047338 the probleml with our immigration policy isnt the poor mexicans trying to gain a better life for there families but those who are profiting from them like the drug lords etc
1047339 if were truly going to be the city we promote ourselves to be a world class 21st century city that advances its values and principles were going to have to try new things
1047340 people are used to doing things a certain way and when you change that they say it cant be done well weve proved them wrong
1047341 we believe with the support of the government with the help of the international community we have the confidence and the ability to host a safe and secure olympic games
1047342 as the fight against aids nears the end of its third decade we are still facing a huge shortfall in resources
1047343 the responses to hiv and aids require long term and sustained financing as more people go on treatment and live longer budgets will have to increase considerably over the next few decades in the most affected countries donors will have to provide the majority of the funding
1047344 we dare not let down our guard this is an unforgiving epidemic
1047345 we are going to be in this for the long haul
1047346 every day almost three times as many people become newly infected with hiv as those who start taking antiretroviral therapy
1047347 many of us want to be doctors or teachers i want to be a singer but these dreams will only be possible when we have medicines when were accepted in schools and when we can grow up in an atmosphere free from violence stigma and discrimination
1047348 reminiscent of benito mussolinis edict of the 1920s which banned groups of five or more people
1047349 gatherings in a bid to protect public decorum and prevent damage to public parks and gardens
1047350 there is no emergency situation in novara there is no need for such a fascist edict there are other better ways to tackle the citys problems
1047351 this is needed to limit public disturbance the citizens of novara asked for it i understand opposition left councillors plan to gather and protest in groups of more than three we will not fine them this time
1047352 one thing i will say though is that to compare the ordinance with fascism is absurd we are trying to solve issues but are being accused of fascism
1047353 i really dont see the need for troops on streets it will have a completely negative effect
1047354 i have already had people calling me after reading reports of troops on streets in italy and asking me is there some sort of civil war going on
1047355 its an image boosting operation that risks turning into a boomerang
1047356 it will make italy look like a country in the grip of an uncontrolled security emergency
1047357 paratroopers guarding the centres of the major tourist cities arent exactly a great calling card for a country at the height of the tourist season
1047358 we will have one soldier for every 10 municipalities doing nothing except going to the bar with a policeman its a joke and to cap it all its only a provisional measure
1047359 when you are nervous about everything else you put your money in a toll road

1047361 were just looking at ways to be more efficient and thats why i used the term public private partnerships trying to find some creative solutions
1047362 the reason im avoiding taxes is because i think taxes are addictive
1047363 i would hate for them to make this a habit and take it into the community
1047364 they could get themselves into some serious situations that could impact their futures
1047365 theft is always a consideration when you are working with adolescents cash high value food and some employees earning near the minimum wage
1047366 i think there are an awful lot of mistakes that are made
1047367 call it what you want lifting ripping off its stealing and it hurts everyone
1047368 its okay for the government to watch them at all times
1047369 i dont want a situation where one of our kids makes a mistake and then they are 25 years old applying for a job and somehow that image ends up on youtube
1047370 how to deploy and use these kinds of substances so you start to piece it all together
1047371 its tricking the muscle into believing its been exercised daily
1047372 we oppose the visit by bush who sells u s beef with its risk of mad cow disease that threatens the health and lives of the public
1047373 just as lee paid a big price to stay at camp david in april bush will be looking to go home with a big catch
1047374 we must treat every suspicious item the same and utilize the tools we have available to make a final determination
1047375 procedures are in place for a reason and this is a clear indication our workforce is doing a great job
1047376 and this rule means that all homemade electronics are confiscated because anything homemade with wires can look like a bomb to someone who doesnt know better the rule just doesnt work
1047377 and in todays passengers fight back world do you think anyone is going to successfully do anything with a fake bomb
1047378 thousands of dollars in excessive compensation for airfare hotels mileage and personal cell phone calls
1047379 activities that cannot withstand public scrutiny without embarrassment do not safeguard the public trust in the integrity of mndot and undermine public trust in the department

1047385 what about the homes of your uncles aunts or friends from school
1047386 its how the accumulation of small differences add up to one big difference
1047387 the idea that they are going to use this scheme to inform on their parents is really like something out of 1984
1047388 its a dreadful throwback to fascist times schools should be more balanced

1047398 aids 2008 is taking place at a unique moment in the epidemic when there is widespread consensus on the urgency of ensuring universal access to hiv prevention treatment care and support by 2010
1047399 what we now need is action on the part of all stakeholders as we gather in mexico each of us must ask ourselves what can i do to end aids in 2008 there are no longer bystanders in this global struggle

1047435 our absence focused minds on the problems within the communion and spoke louder than our presence would have

1047516 this jump in incarceration rates represents a massive intervention in american families at a time when the federal government was making claims that it was less involved in their lives
1047517 these kinds of rates were not historically true 30 years ago today we are giving people custodial sentences that we wouldnt have in the past for victimless crimes our justice system has become more punitive
1047518 we usually dont think of the prison system as something that is a policy shift but the public health risks and the effects on migration and fertility show that it has had fundamental consequences for all of us
1047519 it is in our own self interest to be concerned and certainly from a fiscal standpoint we have an interest in times of financial difficulty we have a fixed amount of money and for every dollar we spend on incarceration we have one dollar less to spend on education and other things this is a challenging public policy question

1047591 barack obamas latest attack ads shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy
1047592 after all it was senator obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
1047593 we were told a special election could be as much as 400 000 and we thought whoa thats not good government

1047596 wakeupwalmart com has known all along that such a widespread problem was a matter of corporate culture and company wide policy
1047597 wal mart knowingly denied its employees breaks so that it could make a greater profit its managers and executives ignored audits and reports showing abuse of federal law to protect their bottom line it is one of the most flagrant examples in long tradition of putting profit over people
1047598 i cant afford health care and it behooves you to keep your workforce healthy
1047599 the dosage she gave was 20 times what was ordered it was 100 milligrams instead of five thats because it was undiluted

1047602 when you go to most chain restaurants ordering off the kids menu is a nightmare
1047603 right now kids meals are almost all unhealthy meals when they should be almost all healthy meals
1047604 at the very least restaurants should list calories on the menu so that parents can navigate through this minefield of calories and fat to find the healthy options
1047605 there have been a lot of changes to our restaurant menus especially childrens meals more and more options are available restaurants are offering low fat milk yogurt apples and vegetables as part of the childrens menu they are helping parents help their children make wise choices when they dine out
1047606 kids meals can be outrageously high in calories fat and sodium but its possible to go into just about any restaurant and cobble together a healthy meal for a child if the childrens menu doesnt look healthy you have to look elsewhere
1047607 eating out is no longer a special occasion its a lifestyle now so we have to be more selective about what we eat
1047608 this is a wakeup call that parents need to take advantage of restaurants healthier options especially if kids are going to be eating out three or more times a week
1047609 most kids dont clean their plates so they are probably not eating all these calories

1047623 we should sell 70 million barrels of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve for less expensive crude which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks

1047749 there are no developments in belek currently within golf courses because the courses are not owned by companies but by the government and under the registration of the ministry of forestry and agriculture
1047750 you cannot develop property on green areas as these are protected so the properties are built beside them
1047751 it is almost impossible to finance the cost of such a big land plot plus the construction of a golf course and on site homes for the profit margin available
1047752 we have some beautiful properties in belek and the local council has made great strides in recent years to improve the town
1047753 the standard of the golf courses and club houses are superb on a par with the best in spain
1047754 apartments should bring in around 250 to 350 per week with villas renting from 500 up to around 700

1047758 a holland man is under arrest for assault and deputies in springville say theyre treating this case a hate crime erie county sheriffs deputies say the assault on the 47 year old male victim was caught on tape by a nearby surveillance camera
1047759 when i walked down here the next morning there was quite a bit of blood on the sidewalk where the assault had taken place
1047760 theres some pushing and shoving and then you see fists flying and what looks like people kicking and things like that
1047761 the police station is just a block away and you would have just wanted someone to have called and it could have been stopped or minimized
1047762 they called me later that day after i gave them the videos and they said they were able to identify all but one person on the video that they felt was involved

1047767 50 mn bags of production in brazil could send indian coffee prices racing down
1047768 however it is too early to say anything definite regarding the final output for the year
1047769 to say that barack obama did not intentionally inject the idea of his name and his race is a lie
1047770 there is no doubt in my mind that sen obama is trying to suggest that he is the victim of something
1047771 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1047772 to say that that is not trying to inject the idea that you are a victim of john mccain trying to make fun of your name and your racial background is a lie
1047773 i dont think you beat obama by saying that hes paris hilton
1047774 the more important thing is really to look at is he who he says he is is he really this great reformer
1047775 its not that obama is a bad person its just that hes like all the rest of them not a reformer not a messiah just like all the rest of them in washington and just like all the other liberals too
1047776 too many of those criticizing obama have been content merely to slander him
1047777 an intellectual laziness among the very people who should be carefully scrutinizing obama
1047778 an hour later he was already calling the sun times back to clarify his comments
1047779 should he become president will he entrust such men and women with executive power
1047780 if youre a liberal reading the following might make you support obama even more
1047781 but if youre honest i think youll agree hes no centrist
1047782 gt wtf wtf is this was she raped or what
1047783 speaking as someone who is riding a motorcycle now i dont have much leverage

1047785 there are grains of truth in the suggestion that in moving you may find yourself in or out of some ones favour but listen to the slow delicate even introspective background some breeze some chimes some distant thunder as each focal point remains a lament

1047994 youth leagues community leagues it has to be a bookend approach
1047995 the problem is that so many kids are specializing these days and getting so wrapped up in one sport that it can feel like a business thats why you have to have coaches who really are mentors and know how to work with the academic side of things with parents with lifeskills development not just the sports side of things
1047996 just because people rise to some status through athletics doesnt mean that they know how to live with that status or how to make a positive impact with it we try to do to a lot of education around good citizenship and leadership and sportsmanship even transcending the field and going out into the community to get them thinking of the community as a larger group of teammates
1047997 somewhere along the line a lot of people picked up the assumption that if you were well behaved and had high graduation rates and did a lot of community service that that meant somehow that you couldnt win football games but i havent seen any stats to prove that and in many respects its probably over the long term a lot healthier for the bottom line if you want to argue the financial side of it to live better and to put the right people on the field
1047998 when you think about the broader context it goes beyond fun and games
1047999 you have to look at the role of higher education in our culture for 350 years
1048000 the message that were sending when these kinds of things happen is that sports is more important
1048001 any way you slice it whether its right or wrong college athletics are the clearest and cleanest and largest window through which the american public views american higher education
1048002 if theres any institution in america that has to stand up and say that education is more important than athletics its colleges and universities and yet time and time again we see instances like this where its clear that athletics is really what its about

1048015 the athletes are very pleased with the village and the training venues and competition sites most have been here for test events but to come back and see all the improvements that have been made we knew the chinese were going to be ready but we are very pleased with what we see right now
1048016 its one of the nicest apartments ive ever stayed in
1048017 i have been here three days and two of the three were very nice
1048018 we are still confident that by the time the games start the air quality will be good
1048019 we are hoping in the next three days the sky will be blue and the air quality will be there
1048020 you try not to get out in the sun too much so you dont get tired from sweating all day
1048021 every athlete that we have talked to is very impressed and amazed by the quality of this village
1048022 personally i have never seen such a nice village in nine games
1048023 after being here a week you get the same kind of things
1048024 they were taking every question seriously and making sure they will solve every problem
1048025 of course we will have a couple of problems along the way

1048030 im sad about the conversation you chose to publish regarding myself and alon her son who volunteered a comment when i was videotaping his mom about td

1048034 do you think that when you write something along those lines that could have an impact on for example my sons interaction with his uncle

1048070 the conservatism that speaks to us through its actions in washington is institutionally opposed to those baseline good intentions we learned about in elementary school its leaders laugh off the idea of the public interest as airy fairy nonsense they caution against bringing top notch talent into government service they declare war on public workers they have made a cult of outsourcing and privatizing they have wrecked established federal operations because they disagree with them and they have deliberately piled up an everest of debt in order to force the government into crisis the ruination they have wrought has been thorough it has been a professional job repairing it will require years of political action
1048071 we are a free and sovereign people we govern ourselves and the government is ours but that is the point we are responsible not our leaders since we follow them we let them divert our loyalty from the united states to some party we let them boss the party and turn our municipal democracies into autocracies and our republican nation into a plutocracy we cheat our government and we let our leaders loot it and we let them wheedle and bribe our sovereignty from us

1048115 president bushs visit to beijing almost looks like a vacation right down to a family reunion but his three nation asian trip also takes him to the doorsteps of two troublesome regimes while forcing him to balance the olympic spirit with the delicacies of diplomacy
1048116 the prospect for controversy at the olympics in beijing where bush is to arrive thursday has already been well documented

1048123 president bush met privately with five chinese activists at the white house on tuesday promising to carry the message of freedom to the summer olympics in beijing next week
1048124 bush has repeatedly said he views the beijing games as being about athletics rather than politics and he has resisted calls to boycott the opening ceremonies on aug 8 but
1048125 he told the activists that engagement with chinese leaders gives him an opportunity to make the united states position clear human rights and religious freedom should not be denied to anyone white house press secretary dana perino said in a
1048126 bush also dropped in on a meeting between chinas foreign minister and national security adviser stephen j hadley bush told yang jiechi that hosting the olympics presents the chinese with an opportunity to demonstrate compassion on human rights and freedom the statement said
1048127 part of an intensifying white house effort to put pressure on beijing before mr

1048129 mr green said mr bushs meeting with the dissidents had been aimed at both addressing his critics and sending a pointed message to the chinese
1048130 another month another new low for george w bush just 28 percent in the new post abc poll approve of the way the president is handling his job this marks a new career low in post polling and is the 40th consecutive month his ratings have been under 50 percent
1048131 his negative rating has also hit a record with 69 percent saying they disapprove of his job performance and the percentage holding strongly negative views is up to 56 percent another new high and nearly five times the number who strongly approve
1048132 while most republicans remain steadfastly behind the president a third now disapprove including two in 10 who strongly disapprove this is the first time so many republicans have expressed such sharply negative views of bushs tenure strong disapproval among democrats has also reached a new high in the poll 81 percent
1048133 28 percent said they approve of the job bush is doing tying his low in the ap ipsos survey set last april
1048134 just 63 percent of republicans and 46 percent of conservatives approved of bushs handling of his job strikingly low numbers
1048135 with soaring fuel prices ailing financial and housing markets and rising inflation bush got his lowest grade for handling the economy just 24 percent approved of how hes dealing with it tying last months ap ipsos low on that issue
1048136 only half of republicans gave bush good grades on the economy as did hardly any democrats or independents
1048137 this is hardly the way he wanted to go out
1048138 as of tuesday bush had 189 days before he walks out of the oval office for the last time his term is ending with americans on edge the mood of the country sour
1048139 the dark side the inside story of how the war on terror turned into a war on american ideals
1048140 after interviewing hundreds of sources in and around the bush white house i think it is clear that many of the legal steps taken by the so called war council were less a new paradigm as alberto gonzales dubbed it than an old political wish list consisting of grievances that cheney and his legal adviser david addington had been compiling for decades
1048141 before september 11 2001 these extreme political positions would not have stood a change of being instituted they would never have survived democratic scrutiny but by september 12 2001 president bush and vice president cheney were extraordinarily empowered political opposition evaporated as critics feared being labeled anti patriotic or worse
1048142 matthew waxman who in 2001 was serving as special assistant to then national security adviser condoleezza rice told mayer that the decision to frame the u
1048143 little deliberation occurred because none was deemed necessary as mayer makes clear the white house seized upon the prospect of open ended war with alacrity and why not in the near term at least going to war almost invariably works to the benefit of the executive branch war elicits deference from congress and the courts as a wartime commander in chief the president wields greater clout in this particular case war also helped deflect demands for accountability despite what mayer describes as the worst intelligence failure in the nations history the aftermath of 9 11 saw not a single senior official fired
1048144 in the area of security cooperation the president and iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki agreed that improving conditions should allow for the agreements now under negotiation to include a general time horizon for meeting aspirational goals such as the resumption of iraqi security control in their cities and provinces and the further reduction of u s combat forces from iraq the president and prime minister agreed that the goals would be based on continued improving conditions on the ground and not an arbitrary date for withdrawal
1048145 on the statement about maliki the conversation with maliki and agreement to have a time some sort of a timetable is this not giving into well basically doing what the democrats have been asking for
1048146 can you define for us a little bit what the aspirational goal might be or what it might look like in an agreement
1048147 wall street got drunk thats one of the reasons i asked you to turn off the tv cameras it got drunk and now its got a hangover the question is how long will it sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
1048148 and then we got a housing issue not in houston and evidently not in dallas because laura was over there trying to buy a house today
1048149 its uh caused me to lose my train of thought
1048150 the presidents blunt remarks were a sharp departure from the more measured tones he uses publicly to discuss the economy and national housing market collapse
1048151 bushs remarks are a departure from the more conservative tone he usually takes when speaking to the press earlier last week in fact the president preached optimism about the economy in a nationally televised news conference
1048152 he acknowledged that the economy was experiencing a tough time but did not compare the current situation to a hangover
1048153 mr bush has rarely been caught on video making such frank remarks before a friendly audience about a politically sensitive topic proving that even the carefully guarded white house is susceptible to being caught off guard in the new era of the endless internet campaign
1048154 my friends i am a flip flopper my friends i am a flip flopper my friends

1048158 but they can always get one over on us every once in a while
1048159 president george w bush was strong and in good spirits as he met this morning with a small group of journalists for about 90 minutes in the oval office topics across the board were discussed as always in these meetings some of the juiciest stuff is off the record too bad because the president has an awful lot of important things to say on so many of these issues but ground rules are ground rules
1048160 mr bush reiterated what he has said in a number of these meetings that in the office of the president character matters a lot he said you have to have clear principles and strong beliefs to execute all the responsibilities that are part of the job
1048161 i would say as someone who has been privileged to attend these gatherings in the past not only did the president show the inner strength he always has but when he does reflect on the tumultuous events of his tenure he is completely at peace with himself and his decisions
1048162 the session maddeningly and often foolishly punctuated by long off the record musings and soliloquies mostly dealt with foreign policy
1048163 dressed in a pale blue suit with a crisp blue tie the president seemed to be in high spirits as he discussed developments in north korea and other diplomatic initiatives crushing my hopes for a poignant bush in winter column
1048164 w hether it is ultimately deemed a failure or a success there is one inconvenient fact of the bush presidency that should prove dismaying to those whove invested so much in demonizing it it isnt that special
1048165 many of its supposedly radical features fit neatly in the mainstream of american presidential history
1048166 mr president what do you say to critics who claim that youve accepted a watered down declaration just to get something done before you leave office i mean you said that it doesnt address the uranium enrichment issue and of course it doesnt address what north korea might have done to help syria build its reactor
1048167 well first let me review where we have been in the past we would provide benefits to the north koreans in the hope that they would fulfill a vague promise in other words thats the way it was before i came into office everybody was concerned about north korea possessing a nuclear weapon everybody was concerned about the proliferation activities and yet the policy in the past was here are some benefits for you and we hope that you respond and of course we found they werent responding and so our policy has changed that says in return for positive action in return for verifiable steps we will reduce penalties and there are plenty of restrictions still on north korea and so my point is this is that well see
1048168 president bush today lifted some trade sanctions against north korea and acted to remove the country from a list of states that sponsor terrorism after the isolated stalinist regime turned over a key document detailing its rogue nuclear program
1048169 nearly seven years after bush described north korea as part of an axis of evil and less than two years after pyongyang stunned the world by exploding a small nuclear device bush said the receipt of the nuclear disclosure marked the start of an action for action process meant to end with the full dismantling of the countrys nuclear facilities and weapons
1048170 provisions of the trading with the enemy act were lifted today by
1048171 president bushs record unpopularity is playing an unprecedented role in the 2008 campaign complicating john mccains task among key constituencies
1048172 mr bushs second term slide in the polls has been especially sharp among independents a group that sen mccain depends on now for mr mccain to win in november at least one third of mccains voters will have to be people who disapprove of the job george bush is doing most of them independents says republican pollster neil newhouse and sen mccain must accomplish that feat while continuing to align himself with mr bush on some of the administrations most controversial policies notably the iraq war
1048173 white house aides contend that polling methods fail to sufficiently sample their sympathizers noting that the gap between self identifying democrats and republicans tends to close dramatically in election day exit polling
1048174 more broadly its been common for voters to express a desire for change at the end of a two term presidency says ed gillespie counselor to the president
1048175 white house officials believe theyve had a series of policy successes recently including improving stability in iraq combating global hiv aids and restoring close ties with western europe they note that approval ratings for congress are even lower than the presidents at an abysmal 13 in the latest journal poll theres frustration with washington and our numbers reflect that mr gillespie says unhappiness with the economy and high fuel prices is another factor aides insist that mr bushs willingness to make unpopular decisions eventually will be vindicated

1048178 this country needs a new president this country is so messed up its such a joke and its quite upsetting frankly how hypocritical this country has become its ok for children to see people killed by guns spreading a little love right now would be a good idea
1048179 it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign it is a complete waste of the countrys tme and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1048180 my parents fought to get me a college education when did going to harvard become a bad thing

1048183 as we head into the fall and holiday travel season known to be the most crowded of the year travelers are looking for peace of mind and a guarantee that their luggage will simply arrive at their final destination
1048184 consumers now are forced to pay even bigger fees for items such as golf clubs skis and surfboards without a guarantee theyll even make it on time
1048185 whether youre traveling to a conference and need an entire trade show booth transported or on vacation and just want to ensure your golf clubs make it to the resort the luggage club takes the worry out of the equation

1048260 president bush called yesterday for lifting the 27 year old ban on u s offshore oil drilling joining sen john mccain in endorsing an idea that republicans hope will gain traction in congress and on the campaign trail as the price of gasoline soars
1048261 democratic leaders in congress said the plan is going nowhere
1048262 one was an oilman from texas the other a high paid energy executive despite that or perhaps because of it for seven years george w bush and dick cheney have been unable to persuade congress and the public that domestic oil drilling is an answer to americas energy needs
1048263 with the clock running down on his presidency mr bush made one last push wednesday by calling on congress to end the 27 year moratorium on most offshore drilling with oil at more than 130 a barrel gasoline over 4 a gallon and the broader economy threatened the white house is betting it can finally break a decades old washington deadlock between those who favor domestic oil exploration and those who say conservation is the key
1048264 if anything democrats say the white house action gives them a chance to paint mr bush as beholden to the oil industry and mr mccain as a clone of mr bush a message that will only grow louder as the november election draws near
1048265 to have president bush be the face of this issue for the republicans means having the worst possible spokesman said geoff garin a democratic strategist who helped run senator hillary rodham clintons presidential campaign

1048282 we all need to fill our classes and replace students who have been taken off wait lists at other institutions the wait list activity could extend for a significant time
1048283 our class is coming in exactly the way we wanted it to fitting into the plan we had to get to a class of 1 240
1048284 harvard will admit somewhere in the range of 150 to 175 from the waiting list possibly more depending on late may 1 returns and other waiting list activity
1048285 were over target right now so were in good shape
1048286 but im keeping a small group on the wait list because i think therell be some impact of wait list activity at other schools
1048287 in a holding pattern because it depends on what other schools do
1048288 theres a domino effect that has an impact on all of us
1048289 but not so much that going to the waiting list is out of the question if we lost a lot to other schools
1048290 in the last few years more and more kids have been getting put on wait lists
1048291 now were seeing more get off the wait lists and earlier it used to be a formal letter
1048292 but this year its still early may and weve had a kid who got a call at home at night saying youre off the wait list do you want to come weve already had kids get off waitlists at n y u b u fairfield and quinnipiac

1048421 i really like the folky feel of the schwarz remix well done once again will play this for sure llorcas version is also a really nice summer tune
1048422 wow another anthem from bern amazing rmx by marcel dettmann one of his best so far
1048423 amazing package indeed all the mixes are outstanding impossible to pick a favourite i can see myself playing all four and im not the only one it seems but then a package this good is such a rarity trawling through hundreds of mediocre electronic promos can be more than kind of depressing sometimes stuff like this makes it all worthwhile excellent
1048424 henriks mix is great and the dettmann mix is wicked
1048425 another cool one from marcel i like what this guy is doing
1048426 man o man super bomb by swiss master of detroit soul
1048427 really nice package marcel kicks the floor schwarz breakin hearts and original is my radio tune thx
1048428 the vocal is wicked on this track pure soul excellent stuff
1048429 superb release nice feeling perfect vocals dettmann and schwarz remixes
1048430 schwarz mix is a lovely track something a big different
1048431 amazing versions of the same tune a very difficult choice but the henrik schwarz mix is surely one for the summer
1048432 a massive packsge the original and henriks mixes work best for me what a stunning vocal although the strings on the llorca remix are wonderful
1048433 love the schwarz mix deetron mix gr8 also a v good collection of mixes to a good track nice vocal also
1048434 what a package brilliant original with hit written all over it so nice to hear a proper vocal track with a techno feel henriks mix is killer too but llorca remix is my pick of the remixes will be hammering all though
1048435 all around really great release dettmann mix is most useful for me but i like everything would be nice to have an instrumental or dub of the original
1048436 great track but i dont play full vocal records really not sure who does these days i would have loved to see an intrumental of the original in this package original is by far best out of these mixes deetron rocks
1048437 one of my fav track in many years gets great treatments
1048438 excellent release as to be expected from such a line up deetron is the most consistent producer out there as an old school strictly rhythm addict its refresing to hear vocals like this all the mixes are superb my personal favourite is marcels just because i will play this most henriks very nice for chilling
1048439 another killer release from mr geiser i like both the original and the marcel dettmann remix will play out everywhere and chart in my july top ten
1048440 im loving these remixes dettmann schwarz and llorca are all amazing
1048441 deetron shows diversity on this top production and the remix team here also delivers
1048442 great and diverse remix package hard to chose a favourite but henrik schwarz and the ultrafunky llorca remix will be my favourites to play out in my sets thanks
1048443 really nice remix selection excellent work will play the original henrik llorca remixes a lot
1048444 the joseph smith papers journals vol 1 1832 1839 is available for
1048445 the joseph smith papers project is the single most significant historical project of our generation
1048446 sorry bishop brennan you cant leave tonight theyve taken the roads in
1048447 the vision for princetons bridge year program is to enable students to gain critical international experiences and perspectives and to bring those insights to campus to share with other students
1048448 not only will this program provide students with a transformational personal experience it will enhance princetons deep commitment to the service of all nations and prepare these students to take fuller advantage of their subsequent four years at the university while much work remains to be done we are grateful to the members of the working group for their insights and guidance as we move forward with the realization of this vision
1048449 students participating in this bold initiative will live in an unfamiliar cultural context abroad that should challenge assumptions encourage innovative thinking and foster maturity
1048450 it will provide a time of service an opportunity for students to think about working with and for others and a break from the academic pressure that marks todays intensely competitive pre college experience the working group was convinced that such an experience will allow students to begin their formal academic training with eyes that see differently with greater breadth and depth
1048451 the changes made to the sat did not substantially change how predictive the test is of first year college performance
1048452 the sat continues to be an excellent predictor of how students will perform
1048453 the 3 hour 45 minutes test is almost as good a predictor as four years of high school grades and a better predictor for minority students
1048454 the new sat was supposed to be significantly better and fairer than the old one but it is neither
1048455 it underpredicts college success for females and those whose best language is not english and over all it does not predict college success as well as high school grades so why do we need the sat old or new
1048456 given the data released today what was the point of all the hoopla about the sats revisions beyond preserving their california market
1048457 this is all spin its been a marketing operation from the get go
1048458 this is gods way of giving atheists what they deserve
1048459 were looking for the scholarshippoints idol the member with the most talent and the most votes submit your original video entry between 7 4 2008 and 9 5 2008 to earn points and win great prizes
1048460 students were telling us the ability to have more control over their scores would make the test experience more comfortable and less stressful
1048461 we can do that without in any way diminishing the value and integrity of the sat
1048462 in every policy change there are some winners and losers
1048463 this creates a penalty free way for applicants who can afford the price of the test numerous times to shop for their best scores for those students for whom cost is not a barrier this is a tremendously good thing
1048464 they need to make changes to keep their product competitive
1048465 if the act is the avis of the industry theyve been catching up with hertz
1048466 its going to make students relax about the test a bit
1048467 it may give them more confidence to take some risks and try it some more times
1048468 we would prefer to see a students entire score history because it gives us the context of how students earned their scores
1048469 its a mistake its going to give kids more room to play games
1048470 its going to privilege kids who are already in an advantaged position financially
1048471 theres no evidence that its anything more than a marketing decision because they think theyre going to give up a majority of that market to act takers
1048472 you want colleges to see your best work so this only helps your chances
1048473 a conversa aconteceu e solana a reportar ao grupo dos seis

1048491 oh say what is truth tis the fairest gem that the riches of worlds can produce
1048492 over all contrary theories dogmas hypotheses or relative truths from whatever source or by whomsoever
1048493 if the salt shall lose its savor wherewith shall the earth be salted
1048494 the great difficulties we are now facing in the soviet union are really not economic or political in character they are in fact spiritual all the gods whom we have worshiped have failed us and we know not where to turn dr wood have you ever heard of an american prophet by the name of joseph smith
1048495 now that i know you are a latter day saint let me see if i have grasped the key concept of this book
1048496 as i understand it joseph smith brought together two ideas that are generally in conflict with each other and combined them in a remarkable synthesis on the one hand the latter day saints believe that mortality is but a moment in eternity and that men and women do not spring into existence at birth and are annihilated at death we existed before birth and shall persist after death moreover there is a link between those who are yet to be born those who now live and those who have passed beyond the grave there is in fact communication across those seeming barriers some who have lived have returned and communicated with the living and there is a great cooperative enterprise that links the unborn the living and the dead aimed at their mutual salvation and perfection youre mystics
1048497 at the same time the latter day saints seem very concerned with improving the lot of mankind in mortality they do not believe that happiness is simply for another world but needs to be established here through common temporal as well as spiritual efforts you seem to be community builders youre very pragmatic as well
1048498 praise be to the man who brought forth such concepts such ideas are the salvation of my people
1048499 maybe you can find the occasion to distribute some of these
1048500 it is obscene for a man to know that much
1048501 i wanted to show the public part of what i saw in private
1048502 what in hell is going on charles alex is being maddeningly uncommunicative here i was sinking into the grateful obscurity of a somewhat benign old age and this thing breaks loose i must put a stop to whatever charles is up to i did not settle in and for the suffocating obscurity of provo to attract public notice

1048506 as more economic quackery history shows it only decreases production at home and only makes us more dependent on foreign oil
1048507 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1048508 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets
1048509 barack obamas latest attack ads shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy
1048510 after all it was senator obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election

1048514 then apple came along and in a 30 second commercial they just made it dead simple
1048515 the iphone has repositioned at amp t as the premier wireless brand in the world
1048516 first we are need blind in admissions meaning that we admit all undergraduates on the basis of academic merit alone without considering their ability to pay
1048517 second mit meets the full demonstrated financial need of all students we admit third we award all our aid based on need alone mit does not award any academic athletic or other forms of merit scholarships
1048518 in a pattern mit has followed for many years we are increasing funds available for financial aid this year at a far greater rate than the rise in tuition
1048519 for those receiving an mit scholarship which is six out of every 10 mit undergraduates net tuition is 8 100 an amount that approximates the in state cost of many public universities
1048520 we believe strongly that financial circumstances should not be a barrier for a qualified student who wants to come to vassar
1048521 for vassar increasing access is a priority and our board has strengthened the resources necessary to live up to that commitment our financial aid is an investment in the rich diversity of our students which is central to our mission
1048522 with a number of the very wealthiest colleges and universities reducing tuition or loans for students the board believes it is imperative to reaffirm that vassar one of the most selective liberal arts colleges in the country is also an institution committed to affordability
1048523 almost all of our trustees are vassar graduates and many were the recipients of financial aid we know firsthand the benefit of having doors opened that might have otherwise seemed closed and we believe family income shouldnt be an impediment to any qualified student
1048524 since 2001 brown has made financial aid for our students one of our highest priorities every year with strong support from the brown corporation we have taken steps to ensure that our financial aid programs are competitive and effective
1048525 today we take another major step forward to ensure that our nations best students from lower and middle income families can attend brown and graduate without the enormous burden of college debt
1048526 we recognize and understand the concerns of s families about the rising cost of higher education
1048527 with our new aid package and a smaller increase in tuition we hope to address their concerns in a fiscally responsible manner while continuing to attract the best students with diverse backgrounds to brown
1048528 the growing demand for a uc education coupled with the growing increase in the pool of qualified applicants is welcome
1048529 certainly theres been an increased level of student preparation with more students fulfilling the a g requirements for example
1048530 these access scholarships will break down yet another barrier for students who have concerns about the cost of coming to carleton
1048531 although it may not alleviate all loans while at carleton recipients will graduate with a more reasonable amount of loan debt to pursue broader career choices
1048532 its great that people feel connected with the colleges they attended and want be part of their long term health and success
1048533 but harvard could buy and sell a number of countries around the globe
1048534 it could pay the tuition of all its undergraduates and its endowment would still grow it is time for wealthy colleges and universities to begin asking themselves what their broader social responsibilities are
1048535 harvard and many other universities make enormous contributions to our nation in research scholarship medicine and the arts due in large part to the resources we raise and invest
1048536 but they are made up of almost 56 000 individual gifts and that includes many people making 100 gifts and 10 gifts
1048537 our donors hopefully are feeling very good about how we are making the absolute best use of their philanthropic dollars
1048538 it is something we take very seriously there are an unlimited number of very worthwhile causes and needs out there we feel these needs are real
1048539 it isnt necessary to blow out the other persons light to let your own shine
1048540 change will happen growth is a maybe dont create a fantasy person around the real person
1048541 i would be very cautious to approach such a great god with a little matter
1048542 solomon warned us not to rush into gods presence with words thats what fools do and often thats what we do
1048543 did you know that a caterpillar has 228 separate and distinct muscles in its head thats quite a few for a bug the average elm tree has approximately 6 million leaves on it and your own heart generates enough pressure as it pumps blood throughout your body that it could squirt blood up to 30 feet
1048544 burned with fire and to blackness and darkness and tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words so that those who heard it begged that the word should not be spoken to them anymore
1048545 do not be rash with your mouth and let not your heart utter anything hastily before god for god is in heaven and you on earth therefore let your words be few for a fools voice is known by his many words
1048546 a deist is someone who calls himself a christian but thinks like a deist thinks he mistrusts enthusiasts 18th century word or fanatics 21st century word who pray as if god is involved in every detail of his day
1048547 one ever recurring question when he had to leave me was what can i bring you wifey i seldom answered him by a request for i had all things richly to enjoy except health but one day when he put the usual query i said playfully i should like an opal ring and a piping bullfinch he looked surprised and rather amused but simply replied ah you know i cannot get those for you two or three days we made merry over my singular choice of desirable articles but one thursday evening on his return from the tabernacle he came into my room with such a beaming face and such love lighted eyes that i knew something had delighted him very much in his hand he held a tiny box and i am sure his pleasure exceeded mine as he took from it a beautiful little ring and placed it on my finger there is your opal ring my darling he said and then he told me of the strange way in which it had come an old lady whom he had once seen when she was ill sent a note to the tabernacle to say she desired to give mrs spurgeon a small present and could someone be sent to her to receive it mr spurgeon s private secretary went accordingly and brought the little parcel which when opened was found to contain this opal ring how we talked of the lords tender love for his stricken child and of his condescension in thus stooping to supply an unnecessary gratification to his dear servants sick one i must leave my readers to imagine but i can remember feeling that the lord was very near to us not long after that i was moved to brighton there to pass a crisis in my life the result of which would be a restoration to better health or death one evening when my dear husband came from london he brought a large package with him and uncovering it disclosed a cage containing a lovely piping bullfinch my astonishment was great my joy unbounded and these emotions were intensified as he related the way in which he became possessed of the coveted treasure he had been to see a dear friend of ours whose husband was sick unto death and after commending the sufferer to god in prayer mrs t said to him i want you to take my pet bird to mrs spurgeon i would give him to none but her his songs are too much for my poor husband in his weak state and know that bully will interest and amuse mrs spurgeon in her loneliness while you are so much away from her dear mr spurgeon then told her of my desire for such a companion and together they rejoiced over the care of the loving heavenly father who had so wondrously provided the very gift his child had longed for with that cage beside him the journey to brighton was a very short one and when bully piped his pretty song and took a hemp seed as a reward from the lips of his new mistress there were eyes with joyful tears in them and hearts overflowing with praise to god in the little room by the sea that night and the dear pastors comment was i think you are one of your heavenly fathers spoiled children and he just gives you whatever you ask for does anyone doubt that this bird was a direct love gift from the pitiful father do i hear someone say oh it was all chance that brought about such coincidences as these ah dear friends those of you who have been similarly indulged by him know of a certainty that it is not so he who cares for all the works of his hand cares with infinite tenderness for the children of his love and thinks nothing which concerns them too small or too trivial to notice
1048548 cast your cares upon him for he cares for you
1048549 rejoice always pray without ceasing give thanks in all circumstances for this is the will of god in christ jesus for you
1048550 tu fino ad ora per me non sei che un ragazzino uguale a centomila ragazzini e non ho bisogno di te e neppure tu hai bisogno di me io non sono per te che una volpe uguale a centomila volpi ma se tu mi addomestichi noi avremo bisogno uno dellaltro tu sarai per me unico al mondo e io sar per te unica al mondo
1048551 la mia vita monotona io do la caccia alle galline e gli uomini danno la caccia a me tutte le galline si assomigliano e tutti gli uomini si assomigliano e io mi annoio per ci ma se tu mi addomestichi la mia vita
1048552 ma non ho molto tempo per ho da scoprire degli amici e da conoscere molte cose
1048553 in principio tu ti sederai un po lontano da me cos nellerba io ti guarder con la coda dellocchio e tu non dirai nulla le parole sono una fonte di malintesi ma ogni giorno tu potrai sederti un po pi vicino
1048554 se tu vieni per esempio tutti i pomeriggi alle quattro dalle tre io comincer ad essere felice col passare dellora aumenter la mia felicit quando saranno le quattro incomincer ad agitarmi e ad inquietarmi scoprir il prezzo della felicit ma se tu vieni non si sa quando io non sapr mai a che ora prepararmi il cuore ci vogliono i riti
1048555 e quello che fa un giorno diverso dagli altri giorni unora dalle altre ore c un rito per esempio presso i miei cacciatori il gioved ballano con le ragazze del villaggio allora il gioved un giorno meraviglioso io mi spingo sino alla vigna se i cacciatori ballassero in un giorno qualsiasi i giorni si assomiglierebbero tutti e non avrei mai vacanza
1048556 io non ti volevo far del male ma tu hai voluto che ti addomesticassi
1048557 va a rivedere le rose capirai che la tua unica al mondo
1048558 voi non siete per niente simili alla mia rosa voi non siete ancora niente
1048559 nessuno vi ha addomesticato e voi non avete addomesticato nessuno voi siete come era la mia volpe non era che una volpe uguale a centomila altre ma ne ho fatto il mio amico e ne ho fatto per me unica al mondo
1048560 non si pu morire per voi certamente un qualsiasi passante crederebbe che la mia rosa vi rassomigli ma lei lei sola pi importante di tutte voi perch lei che ho innaffiata perch lei che ho messa sotto la campana di vetro perch lei che ho riparato col paravento perch su di lei ho ucciso i bruchi salvo due o tre per le farfalle perch lei che ho ascoltato lamentarsi o vantarsi o anche qualche volta tacere perch la mia rosa
1048561 ecco il mio segreto e molto semplice non si vede bene che col cuore lessenziale invisibile agli occhi
1048562 e il tempo che tu hai perduto per la tua rosa che ha fatto la tua rosa cos importante
1048563 e il tempo che ho perduto per la mia rosa
1048564 gli uomini hanno dimenticato questa verit ma tu non la devi dimenticare
1048565 we love the people we admitted but we also love a very large number of the people who we were not able to admit
1048566 whosoever receiveth my word receiveth me and whosoever receiveth me receiveth those the first presidency whom i have sent
1048567 you must make yourselves acquainted with those men who like daniel pray three times a day toward the house of the lord look to the presidency and receive instruction
1048568 i dont criticise the stadium i criticise the governments use of the olympics for propaganda i am disappointed that the system is not able to turn this historical event into political reform
1048569 new museums the good the bad and the horribly misguided
1048570 what kind of clothes do we wear when we get baptized
1048571 no my dad bought me a snorkle mask to wear in the water its pink
1048572 how many years from when were born does it take for us to get ready for baptism
1048573 when they die what do we do with them is there a store where you take your dead pets
1048574 little kids are into process not product kids live in the moment they enjoy the moment of making the art but are quite casual about disposing of it i have five daughters and as i have experienced this with them i know this is true
1048575 i never want this to happen again i must protect myself
1048576 pleased there are sadly no explicit pictures of naked fruit this time financial ramblings comparison of
1048577 there are so many worries over the economy oil prices the banking industry yes theres a lot of concern
1048578 theres very little being done by those people less gift giving less parties
1048579 you know why greed people are more greedy they dont give instead of corporate gifts they do the opposite squeeze more and more from people while giving less and less
1048580 wall street is the source of the problem you see across the country it rose out of the financial sector which spread into the housing sector
1048581 the thing to keep in mind is that wall street is extraordinarily resilient it will come back the only question is when there will be extraordinary opportunities for some
1048582 but this is an opportunity for the talented to get ahead the less talented will be weeded out
1048583 he had been ill many years but nevertheless he was still able to work every day and he was of completely sound mind all this time so his death in fact was sudden
1048584 one of the greatest thinkers writers and humanists of the 20th century
1048585 until the end of his days he fought for russia not only to move away from its totalitarian past but also to have a worthy future to become a truly free and democratic country we owe him a lot
1048586 changed the consciousness of millions of people forcing them to think about past and present in a different way
1048587 we will remember him as a strong brave person with enormous dignity
1048588 the main thing i picked up from solzhenitsyn was his experience fighting the system and this knowledge is very helpful to me today
1048589 people are born people die i cant say i was beating my chest with grief but i was sorry to hear about it
1048590 im very sorry to hear about his death because when it was forbidden to say things freely he wrote the gulag archipelago
1048591 as the fight against aids nears the end of its third decade we are still facing a huge shortfall in resources
1048592 the responses to hiv and aids require long term and sustained financing as more people go on treatment and live longer budgets will have to increase considerably over the next few decades in the most affected countries donors will have to provide the majority of the funding
1048593 we dare not let down our guard this is an unforgiving epidemic
1048594 we are going to be in this for the long haul
1048595 every day almost three times as many people become newly infected with hiv as those who start taking antiretroviral therapy
1048596 i think money has a lot to do with it

1048611 henbane is a very toxic plant and should never be eaten as always check with an expert when foraging or collecting wild plants
1048612 green carbon the role of natural forests in carbon storage
1048613 natural forests are more resilient to climate change and disturbances than plantations
1048614 protecting the carbon in natural forests is preventing an additional emission of carbon from what we get from burning fossil fuel
1048615 the majority of biomass carbon in natural forests resides in the woody biomass of large old trees commercial logging changes the age structure of forests so that the average age of trees is much younger
1048616 the carbon stock of forests subject to commercial logging and of monoculture plantations in particular will therefore always be significantly less on average than the carbon stock of natural undisturbed forests
1048617 what we democrats cant afford to do even as we support senator obama is try to build one america on the cheap

1048624 lets give those moron voters out there something to really sink their teeth into like having backtrack consider a repub which will illustrate his desire to extend a hand to both sides of the aisle this will boost his creds and the talking heads will continue this news cycle for the next 48 hours backtrack will look like a real politician and we can continue our underground work to take over the nation works for me

1048632 hmmmm well i just recently named the place i go to to reach him as the secret place i didnt know the church word until the other day i heard it called that and i thought about it then i read about it i knew it was right because i had goosebumps all over my body when someone named it for me again i recognized it when i heard its description
1048633 it is a place i go inside my mind when i hmmmm let me think
1048634 it usually starts with me telling him who he is who he has been to me what he has done for me when i start telling him who he is but ive been there so much now i freely float there unexpectedly when i tell him how much i love him

1048640 so a woman should wear a covering on her head as a sign of authority because the angels are watching
1048641 however enochs theology differed from that of the later church on a number of points according to the story of the watchers in chapters 6 16 fallen angels took human wives and bore offspring by them a variation of the account of the nephilim given in
1048642 all the good works in the world are not equal to the holy sacrifice of the mass because they are the works of men but the mass is the work of god martyrdom is nothing in comparison for it is but the sacrifice of man to god but the mass is the sacrifice of god for man
1048643 i tell you that you have less to suffer in following the cross than in serving the world and its pleasures
1048644 prayer is to our soul what rain is to the soil fertilize the soil ever so richly it will remain barren unless fed by frequent rains
1048645 prayer is the inner bath of love into which the soul plunges itself
1048646 man is a beggar who needs to ask god for everything
1048647 when our hands have touched spices they give fragrance to all they handle let us make our prayers pass through the hands of the blessed virgin she will make them fragrant
1048648 all our religion is but a false religion and all our virtues are mere illusions and we ourselves are only hypocrites in the sight of god if we have not that universal charity for everyone for the good and for the bad for the poor and for the rich and for all those who do us harm as much as those who do us good
1048649 you cannot please both god and the world at the same time they are utterly opposed to each other in their thoughts their desires and their actions
1048650 upon receiving holy communion the adorable blood of jesus christ really flows in our veins and his flesh is really blended with ours
1048651 we should consider those moments spent before the blessed sacrament as the happiest of our lives
1048652 i throw myself at the foot of the tabernacle like a dog at the foot of his master
1048653 if we could comprehend all the good things contained in holy communion nothing more would be wanting to content the heart of man the miser would run no more after his treasures or the ambitious after glory each would shake off the dust of the earth leave the world and fly away towards heaven
1048654 when we go before the blessed sacrament let us open our heart our good god will open his we shall go to him he will come to us the one to ask the other to receive it will be like a breath from one to the other

1048715 i am equally confident that the games will leave a great legacy for china
1048716 china is a nation in transition with a great future tremendous potential and some challenges i believe history will view the 2008 olympics as a significant milestone in chinas remarkable transformation
1048717 some of the changes are easy to see the birds nest the main stadium and the water cube the swimming complex are already architectural landmarks
1048718 long after the games end these and other olympic venues will encourage the youth of china to participate in sport spectators will be inspired to become athletes and athletes will be inspired to achieve their best in world class venues
1048719 the venues are just a small part of the construction legacy that will benefit china after the games
1048720 new airport terminals new roads and highways new parks and a host of other projects that were initiated or accelerated because of the games will improve the quality of life and contribute to chinas economic development over the long term
1048721 many of the infrastructure investments and other steps taken as a result of the olympics will help china deal with environmental challenges
1048722 chinas role as our olympic host has opened a window to the worlds most populous nation
1048723 we have already seen the courage and determination of the chinese people in another context
1048724 the world mourned the staggering loss of life from the earthquake in sichuan province and marveled at the courageous response by the chinese people
1048725 starting this weekend and over the next 16 days the world will have another reason to come together to share common emotions
1048726 all of us in the olympic family hope that the beijing games will help the healing process in china and deepen the worlds knowledge of this remarkable country
1048727 i said at the outset that i believe these games will be historic
1048728 they are already a landmark event for the olympic movement
1048729 the mere fact that the olympic games are coming to china home to nearly 20 percent of the worlds population is significant
1048730 a billion television viewers are expected to watch live coverage of the opening ceremony on friday
1048731 the beijing games will significantly advance our goals of universality and fair play in several ways
1048732 we will see a record number of participating national teams 205 and a record number of women athletes about 45 percent of all the competitors

1048756 i have been buying the wines of le vieux donjon for well over a decade and i continue to be impressed by how consistently classic they are this continues to be the most underrated great estate of the appellation
1048757 the style of the wines is unashamedly traditionelle vins de garde with plenty of backbone and muscle to them however these are no clumsy blockbusters but wines with real definition and elegance underneath powerful exteriors these are well constituted wines with great depth and extract which manage to retain finesse this is relatively rare in an appellation where size and clumsiness abound and one frequently looks in vain for subtlety sales of le vieux donjon are not a problem for marie jos and lucien michel one can taste why

1048760 it was always the ubiquitous they those indefinable conspirators who would inevitably force the market to go the opposite you were playing it they were the rumormongers who forced stock and commodity prices to fluctuate wildly regardless of the economic climate they were the ones who toyed with the military industrial complex of the fifties and the sixties and then with the oil powers of the seventies they profited from those long lines of gas hungry cars and the shortages of everything from aluminum to wheat they were the brains the real insiders with all the money to manipulate the markets to make even more they were the immovable forces that gave you that lonely feeling that you were up against it the ones that always profited by your mistakes they were the ones who used pit gossip to create doubts about your stature as a shrewd trader they were the enemy heartless calculating always on the offensive forever elusive they were everything you werent
1048761 paul has become obsessed with the they factor to the point where he would rather rationalize away his own trading blunders they of course were always around to take the blame for his poor judgment damn were they cunning sometimes they would suck you into the market by letting you win first then like a shifty hustler they would wipe you out they would always see you as just a small time charlie potatoes a fast eddie felson squeezed between minnesota fats and willie mosconi in a game of cutthroat nine ball it always worked you could never learn your lesson they knew just how greedy you were and that small profits would never satisfy you and just when you were raking it in inevitably they would lower the boom

1048773 we have no doubt we will win the elections next year
1048774 the fact that we are still new is not an issue we were formally registered on 3 august but all along we were establishing our roots
1048775 as it is now we are almost through with the selection of candidates for next year we will contest every position at every level and we have no doubt on the basis of what we have done so far we are going to win
1048776 we are a membership based party so far we have close to two million registered members we are not like all the other parties that depend on supporters supporters can change their allegiance anytime but with members you are guaranteed they will be on your side all the time
1048777 we have members at all levels the lowest level the village congress has 588 executive members representing seven leagues
1048778 the rest of the region is suffering as a result of zanu pfs misrule
1048779 zimbabwe is short changing the rest of the sadc members how can you integrate zimbabwe with an inflation of 14 000 with say botswana whose inflation rate is about seven percent
1048780 the levels of human rights abuses in zimbabwe are not found anywhere in sadc
1048781 the extent of human rights abuses on its own makes it difficult for zimbabwe to fit into a community of nations with respect for human rights
1048782 our political culture is clearly outside the framework that is necessary for integration zimbabwe is not so much in a class of its own in terms of creating problems for the sadc for example we have angola which still wants to rerun the 1990 presidential elections and swaziland which is still run by a monarchy but the difference between zimbabwe and those countries is that in those places there is a genuine effort to implement the sadc guidelines on the holding of free and fair elections
1048783 each time the issue of zimbabwe is raised so many other irrelevant issues arise diverting peoples attention
1048784 sadc were to be serious with any form of integration they have to handle the zimbabwean issue with openness
1048785 the country is literally at the centre of the region
1048786 the countrys position at the centre of the region forces every infrastructure to somehow touch zimbabwe our position makes zimbabwe key to any efforts to integrate the region
1048787 the whole country is now a training centre where people are trained and exported into the region zimbabwe is exporting victims of human rights violations into the region and elsewhere forcing neighbouring countries to spend lots of money on deporting zimbabweans
1048788 the library was fully stocked with new publications from the most renowned publishing houses we had foreign lecturers as guests not now
1048789 we would invite them regardless of their politician affiliation the situation today is terrible i am told there is a shortage of library books and newly published books from outside the country are no longer available
1048790 the environment was most ideal for their interaction i can say we have gone back to pre independence standards
1048791 the current spate of victimization of student leaders in zimbabwe by the tyranny of robert mugabe is unacceptable
1048792 thousands of students are expelled suspended arbitrarily arrested detained tortured or killed for demanding better education
1048793 we are in the academic industry to give tuition of world class quality while certain things may look like they have gone down i can vouch that we still have the best and most effective quality control measures
1048794 there should be 1200 lecturers at uz but there are only 450 most of them pursuing their masters programmes
1048795 all students undergraduate and postgraduate are being treated like grade one pupils
1048796 we have a serious problem i have no doubt about that
1048797 as in every other sector we currently have a serious capacity problem most of our skilled personnel have left the country and this is impacting negatively on the quality of education at our institutions
1048798 even up to now they have not started renovating the halls of residence at the uz when students complain they are labelled anti government and members of the opposition they are either fired or suspended from the institution

1048813 while the university and the athletic department provide financial support for the band escalating travel expenses exceed the bands budget
1048814 simply put private support from alumni and friends is needed for the band to travel
1048815 we are grateful for the tremendous support given to the pride travel fund last season and are hopeful well get another boost again this year from the campaign
1048816 we work very hard at what we love to do
1048817 and we hope that the success of the pride travel fund will allow us to put on display the pride that we have for wvu and the state of west virginia
1048818 people came from over 100 different countries to contribute knowledge and learn from each other i felt like an active contributing team member in a world that is facing serious food security and sovereignty problems
1048819 growers who produce certified organic crops or home growers who wish to avoid the chemicals currently have no viable option of controlling root rot if they find their soil is infested with the disease
1048820 my research investigated the effect of a number of different planting techniques with increased temperature and drainage and whether or not these techniques positively influenced crop stands
1048821 i had a series of opportunities to live and experience the difference of organic food and sustainable farms
1048822 it wasnt a far jump to realize the implications these improvements would mean on a larger scale
1048823 ultimately i chose to continue with organic research because it would allow me to contribute to improving systems which will become more and more important as the world shifts out of favor of methods that depend on oil and toxic chemicals
1048824 living sustainably will soon shift from a fad to a necessity ive experienced it to understand how important it is ive seen the science to know it is possible
1048825 organic agriculture is slowly being recognized as a very important solution to many problems
1048826 its encouraging to see a movement gaining serious economic momentum as people decide what is good for them and thereby vote with their money thus endorsing the products and processes which they support
1048827 we will have every type of triathlete imaginable from first timers to people who have being competing for more than 20 years

1048849 our goals are more of the same the idea that he said hes iron man in part 1 its one thing to say it and its another thing to actually evolve to the point where you can live in a heroic fashion you know they say the superhero movie always needs to follow and i said who is that guy get him out of here we want to do what worked for us last time in a way that evolves were talking about a guy who is put in an extraordinary circumstance and the people that are around him and how that creates a sense of family and how that disrupts whatever forces that we have to say that are working in his life i like the idea of an iron man 2 that youre able to understand various points of view youre able to touch on some subjects that are a lot more far reaching while still grounding it in entertainment
1048850 sherlock holmes we start october 6th guy ritchies take on it was that its like well be making a contemporary version of a very classic portrayal of exactly how it was but its not telling one of the stories from one of the books or anything like that watson its all there the cool thing about sherlock holmes was hes actually a very skilled martial artist so its going to have elements of that its not just his deduction and all that stuff its going to be a very action packed version of that to me its really exciting
1048851 im always training im big into martial arts were putting together a team of people were going to try to do something a little more transcendent and interesting i love the idea of martial arts and bare knuckle boxing before the queensbury rules where it was all kind of proper it was this real balls to the wall brutal type stuff guy ritchies a martial artist and martial arts student so were going to have a real fun time doing all that
1048852 you cannot persuade me there are not more disturbed or disgruntled persons with a political agenda in such a large group
1048853 people given these kinds of responsibilities with this kind of power at their fingertips we have to make sure that they are not likely to do harm to others or misuse that authority be it intentionally or be it because of some mental problem
1048854 these kinds of situations cry out for reexamination of our standards

1048856 hiding it from your co workers that would have been very very difficult
1048857 universities are pretty sloppy its an academic setting not a security setting

1048860 have access to some of the most lethal substances imaginable
1048861 one of the complaints by people who work in safety and security is they cant get the time of day from people running the labs
1048862 are viewed as deeply offensive by a lot of scientists as if their patriotism is being questioned
1048863 though several agencies have a need to know no one agency knows the number and location of these labs in the united states
1048864 its important for internet users and american consumers in general to understand what information is being collected about them and how its being used
1048865 online users have a right to explicitly know when their broadband provider is tracking their activity and collecting potentially sensitive and personal information
1048866 we are working against the clock not just politically but out there in the real world because every year that passes we get more invasions and those invasions stay forever
1048867 by the time the ship finally makes it into shore most of what you got rid of will have regrown
1048868 you dont know what new or additional invasive species youll pick up

1048877 but then we have to explain to them that we just cant do it
1048878 i dont have a beef with him trying to keep his private life private
1048879 the problem is that he seemed to do it in an unprecedented manner i will be extremely interested to see if the courts grant him the power to seal it
1048880 public access protects litigants both present and future because justice faces its gravest threat when courts dispense it secretly
1048881 treating the house speakers divorce records like all other citizens will keep any back door politics and special favors in check
1048882 surely public officials are not entitled to special secrecy of their divorces simply because they are public officials
1048883 the court finds that the harm otherwise resulting to the interest of the parties and their children which are the subject of this action outweighs any public interest and access to that portion of the record
1048884 are typically cases where the parties think their children could be impacted
1048885 its a gold mine of financial information that crooks could get at the courthouse
1048886 to go behind closed doors in which one of the people involved is a lawyer and a very influential state official and the other person is not a lawyer all before a judge who has a connection with mr richardson it gives pause as to what the heck is going on here
1048887 if something doesnt look right people are going to automatically assume bad things have happened whether its true or not
1048888 just because he is a legislator i dont think he should be afforded any more protection than any other litigant

1048912 ive realised i have to do more things like creating chances because there are a lot of children who do look up to you as footballers so you do have a big responsibility to show them the way to go

1048946 nicht immer f hlen sich die kleinsten in g rten wohl weil vergessen wird ihnen gartenteile abzugeben je st rker aber kinder bei kleinen wie gro en bauma nahmen oder der gartenarbeit mit eingebunden werden desto schneller wird das thema garten wichtig
1048947 mit wenigen ideen ist es schon m glich kinder zu begeistern beliebt sind etwa kleine pflanznischen ob als hochbeet oder als k bel die nur von den kleinsten bepflanzt und bewirtschaftet werden hier eignen sich ganz hervorragend kleine obst oder gem sebeete auf die die nachwuchsg rtner besonders aufpassen m ssen belohnt werden sie dann mit einer reichen ernte

1048957 this new tool offers a google maps like view of integrative genomic data
1048958 it brings together different kinds of genomic data into a single holistic view im incredibly proud of our computational scientists for responding so rapidly and effectively to the critical needs of the growing genomics research community
1048959 other tools offer detailed localized views of genomic data and a few tools are equipped to provide a whole genome view
1048960 igv was designed to integrate both and to provide smooth zooming and panning across all resolution scales
1048961 most visualization tools are limited in their ability to handle multiple types of genomic data and are typically retrofitted to accommodate new data types as they have arisen
1048962 igv was designed from the ground up to integrate all of these data and to provide a strong platform for future growth and refinement
1048963 before i was introduced to igv i had to use three different programs to visually integrate my data
1048964 but now this one universal browser allows me to rapidly scan the entire genome and identify promising regions which has revolutionized my work
1048965 this tool is designed to enable researchers to view many types of genomic data especially those relevant to human disease
1048966 were particularly excited about its already groundbreaking use in ongoing studies of the cancer genome
1048967 the goal of the assessment should guide the choice of the assessment tools used and assessments that will have widespread effects should meet high standards of rigor and validity
1048968 for example using a standardized test with a sample of children in a program would be suitable if the goal was to determine whether the program is bringing children closer to national norms but if the purpose is to guide instruction within a specific classroom a nonstandardized assessment linked to the curriculum would be appropriate
1048969 community recreation and parks is the health provider that you dont know about
1048970 traditionally these agencies are considered as organizers of games and sports in a towns parks or ball fields but our study shows that 9 out of 10 recreation and park professionals are actively involved in a health partnership sometimes several of them
1048971 twenty years ago health care providers didnt consider recreation and park professionals to be a partner in the campaigns to promote health but in the 1990s community based health partnerships were starting to consider the role of recreation and parks in promoting physical activity and quality of life since many related programs are offered by recreation and park managers
1048972 health campaigns naturally involve recreation and park departments because they provide low cost close to home opportunities for physical activity such as trails recreation centers outdoor courts and outdoor swimming facilities
1048973 parks trails and recreation centers can also serve as settings for physical rehabilitation
1048974 having facilities is critical but then programs also have to be established to bring in residents and encourage them to take part
1048975 partnerships that include after school programs diet and nutritional information and policy efforts to promote recreational settings should be encouraged
1048976 the study was designed to provide baseline information on the state of current health partnership practices within the profession their successes and their challenges
1048977 such information can be used to help a community effectively develop a program in health and physical activity promotion
1048978 job growth matters but only if you could get it where jobs are needed the most we found that jobs had a bigger impact on reducing poverty in smaller metropolitan areas because if you live in a small area you can get to where the jobs are but if you live in columbus or cleveland or new york or atlanta it is going to be harder to get to the jobs
1048979 many lower skilled workers are single mothers with children who dont have reliable transportation their kids get sick so they miss a couple of days of work and then they get fired so finding ways of breaking down this kind of barrier so they can work can really make a difference
1048980 you tend to find out about jobs from your friends coworkers and neighbors but if you live in an area that is downtown and the jobs are being created out in the suburbs it will be more difficult to find out what jobs are available
1048981 in some suburbs there are particular kinds of zoning that make it difficult to create affordable housing lot size requirements and zoning that keeps out apartments puts limits on where people can move if they have limited resources all of these three barriers public transportation information about new jobs and housing barriers keep the people from low income households from getting the jobs that are available far from home

1048983 he who answers before listening that is his folly and his shame
1048984 the first to present his case seems right till another comes forward and questions him
1048985 the actual person teaching makes a difference in how students learn when there is a good relationship that really facilitates learning and motivation and we found that in almost every area the regular classroom teachers were more effective they were better
1048986 the relationship between the teacher and the student particularly during adolescence is very important it was easier for the kids to talk about personal stuff with someone they knew it was easier for them to absorb the material and become more interested in what they were talking about with their regular teacher in the classroom
1048987 when you have kids who simply memorize material for the test and two weeks later dont remember any of it youre not getting anywhere but if you can get the kids to care and learn because they think its important thats something that will last a lifetime
1048988 students who had a sexual partner were more likely to say that there was class discussion going on with the regular teacher than those taught by the outside person these kids were more likely to feel like there was discussion of these issues rather than just the teacher lecturing to them

1049003 people tended to take new orleans for granted as a party town with a specific kind of music when they realized such a treasure had been severely damaged if not lost forever they were forced to reconsider what new orleans meant as a cultural resource for the country
1049004 new orleans was on everybodys mind and there was this real hunger for its music musicians found themselves busier than they had been in years
1049005 you can have my husband but please dont mess with my man
1049006 people always thought of new orleans as the big easy bourbon street mardi gras and jazzfest home of this old time good time music
1049007 in katrinas wake you couldnt watch the devastation deaths and flooding and associate new orleans with good times so people were looking to artists to tell them what does new orleans mean now and to keep the citys legacy alive
1049008 all sorts of strong emotions come through in the music
1049009 when you hear them sing of a return to new orleans its as if theyre singing of a return to the promised land
1049010 it sounded nothing like marvin gaye and nothing like the dirty dozen brass band had done before
1049011 they substituted gayes silky soulfulness for a brassy assertiveness that gave the material new urgency
1049012 its ironic new orleans seemed to have a stronger sense of musical community when its musicians were scattered all over the country because they had this tragedy in common
1049013 its kind of like they were johnny appleseeds sowing the seeds of this music across the country

1049105 eps of 0 59 was ahead of our 0 58 estimate and consensus of 0 55 net revenues were 742 million up 7 from last quarter and better than our 724 million estimate it appears higher other expenses occupancy and business development took away more upside non compensation increased 11 sequentially results also include a 2 8 million 0 025 unrealized loss related to mbs securities which does run through the income statement accordingly normalized earnings could have been in the 0 61 0 63 range

1049107 perfect worlds pocketpet journey west gained nice traction in its closed beta testing the game added five server groups after launching unlimited closed beta on july 17 bringing the total number of servers to 17 our observations suggest server utilizations are at high levels perfect worlds sever capacity ranks number two in the industry and pcu per server typically ranges between 50k and 100k this implies the game has already gained significant traction initially according to baidu com data search queries for pocketpet journey west surged 168 in the week ending july 17 making it the seventh most searched game in china xunlei com data shows that the game was the fourth most downloaded game during the past week our tracking of zhu xian and chi bi in figures 1 and 2 shows their performances were not much different from a week ago zhu xian remained as a robust game whereas chi bi shows little progress
1049108 the companys presence at chinajoy was largely about pocketpet journey west and to a lesser extent about hot dance party we continue to hear the internal expectations around the performance of ppjw remains very aggressive we note that the niche that ppjw is addressing is relatively unoccupied which bodes well for the prospects of the games ramp further we have spoken to overseas operators that already expressed interest in licensing ppjw which suggests the game should have quick time to revenue through the combination of organic growth and licensing payments initial traction for ppjw continues to be promising we are hearing that pcu for ppjw has recently exceeded 100 000 importantly since the game just started open beta test we would expect acu and pcu to be fairly similar consequently we are having increased confidence in solid revenue prospects for ppjw as unlike chi bi or hot dance party it does not seem to have any problems in attracting the users in our opinion it is more important for the new game to ramp the user count rather than focus on monetization which can be later addressed through expansion packs
1049109 we continue to believe that the mac business and the success of the iphone will drive continued better than expected results during the past several quarters actual results have exceeded guidance by an average of approximately 500m in revenue gross margins by almost 2 points on average and eps by an average of 0 30 with the mac business growing at levels that farexceed the overall pc industry we continue to be very confident of our fiscal and calendar 2009 estimates
1049110 mac sales came in at 2 5m vs our 2 3m estimate representing 41 y y growth roughly 3x the global pc growth rate for the quarter however guidance for fy4q08 came in beneath expectations as a result of asp pressures expected from back to school promotions and a planned unspecified upcoming product transition introduction while we are reducing our near term estimates we believe after market weakness in the stock represents a buying opportunity for this long term high quality growth story

1049152 in an online environment customers dont have the ability to try before they buy and ratings amp reviews can provide the peace of mind a customer needs to make a purchase decision
1049153 in particular with skincare products customers want to be sure the product works before they buy it and who better to trust for an authentic opinion than other people who have already experienced the products whether a murad customer is buying our products online in a salon via a catalog or at retail theyll now be able to get valuable non biased product information from other customers before they buy
1049154 numerous studies have shown that shoppers often read reviews before purchasing offline and then go back online to review their purchases contributing to an ever growing feedback loop
1049155 ratings amp reviews provides murad with a digital archive of feedback impossible to capture in salons or stores and theyre clearly using it very intelligently to improve products and processes we look forward to working hand in hand with murad to maximize the value of user generated content across the brand and for its customers
1049156 our vendor selection process was easy once we experienced the richness of the bazaarvoice product offering combined with its exceptional client services
1049157 weve been very pleased with how the contribution of reviews to our site has dramatically boosted our natural search rankings bazaarvoice is a perfect fit for murad because were a brand that has always been based on a problem solution approach to development and ratings and reviews just makes the customer feedback collection process that much easier

1049164 went into training and ran five miles every day so that at the end of the year i wouldnt look like norm out of tv
1049165 the fact is we are more than just a farmer and a distributor we are a service and solutions provider
1049166 it is imperative that we have the flexibility to move product as needed and using an inventory management system is critical to gaining that business agility if you make a mistake in our industry it isnt like paint or wood chips where you can sell them next week when you make a mistake with produce things go bad and you lose money there is very little room for delay
1049167 we were the first produce company that robocom worked with so there were some unique challenges to overcome on both sides but it was well worth the effort robocom was willing to do whatever it took to ensure our implementation was a success
1049168 our business mix of customers was changing and they were asking for special packaging options for example we may take three boxes of commodities and combine those goods into one package we needed a system that could track all three commodities into one unique package that is a difficult thing to do with rims we can now accommodate new types of customers and take advantage of strategic opportunities we were previously unable to pursue
1049169 if you look at all the news in the produce industry there are constant product recalls we havent had to face that issue yet but you never know what may come up in the future our goal was to be ahead of the curve in recognizing that there could be a problem in the future we knew one of the keys to our success would be having quick access to information and control over our inventory and that would require a whole new infrastructure
1049170 the day i opened the florida facility i was able to turn on the switch and the system was working
1049171 the trainer they sent was phenomenal patient and did a great job
1049172 it was a tough transition and many employees were fearful of the whole process however today our employees love rims and realize how much easier it is making their jobs
1049173 with three high five deep racking our rims solution helps us locate and store all of these goods without losing the ability to do the proper rotation based on size needs etc
1049174 and the accuracy level of the system is proven month in and month out i have the confidence level from my buyers and sales people that they can buy goods store them and they will be there when they want to sell that has been a big benefit which is saving us the equivalent of two hourly workers or 50 000 75 000 in manpower on inventory alone rims has absolutely helped us improve our profitability just in the control of inventory loss
1049175 before using rims we were pushing out the same number of trucks but it was taking a lot longer we were working around the clock we have been able to essentially eliminate an entire shift since using rims it has been a huge improvement from a loading perspective and our operations are much more streamlined and improved now i dont have to pay to have people around the clock loading trucks when i first arrived at pero we had a shipping department of 50 people since implementing rims i run the department with under 20 people the cost savings in manpower alone has been tremendous
1049176 we can track which of our employees are doing what who is more productive and why rims gives management the ability to see how employees are spending their time it is a wonderful tool that has also improved productivity we can understand where we need to implement changes in order to make significant improvements to the business
1049177 from an accuracy perspective we are probably 99 5 percent accurate on our loads maybe even higher
1049178 before if a customer ordered a pallet of red peppers extra large he could very easily have gotten a pallet of red peppers large simply because the loader mistakenly grabbed the wrong one the rims system eliminates that opportunity for error
1049179 all of our major customers rate us on various levels and certainly on accuracy and load completions we are scoring usually at the 100 percentile that is a huge improvement that makes a big difference to a buyer on the other end by running a tighter business we are impacting our customers profitability as well if we dont ship something to them that they purchased at a fixed price then they either have to go somewhere else for the goods which could be more expensive or live with the delay both of which could impact their bottom line
1049180 anywhere that we are going to control and store product we will implement rims we are expanding the florida facility now and have additional growth plans
1049181 i have personally found working with robocom to be a very positive experience they are wonderful people to work with provide terrific support are very timely and most importantly the product does everything they said it could do i cant say enough about them i would highly recommend robocom and rims

1049189 to ensure we continue the a1gp tradition of strong racing coupled with lots of overtaking the effort of the design team has been to provide a chassis that has a good level of down force but without the normal penalties this will make for much closer racing particularly in the corners as cars will be able to run together we have spent in excess of 300 hours in the wind tunnel and have tried hundreds of different aerodynamic variations to ensure the close exciting racing the series is famous for not only continues but gets better
1049190 ive tested a great many in car systems for both what hi fi sound and vision and what car and this bowers amp wilkins has huge appeal its sound quality is terrific and just as importantly its sensibly priced meaning more drivers will choose to specify it

1049192 receiving recognition from the uks top selling audio publication highlights the efforts that were put into the bowers amp wilkins premium sound system in the xf the brief was clear to design the best audio experience possible in a contemporary luxury car this accolade recognises the dedication and attention to detail put into the system and we are sure that xf customers who choose the system will agree

1049494 our government has failed in its obligation to give a timely decision to long time lawful permanent residents who have followed all the rules and want to pledge their allegiance to the united states
1049495 it is particularly outrageous that julian polous al matchy who voluntarily enlisted in the u s army and received a purple heart after being wounded in battle in iraq is among the countless immigrants who have been left in limbo in violation of the law
1049496 i was proud to serve america as a soldier in the u s army
1049497 i love this country and very much want to become a citizen i hope that this lawsuit helps me and other immigrants realize that dream
1049498 the government is required to make a decision within 120 days of interviewing any applicant for naturalization spc polous is not unique in having to endure such an unlawful delay
1049499 julian polous has sacrificed greatly for this country and it is wrong to deny him citizenship when he has met all the necessary requirements contained in statute or regulation
1049500 polous joined the u s army in march 2006 and served among other duties as a translator he was deployed along with his unit to his native country of iraq in october 2007 he was seriously wounded when a suicide bomber detonated himself 10 feet from polous and his fellow soldiers after partially recovering from his wounds he agreed to another stint in iraq until december 2007 for his service he was awarded the purple heart two army commendation medals a combat action badge gold combat spurs and many certificates and letters of appreciation he continues to receive medical treatment for his wounds sustained in iraq

1049503 the detention without charges of the alaei brothers has a chilling effect on all of those efforts
1049504 he is not violent i have not seen him hit anybody in my life
1049505 steven hirschfield had everything to live for so this myth that you are hearing that steven was attacking a police officer is completely at odds with the type of person that steven hirschfield was
1049506 weve seen more than 125 gay couples from australia who have gone home with a baby
1049507 were up to six to eight a month now which is a fourfold increase over two years ago that makes australia one of our biggest markets neck and neck with britain
1049508 were not going to hear these challenges before the election
1049509 i came away from the neighborhood meetings very comfortable with what theyre going to do
1049510 they said they would prepare a memorandum of understanding for town meeting that would address all our concerns and thats a good step
1049511 and once everyone sees the memorandum of understanding in writing i think youll see overwhelming support
1049512 im not expecting youll see much if anything of the studio buildings from long pond road
1049513 i think the most important thing to remember is plymouth rock studios officials came to plymouth before there was any knowledge of the construction credits
1049514 would we like to have the credits sure but well move forward anyway
1049515 senator murray says let them put the shovel in the ground and build the studio and come back when its done and look for postconstruction credits
1049516 this is an important decision to be made by the states policy makers its a process
1049517 i think that weve proven that both parents are important in the success of a family so no i dont believe in gay adoption

1049521 take this jar home and bring me back a sample tomorrow
1049522 well doc its like this first i tried with my right hand but nothing then i tried with my left hand but still nothing then i asked my wife for help she tried with her right hand with nothing then her left but nothing she even tried with her mouth first with the teeth in then with the teeth out and still nothing we even called up the lady next door and she tried with both hands and her mouth too but nothing
1049523 yep but no matter what we tried we couldnt get the darn jar open
1049524 if i can help other people i can build a relationship and then a network
1049525 your network is the most powerful resource you can have and its free
1049526 people from your network can connect you with the people you need to reach your goals
1049527 i tell them that i help people create referrals for life
1049528 the real power in the network is in the second degree not your people but the people they know
1049529 the push has been that the board members have got to wake up
1049530 you as a board member have to be totally asleep at the switch
1049531 a lot of companies that were vested right around the bubble theyre maturing
1049532 but the ipo market is so inhospitable these companies arent even trying to go public the public money isnt coming and the vcs have to write another check
1049533 what would it cost to build a house if you also had to create all the nails
1049534 i have one company merchant circle that provides advertising businesses
1049535 they have only 15 employees and they have 5 000 paying customers i was meeting with a few entrepreneurs from social gaming site playfish who told me they dont own a single server everything is on a cloud e mail accounting file sharing is hosted on a cloud and theyre serving millions of game players a day if youre burning 1 million a month its a really expensive experiment to fail but if your burn rate is 100 000 a month you can go a long way with just a little bit of angel financing and see if you can tweak your product just right so you can afford to wait
1049536 before facebook in order for a dot com or an app to woo users to their site and get them go come back 10 or 15 times a week you had to spend a lot of money with google and others promoting your wares with facebook an app doesnt have to spend their money on customer acquisition
1049537 the more unique your company the greater the value of your company
1049538 if youre one of 20 companies doing the same thing theres not a lot of differentiation and if a large company wants to buy one they have 20 to choose from the lower the barriers to entry the noisier the marketplace
1049539 facebook could have sold the whole thing for 15 billion but they wont be able to get that in a year
1049540 even now they cant get it so there was a feeding frenzy six months ago maybe they should have taken the money and run
1049541 i have not come to give peace of mind because there is already calm
1049542 that is what we have sent to the coaches we should not repeat things every day
1049543 weve already said we do not want to lose silva and villa we want them to stay with us and negotiations with them are a reality
1049544 mapping out that relationship shows employees that greeting customers isnt just something a manager randomly makes them do
1049545 instead its something important to do and it connects with the broader goals of the organization
1049546 bosses shouldnt engage in the one size fits all type of management
1049547 it gives the staff members a better idea of how they have helped the company
1049548 if the financials of the company are not a mystery theyll have more trust
1049549 if you dont fire them the people who do perform will develop a sense of resentment
1049550 the yahoo discussions have valued aol at around 10 billion excluding the dial up business
1049551 in contrast time warners current stock price around 14 suggests a value of no more than 3 billion to 4 billion for the ad sales and content businesses some analysts say
1049552 its not a hallucination its not a hallucination its not a hallucination
1049553 the reviews identified 10 areas of clinical status in which research has demonstrated benefits of religious commitment 1 depression 2 suicide 3 delinquency 4 mortality 5 alcohol use 6 drug use 7 well being 8 divorce and marital satisfaction 9 physical health status and 10 mental health outcome studies the authors underscored the need for additional longitudinal studies featuring health outcomes although there were few such studies tended to show mental health benefit similarly in the case of the few longevity or mortality outcome studies the benefit was in favor of those who attended church at least 70 of the time increased religious commitment was associated with improved coping and protection from problems
1049554 people who reported having intense religious experiences were significantly more likely to report a high level of psychological well being than those who did not experience transcendence
1049555 transcendent experience may well lead toward a permanent transformation of the psyche in the direction of wholeness and health maslow 1970 owens 1972 wapnick 1972
1049556 these states of being also result in behavioral and health changes
1049557 refined sensory threshold and enhanced mind body coordination p 115 alexander et al 1987
1049558 as a result of their study the authors concluded that it would be important to look at a combination of religious items including prayer relationship with god and other measures of religious experience to begin to adequately clarify the associations of religious commitment with general well being
1049559 a non spiritualized person is a sick person even if she doesnt show any symptom described by traditional medicine the supernatural and the sacredness result from an elaboration on the function of omnipotence by the mind and can be found both in atheist and religious people it is an existential function in humankind and the uses each one makes of it will be the measure for ones understanding
1049560 nowadays there are many who do not agree with the notion that religious behavior a priori implies a neurotic state to be decoded and eliminated by analysis exorcism that reductionism based on the first works by freud is currently under review the psychotherapist should be limited to observing the uses their clients make of the representations of the image of god in their subjective world that is the uses of the function of omnipotence among the several authors that subscribe to this position are odilon de mello franco 12 w r bion 2 one of the most notable contemporary psychoanalysts
1049561 one outgrowth of maslows work is what has become known as transpersonal psychology in which the focus is on the spiritual well being of individuals and values are advocated steadfastly transpersonal psychologists seek to blend eastern religion buddhism hinduism etc or western christian jewish or moslem mysticism with a form of modern psychology frequently the transpersonal psychologist rejects psychologys adoption of various scientific methods used in the natural sciences
1049562 the influence of the transpersonal movement remains small but there is evidence that it is growing i suspect that most psychologists would agree with maslow that much of psychology including the psychology of religion needs an improved theoretical foundation
1049563 some suspect that the benefits of faith and churchgoing largely boil down to having social support a factor that by itself has been shown to improve health
1049564 the religious might be healthier because they are less likely to smoke drink and engage in risky sex and more likely to wear seat belts
1049565 if youre a smoker make sure you get your butt in church
1049566 what it came down to for us is that we were already running all these microsoft products so it did not make sense to switch

1049588 tivemos certa evolu o mas ainda estamos com cerca de 70 do que consideramos ideal ainda falta um melhor rendimento por parte de alguns jogadores e acho que eles podem evoluir mais
1049589 foi uma partida complicada e claro que n s ficamos desapontados mas essa a hora de levantar a cabe a e a nossa principal preocupa o com o elenco foi essa procuramos mostrar a necessidade de a motiva o ser alta para o jogo contra o abc

1049648 there was an incident at the end of the school day today
1049649 the global economic turbulence clearly shows in the 0 8 percent drop in freight volumes compared to last year although the passenger demand grew by 3 8 percent this is the slowest growth that we have seen since the industry was hit by the sars crisis in 2003 with consumer and business confidence falling and sky high oil prices the situation will get a lot worse

1049654 since todays press conference the collingwood football club has established that alan didak was in fact a passenger in heath shaws car on sunday night
1049655 the sanction imposed on heath by the club on monday was a result of information stated by both heath and alan after being repeatedly questioned about the incident
1049656 given the club has now found their information to be false it strikes at the principles of honesty and integrity that the collingwood football club is built on
1049657 for this reason the sanction imposed today will be immediately reviewed by the club and media will be notified of a press conference to be held today
1049658 as i said well make our decisions alans a contracted player
1049659 were not hiding anything we will take our time to consider our situation because theres nothing worse than making these decisions on the run unfortunately for us it has changed
1049660 the situation i think was that they were looking after alan after your paper slaughtered him last year
1049661 as a result of that thats compromised the decision making process during the day
1049662 they came to us and told us later that didak was in the car we are going to have a little bit of time to work through things and reconsider the situation
1049663 we have tried our best to be as honest as we can with everybody with the information that we had in front of us
1049664 and now that we have new evidence in front of us we will consider that and in the cool light of day and make a decision
1049665 it is time these guys grew up and took responsibility
1049666 weve had enough of these blokes letting us down theyre not five year olds now theyre grown men
1049667 coach mick malthouse breaks his neck week in and out and is dragged down by clowns enough is enough
1049668 he just gave us his details and was very co operative it was heath and alan didak in the car i wouldnt have guessed that they were over the limit
1049669 i recognised didak they said they swerved to avoid a possum he shaw did not look like he was really pissed
1049670 he wasnt near there but a short time after he was we were together then we went separate ways then i called him because i didnt really know what to do
1049671 the police have a statement about who was in the car the name of the person is a friend of heaths its not alan didak its no one associated with the club
1049672 they said the house was really 500 000 but when i bought it the papers said 625 000
1049673 my thing is we pay our rent every month and weve never been late not once in five years if we can pay our rent every month we can pay our mortgage every month
1049674 i do not see myself as any risk at all because im not stretching with this house
1049675 we can afford the monthly payments were staying put right in this house

1049678 the policy can no longer be blind to the green carbon thats in these natural forests he said
1049679 we need to start factoring in the carbon value of these forests when deciding what to do with them
1049680 they the clauses werent going to get rich from their primary residence thats for sure
1049681 theres just not much of a market for a thirty acre homestead that far north
1049682 zero demand means zero appreciation if youre the clauses and you have to keep up with inflation youre forced to look elsewhere for return on capital
1049683 youre looking at a family investment portfolio that will suffer staggering losses
1049684 if anyone thought the kringles were immune to zero down teaser rate the gains are permanent temptation they were mistaken its pretty sad really
1049685 our advisors certainly would have steered the kringles away from real property assets at that time the fundamentals were shaky then as now we continue to recommend silver and gold
1049686 right now their estate basically has three classes of real property bad worse and monumentally horrific
1049687 certainly we all appreciate everything the kringles have done through the years
1049688 airlifting bags full of toys and gadgets across the globe in a single night the logistics are nightmarish but reality is what it is the kringles are bagholders of a different sort now
1049689 i know theyre worried sick fuel prices are high grain prices are high insurance and union costs for the elves are astronomical and rising creditors call every hour if the grinch had really wanted to steal christmas this is how he should have done it
1049690 and now to top it off you have this this housing bubble i just dont know how it got this bad but i can read the statements and the mail and the news my familys investments are in the shitter dearie
1049691 no mistaking him corncob pipe button nose i dont mind saying it was more than a little odd seeing that familiar face across the table from us at closing i mean that beard never mind the two elves that came with him its not every day you have to sit and wait for fancy pants elves to go over all the contracts
1049692 when i was a little girl i wanted a pony
1049693 i always asked santa for a pony did i ever get my christmas pony no do you know that it took me forty two years two husbands three sunroom renovations and four granite and stainless steel kitchen updates just to get that pony i used the money from that home plus a chunk of a cash out refi on our rental place in alabaster and i bought us a pony farm in missouri shetlands
1049694 i kept my room clean mostly i helped with dishes at dinnertime i carried a b average in school but still no pony from santa every year disappointment heartbreak well thats changed hasnt it in a weird way santa finally gave me that pony i just had to take things into my own hands
1049695 until last year kris and his wife would visit the desert two or three times a year they enjoyed the shows sure blue man group was his favorite but youd be surprised mr kringle isnt a bad texas holdem player in his own right
1049696 she mrs claus tells me theyre down forty percent already

1049698 the things people are doing to the vacant houses its just horrible signs glued to the windows signs stuck in the yards whocoodanode one of the signs said bright red letters

1049702 god only knows what stinky deals these lenders wouldve thrown at the poor easter bunny
1049703 im just not sure what we can do about it
1049704 what were seeing at this time is a need for more direct taxpayer funded stimulus
1049705 the american taxpayers pockets are deep and generous im happy to say
1049706 but we must ask ourselves where are our efforts best directed where will long term benefits best accrue i believe we must take care of the american multi homeowner first and foremost just as soon as weve taken care of our banks and of course public servants like myself
1049707 el cska es ahora el mejor equipo pero la liga acb es la mejor competici n de europa y pamesa es uno de sus mejores equipos y eso me compensa

1049716 goodman says a parallel is often drawn between chinas development since its reform era began 30 years ago and the industrialisation in europe and in the united states
1049717 the pattern of economic development in the peoples republic fits more closely that of germany japan and russia during the late 19th century than that of britain or the us
1049718 chinas new rich categories of entrepreneures are less the new middle class than a future central part of the ruling class
1049719 they are quite unlike the 19th century european bourgeoisie in the extent to which they have emerged from and retain close relationships with the established political system

1049723 for over 20 years i have observed the progressive deterioration of this site as the mound suffered from erosion by livestock and the masonry became increasingly unstable and overgrown by vegetation

1049739 so many people think that bullying is just a rite of passage
1049740 kids have feelings too and so thats what we try to do is help them channel and be able to discuss and find a solution that works for them
1049741 thats the key to the whole thing that violence is never the answer
1049742 ive always liked the comedy part of it and that kind of stuff
1049743 we have to start teaching these young kids that are getting on the internet and writing these things to be careful about the words theyre using
1049744 one kid told us a really scary story about how he was bullied every day because he walked home i guess these kids pushed him down in the street in the bushes and stuff so we talked to him and last time we found out he was getting help from his teacher to try to stop the bullying
1049745 we are sending out requests today to outlets and shops to pull the games off their shelves and we will replace them with other games

1049751 when we have days with a projected lower occupancy we will make every attempt to offer attractive rates and packages that have the effect of creating value for the consumer while filling the hotel rooms that would otherwise remain vacant it makes good business sense
1049752 many of the hotels in the states are offering discounted rates primarily city center hotels
1049753 when summertime hits theres usually a reduction in business travel so its not unusual to see them try to create more value for leisure and discretionary travel
1049754 it made a noise that vibrated throughout my entire body

1049807 a surprising level of sheer willingness to stay together a surprising level of agreement about what might be necessary to make that happen
1049808 wide agreement about the need for moratoria on both sides where divisive actions are concerned
1049809 but the christian with the new insight cant claim straight away that this is now what the church of god believes or intends and it quite rightly takes a long time before any novelty can begin to find a way into the public liturgy
1049810 as soon as there is a liturgical form it gives the impression that this has the churchs stamp of approval on it

1049820 being loved by god who knows us and loves each one of us in christ
1049821 if we have received such great things from god we must give in turn
1049822 we must transmit to others the gifts of goodness love and friendship but at the same time we also must give material gifts to those who need us and who we can help

1049831 we are very thorough in our assessments and there was nothing we could have foreseen
1049832 the possibility of finding buried treasure fascinated many in late eighteenth and early nineteenth century america reports of searching for such riches were widespread in the palmyra new york area and extant accounts show that treasure was generally sought through supernatural means locations for buried wealth and lost spanish mines were sometimes located through dreams treasures could also be located by using divining rods often made from witch hazel or by looking in special stones or crystals sometimes when a stone was used a person would place the stone in a hat and then conjure the guardian treasure spirit after finding a spot where the cache was supposedly hidden the seekers would draw a magic circle on the ground around the hidden treasure sometimes they would maintain absolute silence but other times they would recite magical charms or religious verses used as charms whatever the means money diggers needed to overcome the guardian spirit who had enchanted the treasure otherwise the treasure would slip back into the earth
1049833 prisoner examined says that he had a certain stone which he occasionally looked at to determine where hidden treasures in the bowels of the earth were that he professed to tell in this manner where gold mines were a distance underground and had looked for mr
1049834 the court concluded that there was enough evidence to indicate that the prisoner joseph smith the glass looker had claimed to have the skill to discover lost goods a misdemeanor under the vagrant act and had not actually found anything
1049835 i cant understand why those of other faiths cannot accept the book of mormon
1049836 if any evidence had been in existence that js had used a seer stone for fraud and deception and especially had he made this confession in a court of law as early as 1826 or four years before the bom was printed and this confession was in a court record it would have been impossible for him to have organized the restored church
1049837 zarahemla gave a genealogy of his fathers according to his memory brother hanna indicates that this is a typical custom of his semitic forebearers to recite their genealogy from memory
1049838 regardless why does no one address the content issue i bring up how is it that js used so many arabic phrases and words something must have been visible in his clear stone
1049839 helaman 1 3 here reference is made to the contending for the judgment seat
1049840 thats easy mighty mouse is just a cartoon character superman is a real guy
1049841 truth is truth and the witness of the holy ghost is real and quite evident in my church experience the foundation that people use for truth is what changes you know the wise man and the sand story
1049842 john tvedtnes career apologist with farms and retired scholar from byu masters degree in linguistics but self appointed expert on dna studies tvedtnes has written at length on the dna issue he was recently forced to retract two of the boldest claims he made in the above mentioned fair dvd they were so blatantly incorrect
1049843 you havent addressed the core issue where do we go when we have conflicting experiences throw up our hands no we go to the word if you dont trust the word why carry around a quad with the kjv in it just carry the three mormon scriptures and a collection of ensign magazines
1049844 what js did prior to god calling him as prophet is irrelevant
1049845 grcluff says would you feel inclined to ridicule the speaker at a business conference because he arrived in a beat up car or rode an old bicycle that would be ridiculous and superficial like the content of this article we should instead examine the content of his presentation
1049846 joseph smith would put the seer stone into a hat and put his face in the hat drawing it closely around his face to exclude the light and in the darkness the spiritual light would shine a piece of something resembling parchment would appear and on that appeared the writing one character at a time would appear and under it was the interpretation in english brother joseph would read off the english to oliver cowdery who was his principal scribe and when it was written down and repeated to brother joseph to see if it was correct then it would disappear and another character with the interpretation would appear thus the book of mormon was translated by the gift and power of god and not by any power of man
1049847 there shall not be found among you one who uses divination one who pracitces witchcraft or one who interprets omens or a sorcerer or one who casts a spell or a medium or a spiritist or one who calls up the dead
1049848 you should have tried it a few more times eventually you would remember it clearly
1049849 when you take it up a notch in the temple and see
1049850 no one need suppose me guilty of any great or malignant sins
1049851 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned
1049852 he christ saith unto them but whom say ye that i am and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon bar jona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven
1049853 you who hide deep from the lord in your counsel whose deeds are in the dark and who say who sees us who knows us you turn things upside down
1049854 the most important thing is content and fruit over context history
1049855 and these things brethren i have in a figure transferred to myself and to apollos for your sakes that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written that no one of you be puffed up for one against another
1049856 how do you explain the influence the book of mormon has had in my life if it is really from satan he has a very strange way of accomplishing his mission
1049857 many on this site make fun of and ridicule the mormon belief in christ and dismiss our faith
1049858 it does not make sense that something created by the devil would lead a person to christ
1049859 based on your comments am i to understand that a persons life desires and behavior do not relate to his conversion to christ
1049860 what is the alternative lets see a person cannot rely on answers to prayer to guide his search for truth impressions and spiritual feelings must be disregarded
1049861 two men went up into the temple to pray one a pharisee and the other a tax collector the pharisee standing by himself prayed thus god i thank you that i am not like other men extortioners unjust adulterers or even like this tax collector i fast twice a week i give tithes of all that i get but the tax collector standing far off would not even lift up his eyes to heaven but beat his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled but the one who humbles himself will be exalted
1049862 skip the bible read the bom first it will lead to spiritual awakening without distraction
1049863 because of the headache i had received from reading lds manuals all day i went to the store for goodys headache powder
1049864 every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and a house divided against a house falleth
1049865 what about my testimony i prayed and got this spiritual confirmation this burning in the bosom that js was a prophet that the bom is true that the mormon church is gods restored church
1049866 with it holy ghost the scriptures are not even necessary
1049867 if satan also be divided against himself how shall his kingdom stand
1049868 to not take god seriously at what he has already said is truth will only lead to dire consequences
1049869 we are told to test the scriptures i have done that and the bible has met the test repeatedly
1049870 please understand i am not attempting to tell any of you that you are wrong i do not doubt your faith or your religion my experiences and testimony in no way exclude your faith and experiences
1049871 in writing for your father i frequently wrote day after day often sitting at the table close by him he sitting with his face buried in his hat with the stone in it and dictating hour after hour with nothing between us he had neither manuscript nor book to read from
1049872 joseph looked backward toward folk beliefs in divine power communicated through stones visions dreams and angels
1049873 after 1828 joseph could no longer see that magic might have prepared him to believe in a revelation of gold plates and translation with a stone it did not occur to him that without magic his family might have scoffed at his story of moroni as did the minister who rejected the first vision magic had played its part and now could be set aside
1049874 there shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire or that useth divination magic or an observer of times or an enchanter or a witch or a charmer or a consulter with familiar spirits or a wizard or a necromancer for all that do these things are an abomination unto the lord and because of these abominations the lord thy god doth drive them out from before thee
1049875 why a foundation of apostles and prophets because they are the ones authorized to recieve revelation on doctrinal issues improper interpretation of the bible is no foundation at all
1049876 long ago at many times and in many ways god spoke to our fathers by the prophets but in these last days he has spoken to us by his son whom he appointed the heir of all things through whom also he created the world
1049877 we need no more bible god has done his work
1049878 the bible as it is today didnt exist until the 3rd or 4th century after christ just as many writings were rejected as were included and revelation was not part of the equation that is a serious manipulation in my opinion
1049879 we believe the bible to be the word of god as far as it is translated correctly we also believe the book of mormon to be the word of god
1049880 t rue learning increases both knowledge and mystery the more knowledge we have of god from the bible the more mysteries we apprehend the benefit of increasing mystery this way rather than by means of preserving ignorance is that what we do know gives direction to what we dont know

1049932 it doesnt really change my mind at all i still like penn state and im still with it
1049933 to see all that stuff happening there i really worry at this point i dont really want him to go to that school i know you cant run away because trouble is everywhere but to see that they have a coach and a coaching staff that is not doing what they need to do to keep this stuff from happening really worries me
1049934 i dont want my son to attend a school where theres no guidance when hes away from me i want him to have a role model to keep him in line
1049935 i am honestly i am im going to have to have a serious talk with him im definitely not leaving it up to him we all need to sit down and talk about this because i just want the best for my son and i need to see what type of options he wants to have right now because penn state to me is not a good option
1049936 of course if you have a lot of students and players at one school getting into trouble its going to make that school look bad but you cant necessarily say that the school is a bad place it just shows that those people chose to make the wrong decision
1049937 its not really been a big deal to me once youre in college youre an adult youre a grown female or male and youre old enough to make your own decisions if you choose to make the wrong decision thats on you
1049938 my whole take on it was that i stay away from that type of trouble when you go to college you should know the things you shouldnt be doing
1049939 ive been told that about his contract ive been watching espn and they keep talking about it i mean even if this is his last year whether its a successor which id love to have or if its a brand new coaching staff and then i guess im going to have to see
1049940 im going to penn state because thats where i should be it wasnt for any specific coach
1049941 i honestly dont have a problem as far as these allegations that have gone on with penn state

1049980 here we have a brief and thoughtful theology of the use and place of music in the gathered worship of the people of god aniol argues that our current confusions over music in public worship are at the root theological consequently we need to understand what worship is biblically how sanctification happens the nature and importance of religious affections the relationship between gods glory and beauty and the purpose of music in corporate worship before we are in a position to evaluate the kinds of music most appropriate to that purpose when it comes to musical forms most evangelicals just dont think that they matter in the end and hence drop back to their own preferences as the benchmarks of what we do and dont do musically in public services of worship aniol wants to challenge that approach rightly so
1049981 scott aniol is at once theologian historian philosopher aesthetician musician logician and pastor in this encapsulating must read entry in the worship wars his biblical and musical insights are remarkable for any one person to make let alone one so young
1049982 unhappily the whole controversy about worship style has degenerated into arguments based on personal preference particularly regarding what kind of music is acceptable
1049983 worship in song is one of the most insightful explanations of biblical worship that i have ever read pastor scott aniol harmonizes the concepts of gods beauty aesthetics affection for god accurate theology and musical expertise unlike any other book on this subject i enthusiastically recommend worship in song as a must read for pastors church music directors and all christian musicians who sincerely desire to help lead their congregations to worship god in spirit and in truth
1049984 scott aniol provides a tremendous service to all who would seek to please the lord jesus christ in their thoughts and emotions and in that place where their thoughts and emotions are drawn together to please god their worship
1049985 worship in song may not always be an easy read but it should become a must read for those seeking answers to tough questions about music the book is well written well researched and well documented arguments are clearly presented scott aniol takes the reader to scripture for answers the use of secular sources is appropriate and necessary he is gracious and uncompromising balanced and fair
1049986 in the 20 years i have been in christian broadcasting no single issue has been more explosive than the subject of christian music in the church scott aniols much needed book takes on this issue in an incisive manner and he rightly points to the foundational issue of religious affections that underlies the entire debate christians have allowed hollywood and popular culture to shape their affections rather than holy scripture as a result they have made god over into someone who will accommodate their profane and carnal musical tastes in worship scott aniols thoroughly biblical approach is centered on the belief that god does have something to say about the music we listen to and the music that is used in worship christians owe a debt of gratitude to the author for his scholarship and clarity on this essential subject
