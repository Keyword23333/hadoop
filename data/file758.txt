7580006 when we get a chance were going to get together and do some demos and start rolling but were going to take it slow i feel like we needed to be away for a while people need to kind of miss us because there was a point in the last two and a half years where you could have seen us at least once a month if you wanted

7580023 we do need water we have been in a three year drought but we dont like that much water at one time
7580024 peanuts and cotton are in the ground if they get a significant amount of water we could get crop damage

7580039 she came home from school a couple of times and said i got in trouble for doing a cartwheel
7580040 i thought she meant that it was wrong to do it on the concrete but they made an announcement at assembly that gymnastics was banned
7580041 we had to practise for a play and she did one on the grass
7580042 two teachers took her upstairs and she had to sit down for the rest of the day and not do anything
7580043 i said to the principal what if she keeps doing a handstand and he said shed get into trouble
7580044 i asked what would happen if she was a repeat handstand offender and he said that would be defiance and it could lead to her being suspended
7580045 the school is committed to ensuring that children can continue to do handstands cartwheels and similar movements but in a safe environment under appropriate supervision
7580046 decisions regarding local student safety issues are taken by individual school principals
7580047 thats at an operational level for a school or a principal to work out
7580048 its up to the school or the local community what they want to do
7580049 on the 12th hole i was looking for a ball in the grass i walked away and then went back and the next minute bang it hit me
7580050 i was like what was that and i looked around and i could see a black snake reared up and then its taken off it was about a 4 4 5 foot black snake but i dont know what kind
7580051 it must have been just underneath the grass and i couldnt see him
7580052 i went back to my friend and said a snakes got me and we got into a golf buggy and took off
7580053 it was like a really bad sting until i had a look and saw the two puncture marks and a bit of blood coming out of it and i knew straight away that it was a snake afterwards it got a bit hot and a bit flushed it was sore and there was a pulsating throbbing feeling
7580054 id like to get a result so that everybody knows what their future holds
7580055 i havent read the report yet but what we have to do is weigh up the imbalance between social responsibility and economic responsibility
7580056 we will consider the report and look at the various options to move forward
7580057 some of us are starting to feel that we have lost the battle
7580058 council is being very clever in not giving anything away so it is difficult to jump up and down about it
7580059 i hope council is taking the matter seriously and looks at the issues very carefully when councillors make their decision
7580060 i know we have had some indications of support but will this mean these councillors will vote against it or go with the committees recommendation whatever it may be
7580061 councillors have had three months to think about it and i hope they can see past the dollar signs
7580062 we are offering something new for the centre an open door active management looking for people exploring a range of activities and attracting new user groups to use this facility
7580063 there will be all sorts of problems not the least backing up the management with volunteers
7580064 we have looked at various grants which are available and feel the centre would be successful in obtaining good grants as it seeks to renew an old but solid facility to fulfil its purpose of a community recreation centre
7580065 we were wondering whether we should put sheets over them so no one could see what they were doing
7580066 we didnt know what it was until we got closer
7580067 sure enough its one turtle on top of the other theyd been going at it for quite a long time
7580068 its unusual in the fact with green turtles they have clearly defined courtship areas on land and en masse
7580069 its probably a little early in the season for what most people would think as a classic turtle nesting time which is usually late november early december for the northern great barrier reef area
7580070 but having said that there is sort of low density nesting happening year round in some of the northern region
7580071 so these are a couple of turtles that got together at a good time early in the season
7580072 it was the second day of the three day live aboard trip
7580073 it was late thursday afternoon and they turned right up beside the boat
7580074 they were getting up to within 5m of us and the whales were coming to me having a look
7580075 id rather cheer for the underdog than for the olympic team
7580076 i wish to wait for my flight in a private room please allow me to partake of the free body cavity search as well
7580077 i dont want him going but i tell you what i dont want my grandsons or granddaughters going back in 15 years so how we leave makes a big difference
7580078 terrorism is a means not an end and very different groups and countries are using it toward very different goals if we cant even identify the enemy or describe the war were fighting its difficult to see how we will win

7580080 prohibit extraterritorial detention and rendition except under limited circumstances to modify the definition of unlawful enemy combatant for purposes of military commissions and to extend statutory habeas corpus to detainees
7580081 do you agree or disagree with the statement made by former attorney general gonzales in january 2007 that nothing in the constitution confers an affirmative right to habeas corpus separate from any statutory habeas rights congress might grant or take away
7580082 i disagree categorically with mr gonzales the constitution guarantees the right of habeas corpus unless in the case of rebellion or invasion it is suspended my national security with justice act reinforces this constitutional right by extending by statute meaningful habeas review for all guant namo detainees
7580083 re establishing our credibility as a nation committed to the rule of law
7580084 i think this is a very fair and just resolve and im very pleased and excited that florida and michigan will be seated with full voting rights
7580085 symbolically the restoration of the full vote does mean a lot to people
7580086 it enables democrats to put that behind us and move on to whats most important which is electing a democratic president
7580087 you can challenge the system which doesnt work well and you can land on your feet
7580088 for bringing the sun back out in this process for florida
7580089 we had no candidates no campaign no addressing of michigans issues by the presidential candidates at the time
7580090 because of the early state pledge barack obama is not as well known to the people of florida as he is in a lot of other states or as john mccain is to people in florida
7580091 if the dnc had shown some leadership instead of allowing the leaders of the early states drive the train we could have preserved the historical early states and also prevented the mess
7580092 the least of things with a meaning is worth more in life than the greatest of things without it
7580093 meanings are not determined by situations but we determine ourselves by the meanings we give to situations
7580094 the essence of intelligence is skill in extracting meaning from everyday experience
7580095 meaning is not what you start with but what you end up with
7580096 our obligation is to give meaning to life and in doing so to overcome the passive indifferent life
7580097 what we see depends mainly on what we look for
7580098 what we see depends upon what is meaningful to us
7580099 if you hate a person you hate something in him that is a part of yourself what isnt part of ourselves doesnt disturb us
7580100 love is just a word until someone comes along and gives it meaning
7580101 if i could tell you what it meant there would be no point in dancing it
7580102 i miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because i know not the parts that others play
7580103 ultimately man should not ask what the meaning of his life is but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked
7580104 the president felt it was important to have the vice president consult with allies in the region on our common security interests
7580105 obviously it has taken on greater importance since recent events
7580106 if visitors walk out of here with more questions than they had when they came in thats all we ask
7580107 the concept is that this is a found object emerging from a file cabinet kind of like information hidden in a drawer somewhere
7580108 its meant to grab your attention and question what it is

7580117 we had never been able to develop on online education component and that is now an important objective
7580118 this is the most robust offering of classes outside of a university setting the film society is building on the foundation that film arts has established and taking it in a new direction
7580119 video production editing graphics motion graphics 3d modeling all remain strong classes for us
7580120 we can do better as a bridge toward professional advancement
7580121 we have more contacts with funders with investors with the industry and we can ourselves invent exhibition opportunities

7580123 i want to see my dog my brother and my parents but i dont want to leave the boat
7580124 megan is the youngest but shes been doing really well
7580125 theyve seen amazing landscape such as icebergs theyve visited some communities and they have also seen all kinds of wildlife we have a great group of students scientists and educators on board
7580126 several of our inuit staff are teaching us a lot about their backgrounds
7580127 things like hunting inuit games legends and about the history of the people of the north
7580128 whales come up quite close to us in our small zodiacs
7580129 sometimes even with our ship we are able to get quite close to wildlife
7580130 weve never been to the sam ford fjord but it was just beautiful
7580131 the hike was hard on the students but everyone went at their own pace
7580132 the people were really nice they came out to greet us and then we had a bbq
7580133 isabella bay was my favourite because thats when we went in our zodiacs and seen the whales and the two polar bears
7580134 theyre really coming together as a team weve got a group of students from 10 different countries
7580135 there are 66 students 22 are northern aboriginal youth from all across the north from labrador to the yukon and even one girl from alaska
7580136 there is no doubt that above every other issue in labrador west right now the lack of physicians should be the number one priority in my opinion
7580137 we need a hospital no doubt about that but a hospital is no good without doctors
7580138 dr arsenault suggested a committee be formed and requested this through the towns of lab city and wabush
7580139 the towns then got approval from labrador grenfell health to work with such a committee the idea behind it was to find out how we could attract doctors
7580140 i cannot overemphasize how serious this is because it means those three doctors will have to carry the load of the emergency department and all the patients in town if one of them got sick the system would fall apart immediately i mean these doctors cannot be expected to sustain this
7580141 what the labrador grenfell health board has agreed to do is send over doctors from goose bay to help in the emergency room but that doesnt do anything for patients in town that havent got a family doctor
7580142 and when drs rizk and ibrahim leave that will leave at least another 2500 patients orphaned
7580143 it will bring it up to almost half the population here and the population is expected to grow there are contractors coming into the area every month even if these people are here only temporarily they still need to avail of medical help while they are here its definitely a crisis
7580144 we cannot service the population we are burning these doctors out and there are still so many patients are not getting adequate care
7580145 i have a friend who last year retired in churchill falls and moved here to labrador city he now has to drive to churchill falls to see a doctor
7580146 primary health care is when a doctor works with part of a team of lets say a nurse practitioner a physiotherapist and a pharmacist
7580147 so what we recommend is this be done in conjunction with the new hospital so that when the hospital is competed this system will be in place we want to ensure there is a primary health care system functioning in this community along with the new hospital when a doctor comes in he she wants to see there is adequate help from other professionals up to date equipment and a good facility to practice
7580148 if you are a young doctor coming out of university it difficult to set up your own practice in a fee for service because a lot of these have education debts as high as 200 000
7580149 starting out its more feasible for many to work as a salaried physician the prac has recommended to the health board that they come up with a blended system while we work our way through to the primary health care system when the new hospital is up and running its difficult but not impossible
7580150 what we have there now is the older type insulators because of course the system is old like most around the province
7580151 some of the issues weve had in lab west were related to the insulators
7580152 they porcelain crack and it causes a fault and you lose power the new type should improve reliability and decrease outages
7580153 like poles that over time have come to a bit of a lean and need to be straightened
7580154 we are also making the guywires more secure and tightening the power lines theres too much slack on the lines and when its windy those wires can gallop we think that is one of the issues we had with outages we had a series of probably eight times when the power was on and off and we pinpointed the exact location where it was and it was a slack line and the pole needs to be straightened there were also couple of areas where the distribution poles were too far apart it meets code but to make it more secure we thought wed put in more poles to shorten the distance and make it more secure as well
7580155 so this work is being done on the lines and into the wabush terminal station which they own
7580156 and next year churchill is planning on spending over 4 million on those lines and in that terminal station we are seeing reliability issues and some issues were on the supply side we lost supply from churchill so they are making improvements as well to improve the supply they sell to us and we sell to the consumers and we have gone back to them and said some work needs to be done
7580157 we are proposing it needs to be replaced because we have reliability issues on the line
7580158 it will cost about a half a million dollars and if approved we will do that next summer 09

7580251 this is who i am this is what i believe in traditions here
7580252 were not the fall in line party but make no mistake we are united

7580259 the bishops conference has left it to the individual bishops to decide how they want to handle it
7580260 its kind of appropriate that the almighty god placed him here today because sen biden is here
7580261 as you know he has just received a new appointment and how could we not know about that the senator has received this appointment as we understand because of his expertise in foreign affairs
7580262 its nice that he gets a little educating this morning about some of the needs of our church and the community as well in south india
7580263 that he may find increased wisdom and strength as he becomes more involved in the presidential campaign as candidate for vice president

7580272 i dont think i ever said bart allen was dead i am serious
7580273 there were stories that were going to be told and there were definite crossovers taking place at the moment of the death of bart allen so there is a good chance there is going to be more resolutions to that character and what happened to him in the very near future or the very far future
7580274 we are going to show you how unique and individual each of those flashes are and what theyre purpose is and what they can all do
7580275 and to reinstate barry allen as the king of the flashes thats what we are out to do
7580276 but no one else can see them its a company perk
7580277 i used to ask if we could weave the ghost of barry allen or at least the essence into a story
7580278 i want to see barry i want to see wally i want to see jay i hope to see bart someday id like to see jesse quick and johnny quick and max mercury i want to see them all working together and functioning as a group by the way one of those i let slip

7580307 idf special forces israeli air force personnel detachments of the mossad and other israeli groups
7580308 fruitful land to israeli groups and mercenaries who were all working in complete cooperation with american forces to train and equip the new georgian armed forces israel was preparing to attack tehran
7580309 at the same time israel was preparing to move some of its attack aircraft into georgia base them on israeli controlled airfields in southern georgia and arm and equip them for a strike on tehran
7580310 the second flight was to strike at iranian oil wells pipelines and persian gulf oil terminals once the dual strike was completed the aircraft would head towards israel and then were slated to be refueled in mid air by an american tanker aircraft

7580313 these settlements are supposed to be the nail in the coffin of any future peace agreement with the palestinians
7580314 this place is holy to the jewish people and we have a duty to be here
7580315 the whole land of israel belongs to us and we should not be afraid to live wherever we want to the arabs must accept that
7580316 we are connected to the water grid we have phone lines from the national company bezeq we have been hooked up by the electricity company and have street lighting
7580317 we also have a kindergarten paid for by the state and a group of soldiers stationed here to protect us how can we be illegal
7580318 we can also see all the arabs from here and keep an eye on what they are doing
7580319 and in addition we can see the other settlements and check on their safety
7580320 they are very afraid that this will become simply the first of many settlements to fall
7580321 the settlers know that preparation of an alternative site could take years
7580322 the danger is that migron will be destroyed only to be resurrected in legalised form by the government as a new settlement close by adam
7580323 we believe it is possible to find a solution for the outposts that will strengthen the settlements
7580324 it would be a big mistake if we give up what is rightfully ours
7580325 israel and the clash of civilisations iraq iran and the plan to remake the middle east
7580326 this sum of threats and noise against lebanon is attributed to internal reasons inside israel
7580327 we do not underestimate or undervalue these threats but we deal with them with confidence and resolution
7580328 will be swift and victory shall be fast crystal clear and unequivocally decisive the army of our enemy will witness an unprecedented method of fighting by courageous tough and devoted resistance fighters in the battlefield something they had never seen since the establishment of their usurping entity
7580329 i would like to confirm that those recent threats made by israeli pm ehud olmert and some of his ministers also come within the same framework of intimidation and psychological war against lebanon otherwise there is no rationale for all of this the israelis speak about the policy statement of the lebanese government and say that the government has adopted the resistance and has given hezbollah an umbrella therefore it has to pay the price this is ridiculous because the policy statement of the former government was a text stronger in supporting the resistance than the present one yet zionist leaders did not say that it covered the resistance and adopted it today the israelis need to speak this language of intimidation and blackmail on the other hand they also need it because they have kadima elections coming up and it goes without saying that foreign minister tsibi livni and minister of transportation and a deputy prime minister shaul mofaz will be at loggerheads to lead the party the israelis might hold early legislative elections as well so the labor party kadima and likud will engage in competition moreover there is a current crisis of leadership inside the zionist entity and therefore everyone is trying to project himself as the leader the expert and the savior they have entered the phase of outbidding and threatening lebanon is no exception of course olmert has his own special circumstances the israeli media is no longer commenting on him the israeli media lashed out at olmert saying when you were stronger than today you unleashed threats and promises and proved to be a failure well olmert the loser who is packing for leaving is talking to us this way nevertheless we have to understand his personal and psychological circumstances however we should not underestimate or undervalue these threats we should not be pressured by them as well and cause a state of fear i can tell you from the position of someone who is very cognizant with the resistance its development and its capabilities after the 2006 war the israelis will think tens of thousands of times before they decide to wage a war against lebanon look at defense minister ehud baraks approach when he speaks about balance between lebanon and israel or between the resistance and israel and when he assails and threatens syria and iran he says that if you provide modern anti aircraft weapons to hezbollah you will be disturbing the balance and israel will not allow this to happen barak is acknowledging the current balance and hes afraid of breaking it we do not need to face a threat with another threat we believe in action not in words we made pledges and we fulfilled them before and today we make pledges and we will fulfill them any attack or any war against lebanon will have very different results and repercussions that begin from the results and repercussions of the july 2006 war the new israeli threat is not the israeli air force its what barak is saying about a ground operation that he will carry out to invade lebanon in a matter of days he is speaking about five divisions under construction for that purpose he is saying that these forces are going to change the equation and that they will be engaged in a house to house battle i tell barak and this is my new pledge your five divisions will be crushed on our mountains valleys houses and villages and with them your usurping entity will be destroyed mofaz barak chief of staff gabi ashkenazi and others are speaking about a swift and successful war but i tell them that even though we hate to see this war happening our next victory will be definite unequivocally decisive and crystal clear this army will see in the battlefields in the eyes of the resistance fighters and in their fists things they have never seen since the establishment of the zionist entity god willing

7580332 did dollar just accuse john the baptist literally losing his head because he got angry and tried to use logic in a situation wow
7580333 anderson is kind of endearing because he posts all of his videos himself it takes a certain kind of man a stand up man if you will to directly invite that sort of abuse

7580344 se trata de una gran ejercicio propagand stico es la oportunidad de los partidos para mostrar a su candidato sin pagar en comerciales de televisi n
7580345 es verdad que se han convertido en un espect culo y ya no tienen el objetivo con el que nacieron que era elegir al candidato pero tienen ahora otro tipo de funci n
7580346 la gente estaba cansada deque los l deres escogieran al candidato sin que hubiera una participaci n m s democr tica es por eso que se iniciaron los caucus y las primarias para que todo los miembros del partido en el pa s pudieran dar su opini n
7580347 la convenciones costar n cada una us 60 millones y gran parte del dinero se ha logrado recaudar con contribuciones de qui nes de grandes empresas y grupos de inter s algunas compa as han donado hasta us 6 millones de d lares

7580353 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7580354 after the georgian leadership lost their marbles as they say all the problems got worse and a military conflict erupted
7580355 and i believe we should handle other existing conflicts in this context
7580356 this could never happen with our knowledge or approval and we investigated the situation as a matter of urgency
7580357 the industry has taken much greater strides than anyone ever imagined 40 years ago
7580358 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future
7580359 what if those machines had a small amount of intelligence and they could assemble themselves into various shapes and were capable of movement or locomotion
7580360 if you had enough of them you could create arbitrary shapes and have the assembly of machines that could take on any form and move in arbitrary ways
7580361 my cell phone is too big to fit comfortably in my pocket and too small for my fingers its worse if i try to watch movies or do my e mail but if i had 200 to 300 milliliters of catoms i could have it take on the shape of the device that i need at that moment
7580362 to form its smallest shape or even be a little squishy so i can just drop it in my pocket
7580363 sometime over the next 40 years this will become everyday technology

7580377 the council has said they didnt want to have layoffs but personnel is 83 percent of the police departments budget
7580378 if the departments can cut their budgets a minimum of 5 percent maybe we can use reserves to stem the tide a while until we get a handle of whats going on
7580379 the council has eliminated some items and added others that werent included in the budget
7580380 were also looking at water and garbage rates park rentals and other fees

7580421 mend will not issue any threat over this painful waste of lives but will retaliate at the appropriate time before notifying the public
7580422 there was no shootout no incident and the boat and its passengers moved on
7580423 this really is a catastrophe people are being killed while the world just watches
7580424 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
7580425 moderation in temper is always a virtue but moderation in principle is always a vice
7580426 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
7580427 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
7580428 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
7580429 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
7580430 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
7580431 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it

7580435 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation

7580437 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
7580438 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
7580439 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
7580440 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
7580441 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
7580442 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
7580443 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
7580444 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life

7580446 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
7580447 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy

7580449 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it

7580452 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
7580453 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
7580454 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
7580455 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
7580456 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
7580457 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
7580458 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
7580459 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
7580460 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
7580461 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
7580462 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
7580463 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
7580464 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
7580465 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
7580466 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
7580467 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
7580468 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
7580469 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
7580470 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
7580471 the human race has improved everything except the human race adlai stephenson
7580472 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed

7580602 the uk visa operation in nigeria is one of uks biggest and busiest in the world
7580603 the bhc has processed over 300 000 uk visa applications in nigeria
7580604 this form is a standard form that asks some questions that sometimes require just a yes or a no answer and does not go into details to tell you that further information are needed to be disclosed
7580605 for example a simple question that asks for your marital status will require that you must present your marriage certificate if you say you are married or a court order showing that you are divorced if that is what you indicated in the form and also the presentation of a detailed explanation regarding who holds custody of your children if you say you have kids
7580606 sometimes some people do not know what they want to apply for and the moment you apply for the wrong thing you may not know all the information you need to provide if you are going to study do not asterisk visiting on the form
7580607 you need to be able to access all the laws that govern each type of application
7580608 take the right of abode as an example you need to be conversant with the british immigration act and the nationalities act and not just rush and fill the form
7580609 someone who earns n80 000 in a month and says he wants to go on six weeks leave in britain where he intends to spend 2 000 has missed the point eighty thousand a month multiplied by 12 months is n960 000 the question is why anyone should want to blow over 50 per cent of his annual income in six weeks such a person is a potential candidate to be turned down all these deductions are made from your answer to two simple questions that asks you how much you earn and how much you are travelling with that is why i say most information are hidden and are intended to weed out people
7580610 this kind of mistake is very costly because not only are the candidates denied the visa but they are on their own in recovering their trapped tuition
7580611 we counsel such people not only to get the visa but also on what they are likely to face if they find themselves in the uk
7580612 in any case you must have a work permit before you can get the type of employment that will bring you under the british labour law
7580613 eighty per cent of nigerians who are illegal immigrants in britain are night watchmen in three pubs that i frequent in the uk the guys that stay in the toilets to give out toiletries like hand towels are nigerians and they are graduates some read economics

7580618 highlighting how clinton was passed over by barack obama in favor of joe biden and now this one showing a former clinton national delegate stating that she is voting for john mccain is meant to play up the tensions between clinton supporters and obama and his supporters to garner more of them to vote for john mccain
7580619 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7580620 japanese soldiers in the south pacific still fighting after the war is over
7580621 we understand that some in the news media are more interested in reporting the rumor of controversy than the fact of unity the fact is that our teams are working closely to ensure a successful convention and will continue to do so senator and president clinton fully support the obama biden ticket and look forward to addressing the convention and the nation on the urgency of victory this fall anyone saying anything else doesnt know what theyre talking about period
7580622 matthews and keith olbermann are not the only voices on msnbc

7580750 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7580751 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7580752 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7580753 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together

7580764 quasi national unity ticket with lieberman renouncing any further ambition to run for the presidency
7580765 should help with ticket splitters but can such a ticket hold the support of pro lifers conservatives and republicans if youre conscientiously pro life you will have reservations about a pro abortion rights vp if youre a proud conservative lieberman hasnt been one if youre a loyal republican youd much prefer someone from within the ranks
7580766 i woke up this morning and i thought gosh i hope im prepared
7580767 im really glad that i did my student teaching here and im coaching and meeting students

7580770 i learned a lot in student teaching and im sure ill learn a lot more in the first few weeks of class as a first year teacher youve got a lot on your plate

7580777 what you ought to be what you can be what you will be
7580778 but it wasnt a mob scene it was never a mob scene
7580779 the senator came over to me and said something like my career has taken off since i gave the knox commencement address
7580780 i went down with a friend of mine but we were offered an opportunity to volunteer at the event
7580781 we helped work the crowd a little bit it essentially turned into crowd control
7580782 it was pretty much a sea of people walking in
7580783 by 1 30 it was so crowded where we were we ended up going outside our area and watched the event on the jumbotron
7580784 it was so hot with all the people so close together and by noon the sun was directly overhead and there was no shade

7580792 there have been a few complaints in edmonton the kids are smart enough or intuitive enough to tell mom and dad and mom and dad will contact the police
7580793 what usually happens is the predator will get online and try to make contact and communicate and then try to get them into a more private setting like possibly msn messenger where they can have a chat with them and from there things can progress
7580794 people play sports together in real life they gain trust and friendships the same thing can happen online
7580795 you just leave and go somewhere else and play a different game or whatever
7580796 ive had those conversations with them since they were just little kids to talk about the safety and what to be aware of
7580797 if somebody comes on and starts asking them questions or is trying to engage them in conversation that is not about the game such as what do they do and where do they live and about their bodies then they should just turn it off or tell them to go away
7580798 the two hottest device launches to date could lead to the greatest subscriber quarter in rogers history when it launches third quarter 2008 results

7580924 be wary of strong drink it can make you shoot at tax collectors and miss
7580925 to have my college on this list would be an honor

7580937 its no question that gov sebelius would have been an excellent vp but we here in texas were rooting for one of our own
7580938 whats the trade off for being so upset that hillary didnt win that you vote for mccain whats your trade off do we want four more years of bush do we want four more years of higher gas prices
7580939 and lets win this because the trade off is dismal
7580940 while we revere senator mccains service and sacrifice for the country major veterans organizations give him a failing grade when it comes to supporting veterans health care and benefits
7580941 there was no overarching game plan here to be looking at 2012 or 2016 im simply spending time with a colleague of mine in congress
7580942 im just honored to have been considered and i commend senator obama for thinking outside of the box and looking at texas for a possible running mate
7580943 they dont give any silver or bronze medals in the veepstakes
7580944 there still is a possibility that obama will chip into the republican advantage with this religious outreach
7580945 even if he gains just a few points that could be decisive in a close election
7580946 the amount of work a user must invest in order to find favorable videos in youtube or other video applications is overwhelming

7580953 at previous conventions the parties and candidates would hope that the video would be shown to the television audience and if you were at home watching you might see it
7580954 but if you didnt catch the video about john kerry in 2004 your ability to see that video was pretty much lost
7580955 we have these fake queues at front of 20 stores around the country to drum up interest in the iphone
7580956 a pair of kerouacs armed with sharpies and erasers and righteous indignation
7580957 discovered a hand rendered sign inside that i regret to report contained a few errors

7580959 statement on the signage of our national parks and public lands to come
7580960 i want some introspection but lets be realistic im never going to be able to completely create that scenario
7580961 i think as the nominee of the democratic party barack obama is obligated to do everything that he can possibly do that is honest and ethical to win that seat
7580962 now what he talked about in terms of a different kind of politics i hope that after he wins he will attempt to have that kind of administration but this is an election and the obligation he has i think to the country is to fight as hard as he can fight
7580963 with biden obama also took mccains age off the table
7580964 the choice of biden was a hard headed cold blooded calculation that he may need a biden to win and will certainly benefit from a biden in governing if he become president it was the action of a politician not a crusader
7580965 his gifts as a campaigner his personality and his natural talents have set him apart from other politicians
7580966 the malaysians consider this a critical point in our history
7580967 whether we get the mandate to chart a new course for malaysia or we should just be happy with the same corrupt establishment
7580968 whats shocking is that the deputy prime minister himself is directly involved in this malicious campaign
7580969 mr anwar has been very personal i have not been personal

7580977 hay un acuerdo alcanzado entre las dos partes para una fecha fija que es el fin de 2011 para poner fin a cualquier presencia extranjera en suelo iraqu

7580986 knowing is not enough we must apply willing is not enough we must do
7580987 then a mist appeared through which two hands appeared that were handing me a crown of thorns
7580988 i took the crown of thorns from the outstretched hands and placed it upon my head as the crown was being seated upon my head i prematurely winced fully expecting searing pain from those thorns to shoot through my head and throughout my entire body
7580989 but instead of pain a warm and wonderful feeling of joy and peace settled over me i was being bathed in gods love
7580990 simultaneously with the crown of thorns being placed upon my head a vision appeared before me of a glass mirror
7580991 i was immediately filled with shame because jesus had caught me wearing his crown and i immediately pulled it from my head
7580992 as i did the glass unfurled before me and again jesus was standing before me
7580993 at that moment the realization hit me that i was looking into a mirror and seeing my own reflection and that reflection was my savior and my lord and me one and the same
7580994 this vision greatly troubled me after all who did i think i was anyway was i so vain as to think myself equal to jesus god forbid the vision continued to frighten me long afterwards fearing that my attitude was obviously not right with god that is until i heard these words
7580995 do not be afraid to put on my crown of thorns

7581003 i just kept saying that this is too weird leo was like oh get over with it and i am going while i said yeah but a little reminder you are my best friend and he mendes is my husband so this is a bit weird
7581004 many of their montana democrats arguments in favor of lowering the drinking age are remarkably similar to ours
7581005 the awards committee recognized seamans work to reflect excellent scholarship and high social relevance and noted that his commitment to the issue of college drinking was enduring and impressive
7581006 thanks scott judges im flattered but frankly astonished that a group of data driven knowledgeable scientists would actually be enlightened by the musings of a journalist who wandered into the thick of american campus life with a notebook in his hand makes me think i must have gotten at least part of it right everyone here tonight can agree that we have an alcohol problem increasingly centered among young people in this country where we might differ is on how best to respond i believe that we cannot expect young people to learn how to handle alcohol responsibly if we walk out of the room and assume that the law is going to solve the problem we need to be in that room demonstrating that one doesnt need to do shots and get falling down drink to enjoy oneself i would urge you as scientists to help us as a society find the right balance between legislating behavior as we try to do now and educating young people objectively so they can take responsibility for their behavior

7581017 there was a time when i felt as at the end of any great fight some disappointment
7581018 were going to have a change because people expect it and were going to have a democratic house and senate
7581019 were been in this business a long time all of us sometimes you win sometimes you lose it doesnt mean the world comes to an end weve got a very short time to get the campaign together and win it and win it big
7581020 that wonderful struggle that broke so many glass ceilings but didnt quite break one more
7581021 there are some who will point to the historic nature of her candidacy who will not vote for her but many others will do what hillary does which is vote for obama

7581103 the demand that were seeing has far exceeded even our wildest expectations
7581104 people want to catch up on events that they miss about half say thats the main reason the second reason about 40 percent is that they want to resee and revisit the major events they had seen on tv earlier
7581105 the stadium is already a world famous athletics venue and its reputation as a major training facility is growing
7581106 our aim now is to capitalise on what we already have here by developing something really special
7581107 you must be the change you want to see in the world
7581108 the recent gse sell off has been surprising since the only catalyst was apparently a press report suggesting that federal officials are likely to recapitalize the gses soon

7581126 the potential exploitable wind resource in british columbia has been estimated at 5 000 mw
7581127 it therefore makes perfect sense for sgurrenergy to set up in the provinces largest city vancouver in order to tap into this large pipeline of project work that will require an extensive knowledge of wind farm development
7581128 wie ein examen das uns zeigen wird was wir drauf haben
7581129 dieses spiel wird vor dem start der champions league ein guter test f r uns sein
7581130 es ist wie ein examen das uns zeigen wird was wir drauf haben united ist ein sehr ber hmter und sehr starker gegner dem wir mit viel respekt gegen ber treten
7581131 der spielbetrieb in russland war zuletzt sehr anstrengend aber wir hatten zeit um uns auf das spiel in monaco vorzubereiten
7581132 aus psychologischer sicht wird es f r uns leichter weil die fans in der heimischen liga von uns immer siege erwarten der druck ist einfach gr er
7581133 dieser vergleich ist durchaus zutreffend aber mit einem unterschied united ist st rker als die bayern
7581134 nach der uefa euro 2008 kehrten die russischen nationalspieler ausgelaugt in die liga zur ck wir hatten auch einen sehr straffen zeitplan die transfer spekulationen um andrei arshavin ziehen sich auch in die l nge
7581135 seit sechs wochen ist dieses thema jetzt allgegenw rtig und ich m chte gar nicht leugnen dass das team sowie unsere resultate davon negativ beeinflusst wurden
7581136 ich hoffe dass in den n chsten tagen endlich klarheit herrschen wird
7581137 angesichts der vielen partien brauchen wir weitere spieler leider wollen nur wenige gute akteure nach russland kommen dabei geht es nicht um das niveau in der liga denn das ist gut wahrscheinlicher ist es dass die spieler von der infrastruktur und den langen fl gen zu ausw rtsspielen abgeschreckt sind

7581160 it was always my aim to come back here and try to defend my title as soon as the gun went off at the swim i smashed in i held on for dear life on the course there were parts of the marathon that were very ugly but coming back it doesnt matter how you feel because the crowd takes you home its amazing
7581161 a lot of folks are driving into the south okanagan just because of the logistics i think
7581162 upon closer examination four one kilogram bags of what appeared to be ecstasy pills were located under the rear seat approximately 132 000 pills were seized

7581169 the new aero package helps driving through the high speed sections of the track even quicker the carbon brakes work extremely well meaning you can brake a lot later than you ever could before its much more like a thoroughbred racing car overall the performance is a step up in every department i thoroughly enjoyed driving the car
7581170 the extra 60bhp you get with the push to pass will open up more overtaking opportunities at every circuit a1gp visits this season which should make racing even more exciting
7581171 the test was very encouraging and both test drivers gave very useful feedback the brakes have much much better performance the engine is stronger and it is more powerful and has more torque we have obviously moved forward with this car with this we have now covered 6100 kilometres testing with the first test car and 581 kilometres with the second
7581172 at this point im not sure i see a consensus for how the commission ends up addressing it
7581173 its quickly becoming a very popular way to build next generation applications theres a lot of interest in capturing the hearts and minds of developers
7581174 we have a large and established customer base there is no doubt in our minds that microsoft is going after this space very aggressively but we feel very strong and confident
7581175 this is a logical extension of the investment that weve had in the development space for decades
7581176 and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so theres no room for debate on this matter
7581177 it soon became clear to me that the ossetians viewed georgians in much the same way that georgians view russians as aggressive bullies bent on taking away their independence
7581178 i was there in march 1991 shortly after the city was occupied by georgian militia units loyal to zviad gamsakhurdia the first freely elected leader of georgia in seven decades one of gamsakhurdias first acts as georgian president was to cancel the political autonomy that the stalinist constitution had granted the republics 90 000 strong ossetian minority i discovered that the town tskhinvali the capital of south ossetia had been ransacked by gamsakhurdias militia the georgians had trashed the ossetian national theater decapitated the statue of an ossetian poet and pulled down monuments to ossetians who had fought with soviet troops in world war ii the ossetians were responding in kind firing on georgian villages and forcing georgian residents of tskhinvali to flee their homes
7581179 we were concentrating more on the flight than the record
7581180 unwilling perhaps unable to question our basic assumptions about how our tools relate to our larger purposes and prospects
7581181 t he economics of corn ethanol have never made much sense
7581182 its really geared toward the digital audience that wants to be the ultimate decider of what order they watch it
7581183 what it really is is a one stop shop for news fanatics about whats happening right now in the country and the world
7581184 if i think we screwed up on the broadcast im going to say that
7581185 if we left out something out of a piece that we shouldnt have im going to say that too
7581186 exploitation of black workers by white workers was preordained inscribed as it were on the dna of the white american proletariat white alabama and arkansas workers workers would prevent black workers from rising out of the mudsill by mob and apartheid laws just as their northern counterparts had historically done through urban riots exclusionary union rules
7581187 the successful conclusion of our partnership with altagas has validated our business model to develop clean renewable energy projects in the western u s and canada
7581188 the nyiso board of directors recognized henry chaos superb performance in directing the nyisos expanding array of planning responsibilities ranging from resource adequacy to complex transmission planning studies

7581191 in todays marketplace it doesnt pay to be loyal to one brand
7581192 shameful treatment of sub saharan african migrants and vulnerable asylum seekers blatantly disregards international law
7581193 here it is like war for us and back home it is war also there is no difference we fled from death but death is after us we dont know what is happening to our relatives back home in camps for the displaced staying there would have been better than what happened to us
7581194 the systems that generate elections and earthquakes are complex systems
7581195 they are not predictable by simple equations but after coarse graining averaging they become predictable
7581196 we didnt look at it as reagan versus carter or republicans versus democrats or liberals versus conservatives rather we looked at elections as stability versus upheavals
7581197 a religious war going on in our country for the soul of america it is a cultural war
7581198 hello george this is ron reagan id like to go over to the convention and announce that youre my choice for vice president if thats alright with you

7581201 the uptake of xp was slower than people remember today
7581202 xp was really viewed as a glorified upgrade not a new operating system in its own right
7581203 we used to say xp was like swiss cheese full of holes everywhere
7581204 google has shown that it thinks about day care the same way every other company does as a luxury not a benefit judging by whats transpired thats what google is fast becoming just another company
7581205 theres just too much of it that is regularly broken it seems like every week 10 of all the features are broken and its a different 10 every week the old bugs are getting fixed the new ones introduced
7581206 the culture at google values coolness tremendously and the quality of service not as much
7581207 were making javascript disappear as far as performance is concerned
7581208 one example is to use the browser as a very simple photoshop
7581209 editing an image requires things that for each step takes the better part of a second thats not a great user experience but with tracemonkey now you have something that comes close to interactive performance
7581210 we are planning for it to be there in firefox 3 1
7581211 it wont have all the capabilities theres more than a couple of months of work left but we are targeting 3 1
7581212 theres still a lot of room for improvement to benchmark javascript
7581213 but as an application developer the only benchmark you care about is how your application runs
7581214 theres no theoretical reason why it cant be as sharp and approach native code speeds in two to four years
7581215 all browsers have improved their javascript speed we focused on our tests
7581216 we believe that this deal will position broadcom to be a leader in this market by significantly expanding our customer base giving us the product breath needed to lead the market and enabling us to achieve the scale needed to broadly compete
7581217 helping to strengthen our balance sheet lower our break even point and hone our focus
7581218 the market is large and expected deliver strong growth into the future
7581219 we look forward to a resounding success when we make our first attempt to send a beam all the way round the lhc

7581222 burden the original decision of the woman and the physician
7581223 would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute
7581224 as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved
7581225 if this is a child then this would be an antiabortion statute
7581226 obama is a father of two young girls you can bet that attacks like that will get him or any father riled up that language seems to be way over the top his critics can paint him as a pro choice liberal thats fair but to go any further is really beyond the pale is obama really sinister a monster
7581227 earlier the casualty ward received between 100 to 150 patients only today the number has increased to 800 the challenge is greater but resources insufficient
7581228 i had always been passionate about giving something back to my society which is why i chose to do medicine when i joined as a medical officer in 1989 and witnessed the poor condition of state run hospitals i decided to work towards a change i wanted to uplift the ward i was given charge of and prove that the government sector can also deliver if provided with the funds and opportunity this i was able to do over the years
7581229 the emergency ward at the jpmc karachi is possibly the only ward in the country where doctors are constantly busy if there is no political clash or bomb blast we are dealing with deaths from epidemics rain and what not
7581230 there were about 250 injured brought to the hospital and the chaos was unimaginable
7581231 in an urban city like karachi where suicide bombings clashes and political killings are common it is difficult to remain stress free but with time we learnt to handle one difficult situation after another
7581232 my official timings are from 8 00 am to 2 00 pm but i never return home on time and am unable to have lunch with my children it would always take me another three hours to wrap up
7581233 we cant make torchwood toys we cant market to children because its an adult show maybe we could do torchwood sex toys i will suggest it
7581234 i really love wales so its great to have the chance to play at a big festival here instead of taking the motorway we took the road up through the brecon beacons i feel at home here
7581235 bryn has asked me to be involved for a few years but because of filming ive never been able to
7581236 i am thrilled to be on dancing with the stars this season
7581237 i have always been a big fan of the show
7581238 we will take any decision up to terminating relations entirely
7581239 cooperation is above all in the interests of nato not russia
7581240 we want our relations to be full fledged and those of partners but we do not want an illusion of partnership
7581241 naturally we are not happy with being surrounded by military bases and being told do not worry everythings fine let alone with the latest events
7581242 we are ready and dmitry medvedev has confirmed this to review a syrian request to purchase new types of weapons
7581243 we will supply syria primarily with weapons of a defensive nature that will not disturb the strategic balance in the region
7581244 our position is we are ready to cooperate with russia in any project that can strengthen its security i think russia really has to think of the response it will make when it finds itself closed in a circle
7581245 i never dreamed i would walk again after i was wounded i forgot what its like
7581246 only when standing up can i feel how tall i really am and speak to people eye to eye not from below
7581247 it raises people out of their wheelchair and lets them stand up straight
7581248 physically the body works differently when upright you can challenge different muscles and allow full expansion of the lungs
7581249 psychologically it lets people live at the upright level and make eye contact
7581250 it may be a burdensome device but it will be very helpful and important for those who choose to use it
7581251 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
7581252 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline not an open time frame
7581253 were optimistic that iraq and the u s can reach a mutual agreement on flexible goals for u s troops to continue to return on success based on conditions on the ground and allow iraqi forces to provide security for a sovereign iraq
7581254 we dont want the phrase time horizons we are not comfortable with that phrase
7581255 stopped talking about the withdrawal of combat troops we just talk about withdrawals
7581256 precision and reliability are key to hellfires standing as the worlds premier air to ground weapon system
7581257 the battle proven hellfire ii continues its legacy of high lethality with minimal collateral damage
7581258 todays event represents not only the completion of a major aircraft assembly for the f 35 program but also the delivery on a promise by northrop grumman
7581259 weve shown that we can design and produce a common center fuselage that will meet the operational and logistic support requirements of all three variants of the f 35 and that were ready to transition to the production phase of the program
7581260 meeting this delivery commitment on time helps ensure that the f 35c lightning ii will begin flight test on schedule in 2009 this important step is vital to our commitment to fielding the f 35c for the u s navy as planned in 2015
7581261 the f 35 carrier variant will give the navy a powerful multi role strike fighter that can begin to assume the duties of the f a 18 hornet a b c d aircraft that have been successfully protecting and extending the reach of the u s fleet since 1983
7581262 there was only one dream team and there will never be another
7581263 i was pretty young in 1992 but to me there was only one dream team
7581264 that team inspired a lot of young people to want to go and play basketball this team is very good close to that team but i dont think there will ever be anything like that team again
7581265 were going to celebrate and were going to talk about the future going forward but the good news is this unsolicited five or six of these guys have already said they want to be a part of what we do going forward but we have plenty of time to sort through it they need some time off they really do
7581266 why not the best results from the national scorecard on u s health system performance 2008
7581267 thats not the point there are plenty of assholes and tough guy cops who would fuck with people just for sport thats why we have a judicial system btw whats your stance on the alleged aggressive interrogations at guantanamo
7581268 in total there are 10 new layouts for tau crater and since the jetpack is a massive game changing addition to warhawk we included a crap ton of bonus layouts for the original game too there are 30 bonus layouts that add jetpacks into the warhawks original content
7581269 except in three cases that of their wives their daughters and their girlfriends
7581270 nancy unwilling to stand up for womens pro choice beliefs
7581271 family is shaping the content of the entire day and thats not been done before
7581272 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7581273 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7581274 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7581275 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7581276 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7581277 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope
7581278 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7581279 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7581280 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7581281 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7581282 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7581283 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7581284 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7581285 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7581286 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7581287 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7581288 the acadia aced our front side and rear crash tests
7581289 while affording buyers state of the art crash protection the acadia also includes standard electronic stability control which safety research shows can help keep drivers out of some crashes altogether
7581290 it really shook him up he and i both essentially went through high school and college fantasizing about christina applegate so at first he was really excited like dude i totally get to see christina applegate nude but i guess the trauma of realizing that he drove a dagger into the collective heart of men everywhere by cutting off the very things that helped him through the rough spots of puberty was just too much for him
7581291 it started out kind of funny actually she was lying there on the table unconscious he was joking around check it out im finally getting to touch kelly bundys boobs but then you could almost see a kind of black cloud of realization drift over him as i handed him the scalpel and he remembered the task at hand when it was all said and done he just stood there for awhile then screamed what have i done and ran out of the room crying
7581292 knowing is not enough we must apply willing is not enough we must do
7581293 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show
7581294 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7581295 we have provided daleks and components for the tardis in the past and i think a one off move to the screen would be amazing
7581296 it would take dr who to the next level so should be very successful
7581297 i think david tenant is an excellent doctor who is perfect for the part because he is eccentric and a nice guy too
7581298 were breaking the bank and going all out to bring in an ace this year
7581299 were making a financial commitment not to simply having a baseball team but to having a winning baseball team
7581300 how long o lord will you forget me how long must i wrestle with my thoughts and everyday have sorrow in my heart
7581301 but i trust in your unfailing love my heart rejoices in your salvation i will sing to the lord for he has been good to me
7581302 the only honest art form is laughter comedy you cant fake it
7581303 these were basically attacks intended to result in the social exclusion or humiliation of the speaker punctuated on occasion with profanity a nasty glare or even a solid punch to the arm
7581304 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker
7581305 often drops characters there is either no buffer or the line buffer is too small without a source code theres nothing to be done about it
7581306 before i got the system i could in a good day turn out ten pages the computer lets me turn out words at more than double that rate it doesnt get in the way of writing every draft is a clean draft
7581307 we will take our orders from sheik osama bin laden because we are his students
7581308 al qaeda is the mother of the jihad in somalia
7581309 most of our leaders were trained in al qaeda camps we get our tactics and guidelines from them many have spent time with osama bin laden
7581310 once we end the jihad in somalia we will take it to any government that participated in the fighting against somalia or gave assistance to those attacking us
7581311 the more americans move against us the more popular we become
7581312 if they think a patient will gain an extra year of life but it will cost more than 20 000 they think it is not cost effective yet if the patient wants to pay for it themselves they are denied nhs treatment its an outrage
7581313 the nhs was built on the foundation of caring for the community it was designed to help those who needed help care for those who needed care and treat those who needed treatment
7581314 those basic principles have been lost as the government takes us down a dangerous path that can only be a catastrophic meltdown of the system
7581315 ten years ago waits of 18 months were not uncommon but by the end of this year no one should wait longer than 18 weeks none of this would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of everyone working into he nhs
7581316 they dont procreate i want to give religious status and values to jerusalem

7581322 rest assured i was on the internet within minutes registering my disgust throughout the world
7581323 home is where the heart lies but if the heart lies where is home
7581324 the ripest peach is the highest on the tree but it is t s eliot that said it all
7581325 i initially became aware of gold farming through my own games playing but assumed it was just a cottage industry
7581326 in a way that is still true its just that instead of a few dozen cottages there turn out to be tens of thousands
7581327 these gangs pay for their accounts with stolen credit cards take money from players and do not hand over gold or goods in return and fill chat channels with adverts for websites hawking game gold
7581328 still comparable in employment size yet not at all in terms of profile
7581329 and while its great to have my first title be not only a critically acclaimed one but also a financial success there is a bigger picture at play here that we need to look at consumers voted with their dollars
7581330 basically we have set a standard in digital gaming the bar has been raised and you have let developers around the world know that if they invest the time money and heart into making and remaking some great games you will support that initiative
7581331 heres something you dont know about mary when she had an orgasm she threw her hat in the air

7581356 de druk wordt bij zon tekort te groot in de zomervakantie rukten we bijna elke dag een of twee keer uit
7581357 je moet bij nood binnen een kwartier op het station zijn 24 uur per dag beschikbaar zijn en de baas op het werk moet het er ook mee eens zijn
7581358 it just happened all of a sudden out of nowhere
7581359 no there were problems ossetian provocation they killed police officers
7581360 russian politics started this the russians are good people but their politicians are bad aggressive the demonstrations of early november were russian provocation
7581361 i lived here for 50 years i remember world war two
7581362 i dont know if anyone came to offer help to repair the apartment many residents reported being told that the government would provide funds and assistance in rebuilding but nothing can fix my heart
7581363 we lived alongside the ossetians there are many in this city we lived peacefully
7581364 everyone believes the russians are coming back i think they may return
7581365 look what they did in chechnya sergo ordzhonokidze gave sochi to russia russia wants all of georgia
7581366 the russian soldiers were not bad they just stood there they were not aggressive but there were six tanks in the village to which she and her family fled when the bombing started but the first bombs landed on a first aid station there was no first aid after the first strikes
7581367 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7581368 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7581369 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7581370 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7581371 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7581372 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7581373 i voted for the bill before i voted against it
7581374 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7581375 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7581376 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7581377 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7581378 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7581379 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7581380 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7581381 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7581382 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7581383 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7581384 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7581385 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7581386 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7581387 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
7581388 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7581389 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
7581390 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief

7581446 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7581447 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7581448 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7581449 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7581450 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7581451 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7581452 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7581453 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7581454 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7581455 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7581456 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants

7581468 there is still work to do on the bill clinton front he feels like the obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments and he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process
7581469 the american response to this work has been frankly immature and lacking the sophistication and consideration that other parts of the world have so far shown the work
7581470 we still dont have all the answers about senator obama
7581471 we had old white men in utah see the film and say they finally understood hip hop as an art form

7581476 what an outrage ms goldfarb seems to be making up the rules as she goes along and as she sees fit the secrecy in the form of undisclosed participants invitees the closed door policy apparent ulterior motives which raises questions about possible corruption within and or coercion of the drp and simple lack of congruency from the drp and its office is intolerable and outrageous i hope the news gets all over this and it becomes the latest city scandal

7581507 i still think obama will support credit card reform despite all of this but even though credit card reform is a pressing agenda item for advocates and many consumers i am not sure it is going to be the top item on his list
7581508 while some might think about what legislation would be on the agenda of an obama biden administration one of the most critical roles it would have is its selection of appointees for the regulators that govern the credit card industry such as the federal reserve board and office of comptroller of currency

7581517 we see virtually no advantages but we are carrying a burden
7581518 that does not mean we should abandon our strategic goals of moving toward wto but we must be clear when dealing with our partners
7581519 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7581520 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7581521 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip

7581529 its actually only loosely very very loosely based on the book
7581530 but its about a small town that rains food basically so hamburgers come down and ice cream and the residents have to figure out a way stop it eventually it gets more and more dangerous and they have to figure out a way to stop the satellite machine thats raining food
7581531 great site great service i started submitting my press releases through mediasyndicate com over four years ago and never looked back the site has always delivered reliable and consistent results for my clients

7581539 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7581540 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature

7581542 the pavement failures and subsidence that have been occurring at the lookout are a slow and gradual process

7581544 the victim feared for his life and began to defend himself raising his arm to protect his head from being struck with that baton which resulted in his arm being broken
7581545 committing yourself to one job for a life time is a different notion for this generation
7581546 the young generation is not as attracted to the church as in previous generations
7581547 there was a need for one parish not to have a resident priest for a six month period for six months the priest will not live there new arrangements will be made once we complete our dialogues
7581548 its a situation we are now finding we have to do more and more
7581549 it shows up starkly in the country diocese in metropolitan places and melbourne it does not appear as stark the country parishes are an hour and a half away which makes it look a lot worse
7581550 we are hoping to get people who are not regular church goers but are still catholics we would like them to be involved in the conversations

7581552 appeared to be intoxicated or under the influence of other drugs
7581553 im concerned by a person facing so many charges and that she is the oldest in the group by a long mile is also of concern
7581554 they both left the area and the main idea of it is to reduce the amount of trouble in the area
7581555 if they have been causing trouble they are removed its for their own benefit and the benefit of the community to remove them
7581556 its only going to be used in the cases where we can use them and where we believe its going to prevent alcohol related violence or problems in the area
7581557 residents and ratepayers have a right to know what the investigation report has found prior to considering which candidates they wish to support at this years council elections
7581558 with only three months until municipal elections a number of candidates have declared they are standing for council and have commenced campaigning
7581559 it is unfair on incumbent councillors and new candidates for this report be held up by the brumby government
7581560 the existing councillors are at a particular disadvantage the longer labor sit on this report because they have the suspicion and unspecified allegations left hanging unanswered against their reputations
7581561 the department expects to receive the final report from pwc investigators this week at which point it will be reviewed and passed to the minister for his consideration
7581562 once the minister has received the report he will respond to it in public in the next couple of weeks

7581567 algunas personas en ocasiones llegamos a pensar que dios quiere lo que nosotros queremos porque nuestro razonamiento nos lleva a creer eso un razonamiento muy l gico es pensar que dios no puede querer para mi algo que me desagrade ya que el me ama y como me ama lo que yo quiera me lo conceder y otra forma de pensar bastante l gica es que nosotros tomamos las decisiones en nuestra vida y por lo tanto decidimos lo que mas nos gusta y a dios solo lo consultamos cuando algo falla en nuestros planes pero sabes estos pensamientos solo nos llevan al sufrimiento porque nuestros caminos no son los caminos de dios es necesario comprender que lo que dios quiere para mi en nada depende de lo que yo quiera porque mis deseos son carnales y solo buscan satisfacerme a mi misma y no a mi se or los planes de dios son perfectos siempre llevan a glorificarlo y darle la honra y honor que se merece

7581577 i think guys will see how much fun we had and be like man i want to be a part of that
7581578 but the good news is this unsolicited five or six of these guys have already said they want to be part of what we do going forward but we have plenty of time to sort through it they need some time off they really do
7581579 tens of thousands of people could be in line for a refund
7581580 it wasnt a huge amount of money but it was ours
7581581 the genesis for this was chucks real feeling that this was an unfair position
7581582 we should have had a boston tea party over this
7581583 starting the new chapter in our lives as a family
7581584 there is an agreement between the two sides that there will be no foreign soldiers in iraq after 2011
7581585 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
7581586 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
7581587 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline not an open time frame
7581588 we dont want the phrase time horizons we are not comfortable with that phrase
7581589 i cant do this its too hard its got too many political sensitivities
7581590 oh my god theyre idiots they dont know how to speak at all
7581591 you know i thought i had misremembered it because i didnt know which side hes on
7581592 well thats not really a surprise because we know that because everyones going to have seen that in the trailer
7581593 lets take that type of real espionage thriller structure but just put it in our real world just put it today when the real enemies are radical muslim terrorists
7581594 here is someone who comes from a different culture in some ways and yet can be just as american as any of us
7581595 who are the people who get recruited how do they get recruited are they all fanatics are they all sociopaths
7581596 that would never happen we dont ever get to fly in first class
7581597 how would you penetrate an al qaeda group and there are not that many ways to do it
7581598 arbys does a lot of couponing in newspaper and direct mail so it was a natural transition to do a mobile cou poning offer
7581599 we look for alternative media oppor tunities to reach different audiences and we felt that mobile was the perfect way to reach a younger audience
7581600 top 10 who are changing the world of internet and politics
7581601 the demand that were seeing has far exceeded even our wildest expectations
7581602 people want to catch up on events that they miss about half say thats the main reason the second reason about 40 percent is that they want to resee and revisit the major events they had seen on tv earlier
7581603 blacklist for alleged spam activity and are temporarily refusing to accept mail from our campus server
7581604 btw you might want to know that this one student just sent 10 million emails yesterday
7581605 if you were president what would be the first thing you would do
7581606 but you dont have to wait until youre president to do that you can come over to my house and mow pull weeds and sweep my sidewalks and ill pay you 50 then ill take you over to the grocery store where a homeless man panhandles every day you can give him the 50 to use toward a new house
7581607 why doesnt the homeless guy come over and do the work and you can just pay him the 50
7581608 metsos profitable growth strategy was launched in august 2005 our progress has been strong and we are reaching the financial targets set in october 2006 one year earlier than we estimated at the time
7581609 now it is time to accelerate the strategy execution by introducing a new operating structure and more ambitious financial targets
7581610 simultaneously with enhancing our focus on the energy and environment segment automation and power businesses will naturally continue to work in close cooperation with paper and fiber segment to develop our product and service offering towards the pulp and paper industry
7581611 by creating awareness and demand for the beneficial use of gypsum within the indiana agricultural community indiana farmers can realize true benefits
7581612 using gypsum on indiana soil not only enhances farmers productivity and the states output but it also helps protect our environment by capturing more carbon dioxide reducing soil erosion and helping with the offsite movement of pollutants such as excess nutrients and pesticides
7581613 anytime someone can create something that positively affects the environment we are proud to offer assistance
7581614 this was an extremely worthwhile venture that has resulted in tremendous results
7581615 this project is an excellent example of multiple public agencies working together to supply children with playgrounds that employ the best aspects of recycling green technology safety and accessibility we thank our partners in this endeavor and look forward to using this project as a model for further projects in missouri and around the country
7581616 i felt like i had run the same time all season
7581617 it just got me really excited about this cross country season
7581618 anybody in the state would feel lucky to have them on their team even if they werent such great runners because theyre such great kids
7581619 thats what i feel about all our kids but when you have two kids that have that mix together its special
7581620 rarely do you see them step up and take charge of practice and say were doing it this way kiahs the more vocal of the two sophia is reserved but makes her presence felt in other ways
7581621 attitude is essential you cant run a 5k if you have any negative thoughts so keeping a good attitude keeping everyone healthy and loving the sport is important
7581622 i want them to know why we do every workout and if they dont i want them to ask me and they do i tell them what were trying to accomplish whether its oxygen delivery or lactate threshold i tell what theyre going to do at practice and what they can expect to get out of it and when theyre going to get the biggest benefit from it so when it comes to race day they know they have already done what they have to do to prepare
7581623 i always let him know what im thinking and how im feeling i can understand that with a coach how that might get annoying but he always listens to me and its not just like passive listening he listens and he does something
7581624 he sets the tone for our team hes really dedicated to it we always know what were doing and whats going to help us we always know that when the race comes were probably the most prepared team
7581625 but i liked it a lot and i trained really hard before 8th grade and i kept improving and once you improve you just want to stick with it
7581626 i thought id be the worst person ever to run
7581627 i was really really slow but i liked it anyway
7581628 in cross country the slower people just get more playing time
7581629 after my first season in 8th grade i loved it
7581630 its better than any other sport would make you feel
7581631 my mom was really good and just ran a marathon
7581632 i did it instead of soccer and i just loved it
7581633 i had been swimming since i was 10 or 11 and i was competitive at a very high level
7581634 theres just no time for drama when you do this the people around you become your best friends
7581635 even when we get into our interval and repeat work they are still responsible for their times i record all of that so they can see their progression
7581636 summer is the base for september and september is the base for championships
7581637 there are workouts needed in october for speed and oxygen delivery and racing does not fit
7581638 we were thinking about ntn but after everything changed we learned not to look so far ahead and to just worry about whats coming up
7581639 this is august and states is in november if we take it one race at a time and win states thats great if not and its still our best it has to be enough
7581640 the president has to say im not willing to negotiate these things as second priorities he must keep that moral focus
7581641 comparativo das capas dos di rios a excep o do record no dia de vora
7581642 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7581643 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7581644 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7581645 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7581646 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7581647 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7581648 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7581649 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7581650 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7581651 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7581652 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7581653 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7581654 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7581655 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7581656 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7581657 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7581658 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7581659 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7581660 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7581661 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7581662 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7581663 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7581664 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7581665 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7581666 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7581667 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7581668 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7581669 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7581670 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7581671 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7581672 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7581673 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7581674 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7581675 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7581676 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7581677 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7581678 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7581679 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
7581680 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
7581681 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7581682 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7581683 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7581684 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7581685 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7581686 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7581687 now pay attention you get that painting after the show
7581688 do you think mccain is seriously and i mean this professionally flirting with the idea of accepting a second place on the ticket with john kerry and creating a fusion ticket to run against the president
7581689 i think that this is time for unity in this country and maybe it is time to have a guy like john mccain a republican on the ticket with a guy he does like they do get along and they dont have fundamental disagreements on major policies
7581690 theres just too much uncertainty out there creating all this volatility and whats adding to the volatility is were entering this holiday period the swings are exaggerated by the light volumes
7581691 you really need to see a resolution to those three issues or at least some type of clear picture to those issues
7581692 he did everything he was a carpenter a multipurpose utility player he was a very popular employee forever upbeat
7581693 he was very giving i think he was in africa last year
7581694 having the convention in denver is as incredible as olympic gold and crazier than john mccains policy platform but much more fun
7581695 the partnerships from corporate america and local businesses help you succeed in staging the event
7581696 the parties and candidates in debt to the corporate interests
7581697 we need to overcome the myth solar is not ready for primetime and it is
7581698 the bank is cautiously optimistic despite the external headwinds from the us subprime issue and rising commodity prices
7581699 we find of course that our economy is not totally de coupled from the impact on the us economy we also see that consumers are more aware of what the risks are and people are more skewed towards deposit structured and capital protected products
7581700 if we can mitigate the risks we could go back to bank negara malaysia bnm and have it reinstate the approval
7581701 rumour is that a new substantial shareholder is joining the company said a dealer
7581702 the ls460 is a fine addition to complement the ls460l that was designed with a chauffer driven intention
7581703 although new to the malaysian market having made its entry in december last year lexus has already sold 330 units with 90 of them being the ls460l model
7581704 we hope that with the addition of this variant the lexus brand will be strengthened and soar to greater heights in malaysia
7581705 the value of malaysias construction sector abroad for both completed and ongoing projects are worth us 25 2 billion rm84 92 billion but they involve only a small number of companies
7581706 malaysia recognises the pressing need for its construction sector to expand its market offshore
7581707 with the acquisition baneng will offer sts transfer operation services throughout the port of pasir gudang
7581708 we have appointed a ship surveyor and valuer to assess in the acquisition of a vlcc tanker in the next few months
7581709 a typical vlcc tanker with capacity of 300 000 tonnes would be able to carry a stock value of us 195 million rm657 15 million at any one time with an estimated yearly stock turnover of us 2 35 billion rm7 92 billion
7581710 the vision of baneng is to be the leading operator of oil storage terminals in malaysia
7581711 we want to strengthen our domestic presence and one way is to broaden our islamic deposit size and we believe there is big prospects for us as the overall liquidity is still there in the market

7581831 i say luck is when an opportunity comes along and youre prepared for it
7581832 mystery creates wonder and wonder is the basis of mans desire to understand
7581833 just as our eyes need light in order to see our minds need ideas in order to create
7581834 if we all worked on the assumption that what is accepted as true is really true there would be little hope of advance
7581835 the greater the obstacle the more glory in overcoming it
7581836 we have the oregon police lab assisting us and we are trying to determine what happened
7581837 around 10 or 11 i heard sirens and there were all kinds of people it was just kind of traumatizing for all of us you know
7581838 i wrote the book in the hopes that children will get better lives
7581839 i want to see more integration and the responsibility for that lies with the somalians themselves and with the authorities
7581840 i guess im one of the few players whos played it in both places denver and boulder its fun playing it anywhere as long as we get to put it on against them we could play it out in the parking lot and it would be fun
7581841 its a great game in colorado getting two great schools like that together
7581842 theres so much tradition behind it before i came out here from coto de casa calif i really didnt know that much about the rivalry now i can see it and its a great thing for both teams both programs and the fans
7581843 these are two great programs that historically have had some great players come through
7581844 i think its a great thing its definitely a must for the state its great to be able to strap it on against those guys every year and i think they would say the same
7581845 our stadiums too small for this big of a game and its not fair for us to play them in boulder all the time
7581846 at invesco you know its going to be loud and you know its going to be insane and thats what a rivalry game like this should be like
7581847 i grew up here so i knew about csu but every year freshmen get in camp hear coaches talking about it saying theyre our little brothers and we have to keep them in line and everything
7581848 i think cu will win this game a lot easier now that sonnys lubick gone it amazes that some csu fans think their program is better off without the guy they named the stadium for
7581849 how many of you out there will miss lubick on the sheep sidelines too bad van mullet van pelt cant come back for one more beating i almost pity the goats this year on second thought nah rocky mountain beatdown cu 45 rams 17

7581857 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging

7581860 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years

7581938 is a reflection of increased sales of foreclosed homes at very low prices rather than a pick up in the regular private sales market but they all count
7581939 the rebound in existing home sales does not indicate the beginning of a recovery in the housing market as the level of excess supply continues to rise and sales prices keep falling suggesting that the downward adjustment in prices is not over

7581957 my client spends a great deal of time and money to understand the market they are trying to reach with certain brands and specific products when we buy television advertising we target those consumers i cant wait six months to match data
7581958 my target market is loyal to particular programs so i dont need to pay a premium for addressability
7581959 at certain moments advertising no matter how cunningly crafted is incapable of sending its intended message at certain moments it is capable only of triggering associations with the larger story in the public mind thats one reason you havent seen a lot of bank commercials lately offering fast convenient refinancing its why john mccain will come nowhere near his republican colleague alaska sen ted stevens in the next three months its why barry bonds endorsement career has dried up

7582103 for colangelo it completed the trifecta giving him a world series championship a spot in the pro basketball hall of fame and a gold medal olympic team sure the game always is about the players but colangelo was the glue of the entire operation hes the one who changed the infrastructure of usa basketball demanded and received three year commitments from the nbas best players and brought it all together listen to how these players respect him all referring to him as mr colangelo as if theyre a little scared of him there was a time in sundays fourth quarter when colangelo was so scared that he couldnt bear to watch he left his seat and took a short walk but the team he built was just that a team and it saved its best for last surprisingly instead of walking off into the sunset colangelo said hell likely remain in charge of usa basketball for another olympic run

7582185 iraq will not hold any agreement or treaty on the basis of one foreign soldiers presence on the iraqi lands but through putting a specified timetable for the withdrawal of the foreign troops
7582186 big progress is currently taking place in the iraqi u s negotiations to put the final touches on the mutual agreement
7582187 among the pending points in the negotiations is the issue of offering unlimited immunities
7582188 open immunities cannot be given to any person regardless he is iraqi or a foreigner
7582189 there is also the issue on foreign forces presence movements and bases
7582190 an agreement has been made that the end of 2011 would be the last date for foreign forces presence in iraq
7582191 meanwhile those forces are not allowed to conduct military missions unless with a clearance from the iraqi government
7582192 the agreement will be transparent and will be admitted to the iraqi parliament for approval
7582193 there will be no secrete appendixes for the agreement as some insincere politicians claim
7582194 very very close to finalizing the agreement but had not yet clinched the deal
7582195 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
7582196 voters are becoming increasingly cynical and demonstrate a record level of skepticism about the governments ability to effect positive change
7582197 yeah it would take you five minutes to get up these stairs whereas i could take them three steps at a time the problem is that once i got to the top id forget where i was going

7582200 it talks about the freedom of a child when he is left alone in the house with his cousin and the funny situations that follow when two burglars try getting into the house to get hold of a chip that his father has been secretly working on
7582201 the scholars behind the project say they are trying to get more attention for orwell online and to make him more relevant to a younger generation he would have wanted to speak to

7582363 philip morris documents show the majority of the companys internal reports regarding po 210 polonium 210 were not published one manuscript believed by some philip morris scientists to be favourable to the tobacco industry was withheld from publication for fear of heightening public awareness of po 210
7582364 unlike other smoking and health issues where the industry line was to create doubt in relation to polonium 210 and the radioactivity of cigarettes the companies wanted to hide from that issue publicly they continue to minimise the recognition of radioactivity in their products in smoking and health litigation
7582365 its fairly common knowledge polonium 210 is in cigarette smoke because its present in all such plant types including strawberries
7582366 there was a 1977 study that found of the daily intake of the polonium 210 in a smoker 77 3 per cent came from food and 17 per cent from tobacco the world health organisation is trying to determine which constituents of tobacco smoke are most important in diseases including lung cancer but as yet have not concluded polonium 210 is a priority constituent

7582374 the site has been chosen and the preparation process is under way
7582375 gradually the complementary design phase and its building will begin
7582376 at the time we planned for these nuclear units there was rising power demand it was really going off the charts and we planned to meet that demand by building nuclear units
7582377 then the demand dropped there was a lot of aluminum production in the south those plants closed down demand started to decline and the cost of the nuclear plants increased dramatically
7582378 tva used to have a great name here in the valley
7582379 historically tva has been a leader in this nation has showed everyone else how it is to be done now you are on the verge of taking a bold step backward
7582380 i think had the nuclear plant been built it would have been a tremendous economic boost to hawkins county
7582381 we know that our power demand is growing at about two percent a year
7582382 were looking at every power source thats out there some renewables some coal technology we continue to look at coal but there are still some issues on emissions with coal and changing regulations on air compliance in our region we dont have as much of a resource in solar and wind as you would have in the desert southwest and midwest
7582383 i think in my lifetime nuclear power may be the biggest power used for automobiles

7582401 russias view of china as a serious geopolitical ally in challenging the west
7582402 we applaud the courage of the secretary general and his expression of moral authority we expect the secretary general to also stand for the rights of the people of burma who were unable to express their real aspirations in the referendum

7582414 we were very disappointed because weve had a long history with sen mccain and i know that if he personally had gotten the message he might have met with us but we couldnt get to him
7582415 sen obamas going to have to meet with tribes on a daily basis to catch up with the 25 years sen mccain has spent on their issues
7582416 i dont think theres anything that even looks like a horse race in terms of intimacy of association and familiarity with the issues
7582417 sen mccain knows us intimately so he knows our strengths as well as our weaknesses so that could play good and bad for us
7582418 im sure plenty of people who see all the places ive been and things ive done probably wonder when ill slow down but i feel as if the adventure is just beginning
7582419 i can go anywhere i dream of going and thanks to generations of children and their imaginations i have been able to live my dreams in a fun playful and fearless way im ready to go wherever the worlds creative builders decide to take me next

7582426 con este episodio de las olimpiadas y la pasi n que se desbord en venezuela y aqu en mi coraz n yo personalmente voy a estar mucho m s pendiente del deporte apoyando lo que haga falta
7582427 algunos diarios se dedicaron a escribir editoriales diciendo que por ejemplo las muchachas de softbol no estaban preparadas que las echamos a los leones que se las devoraron en china ellos son los que no tienen patria pero ustedes atletas son la patria buena la patria grande
7582428 aquellos que no conocen del deporte no tienen por qu criticarnos primero tienen que sentarse a conocer el deporte por dentro y despu s pueden opinar
7582429 no importa que critiquen los que quieran pero este pueblo los ama a ustedes nuestros gloriosos deportivas
7582430 una primera decisi n que hemos tomado para profundizar la revoluci n deportiva es la creaci n de una oficina para el deporte de alto rendimiento donde los deportistas puedan ir y hacer sus planteamientos y para hacer asambleas para o r sus opiniones
7582431 analizar la situaci n del deporte porque son los atletas los que la conocen realmente
7582432 estamos agradecidos por todo el apoyo que nos han dado y queremos solicitarle que se haga una gesti n constante con la selecci n nacional para que el pueblo venezolano conozca a sus atletas de alto rendimiento que somos los que metemos el pecho y entregamos todo por nuestro pa s
7582433 para que el deporte nacional pueda surgir como lo queremos se debe contar con una dirigencia que de verdad conozca el deporte por lo que la resposabilidad de dirigir el deporte debe estar en manos de deportistas y exdeportistas
7582434 queremos aclarar al pueblo venezolano que algunos hicieron falsas expectativas sobre nuestra participaci n en beijing y nosotros fuimos a pelear por estar en lo m s alto de podio estar entre las medallas sin embargo no se lograron los objetivos pero eso es parte del deporte

7582443 the least of things with a meaning is worth more in life than the greatest of things without it
7582444 meanings are not determined by situations but we determine ourselves by the meanings we give to situations
7582445 the essence of intelligence is skill in extracting meaning from everyday experience
7582446 meaning is not what you start with but what you end up with
7582447 our obligation is to give meaning to life and in doing so to overcome the passive indifferent life
7582448 what we see depends mainly on what we look for
7582449 what we see depends upon what is meaningful to us
7582450 if you hate a person you hate something in him that is a part of yourself what isnt part of ourselves doesnt disturb us
7582451 love is just a word until someone comes along and gives it meaning
7582452 if i could tell you what it meant there would be no point in dancing it
7582453 i miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because i know not the parts that others play
7582454 ultimately man should not ask what the meaning of his life is but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked

7582486 it is with great concern that we witness the deteriorating humanitarian situation in various parts of mindanao as a result of the recent upsurge in conflict
7582487 many civilians have lost their lives and many more are at risk
7582488 the agencies of the iasc who come together to coordinate relief efforts on behalf of the international community in times of crisis appeal for calm and protection of all civilians
7582489 they civilians are safe to go home now but we understand the trauma they are now suffering
7582490 our troops and police are trying their level best more than what is expected of them to end this as soon as possible but it would be dishonest of me to say it will be over soon

7582511 this is pioneering stuff for canterbury to have an integrated urban development and transport infrastructure
7582512 over the next 10 years what you are not going to see are greenfield developments with no connection to transportation and other community serviced infrastructures that then have to be supplied after at considerable expense to the community
7582513 these variations are the last part of our council process in terms of debate now it goes off for analysis submissions and then it will be heard by the hearing panel and no doubt reviewed by the environment court after that
7582514 the hearing will be in march april next year and after that it will be up to a party or parties if they think that the panel has it wrong to have that decision reviewed in the environment court

7582517 our group simply wants a fair deal and a balanced approach to land use it is clearly in everyones interest to have the airport operating to capacity 24 7
7582518 there will be no impact on the airport if the 55dba new zealand standard is adopted

7582526 we will not tolerate and will crush any attempt to disturb peace and development in mindanao
7582527 in the current unpredictable security situation vulnerable victims of these clashes urgently need to receive humanitarian assistance especially essential food among other complimentary relief items
7582528 wfp plans to continue to conduct more in depth assessments in affected provinces together with relevant partners to better quantify the overall magnitude of the needs faced by the affected population and recommend additional support as necessary
7582529 we hope for peace and stability so that affected families in mindanao can soon return to their homes and begin rebuilding their lives
7582530 if we want to protect coral reefs and rehabilitate fisheries it is not by planting new corals it is by educating people and changing their mindsets

7582532 the next task is to support the regional disaster coordinating council and the social welfare agencies in assisting the handling of internally displaced persons idps both in the evacuation centres and those with host families
7582533 to deliver the relief goods that are coming in as well as give proper medical attention to those in need
7582534 the relief and rehabilitation process might take longer than the security operations
7582535 it is putting a strain on them to remain in this type of situation but at the same time people fear for their lives

7582542 its frightening and sooner or later the bullets will hit those trying to escape

7582545 yea doubtless and i count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that i may win christ
7582546 never actually seen one of those before in real life thats pretty neat
7582547 we go back and forth i dont know if its our immediate future its something we talk about every few months
7582548 if they would be as pretty as brad and angelinas kids we might
7582549 its something we would never take lightly and just say that would be fun its a lot of work and we recognise that
7582550 danny wants the opportunity to play in the masters and opens next year so it could be about this time next year when he turns professional
7582551 some people think it would still be too young to turn professional and maybe it is but then we havent seen anyone like him before so we have nothing to base a judgment on
7582552 his performance in the pga tournament was beyond expectations but certainly the goal was always to win this event it was the way in which he won that was surprising for the most part he smashed it
7582553 danny doesnt particularly like his golf swing there is still work to do which is the scary thing but a good thing as well hes not at his full potential yet
7582554 hes an incredible ball striker but one thing he will have to start looking at is physically can he continue to swing the club like he does
7582555 there might need to be some improvements to reduce the risk of injury
7582556 i had him out there a few times and it has developed from there
7582557 try to compare a stale looking computer to something that has a flowing glow of light just beaming from the case ultraviolet liquid pumping through tubes theres the excitement of seeing all the circuit boards lit up and viewable
7582558 sick of looking at those stale old beige or dull coloured towers
7582559 i think people enjoy seeing if it the mod can be done
7582560 and when it is done it reminds them of their favourite old consoles from back in the day and has a nostalgia factor
7582561 several years ago i wanted to get into a new hobby since the old one independent filmmaking was tiring me i decided to see what i could hack up using an old atari 2600 gaming system i managed to make a portable version of it and did a web page describing the process requests came pouring in and ive been doing mods ever since
7582562 most people want their technology to look like technology but there are always those who are drawn to a more nostalgic sense of style
7582563 people want to have things worth keeping there isnt much manufactured today that will stand the test of time
7582564 theres the problem of last weeks technology looking embarrassingly out of date and the pointless expense of upgrading things that dont need upgrading
7582565 on the other hand make a keyboard look a century out of date at the get go and in 10 years that steampunk keyboard is just going to look better for some authentic wear
7582566 i was fascinated by the retro futuristic computers and other technology in the movie brazil by terry gilliam and when i bought myself a new computer i decided to convert my old one into a brazilian machine
7582567 who got some sort of perverse pleasure in watching or encouraging the fight to continue
7582568 the perpetrator of this incident was treated the same way as the two who threw the punches they were stood down if i had my way id do the same with the mob having a bit of cheap fun at their expense
7582569 inflames things more than a face to face confrontation and gets things a wee bit out of kilter
7582570 a message to the boys about how to deal with conflict
7582571 i spoke of the importance of finding better ways to deal with the inevitable conflict everyone faces and used the example of tony veitch to illustrate how a violent response to resolving disagreements is not the way to go
7582572 the reason why i used him was he was a person who was a male and was sports mad like a lot of boys here
7582573 i was trying to draw some sort of similarity there between those elements and those characteristics that many of our boys have and said this is topical and this is what could happen if you cant control your anger
7582574 thats a bit of a leap from a group of boys having a fight to tony veitch i think theyre two totally different situations
7582575 realized that the russians were exploiting the ambiguous margins of the text and that there was a risk of a loss of credibility for the eu and the french presidency
7582576 sarkozy proved that he could act very fast and could also negotiate a deal
7582577 the criticisms which were heard among the europeans were that it was too vague and that he sarkozy was being sidelined by the russians sarkozy now needs a consensus in order to continue to play his primary role
7582578 im quite sad about it really weve had some good times
7582579 a whole range of people saw the need of the day
7582580 there were all sorts of avenues that were set up out of the whole thing and it was because these people cared for the community they could see what people children especially were missing out on
7582581 weve got a lot of loyal regular customers the biggest part are our friends now
7582582 were interested in what were selling and weve got a little bit of knowledge
7582583 knittings come back in a big way and people are starting to realise you get exactly what you pay for people like pure wools and a lot like new zealand wools
7582584 they know what theyre talking about and have a wonderful selection ill probably go to auckland now
7582585 the initial verbal report that they have given is that there has been no leak of oil or chemicals detected from the sunken ferry
7582586 its a necessity that further monitoring for any leaks must continue
7582587 so long as the chemical does not leak there is no immediate danger other than the impact it has already had on the reef
7582588 be on guard stand firm in the faith be courageous be strong and do everything with love
7582589 be on guard stand firm be courageous be strong are all things you would say to a warrior heading into battle
7582590 i command you be strong and courageous do not be afraid or discouraged for the lord your god is with you wherever you go
7582591 but if you are willing to listen i say love your enemies do good to those who hate you
7582592 thats for the court and for the judge to say its clear that the documents will be used by the prosecution i personally as well as the czech embassy was aware quite a while back that these blank documents existed both men informed me about them when i visited them in jail in darjeeling some two months ago the court has all the evidence how to judge impartially how to treat these documents and we believe that justice will be done in this case
7582593 they first spent one month in jail which was a very hard experience especially in view of their age but also their standing in the scientific community the jail was relatively small they were there with 29 other prisoners and the facilities were what one might expect after one month they were released on bail and when the indian authorities came to understand that neither would try to escape india just the opposite they were happy their case would finally go to court the authorities even lessened earlier requirements such as reporting to the local police right now we are in continued contact with them here from the czech embassy and we give them all possible consular support and they are in relatively positive mood for the first time they are in a situation where they can present their side of the story before an impartial court
7582594 definitely a case like that is very unfortunate for the czech republic and india it doesnt help our traditionally very good and very friendly relations basically what happened is that the two scientists were doing research without the proper permit so most of the time i make the parallel they were like professional drivers caught on the road without their license although they have valid licenses at home so they definitely deserve punishment for one thing they did not having a permit but all the other allegations are pure nonsense
7582595 though we can provide indian flood victims with food and accommodation for few days yet we encourage them to return to india
7582596 our conference this past weekend with barbie breathitt was exciting and informative her teaching and impartation not only increased our awe of god and his majesty but gave us great insight into his desire to communicate with us through dreams and visions
7582597 the ministry of barbara breathitt has greatly impacted our church both times she has been with us she has brought hands on inspiring and revelatory teaching which has significantly enhanced the ministry of our people what i especially like about her is that she is true to life a real human being who loves god and loves people barbara you are always welcome back to the land of the vikings
7582598 there are some anointed ministries that are must have ministries
7582599 we recently had barbie breathitt help us dedicate our creative sound caf to the lord and everyone came away encouraged and challenged to use the creative gifts they had been given in a greater way when she spoke the following sunday morning we witnessed healings physically spiritually and emotionally god is using breath of the spirit ministries to equip the body for works of service in knowing gods voice using the spiritual gifts he has given and practicing a life of increasing faith we are excited to bring barbie and steve back to fish gate community church soon
7582600 we have been blessed to work with breath of the spirit ministries on numerous occasions i have had the opportunity to observe barbie minister both in our church in various other locations around the world she is a gifted teacher who operates in a strong prophetic anointing i have also had opportunity to travel overseas with barbie and have seen her adapt to unique cultural situations in a way that could only come with the wisdom and direction of the holy spirit we have been blessed by barbies ministry and by her friendship her teaching is solid and her gifting is spirit led i am happy to recommend her ministry
7582601 barbie ministered at trinity fellowship in tyler over a weekend and we found her to be informative and refreshing the response from those who attended was positive and motivational barbie interacts very well with people and understands the local church dynamics i find her to be a good resource of what the holy spirit is emphasizing today
7582602 we have come to know barbie very well through her ministry at our church saginaw valley community church in saginaw michigan
7582603 and the lord would say unto you that i have formed you and i have given you favor for a season and i am beginning to cause you to see the mission of why i have positioned you in the earth at this time i say you are going to be breathing from a seeing stand point for i say i am opening your eyes to see into a realm where i am and where i am bringing in revelation of the night i say from that revelation of the night you will breath out an expression of who i am and night will become light saith the lord and you will cause people where they could not see they will begin to see and not only will they see they will begin to live and from their life they will begin to express me saith the lord
7582604 i deeply appreciate the spiritual gifts that the lord has given to barbie you need to get to know her and her ministry
7582605 barbie breathitt is not only very gifted to help people interpret revelation but she holds the greatest quality of servanthood

7582644 for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world then said they unto him lord evermore give us this bread and jesus said i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst
7582645 he that cometh to me shall never hunger he that believeth on me shall never thirst
7582646 verily verily i say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed
7582647 he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him
7582648 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not
7582649 and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not
7582650 then said jesus i go my way and ye shall seek me and die in your sins whither i go ye cannot come
7582651 for i know whence i came and whither i go
7582652 i am the door of the sheep by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture
7582653 and he said therefore said i unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him
7582654 then said jesus unto the twelve will ye also go away and simon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life
7582655 god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth
7582656 when the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come
7582657 i can of mine own self do nothing as i hear so i judge and my judgment is just because i seek not mine own will but the will of the father which hath sent me

7582770 it would be better to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around the neck than to face the punishment in store for harming one of these little ones
7582771 set aside that obama said shed be on anybodys short list set aside anybodys feelings on whether she was deliberately snubbed and the pros and cons of whether it should be her focus on the politics of it and you have about a quarter of clinton loyalists still not joining the caravan for gods sake not to even make a show of taking her seriously is flatly stupid
7582772 they thought her supporters were mad before they are really mad now we knew it was never going to happen but you would have thought they might at least make a show of it
7582773 i think there are a lot of hillary voters who are going to say hey wait a minute man you said you were going to put her on the short list you know you didnt even vet her you didnt call her you didnt seek her advice by the way he didnt seek president clintons advice either hes actually the guy who i think picked the best vice president in american history you would think maybe you would sort of check in with him
7582774 ad geared toward those supporters it is not clear if another two months will heal the wounds that clinton supporters still feel

7582791 this is not about bricks and mortar rather it is about the highest standards of treatment and care
7582792 people before profit took up the campaign to save st lukes because nobody else would take it on
7582793 and the reason that many campaigns fail is that they are organised too late in the day but we are still at a point where the date for the projected move is far enough away that we have a real possibility of changing it
7582794 st lukes has existed and functioned without surgery services to date and its a bit of a red herring because cancer treatment is long term and lukes is very close to existing surgery centres such as vincents
7582795 st lukes hospital is in an absolutely beautiful place and if i were a cancer patient in dublin and offered a choice id go there because environment does matter
7582796 patients are not happy at all at the idea of lukes moving not at all but we cant deliver multidisciplinary care surgery here and and thats the achilles heel of lukes this is an enormous site and at one point we could have explored the possibility of developing facilities on site however the decision has been made to move and we now have to go with that decision
7582797 we all know that infighting between the hse and doctors in ireland is ferocious but meantime why are we continuing to invest money in a site that is going to be closed if were going to move dont faff around and waste money theyve got the plan but like a lot of things in the department of health its sitting on a shelf
7582798 once the hollywood report recommended that lukes be on the site of a general hospital and once the government accepted that the campaign was unfortunately doomed
7582799 something that has become very popular is people putting buckets out at their 40th or 50th birthdays and asking people to donate to st lukes rather than bringing presents they nearly always have personal contact with the hospital through family or friends
7582800 without a doubt wherever i go people ask me whats happening to lukes our attitude has been from the beginning that its business as usual we are still continuing to fundraise we have a lot of patients to be seen over the next seven years when we are due to move and theres no way well drop our standards here in the meantime
7582801 the friends of st lukes would prefer naturally if the hospital wasnt moved
7582802 the july 2005 government announcement very clearly states that the long term use of the st lukes campus in rathgar is yet to be decided and that st lukes will be directly involved in the identification of a use that is in the best interests of the health services in the long term
7582803 regarding staff the board and executive management support the decision of the minister announced in july 2005 as is normal practice in all institutions the views of st lukes hospital will be articulated only through the chair of the board or chief executive or others acting on their behalf
7582804 members of staff are fully entitled to hold and articulate a different view in their private individual capacity and we do not have any issue with this provided these views are not presented in such a way as to be confused with those of the hospital corporate body
7582805 theres been a movement to make vehicles quieter but we can be victims of our own virtue
7582806 that could be the case with automobiles if they get too quiet
7582807 asking tens of thousands of hybrid owners to add noisemakers is burdensome
7582808 then the church throughout judea galilee and samaria enjoyed a time of peace it was strengthened and encouraged by the holy spirit it grew in numbers living in the fear of the lord
7582809 we read that the church had peace were being edified were walking in the fear of the lord and they were multiplied
7582810 they were engaging their culture so much that they turned their world upside down
7582811 lost something in the modern era we are not walking in the fear of the lord
7582812 why is the church living in a no fear culture why is it you can sit in a church for months years a decade and never hear of the fear of the lord
7582813 could it be that we have lost a sense of the holiness of god
7582814 the fear of the lord is all throughout the gospels
7582815 how could we have missed this how when its found all throughout the old testament and the writings of the apostles how is it we have forgotten it
7582816 we had a pastor who taught us about the fear of god
7582817 he taught us that the fear of the lord was not that his hand of retribution would be put on us but the fear that god would take his hand off of us
7582818 the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom
7582819 how do you let it become a controlling factor in your life
7582820 after all the lord jesus christ has done for you calling you out of darkness and into marvelous light the fear of the lord means to fear doing things that would displease or dishonor the lord
7582821 may it one day be said that the churches of this land would be encouraged by the holy spirit growing in numbers and living in the fear of the lord
7582822 some people think football is a matter of life and death i assure you its much more serious than that

7582828 the beginning of power sharing not by consensus but by issue of the electoral weight
7582829 it gives them a significant amount of power to build the legislative assembly into a strong force for accountability one which is really going to force the executive mugabe to find a way to work with a parliament which may be led by hostile forces

7582872 those were good years um i dont know as long as you take advantage of it in positive ways and not negative it can open a lot of doors for you and you can help a lot of people its hard to answer a question like that when youve grown up with it your whole life i really dont know any other way i remember as a kid i was really shy and when id go to events with my mom and my dad id sneak in through the kitchen door of say the beverly wilshire hotel at one of those black tie events instead of walking down the aisle

7582898 i had proposed to hbo a series about the city cops in rome at the time of nero what had interested me was the idea of order without law emphasis added the praetorian guard who were the emperors guards understood how they were to proceed but for the city cops who were called the urban cohorts there was no law at all so they were sort of making themselves up as they went along i wanted to focus on that idea of how order is generated in the absence of law they hbo were already doing a show about rome in the time of caesar so they asked if i could engage the same themes in a different setting and that was how i decided to do the western
7582899 i think youve been getting fresh with the ladies at church

7582905 last night i was called an uncle tom by emil jones in the lobby of the hotel right in front of ald freddrenna lyle and ald leslie hairston and ald latasha thomas
7582906 i walked over to him and asked him what did you just call me
7582907 if people are still making digs at the hillary clinton people because we supported her that is not going to bring us on board it makes us feel as though were outsiders and were democrats
7582908 the litmus test for being black is seen as supporting barack
7582909 you can tell the hillary clinton people they never take the buttons
7582910 i told her i never said that she may have misunderstood
7582911 that was not that was not thats all i have to say
7582912 i said then 35 000 people drank the kool aid he said barack is a clean cut guy he never liked gutter politics thats why the clintons did so and so i said i dont want to get into this so i went over to the elevator and he said uncle tom then he grabbed me and hugged me and started laughing i said what did you say i turned to freddrenna lyle and i said what did he say she wouldnt say anything thats when i said some bad things to him
7582913 calling me an uncle tom is beyond the pale especially considering where he is close with mayor daley and with gov blagojevich i am hardly the uncle tom here
7582914 when they have a camera put in their faces they will have an opportunity to put their arm around our guy so that he can run the bases
7582915 hillary clinton will have a pee wee reese moment bill clinton will have a pee wee reese moment pennsylvania gov ed rendell will have a pee wee reese moment
7582916 got to show hes able to hit hes got to show hes capable of running the bases thats whether the rubber meets the road
7582917 aggh its real monsters oh wait nope just sandy hello
7582918 i have a lot of opinions on journalism newspapers and whatnot but it would fill up your entire inbox long story short i think youd be very wise to move on explore what else you want to do with your life the possibilities are endless when you really start thinking about what you can do quitting is exactly what i did when i realized it wasnt for me it took me a long time to realize that writing and journalism is definitely not the same thing in fact if you love writing you may find you hate journalism it was while blogging as a bellman that i rediscovered my love for writing but i still didnt realize the distinction between writing and traditional journalism until i took a job at the state journal i realized almost immediately it was a mistake i am not sad to see newspapers die they were a good idea in their time but they just dont make sense anymore shit the printing press was invented centuries ago its long past time for new technologies faster more efficient technologies to take their place long story short life is short you gotta love what you do and if you dont you gotta move on
7582919 ladies and gentleman the coverage of barack obama was embarrassing
7582920 now that they have decided to get out of the sport it gives us the ability to really be aggressive with the companies weve been talking to and with new companies that will see that juan is available for half the season to really zero in on that
7582921 i feel real confident well have something put together pretty quick
7582922 we run six cars as a company and for 2009 right now five and a half of those six cars are locked in with sponsorship
7582923 there are a few teams that would trade positions with us when youre looking at that especially with half of our car that we need to fill is our top driver personality wise recognition wise performance wise on the nascar side
7582924 carl had an opportunity and bob had an opportunity to work on the car tonight
7582925 i think that nascar achieved what they were looking for in terms of having very equal cars i think this is our fourth time coming back here the shocks are pretty well understood and everybody has done the right kind of job for here and the cars are even
7582926 until it came time for carl to reach out and take a chance on using his car up or whoever was in contention it was going to be a follow the leader kind of a deal because theres an advantage to being in front and when youre behind you just dont quite have the option you do when youre in front
7582927 and so it came down to carl having a little bit better car on the short run and it looked like before the last stop that kyle had a little bit better car on the long run or at least medium run to longer run but it came down to carl wanting it bad enough and it was there for him and he took it
7582928 i thought we had the fastest car for the first 15 laps of every run but after that the 18 of busch was definitely a lot better than us and it would be hit or miss on how close we were whether the 12 of ryan newman at some point was a little bit better than us on the long runs and so on and so forth
7582929 you know the situation arises and the team took advantage of the situation it had in front of it and capitalized it was a good night
7582930 bristol run raises team confidence shows strength of edwards group
7582931 my wife is pregnant and i dont let my wife drink the water
7582932 there is the potential for an increased risk for those people who are prone to estrogenic cancer
7582933 the timing makes the poison as much as the dose
7582934 and the dose itself is not the dose from just any one thing its from this whole kaleidoscope of chemicals
7582935 they miss some of the big issues our research shows mixtures are so prevalent
7582936 if there are any cumulative or additive issues you cant just dismiss things so quickly
7582937 are going to be concerned about being medicated by mandate when you turn on the tap
7582938 and thats going to be seen if the level is only one molecule in 100 taps
7582939 we recognize it is a growing concern and were taking it very seriously
7582940 new york citys drinking water continues to meet all federal and state regulations regarding drinking water quality in the watershed and the distribution system
7582941 septic systems are essentially small treatment plants that are essentially unmanaged and therefore tend to fail
7582942 people think that if they take a medication their body absorbs it and it disappears but of course thats not the case
7582943 based on what we now know i would say we find theres little or no risk from pharmaceuticals in the environment to human health
7582944 theres no doubt about it pharmaceuticals are being detected in the environment and there is genuine concern that these compounds in the small concentrations that theyre at could be causing impacts to human health or to aquatic organisms
7582945 it brings a question to peoples minds that if the fish were affected might there be a potential problem for humans
7582946 it could be that the fish are just exquisitely sensitive because of their physiology or something we havent gotten far enough along
7582947 i think its a shame that so much money is going into monitoring to figure out if these things are out there and so little is being spent on human health
7582948 they need to just accept that these things are everywhere every chemical and pharmaceutical could be there its time for the epa to step up to the plate and make a statement about the need to study effects both human and environmental
7582949 we realize that we have a limited amount of data on the concentrations
7582950 were going to be able to learn a lot more
7582951 these are chemicals that are designed to have very specific effects at very low concentrations thats what pharmaceuticals do so when they get out to the environment it should not be a shock to people that they have effects

7582992 obama claims hes looking after our families in an economic downturn

7583007 banyak bedanya contohnya kalau koran terbit harian di tv itu kan tiap detik dan menit tv itu lebih kompleks daripada koran
7583008 secara dana pasti lebih besar tv dan secara operasional lebih kompleks tv
7583009 di televisi itu tetap terpakai reporter tv harus bisa menulis itu juga sangat dibutuhkan
7583010 berbeda konsepnya sebab antv kan general entertainment di situ pak anin dengan star tv sedangkan di sini tvone red lebih fokus pada news dan sportstainment

7583029 it was a pleasure to sit down with senator mccain and discuss firsthand an issue that is americas top priority ending our dependence on foreign oil which today is approaching 70 percent during the meeting i reiterated the urgency of the situation i told him that any credible domestic energy policy must reduce our foreign dependence on foreign oil by at least 30 in the next 10 years on top of conservation that is beginning to happen must utilize proven and available technologies and be 100 percent comprised of american resources while i can not speak for the senator my sense is that he was interested and encouraged by the work we are doing and recognizes that citizen education and citizen involvement is key to changing course and actually developing a real energy policy with teeth that will help this country from our current disastrous path

7583096 they have computers and they may have other weapons of mass destruction
7583097 thats whats cool about working with computers they dont argue they remember everything and they dont drink all your beer
7583098 if the automobile had followed the same development cycle as the computer a rolls royce would today cost 100 get a million miles per gallon and explode once a year killing everyone inside
7583099 ive noticed lately that the paranoid fear of computers becoming intelligent and taking over the world has almost entirely disappeared from the common culture near as i can tell this coincides with the release of ms dos
7583100 the question of whether computers can think is like the question of whether submarines can swim
7583101 its ridiculous to live 100 years and only be able to remember 30 million bytes you know less than a compact disc the human condition is really becoming more obsolete every minute

7583111 come to think of it there are already a million monkeys on a million typewriters and usenet is
7583112 the most amazing achievement of the computer software industry is its continuing cancellation of the steady and staggering gains made by the computer hardware industry
7583113 true innovation often comes from the small startup who is lean enough to launch a market but lacks the heft to own it
7583114 it has been said that the great scientific disciplines are examples of giants standing on the shoulders of other giants it has also been said that the software industry is an example of midgets standing on the toes of other midgets
7583115 it is not about bits bytes and protocols but profits losses and margins
7583116 we are microsoft resistance is futile you will be assimilated
7583117 no matter how slick the demo is in rehearsal when you do it in front of a live audience the probability of a flawless presentation is inversely proportional to the number of people watching raised to the power of the amount of money involved
7583118 the bulk of all patents are crap spending time reading them is stupid its up to the patent owner to do so and to enforce them
7583119 complexity kills it sucks the life out of developers it makes products difficult to plan build and test it introduces security challenges and it causes end user and administrator frustration
7583120 there are two ways of constructing a software design one way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies
7583121 the function of good software is to make the complex appear to be simple
7583122 just remember youre not a dummy no matter what those computer books claim the real dummies are the people who though technically design hardware and software thats usable by normal consumers if their lives depended upon it
7583123 software suppliers are trying to make their software packages more user friendly their best approach so far has been to take all the old brochures and stamp the words user friendly on the cover
7583124 theres an old story about the person who wished his computer were as easy to use as his telephone that wish has come true since i no longer know how to use my telephone
7583125 there are only two industries that refer to their customers as users
7583126 programmers are in a race with the universe to create bigger and better idiot proof programs while the universe is trying to create bigger and better idiots so far the universe is winning
7583127 most of you are familiar with the virtues of a programmer there are three of course laziness impatience and hubris
7583128 the trouble with programmers is that you can never tell what a programmer is doing until its too late
7583129 thats the thing about people who think they hate computers what they really hate is lousy programmers
7583130 for a long time it puzzled me how something so expensive so leading edge could be so useless and then it occurred to me that a computer is a stupid machine with the ability to do incredibly smart things while computer programmers are smart people with the ability to do incredibly stupid things they are in short a perfect match
7583131 computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter
7583132 a programmer is a person who passes as an exacting expert on the basis of being able to turn out after innumerable punching an infinite series of incomprehensive answers calculated with micrometric precisions from vague assumptions based on debatable figures taken from inconclusive documents and carried out on instruments of problematical accuracy by persons of dubious reliability and questionable mentality for the avowed purpose of annoying and confounding a hopelessly defenseless department that was unfortunate enough to ask for the information in the first place
7583133 a hacker on a roll may be able to produce in a period of a few months something that a small development group say 7 8 people would have a hard time getting together over a year ibm used to report that certain programmers might be as much as 100 times as productive as other workers or more
7583134 the best programmers are not marginally better than merely good ones they are an order of magnitude better measured by whatever standard conceptual creativity speed ingenuity of design or problem solving ability
7583135 a great lathe operator commands several times the wage of an average lathe operator but a great writer of software code is worth 10 000 times the price of an average software writer
7583136 dont worry if it doesnt work right if everything did youd be out of a job
7583137 measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight
7583138 writing code has a place in the human hierarchy worth somewhere above grave robbing and beneath managing
7583139 first learn computer science and all the theory next develop a programming style then forget all that and just hack
7583140 optimism is an occupational hazard of programming feedback is the treatment
7583141 the best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong you are only off by a bit
7583142 should array indices start at 0 or 1 my compromise of 0 5 was rejected without i thought proper consideration
7583143 there are only two kinds of programming languages those people always bitch about and those nobody uses
7583144 php is a minor evil perpetrated and created by incompetent amateurs whereas perl is a great and insidious evil perpetrated by skilled but perverted professionals
7583145 the use of cobol cripples the mind its teaching should therefore be regarded as a criminal offense
7583146 it is practically impossible to teach good programming style to students that have had prior exposure to basic as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration
7583147 i think microsoft named net so it wouldnt show up in a unix directory listing
7583148 there is no programming language no matter how structured that will prevent programmers from making bad programs
7583149 computer language design is just like a stroll in the park jurassic park that is
7583150 fifty years of programming language research and we end up with c
7583151 writing in c or c is like running a chain saw with all the safety guards removed
7583152 in c its harder to shoot yourself in the foot but when you do you blow off your whole leg
7583153 one of the main causes of the fall of the roman empire was that lacking zero they had no way to indicate successful termination of their c programs
7583154 saying that java is nice because it works on all oses is like saying that anal sex is nice because it works on all genders
7583155 fine java might be a good example of what a programming language should be like but java applications are good examples of what applications shouldnt be like
7583156 if java had true garbage collection most programs would delete themselves upon execution
7583157 the only people who have anything to fear from free software are those whose products are worth even less
7583158 any code of your own that you havent looked at for six or more months might as well have been written by someone else
7583159 the first 90 of the code accounts for the first 90 of the development time the remaining 10 of the code accounts for the other 90 of the development time
7583160 good programmers use their brains but good guidelines save us having to think out every case
7583161 in software we rarely have meaningful requirements even if we do the only measure of success that matters is whether our solution solves the customers shifting idea of what their problem is
7583162 considering the current sad state of our computer programs software development is clearly still a black art and cannot yet be called an engineering discipline
7583163 you cant have great software without a great team and most software teams behave like dysfunctional families
7583164 as soon as we started programming we found to our surprise that it wasnt as easy to get programs right as we had thought debugging had to be discovered i can remember the exact instant when i realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs
7583165 debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place therefore if you write the code as cleverly as possible you are by definition not smart enough to debug it
7583166 if debugging is the process of removing bugs then programming must be the process of putting them in
7583167 i dont care if it works on your machine we are not shipping your machine
7583168 programming is like sex one mistake and youre providing support for a lifetime
7583169 there are two ways to write error free programs only the third one works
7583170 you can either have software quality or you can have pointer arithmetic but you cannot have both at the same time
7583171 if mcdonalds were run like a software company one out of every hundred big macs would give you food poisoning and the response would be were sorry heres a coupon for two more
7583172 always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live
7583173 to err is human but to really foul things up you need a computer
7583174 a computer lets you make more mistakes faster than any invention in human history with the possible exceptions of handguns and tequila

7583256 move against johnstons army to break it up and to get into the interior of the enemys country as far as you can inflicting all the damage you can against their war resources i do not propose to lay down for you a plan of campaign but simply lay down the work it is desirable to have done and leave you free to execute it in your own way submit to me however as early as you can your plan of operations
7583257 i want to grab hold of the enemies shoulder and from there peel him off of that ridge like an orange
7583258 to preserve the initiative subordinates must act independently within the context of an overall plan they must exploit successes boldly and take advantage of unforeseen opportunities they must deviate from the expected courses of action without hesitation when opportunities arise to expedite the overall mission of the higher force they will take risks and the command must support them
7583259 subordinate leaders will be expected to act on their own initiative within the framework of the commanders intent
7583260 speed depends on the violent execution of the plan by fire and maneuver units but it also depends on full understanding of the understanding of the commanders intent
7583261 commanders express their vision as the commanders intent the staff and subordinates measure the plans and orders that transform thought to action against it the commanders intent is a clear concise statement of what the force must do and the conditions the force must meet to succeed with respect to the enemy terrain and the desired end state commanders make their own independent and sometimes intuitive assessment of how they intend to win the final expression of intent comes from commanders personally
7583262 intent coupled with mission directs subordinates toward mission accomplishment in the absence of orders when significant opportunities appear subordinates use the commanders intent to orient their efforts intent includes the conditions that forces meet to achieve the end state conditions apply to all courses of action they include the tempo duration effect on the enemy effect on another friendly force operation and key terrain
7583263 commanders intent the commanders intent is a clear concise statement of what the force must do and the conditions the force must establish with respect to the enemy terrain and civil considerations that represent the desired end state the commanders intent succinctly describes what constitutes success in an operation it includes the operations purpose and the conditions that define the end state it links the mission concept of operations and tasks to subordinate units a clear commanders intent facilitates a shared understanding and focus on the overall conditions that represent mission accomplishment during execution the commanders intent spurs individual initiative
7583264 the commanders intent must be easy to remember and clearly understood two echelons down the shorter the commanders intent the better it serves these purposes typically the commanders intent statement is three to five sentences long
7583265 commanders develop their intent statement personally commanders intent coupled with mission directs subordinates toward mission accomplishment especially when current orders no longer fit the situation and subordinates must decide how to deviate from them subordinates use the commanders intent to orient their efforts and help them make decisions when facing unforeseen opportunities or threats

7583501 the recovery shows that a massive explosion was on the cards
7583502 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbour occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
7583503 nato is trying to make a victim of an aggressor and whitewash a criminal regime save a collapsing regime and is taking a path to the rearmament of the current leaders in georgia
7583504 i am proud to be associated with you i think you did better than anyone could have because of your standing your reputation and your integrity
7583505 i want to see the president of the united states succeed in iraq his success is americas success and his failure is americas failure
7583506 this disconnect i believe is fueling cynicism that is undermining the single most important weapon we need to give our troops to be able to do their job and that is the unyielding support of the american people that support is waning

7583509 biden has carved out a niche as the democratic presidential candidate most willing to publicly rebuke antiwar sentiment
7583510 that there is any possibility in the lifetime of anyone here of having the iraqis get together have a unity government in baghdad that pulls the country together that will not happen it will not happen in the lifetime of anyone here
7583511 acceptable perhaps even satisfying conclusion to the great veep search
7583512 when biden went after john mccain with a vigor and yes a venom that has been missing from obamas stump speaking it was a tonic for the troops who have been waiting for a campaign that is more prepared to throw punches than take them

7583515 this changes the strategic relationship between the us and poland there is a clear and explicit understanding that if there are negative consequences of stationing the missile shield the us will come to polands defense
7583516 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia its to protect our european allies from any rogue threats
7583517 the strategic significance of the system consists of intercepting those few dozen missiles moscow can launch following a first strike its a crucial element to develop a nuclear first strike capacity against russia the original plan is for ten interceptor missiles in poland but once established their number could be easily increased
7583518 guarantee s a us edge to carry out nuclear war without risking a counter strike
7583519 were at war against determined enemies and we must not rest until that war is won

7583525 the dark days of communist yore and captures the threat of what we and russias neighbors are up against
7583526 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
7583527 immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
7583528 nato can act to stabiliz e this very dangerous situation
7583529 now is the time for action not just words russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met

7583538 young democracies around russia back into moscows sphere of influence the worldview of a russian nationalist is hard for outsiders to comprehend
7583539 kremlin capitalism is a threat to the west by using its market strength in oil and gas resources to strong arm its neighbors and outmaneuver the us and eu
7583540 is to replace a pro western government with a new russian satellite reminiscent of the brezhnev doctrine its part of a broader campaign to annex new territory expand the russian empire conduct cyber attacks against the baltic states assassinate enemies and use economic intimidation through cutoffs of russian oil and gas shipments to ukraine and the czech republic it is important that moscow pays a concrete and tangible price for its latest aggression at least comparable to what it paid for the 1979 invasion of afghanistan
7583541 burned and houses broken unburied bodies lay rotting fresh graves were dug in gardens and basements most victims interviewed were ethnic georgians in central georgian villages some killings were carried out for revenge some involved theft and still others seemed to be that the power balance was shifting away from ethnic georgians to the ossetian separatists and their russian backers
7583542 georgians living in several of the villages said the russians occupying their land had treated them well done nothing to encourage them to leave and offered the only protection available from the south ossestian militias they feared most
7583543 us sees much to fear in a hostile russia by usher ing in a sustained period of renewed animosity with the west problems extend ing far beyond arms deals with syria and the mountains of georgia

7583548 the kremlin is nearing formal recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia possibly as early as next week
7583549 support is likely and that after all the events that have occurred one should not expect otherwise
7583550 appealed to russia and to governments of other countries to recognize abkhazias independence
7583551 express such a will and if the russian president makes a relevant decision on this score
7583552 again said they will never agree to remain within georgia
7583553 in accordance with the international agreements to their previous places of deployment
7583554 envisaged in the international agreement poti is outside of the security zone
7583555 but that does not mean we will sit behind a fence watching them riding around in hummers
7583556 we have registered an increase in georgian reconnaissance activities and preparations for armed actions in the georgian south ossetian conflict zone
7583557 temporarily suspending military cooperation with nato until a political decision on relations
7583558 now we see russian forces which responded to attacks on russian peacekeepers in south ossetia legitimately
7583559 local s ossetian and abkhazian population said they fear georgia might repeat its regional aggression they also want russian troops to stay in the area to shield them from any possible attacks

7583628 the entire material leaves a bitter taste in the mouth about the goings on in the bmw case there is no manner of doubt whatsoever that there was complicity between mr khan and mr anand there can be absolutely no doubt that mr khan and mr anand were somehow or the other more than mixed up in the bmw case
7583629 mr anand and mr khan are prohibited from appearing in this court delhi high court or courts subordinate to it for four months from today however they are free to discharge their professional duties in terms of consultation advice conferences opinions etc

7583639 cant a judge buy legal property let the police or any other investigating agency prove that the money for the deal was provided by sanjeev bansal or ravinder singh
7583640 bansal failed to give a detailed account of the cash he produced some papers pertaining to some property in panchkula but that did not carry any weight our investigations caught him on the wrong foot and therefore we booked him along with two others under the prevention of corruption act and criminal conspiracy
7583641 the first thing that struck me as i entered the long dimly lit room was the smell an overwhelming mix of filth feces and chemicals next i saw the rows of small metal cages each one only about two meters long although i had seen pictures of these cruel confinement systems the reality was even more heartbreaking than i could have imagined inside of each cage was a black bear not the majestic awe inspiring animals that we think of when we picture a bear but pathetic creatures their fur matted and raw sitting in their own feces reduced to little more than machines

7583697 a man should learn to detect and watch the gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages yet he dismisses without notice his thoughts because it is his in every work of genius we recognize our own reject thoughts they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty great works of art have no more affecting lesson for us than this they teach us to abide by our spontaneous impression with good humored inflexibility then most when the whole cry of voices is on the other side else to morrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another

7583719 in the fall of 2002 bush and his white house were engaging in a carefully orchestrated campaign to shape and manipulate sources of public approval to our advantage
7583720 the phony bush lied story line distracts from the biggest prewar failure the fact that so much of the intelligence upon which bush and rockefeller and everyone else relied turned out to be tragically catastrophically wrong
7583721 in my experience the great majority of cases of actual politicization successful politicization are invariably subtle
7583722 the desire to avoid the unpleasantness of putting unwelcome assessments on the desks of policymakers

7583747 womens ordination as priests and now bishops has dominated debate and headlines but while looking at women in the pulpit we have taken our eyes off the pews where a shift with more consequences for the churchs survival is underway
7583748 what this research reveals is that a lot of people are put off by traditional stances and attitudes we still have a long way to go before women particularly young women feel as included in the church as men do

7584505 just tell plum creek no thanks lily bay is just fine the way it is
7584506 there is no need nor local desire to have this relatively unscathed section of the moosehead lake region developed especially on the large scale proposed by plum creek
7584507 i and all of my children and nieces and nephews were all baptized at the log chapel in rockwood i was married in the chapel and my fathers memorial service was held there i cant imagine moosehead lake becoming just another lake winnipesaukee with tens of thousands of boats polluting the pristine waters of the lake if you allow this development you can never take back the mistakes you will be making it is forever something missing here and another piece of america will be lost forever
7584508 one cannot say too often that once the moosehead peace quiet and natural beauty is compromised by development for the few wealthy seasonal beneficiaries it is compromised forever it is not worth it
7584509 i personally have many fond memories of family camping trips at lily bay fishing for native brook trout in the rivers near lily bay and sighting many different wildlife species that call this area home i sincerely hope that i can share these same experiences with my children someday but this will be impossible if the area is developed to the extent in the plum creek proposal
7584510 i am certainly a believer in tourism to our state but if we fundamentally erode the places that define who we are to ourselves and to others then we are killing the golden goose
7584511 we understand that some development is good but this is by far too sweeping plum creek would condemn this area to a future of cookie cutter resorts our beautiful maine will become just like everywhere else
7584512 such places are getting increasingly rare in our country and thus on a per acre basis add much more to the wealth and appeal of our state to residents and moosehead lake visitors alike than any development ever could
7584513 we dont know who kidnapped them there is a rebel group which kidnaps for ransom separate from rivals who have political objectives
7584514 we shall do all that is possible to save them
7584515 westerners have been targeted and killed in terrorist attacks throughout somalia including mogadishu

7584578 zurich swiss watches need to be more swiss that is the call of some of the biggest makers of one of the countrys best known luxury exports worried that too large a proportion of a swiss watch is in fact made outside switzerland big manufacturers such as swatch group sa cie financi re richemont sa which owns the piaget brand and family owned rolex sa want to tighten the requirements for what qualifies as swiss made but some smaller companies see this as an attempt to force them out of business and say protecting the swiss made name would be better achieved by boosting quality standards under current laws at least 50 of the value of a watch movement the watchs engine comprising key parts such as the winding and setting mechanisms must be manufactured in switzerland for the product to qualify as swiss made but since a movement typically makes up only 15 to 25 of a watchs total value this means less than 10 of the value of a watch qualifying as swiss made might have been added in switzerland

7584632 se trata de un crecimiento l gico por lo que fue la transformaci n de los vi edos que pasaron de ser encargados de producir volumen a producir calidad

7584634 hace 15 a os la g ndolas exhib an unas 30 etiquetas y hoy hay m s de 5 000 en el mercado
7584635 hubo una complejizaci n que trajo la necesidad de que el sommelier pudiera aparecer en escena separando la paja del trigo trabajando en el asesoramiento de los consumidores porque es dif cil mantenerse al d a y estar informado de cada vino nuevo que sale
7584636 se gener el nicho para que aparezca el sommelier como el traductor el intermediario entre productores y consumidores

7584666 dat mensen daar wonen met zon kleine baby dat moeten we met elkaar niet willen nog afgezien van het eigendomsrecht het is de humane zorg die je als gemeentebestuurder hebt naar mensen
7584667 we willen niet schoppen naar de gemeente want wij willen juist het positieve benadrukken maar dit neigt wel naar stemmingmakerij jammer dat ze het kennelijk zo willen uitvechten
7584668 in twee van de drie panden is lekkage geweest en is het stoffig de baby verblijft in het huis dat tot voor een jaar nog bewoond werd er zijn daar dezelfde omstandigheden als in een normale woning
7584669 die zijn hier geweest en hebben per vertrek gekeken of er in gewoond kon worden er is geen woord gevallen dat er niet gewoond zou kunnen worden
7584670 liever krakers in de weverstraat dan een verdere verloedering en verkrotting van die panden
7584671 ik heb me net als de buurt geeergerd en steeds bozer gemaakt over hoe zowel gemeente als vivare die panden hebben laten verslonzen
7584672 in oktober en december vorig jaar heb ik wethouder heinrich daar nog vragen over gesteld maar die meldde dat alles op een haar na rond was met vivare eind 2003 heeft de gemeente die panden gekocht je geeft als overheid een slecht signaal wanneer je woonruimte vier jaar laat verkrotten en dat in een straat waarvan je kort daarvoor hebt besloten dat het een beschermd dorpsgezicht moet zijn
7584673 door de laksheid of wat het dan ook mag zijn dat tot de vertraging geleid heeft is de gemeente ook nog subsidie van het kan en het bouwfonds cultuurfonds kwijt
7584674 wij nemen pas over als de boel leeg is en aan die afspraak houden wij vast feitelijk zijn de krakers een probleem van de gemeente daar staan wij buiten
7584675 de zaak was met vivare eigenlijk al beklonken het was alleen nog wachten op de overdracht we zijn er dan ook heel ongelukkig mee dat de panden in dit stadium zijn gekraakt
7584676 zeer ongewenst en onverantwoord het is daar koud vochtig vies en ongezond dat mensen daar wonen met zo n kleine baby dat moeten we met elkaar niet willen nog afgezien van het eigendomsrecht het is de humane zorg die je als gemeentebestuurder hebt naar mensen
7584677 we zijn dan ook met wijn en bossen bloemen door de buurt onthaald
7584678 de buurt ergerde zich aan de verloedering van de drie panden en heeft heel veel onvrede hoe de gemeente er mee omgaat
7584679 e n pand heeft erg te lijden van vocht er zaten allemaal schrootjes tegen de muren getimmerd waardoor het vocht niet weg kon die schrootjes hebben we nu allemaal weggehaald
7584680 we willen een expositieruimte ateliers voor kunstenaars en woonruimte de galerie moet je heel breed zien het moet een soort huiskamer worden van de weverstraat
7584681 wij zijn in de panden geweest en hebben vervolgens de gemeente en de brandweer ge nformeerd in het kader van brandveiligheid en gezondheid
7584682 die zien geen reden acuut het vertrek te eisen van de krakers daarmee is het geen zaak voor politie en justitie als de eigenaar wat wil zal hij dat via een civiele procedure bij de rechter moeten doen
7584683 eind 2005 zijn gemeente en vivare tot een akkoord gekomen over de verkoop van de panden eind vorig jaar kwam de woonstichting met een plan voor vier appartementen en twee winkels daaronder het was alleen nog een kwestie van het regelen van de overdracht we weten nu nog even niet welke stappen we moeten zetten

7584689 the medical expenses already run into the tens of thousands of dollars
7584690 dennis and vicki did so much for desoto county and the children here that i believe we should help them
7584691 vicki was onboard the ambulance aircraft that airlifted dennis from montana to utah
7584692 dennis was in a lot of pain from being jostled around during the trip but he is feeling much better now
7584693 we appreciate the many prayers and the praise for denniss healing
7584694 this was such a blessing to me i dont know jo but i found out that she lives down the street and i hope to meet her soon
7584695 dennis asked me to take this position and always showed that he had faith in me
7584696 hmm i know a dennis moore naw not our dennis moore
7584697 that was the first thing he wanted to do was schedule a meeting with everyone
7584698 i imagine hell be able to get back to work by january
7584699 people probably think why dont they just go out and buy a new house
7584700 i just dont think theres any greater joy than giving
7584701 were doing this because we want to bless his family
7584702 dennis keeps trying to turn the miles per hour up
7584703 we all need moore friends victory over sci that means spinal cord injury
7584704 the operator told me to turn him over and start cpr i had just established a good rhythm when the ambulance crew rolled up
7584705 fortunately there was no severing of the spinal cord but he remains paralyzed
7584706 hes totally aware and hes communicative but hes paralyzed and were in for the long haul
7584707 when i looked over the edge of the roof he was not moving he had fallen from 12 to 15 feet but its the way he hit the doctors said
7584708 were still going to have the surgery then i think hes going to be in a rehab center for about two months
7584709 hes always liked a challenge and this is just one more trip for him
7584710 hes heard from friends all over the world and i think hes enjoyed all the contacts
7584711 the surgery this morning was successful and hes scheduled to have additional surgery on sunday then hes going for rehabilitation at a hospital in denver
7584712 cb3 dorky kid or music related and words on the under brim like breezy or boom
7584713 we got here in less than two hours and dennis appears to be in good shape
7584714 we expect hes going to be here through early september
7584715 its based on progress but overall its a program of about six weeks or so
7584716 dennis is eager to get on with it hes talking to everyone but he remains paralyzed
7584717 its about the same as it was he cant wait to get started
7584718 its going to work out well for us i believe
7584719 he came through the surgery fine but hes been having some pain in his neck while hes recovering
7584720 they had to fuse the first two vertebrae and then they had to place a metal plate in his head
7584721 dennis is still on a ventilator so well have to work out the details so he can be flown to denver and then taken to the rehab facility
7584722 we want to be ready when the hospital is ready for him
7584723 hes in the healing process and we know that its going to take time
7584724 hes experiencing some pain now but the doctors tell us thats a good sign
7584725 he continues to have a good attitude and hes cooperating well with the doctors
7584726 weve read all of the e mails to him and they really give him a boost

7584746 barack loves basketball and we talked about the game today and we realize that over the last week or 10 days john mccain has had a 12 and 0 run here in this basketball game but we know that the momentum can shift and its going to shift starting in denver
7584747 out of direct contact with the news cycle then comes the invasion of georgia so all of those things came together to give mccain the field and a stronger position that he might otherwise have had tactically
7584748 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil

7584753 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7584754 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7584755 its an initiative that belittles the role of nuns who have dedicated themselves to god

7584814 one of the highlights for me was going to be to get to see her today said barbaro who has been wearing a clinton supporter for obama button
7584815 i think the key to a big victory for barack is how well she translates her support for him into meaningful language that is truly communicated that translation has yet to catch on
7584816 the news here is that a significant number of people who voted for clinton are still not on the obama train said hanna a clinton delegate
7584817 so shes working on that i think its not that shes disregarding california
7584818 she has a lot of constituent delegates here and wed love to see her and love to hear her galloway said
7584819 i will be on the obama train when hillary tells me its ok to said galloway who went to texas to help campaign for clinton during the long primary fight
7584820 as far as the messages we personally get from hillary we have not gotten a directive to change our vote
7584821 i was still hoping to the last minute for the dream team galloway said

7584842 providing tools to help artists take their work to an audience and develop direct support
7584843 taking charge of my career this way ends a long ugly struggle everything about the previous scenario felt unnatural the photo shoots stylists the makeup and the hair thousands of dollars spent to make me look like a fashion model the truth is i never belonged anywhere near that life
7584844 at this point ive come to the realization that the size of our audience probably wont change much
7584845 the question then becomes how to best serve the audience weve got cash has been a great tool in that respect those involved are extremely passionate people with consistently good ideas about how to move a project forward and the technological know how to make it possible
7584846 it seems like the perfect way of escaping from the dumb industry standards
7584847 super expensive promo videos and other hackneyed techniques have been catastrophic failures for us
7584848 i would prefer to engage you in conversation and reconciliation

7584877 our law is based on the british organ transplantation and human tissue act the british administration amended it about a year ago so we should follow them in the larger public interest
7584878 in india i feel that the law should be amended to provide for setting up an independent committee
7584879 since most of the hospital had taken up a cautious stand i had a prolonged meeting with nominees of both the organisations and leading urologists and nephrologists to discuss the crisis situation
7584880 i have requested the organisations to submit their suggestions within a week so that we can take it up with the centre
7584881 for last three months we had stopped the procedures but in the past week we have performed two cases of cadaver transplants
7584882 we are really excited for our spring 09 juniors launch of our fashion forward collection for the ever changing fast marketplace we have researched extensively to be on the pulse of what our ezekiel girl wants we collectively have brought together bold colors and strong silhouettes with a creative marketing campaign to bring interest to our loyal followers and newcomers
7584883 im proud to have worked with such a talented team on this dynamic project
7584884 together we have created a package that both retailers and consumers will fall in love with our girl has always been at the forefront of young contemporary styles but this year she is more in touch with her whimsical feminine self
7584885 at that time i will be releasing them i will tell them that i intend to vote for senator obama a lot of people are committed to unifying behind senator obama how they vote is a more personal decision because a lot of them feel like they represent people who sent them there to vote for me a lot of them feel that you know they want to have their chance to vote for me and then well all vote together that is what traditionally happens we could go back and have a long history lesson about how this has worked before i dont think you would find a more cooperative relationship between two campaigns at least as far as i can remember in any kind of contested primary season once we get to the convention so of course some people are having to make up their minds because there are arguments pulling both ways their constituents voted for me but of course they are going to do everything they can for senator obama so thats why i am saying what i am going to do releasing them and letting them know that however they do decide to vote we will all be united behind senator obama once the nomination is finally declared and we leave denver and thats the real goal here it is to make sure that people feel good about their experience in denver that they feel like they had a chance to be heard that they did get an opportunity to say what they had to say and what they came to say but then we leave here and we are all behind senator obama and it is so much of a smoother convention its not like anything like a lot of the challenges and the fights and the disagreements you know in my experience going back gosh a long time so i would just suggest to you that i know we have 24 7 news cycle to fill but clearly what maggie williams and david axelrod said yesterday about how were working together and how we intend to unify our party and elect senator obama is exactly whats going on
7584886 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention as well as it should be
7584887 come on this is new york are you ready to elect a president
7584888 we stayed with hillary right up there to the end
7584889 we are united in one thing we are going to elect barack obama president of the united states
7584890 and the person who will be leading the charge to do that
7584891 hillary clinton will lead all of us in new york and in this country to make sure that barack obama
7584892 struggle that broke so many glass ceilings but didnt quite break one more
7584893 despite the sexism and despite everything else nothing stops her
7584894 all of you here in new york played such an instrumental role in my campaign
7584895 and now i ask each and every one of you to work as hard for barack obama and joe biden as you worked for me
7584896 the mccain campaign is running ads that are trying to divide us
7584897 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7584898 everyone of us could stand up and recite all the reasons we must elect barack
7584899 none of that will happen if john mccain is in the white house
7584900 if anything preschool may do lasting damage to many children
7584901 a 2005 analysis by researchers at stanford university and the university of california berkeley found that kindergartners with 15 or more hours of preschool every week were less motivated and more aggressive in class likewise canadas c d howe institute found a higher incidence of anxiety hyperactivity and poor social skills among kids in quebec after universal preschool
7584902 very much in its infancy but one inescapable conclusion from the existing research is that it is not for everyone kids with loving and attentive parents the vast majority might well be better off spending more time at home than away in their formative years the last thing that public policy should do is spend vast new sums of taxpayer dollars to incentivize a premature separation between toddlers and parents
7584903 you two were at the end of the universe eh right at the edge of knowledge itself and youre busy blogging
7584904 we have nothing against the technology we just dont want that delivery system

7584906 this isnt fibromyalgia or some sort of chronic fatigue or even the flu its dehydration
7584907 something like this technology could be embedded in tables and work surfaces

7584909 we believe that this will establish the psp as a viable communication device

7584957 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7584958 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7584959 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7584960 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table shes been as an island of consideration and gentle criticism between randy and simon offering her invaluable expertise as a performer and no 1 artist to the thousands who have competed on american idol with kara by her side paula finally has some back up and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show

7585059 the head had been removed there was nothing left of it only the jaw bone and you could clearly see toothmarks in it
7585060 the hind leg had been pulled up through the neck hole the heart lungs and other internal organs had also been removed there wasnt really much left of her
7585061 there was nothing in the area to indicate a struggle it was clear she had been completely overpowered she was a confident plucky thing but whatever it was killed minnie very quickly and managed to jump our six foot fence
7585062 big cats go for the neck and then pull their prey down when they feed they start with the tongue and the cheeks and work down

7585065 weve moved all our animals out of that field now im not daft but there is definitely something around here something very powerful i have absolutely no doubt now that there is a big cat wandering this area
7585066 several years ago while driving in the chase with my partner i spotted an animal that i struggled to identify
7585067 it was too large for a cat and definitely did not move the way a dog would move it was jet black
7585068 unfortunately it was only a glimpse as the animal moved into the trees i have often wondered if it was a panther

7585079 people thought i was saying the bus killing was caused by windigo possession

7585100 in order to become myself i must cease to be what i always thought i wanted to be

7585135 okay now where was i a hundred years ago before i was born
7585136 yep its exactly the same theres no difference at all between not existing before you were born and not existing after you die none so if you werent scared then you shouldnt be scared about going back to it i still get scared sometimes because i forget that but then i try to really understand it again and i feel much better

7585154 thailand needs cambodia and cambodia needs thailand if bilateral negotiations fail if after every effort you cannot find a solution it is time to consider the option of the united nations security council
7585155 that is one thing asean could do to make itself really effective
7585156 i am disappointed with the thai decision to close the temple gate they should understand that the temple belongs to cambodia and should be under cambodian control
7585157 the united states government is right now on the threshold of making its decision to directly fund the tribunal

7585161 the khmer rouge tribunal is making slow progress but it is going in the right direction
7585162 we want to support and fund the khmer rouge tribunal directly but we cannot until we are convinced it is a real tribunal and will give cambodian people a real chance at justice
7585163 the government is still safe and sound and the cabinet meeting will be held at government house tomorrow

7585171 it is often said without solid evidence that the king of aragon adopted the moors head after the battle of alcoras or alarcos 1046 during which king peter i had defeated four moorish kings the only solid conclusion which can be drawn is that the moors head is not of corsican origin but was probably imported by the kings of aragon although it is not attested before the beginnning ot the xivth century

7585181 your hunters need to understand that steady shot is the perfect filler special shot special shots consist of steady shot arcane shot multishot any others but irrelevant because arcane shot and multishot both do more damage than steady shot these should have precedence then only when these 2 shots are on cooldown you feed in your steady shots to keep up the damage so ideally the sum of all steady shots arcane shots multishots should be equal to the number of auto shots fired this is a 1 1 rotation one autoshot followed by one special doing this wills see their dps increase dramatically

7585233 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7585234 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7585235 we also are children of royal consciousness all of us in one way or another have deep commitments to it so the first question is how can we have enough freedom to imagine and articulate a real historical newness in our situation that is not to ask as israels prophets ever asked if this freedom is realistic or politically practical or economically viable to begin with such questions is to concede everything to the royal consciousness even before we begin we need to ask not whether it is realistic or practical or viable but whether it is imaginable we need to ask if our consciousness and imagination have been so assaulted and co opted by the royal consciousness that we have been robbed of the courage or power to think an alternative thought
7585236 the royal consciousness leads people to despair about the power to move toward new life it is the task of prophetic imagination and ministry to bring people to engage the promise of newness that is at work in our history with god
7585237 man is so much the prey of the powers so closely associated with their work enjoys himself so thoroughly to their profit desires so much all that they offer conceives his life to such a degree separated from god that every approach of god every positive work of god appears to him as an unacceptable disturbance and finally an attack against him when god comes to deliver him he does not at all perceive his liberation he protests against the breaking of those marvelous objects which are his chains or the doors of his prison the adored chains this is clearly the situation of man
7585238 and we must take account of the fact that every work of liberation the process of freeing us is in fact destructive of the evil environment
7585239 next that evil also takes place by the interplay of the spiritual powers who act in the world and in society

7585262 he swung it well today it was a well played game we got down and battled back we had a big inning thanks to bengie
7585263 ive seen it before ive always thought that he was a good clutch hitter
7585264 he has the ability to put the good part of the bat on the ball
7585265 he can hit he hit a good pitch he has the ability to put the bat on the ball wherever it is that is a special talent that he has what has been impressive about him is how comfortable he is and the sense of belonging that we have talked about he believes that he can play up here and that is why he is doing so well
7585266 in that spot its not as big a deal as you would think it is its early in the game and youre looking to throw a strike
7585267 its almost better that he hits it in the water than a double otherwise youre looking at a stress inning right off the bat

7585269 lawsuits are ephemeral and serve only as a delay tactic for record labels to catch up with emerging technologies while the issue of contention in lawsuits is often the protection of copyright materials the real concern for record labels may be the ceding of monopoly power
7585270 key economic issue for the recording industry is that the marginal cost of e distribution of music is negligible creating intense competitive pressure on prices and established distribution channels
7585271 mp3 developed outside of the big fives control and offered no intrinsic protections against copying mp3s therefore threatened the music industry by holding out the possibility of a business model that links artists directly to consumers bypassing the record companies completely

7585372 each manufacturer is actually accelerating the developement and the launch of these types of vehicles because they reduce carbon emissions
7585373 the pricing right now is a little costly so if you were to take a look at the other solutions like the hybrids and electric vehicles they are actually being sold right now in the developed countries the us europe japan because of high purchasing power
7585374 as costs go down once we reach the critical mass they hybrids will going to be disseminated more here in asean

7585465 i honestly couldnt care less who scarlett johansson is supporting or that she wants to marry barack obama i mean get over yourself and show me your boobs period
7585466 its totally irrelevant what angelina jolie says about who shes voting for isnt going to affect anyone and that very irrelevancy proves that celebrities are just celebrities nothing more and that no one cares what they think even though their narcissism might have them believing otherwise
7585467 how can you live the life you lead a life of enormous riches when whoevers in power isnt going to affect you in any way oprah is not dealing with the sub prime crisis
7585468 finally people are interested in what ive been trying to explain to them for the past 27 years
7585469 ever since i was little my parents knew there was something a bit different about me and growing up in the states they didnt exactly know where to put me because i wasnt autistic i didnt have cerebral palsy i was failing every subject and teachers were bullying me other students
7585470 something as simplistic as getting dressed in the morning was quite difficult so id show up to class late
7585471 and i remember when i was seven i put my jeans on in the wrong direction inside out
7585472 imagine having problems with depth perception and trying to do geometry or lining up numbers
7585473 i cant judge which way the arrows should go and which way it should go in
7585474 these are not children who are just low in athletic ability
7585475 they are children who are having difficulty with everyday activities like buttering bread turning a key in the lock printing cutting combing their hair just doing everyday activities
7585476 its helpful to families when they recognize that their children are struggling to know that the children are not going to get worse that its not a degenerative condition
7585477 in fact the children are going to develop some skills over time and therefore they will seem better
7585478 if people realize how hard it is for them to do the motor aspect of tasks and they understand it theres lots of ways around many tasks
7585479 nothings missing with us we have talents things are just a bit off
7585480 i didnt want to drift too far away from the old school sensibility
7585481 to me the idea of doing something that had many dimensions that was actually to some extent quite heroic but not in a square jawed sense but someone who is ultimately a good guy with many layers and complex with a gray character not black or white and with a long arc to tell that story with many different directions and a lot of potential depth that really really appealed to me edginess certainly but thats not something that attracts me to tell you the truth i get enough of that
7585482 china with 100 medals in total count including 51 gold has yielded the richest crop of heroes in its history as one of the songs at the closing ceremony implored guests to stay in a gesture of chinese hospitality china is here to stay as a sporting power and its implications will reverberate beyond sports
7585483 what will the chinese regime do with its olympic triumph
7585484 as much a political as a sports triumph for chinese power which appears to be stronger than ever
7585485 the loosening up of human rights restrictions by the government was nowhere to be seen during the big olympics party
7585486 presented himself as a puppet of the chinese communist regime
7585487 want acceptance this anxiety this eagerness to please manifested itself in the authorities view that nothing in these games could be left to chance from the opening ceremony it was clear these olympics had been perfectly choreographed the chinese people were desperate to make that peace with the rest of the world and they are starting to believe they have been successful so have the beijing olympics been a public relations triumph for chinas leaders has the carefully choreographed spectacle dispelled the notion of china as an authoritarian and vaguely threatening superpower with a poor record on human rights for the chinese the public relations push has only just begun the communist government is moving swiftly to capitalize on the success of its athletes by sending most of chinas gold medalists to hong kong next week ahead of elections there on september 7 that are a crucial test for advocates of democracy a resurgent chinese national pride has buoyed pro beijing candidates this summer and they hope they can take control

7585725 if people had infrared sensitive eyes the entrails of sagittarius would be a prominent fixture sweeping across our sky
7585726 but at human visual wavelengths they become buried among countless intervening stars and obscuring dust the great expanse of the sagittarius system has been hidden from view
7585727 we sifted several thousand interesting stars from a catalog of half a billion
7585728 by tuning our maps of the sky to the right kind of star the sagittarius system jumped into view
7585729 this first full sky map of sagittarius shows its extensive interaction with the milky way
7585730 both stars and star clusters now in the outer parts of the milky way have been stolen from sagittarius as the gravitational forces of the milky way nibbled away at its dwarf companion this one vivid example shows that the milky way grows by eating its smaller neighbors
7585731 after slow continuous gnawing by the milky way sagittarius has been whittled down to the point that it cannot hold itself together much longer
7585732 we are seeing sagittarius at the very end of its life as an intact system
7585733 whenever possible astronomers appeal to the principle that we are not at a special time or place in the universe
7585734 because over the 14 billion year history of the milky way it is unlikely that we would just happen to catch a brief event like the death of sagittarius we infer that such events must be common in the life of big spiral galaxies like our own the milky way probably dined on a number of dwarf galaxy snacks in the past
7585735 for only a few percent of its 240 million year orbit around the milky way galaxy does our solar system pass through the path of sagittarius debris
7585736 remarkably stars from sagittarius are now raining down onto our present position in the milky way stars from an alien galaxy are relatively near us we have to re think our assumptions about the milky way galaxy to account for this contamination
7585737 the shape of the sagittarius debris trail shows us that the milky ways unseen dark matter is in a spherical distribution a result that is quite unexpected
7585738 the observations provide new insights into the nature of the mysterious dark matter
7585739 either our galaxy is unusual or the dark matter has richer properties than postulated by conventional models

7585760 it was really thrilling to see somebody who was actually trying to understand the broader applications of technology for the marketplace it kind of triangulated social issue business issues technology issues to try to figure out what was really going on
7585761 even though there is that disproportionate contribution to gdp were under investing compared with the us to the tune of about 50 so that makes us canada less competitive another thing that is happening is that a lot of people think it is a field that in some ways is in decline but in fact it is growing and the demand for icts is growing in canada companies are realizing that they need to invest in this area in order to be more competitive and for a number of other reasons as well we are facing a crisis in the labour market where we have all the old fogies like me retiring or on the eve of retirement at the other end of the labour market we have declining enrollments and people not entering the field so those are my interests both in itac and in ictc
7585762 both of those things are happening even though we are moving jobs offshore demand is growing and its growing firstly because we have underinvested for a very long time in this area and secondly because companies are using it in ever more areas of the business and its becoming pervasive in every aspect in our lives theres a myth out there that this offshoring is creating a decline in jobs that is absolutely not the case what is happening is that the kinds of people that we need are changing
7585763 i think there is a lot of mythology out there about this issue a lot of people think that the reason that the kids are not enrolling is because of the dot com crash five years ago so people think that this is a field that is in decline or the offshoring phenomenon where people say why should i go into a field where i might not actually be able to get a job that may be a bit of a factor but i dont think its the central factor look at the data that does exist out there and what you find is theres a certain perception among young people that it is not the greatest career choice compared with other fields we need to look at ourselves as an industry or as a field and ask the hard nosed question what is the roi on going into the field of information technology as compared with some of the other options
7585764 i think that the main issue is that kids dont think that they want to go into this field they dont want to be perceived or have the experience of being nerds who are stuck in front of a computer screen for the rest of their lives even though that is actually not the future of these jobs
7585765 women have been grossly under represented in terms of their percentage of the workforce in this field and it has never really gotten any better weve stood at around the 25 mark of women in it for as long back as people can remember but actually what is happening as enrollments are declining across canada and in all industrialized countries of men in post secondary programs we are seeing a commensurate declining enrollment of women what that says is that there is a broader set of issues here that effect both women and men and there are some specific gender issues that affect women
7585766 historically it hasnt been that great look at it companies hardly any it companies or telecom companies have a ceo whose principle credentials are it credentials weve got to fix that if we are going to make this an attractive field
7585767 we have not been able to tackle immigration effectively to fill this gap there are probably two primary reasons one is that we are not very good at recognizing the credentials of internationally educated professionals secondly our immigration systems has not been focused on this challenge and we have not been focused on getting the type of people with the market skills that we require
7585768 immigration is a part of the solution but its not going to get us there at the end of the day we need a way to solve the enrollment problem and also to retrain people retraining is one way to tackle this both in terms of taking business people and giving them the it skills that they need but also we should be looking at whats happening with the automotive industry or the manufacturing industry in general
7585769 all the organizations that ive talked to are trying to get the real players mobilized to take action we need to change the way that we manage peoples careers in it we need to change the way we educate people to prepare for this field we need to get a lot better at communicating those choices and educating people about them we need to get the influencers understanding this and not just the kids themselves
7585770 this kind of disaggregation of control that information communications technologies have wrought on markets is part of what is driving the current economic crisis that we see in the world what we are seeing are two levels of disaggregation that are happening now because of the power of information technology on one hand historically a lot of relationships were managed hierarchically through fairly controlled ways of doing things and the other thing thats happening is that we are seeing increasingly a shift away from pre designed pre packaged and pre specified solutions toward emergent solutions where the participants in the network are the ones who are designing the solutions the outcomes almost on the fly
7585771 the opportunities are finding new ways and more creative ways to manage against these problems there are big opportunities for any country that can build a new kind of economy that is more energy efficient and creates new kinds of technologies that can facilitate energy efficiency because there will be a huge global demand for those kinds of solutions

7585799 this entire project the hotel the villas and the condos under
7585800 a wonderful hotel in a fantastic part of the world
7585801 this wonderful restaurant imho is the best place to close a deal
7585802 because what lies in store for that someone else will be the consequences of our actions
7585803 im also excited about having our honorary captains in bob chappius ron kramer and dan dierdorf i think thats something im really excited about each home game well have a few honorary captains some of our past greats that will come and the fans will have a chance to see them and theyll have an opportunity to be in the locker room with our team prior to the game
7585804 it should be or when it says or it means or now hopefully by the end of the week were going to have somebody on all these ors go out with the first group but its still a wide open competition it will remain so at a lot of positions
7585805 right now nick and steve are still battling and i dont want to say hopefully someone separates himself but i just hope that both of them are ready to play and win with by the weekend and that theyve made great steps like the tailback position the receiver position and quarterback position this week will probably determine who starts on saturday
7585806 well do something again on a smaller scale this thursday just because we particularly found out with our freshmen not that they got all wide eyed but it was a little bit different when a coach wasnt standing right behind him telling him what to do so that was good work for us and having been in the stadium for the first time because we didnt even have a spring game even to get our upperclassmen back into the feel getting them excited to be back in the big house
7585807 in the transition to the spread scheme the skill guys on offense all had a chance and that has played out to be true
7585808 martavious odoms has had a terrific camp and we thought he had an opportunity but you didnt know how quickly hes going to make mistakes all of them are but he has shown enough playmaking ability that we have to get him in the game
7585809 obviously at the receiver position where we lost some guys thats where darryl stonum and even roy roundtree could play there are five or six on offense and even a few guys on defense mike martin is going to play boubacar cissoko is going to play j b fitzgerald is going to play so we have eight nine maybe 10 true freshmen that will play for the first time this weekend thats why were a little nervous but im excited for them
7585810 yeah thats still ive been really pleased with the tight end play for the most part kevin has shown us enough hes a very very quick learner a very intelligent guy and obviously has some ability we think kevin will be right there in the mix mike massey is a veteran carson butler has played a good bit but kevin has showed us quite a bit hes caught our eye and will have an opportunity to play
7585811 i think talking to scott draper our assistant ad i think that was already in the works even before i got hired talking about doing something like that
7585812 its going to be new and hopefully it will grow when the word gets out hopefully there will be a bunch of our fans lined up on either side getting the guys fired up not that they needed it but its fun
7585813 i tell the team you work like crazy for seven or eight months of the year to play 12 games and hope to play in a 13th and those 12 games ought to be very very exciting for them all the time i think that adds a little bit to it im excited about it
7585814 right outside here the junge center well drop off two parking lots down it will be a 200 yard walk just down here the band will lead the way when we get off the bus and then the players will walk a few hundred yards right into our locker room we tried that a little bit last thursday and the guys got a smile on their face i think its pretty neat
7585815 the biggest improvement with them was the obvious learning the system
7585816 and thats the thing for the coaches in order to run an effective offense and defense you have to have enough in there to have answers to the problems youll face but you cant confuse your players thats the dynamic were dealing with now
7585817 basically in a sense because of the new schemes everyone is a freshman mentally now the guys that have some experience or are used to picking up different things offensively and defensively learned it very quickly nick and steve have both probably picked up more things than we could have anticipated now we havent done it in a game but as far as what theyve shown in practice and even their improvement from the spring to now is the grasp of the offense but it will still get better
7585818 i would think both have gotten to the point where we feel comfortable we could win with both of them
7585819 one of his advantages was he was able to come here in the spring semester and go through spring practice and get in the weight program
7585820 were having all of our receivers lean both sides what we call the x and the z receiver those are different positions and yet theyre very very similar normally by your second or third year they all have it but we had them all learn it now darryl was a pretty quick learner again a lot of these guys will make mistakes hopefully well keep them to a minimum darryl has skills but hes also a very very competitive guy hes going to play quite a bit
7585821 all of them laterryal savoy greg mathews junior hemingway is another guy that is probably not even listed because hes banged up as junior gets healthy well see this week he could be another guy in there toney clemons may play outside some as well i mention roy roundtree is a true freshman that will have an opportunity to play as well
7585822 with that there are going to be some few anxious moments before we get out there and perform but we try to do is put pressure on them in practice put them in some situations we have at least know in our mind that this guy is going to be ready to play or not thats why you say there are so many ors we have another week to put pressure on them in practice and in a game we want to play a lot of people anyway but i think were going to be in a situation where were going to and we can see who responds well in a game
7585823 not really ive never been im not that nostalgic type not that it wont be exciting because it will be very exciting but i think its probably different every place you go to and coach at is always a neat experience the first time but i think the very first time you run out as a head coach is what you remember a lot having done this for a few years you get excited for the games but all the hoopla doesnt particularly make me feel one way or another im just happy to play and see how we compete the other stuff is not a big deal for me
7585824 most of the time you think about coaches being nervous you get a little bit if youre not getting butterflies as a coach or a player you shouldnt be playing or coaching but you usually have a little more fun fridays and saturdays because most of the work is already done as far as the preparation the preparation is when you have to have a sense of urgency i have a greater sense of urgency now than i will come friday or saturday
7585825 we do that everybody does everybody takes their travel squad and puts them in a hotel has a nice meal a nice meeting well let them watch a movie something to relax friday night its very similar i think just about every team does the same thing
7585826 we didnt go live in the beanie bowl so thats why its hard for us obviously in the punt returns were going to use both donovan warren and martavious odoms donovan warren will be the first guy hes the most experienced guy
7585827 any time you put a true freshman on the returns it makes you a little nervous you also want to put your most explosive players there so michael shaw may be back there on kick returns but well definitely have brandon harrison and morgan trent and those guys ready as well
7585828 the most damaging part injury wise in camp was to our o line which was an area we couldnt afford cory zirbel went out with a knee and his backup mark huyge went out with an ankle now all of a sudden were really scrambling with already inexperienced players
7585829 that was the biggest concern we had moving john ferrara helped john is still learning it but hes certainly going to help there david moosman being able to play both center and guard has helped us as well
7585830 were very very thin there we knew that coming in were obviously thin there on experience youre going to have four new starters regardless but those guys have worked pretty hard theyve gotten a little bit better each day
7585831 were going to see a whole lot of pressure from utah theyre going to bring a lot of blitzes theyre a very aggressive defense and give you a lot of different looks some odd fronts some even fronts bringing guys from off the edges and up the middle weve got to do a lot of work this week in making sure they can pick up the blitzes and be ready for the pressure
7585832 there are ors on all of those ive got four tailbacks right there
7585833 mcguffie shaw minor and brown are all right there competing we may start two at one time in our offense we can play two tailbacks at the same time
7585834 again i know its important maybe who takes the first snap to a lot of people to me its more important to us to play the guys we feel were ready to win with
7585835 i dont ever go into it its more of a feel thing if a guy is playing well making plays not making big mistakes and hes not getting tired well keep feeding him the ball but we dont ever go into it saying this guy is going to get eight carries this guy is going to get seven carries we just kind of let it happen
7585836 kevin will not play hes suspended for this saturday he knows that
7585837 not for team rules obviously the guys who are injured cory mark huyge terrance robison is another terrance is a guy that would have played as a true freshman this week he has a knee situation and hell be out a few weeks hes a freshman that would have been playing this weekend
7585838 oh as long as i deem necessary hes got certain things hes got to do and hes been doing them daily with kevin i know hes learned his lesson and hes working hard to get back in the good graces hes done everything that weve asked of him on the field and off the field if he continues to do that well lift the suspension in due time
7585839 the experience they have is one thing thats a team thats going to come in very confident very aggressive defensively ive said it before they think this may be their best team since urbans meyer team went to the bcs
7585840 theyve got a very athletic quarterback that runs the spread which weve had problems against in the past theyve got some explosive players theyve got some of the fastest corners we will play against theyre pretty solid and theyve got a great punter kicker in louis sakoda
7585841 there are really no weak spots and its a veteran team so its not like were opening up against somebody that we can mess around and play awful and win weve got to play well to win this one
7585842 hes an explosive guy then theyve got the other big tailback matt asiata those guys can play for anybody mack had a great year last year hes a perfect spread back in that he can catch the ball hes got quick hips
7585843 weve done some live like everybody else but its different at game speed
7585844 because you dont do a lot of live tackling in practices the games are really where youve got to judge it weve done some in practice obviously against each other but the big concern is can we tackle these guys in space
7585845 yeah it looks like it that way dont put a whole lot into it because we tell our players not to weve got a few more practices i could tell you more definitively if this was about one oclock on saturday
7585846 were just trying to get them ready to win with and put the best guys out there to start the game
7585847 ive got a gut feeling yeah can you keep a secret
7585848 wednesday maybe yeah i might maybe not ive got a gut feeling
7585849 yeah but i think thats overrated theyre going to prepare for either one and neither one of them are on film its not like you can watch either guy and say he does this and that guy does that
7585850 theyre both similar players anyway i think if you had two totally different types of players one strictly a runner and one strictly a thrower then you maybe would keep an advantage by not saying something but theyre very similar in what they do and neither one of them have played so i dont think it gives an advantage one way or the other
7585851 oh later in the week to their credit they know they just have to keep working every day people say if you tell them they get their nerves out theyre going to be nervous no matter when you tell them saturday before the game or wednesday or thursday today whatever
7585852 ill talk with both of them and have my little conversations with them as far as both of them getting ready but theyre great young men theyll understand the situation and go out there and compete hopefully theyll have some fun
7585853 hes still taking a class hes not on the team right now until he gets through the ncaa clearinghouse
7585854 i dont think its fair to compare players with other teams but ive been fortunate to have a lot of explosive players the last several years that certainly helps your dynamics of your offense if you have guys who are great in space or who can run away from people
7585855 i always tell them id rather tell you whoa than sick em those guys came out from the first practice going full speed and have not missed a rep this weekend hopefully theyve got their legs back under them im excited for them theyre going to have great careers here both of them well get a little more depth which we need at that position theyll play a lot of football
7585856 no not really i understand the question but for us to win michigan cant beat michigan we cant turn the ball over we cant make a lot of mental mistakes even though were going to make some especially the young guys we cant do the dumb things to beat ourselves
7585857 if youre more talented than everybody you play and all that you can screw around and do those things and still win were not there right now were not to the point where we can mess around and screw up and win the game
7585858 were going to have to execute keep the mistakes to a minimum whatever score that is that is
7585859 no you cant i dont want to lose any more players this week getting ready to play now we will bang on tuesday tuesday will be a physical practice well be in full pads and get after it pretty good we wont tackle to the ground but guys will fall on the ground
7585860 tuesday well get after it pretty good the other days the execution part will be full speed but we wont be hitting
7585861 im glad they want to be that but ive got to see it weve got to prove it i do think weve got a lot more experience defensively a lot more guys that have played theyve worked very hard and theyre in pretty good shape
7585862 i still think we have some things to work on defensively as well as offensively
7585863 our guys have to be in great shape when youre playing in open space and youre running a whole lot there are going to be a lot of guys that get winded at times
7585864 hes kind of like shaun king hes a little faster than shaun i think shaun wouldnt tell you that but hes very very competitive
7585865 he ran more before he dinged his shoulder up and then he didnt run as much for obvious reasons he can run and they have all that part of their offense weve got to be ready for that
7585866 knowing your assignment doing your job whatever your job is on that particular scheme youve got to do that job again tackle well in space against spread teams
7585867 whether its a running back or quarterback or wide receiver youve got to get guys to the ball if one guy does miss youve got to have two or three and the rest of the troops coming on
7585868 defined not by what they carry but by what they leave behind knowing that the environment will provide it

7585877 from societys perspective covering the uninsured is still a good investment failure to act in the near term will only make it more expensive to cover the uninsured in the future while adding to the amount of lost productivity from not insuring all americans
7585878 the uninsured receive a lot less care than the insured and they pay a greater percentage of it out of pocket contrary to popular myth they are not all free riders
7585879 adding the cost of the additional care to current spending by or for the uninsured total medical care costs for newly insured people will be about 208 6 billion roughly 3 800 per full year equivalent newly insured person consisting of 122 6 billion in new spending on top of the 86 billion already in the system

7585924 this is the most luminous and therefore probably the most massive cluster of galaxies discovered at this epoch
7585925 the light we observe started about 7 7 billion years ago this is about half of the age of the universe so it is from quite long ago and quite far away
7585926 the existence of the cluster can only be explained with dark energy
7585927 the fact that we do find these clusters is a clear confirmation of dark energy
7585928 this was a very long time ago and its actually about as massive as the most massive ones we observe today without dark energy we would observe much more massive clusters and many more of these massive clusters than we actually do

7585957 what the fuck are we all doing have we lost our fucking minds
7585958 1 some men came down from judea and began teaching the brethren
7585959 it is necessary to circumcise them and to direct them to observe the law of moses
7585960 turn back again to the weak and worthless elementary principles of the world
7585961 the judaizers false gospel was christ plus the law of moses grace plus works
7585962 he had purely and faithfully instructed them in the gospel but false apostles had entered during his absence and had corrupted the true seed by false and erroneous doctrines
7585963 it is no small evil to quench the light of the gospel to lay a snare for consciences
7585964 they worked within the framework of the christian church and claimed to be christians acknowledging jesus as messiah but while they professed to accept christ yet in theory and practice they tended to minimize and neutralize him they robbed christ of his uniqueness by putting other things on a level with him as necessary to salvation
7585965 we must trust christ for nothing or for all to trust him only for part is the essence of unbelief
7585966 the devil cannot but furiously impugn this doctrine neither can he rest so long as any spark of it remaineth
7585967 hence see the reason why the devil opposes the doctrine of grace so much and cares not though the law as a covenant be never so much preached up because it is the gospel doctrine that tends only to true godliness while the law and legal doctrines tend to keep men strangers to the life of god the devil cares not how much you be in duties providing you keep off from christ who is the end of the law for righteousness for then he knows you would be holy also but he is an unholy devil and therefore he opposes the gospel and its doctrine the devil knows that he hath fast hold of you so long as you cleave to the law but that he hath lost you if once you have laid hold on christ for if once you get christ for justification as having fulfilled the righteousness of the law for you then you will also get him for sanctification to fulfill the righteousness of the law in you the devil knows that though in seeming holiness you should be transformed to an angel of light like himself yet you lie under the heavy vengeance of god and curse of the law and under the power of sin too so long as you are under the law

7585996 actel is well positioned for revenue growth with its current product offering
7585997 actel has been attacking the low power low cost portion of the fpga market and this is where we are expecting most of the growth over the next three to five years actel gained market share in 2007 and we expect them to gain market share in 2008
7585998 even low power sram based fpgas draw on the order of ten times more power than specified for typical battery operated applications sram based fpgas also experience power surges at start up that drain batteries and can cause system initialization failures compounding the problem each process node shrink increases the static power consumption of transistor heavy sram based fpgas

7586101 i am really good at customer service i think that customer service is really important it is important that customers are served well and their needs are met i have done customer service training and want to continue to keep my skills up in this important area if customers dont get service they dont come back in my current role we always put the customer first
7586102 i am really good at customer service this is because i always go the extra mile to understand the customers needs and i try my hardest to meet their expectations for instance two weeks ago i had a customer come into our store who was complaining that her appliance had slipped i decided quickly that my task was to understand whether or not the customer had received our on site training in how to stop the appliance vibrating at the wrong time it turned out that she was unaware of this training service but indicated that she was willing to try the training before returning the appliance so i organised for our trainers to visit her later the very same day the result was her appliance stopped slipping and she wrote in praise of our helpful and prompt service this is a good illustration of my commitment to outstanding customer service

7586115 the bureaucrats trade unions are only one aspect of the states inefficiency the state is inefficient in the deep sense that it cannot generally satisfy and reconcile the diverse preferences of multiple individuals markets that is decentralized exchanges by individuals on the basis of private property rights are much more efficient
7586116 the bloated state under which we now labour cannot be efficient in most of what it does it is geared to redistribution that is stealing from paul to give to peter
7586117 real reform must be considered what the public health system needs is real competition from a variety of private organizations not from tightly regulated private subcontractors as junior partners let private initiatives free to compete with the public system it is because defenders of the status quo know that the bureaucrats couldnt win that they want so much to preserve the public sector monopoly

7586127 should not be taken out of the space time cultural context in which they were uttered
7586128 it is the means by which the interpreter mentally transfers himself into the context in which the author uttered the words this guards against the interpretive error of making the readers historical or cultural context the norm for understanding the text

7586222 after five years of writing on tech industry topics as well as personal ones and building an audience of 10 000 to 20 000 daily visitors calacanis said he got tired of all the nasty commenters and opportunistic link baiters people who post just to promote their own blogs
7586223 calacanis blogged to start conversations and be a part of a virtual community
7586224 but corporate bloggers are in it for other reasons talking directly to customers or giving a personal touch to a big business

7586234 its not as important for people to fall in love with the product as it is for them to know that browser security is becoming increasingly important with more than a third of attacks coming via the internet
7586235 i think what separates us though is that were a lot more paranoid if you will at the security level and i think this product will reflect that
7586236 ie is a trusted application and therefore a very common vector but because parts of its code are built into the os once you hack into ie you can do anything you want

7586238 so im happy to be part of this campaign i think obama will make a tremendous president and tremendous leader i saw that during the vice presidential process

7586245 well i used to work at a clam shack in marblehead called flynnies at the beach which doesnt exist anymore
7586246 but i fried clams and i brought calamari to the menu too because they werent doing calamari
7586247 i dont know what life would have been like without the fried clam so its kind of a mecca
7586248 you imagine the little fat bellies dropping into the oil start to salivate
7586249 actually 92 years ago my grandfather came up with the idea of putting some fried clams in his chip fryalator to deep fry em
7586250 and on july 4th big parade coming through he put a big sign out fried clams and sold 35 worth of product that day and thats the most he took in in any day of operation so he wasnt a stupid man so he kept them on the menu

7586628 so whats the deal with the belts turning on and off
7586629 its the one belt somebody ordered a shit ton of lube and the box broke open spilling the lube everywhere and it short circuited the whole damn thing
7586630 you listen to me and listen to me good janssen
7586631 i went down to the one belt myself because i didnt believe it either its a goddamn slip and slide of hotness down there the one belt is as lubed up as i wish my girlfriend was

7586645 the organic act is united states code 48 section 8a unfortunately article 14 of the united states constitution has never been amended to include citizenship of unincorporated territories because article 14 line 1 of the united states constitution states there are only two ways to be a united states citizen you are either born a citizen or you are naturalized you cannot be naturalized as a statutory citizen
7586646 the only true way for guam and the chamorro people to get united states true citizenship which means full protection and full constitutional rights is either guam becomes a state which is not going to happen because we do not have the population base and we are too far from the contiguous 48 states the only other way for us to get constitutional citizenship is to become registered as a native american tribe so that we as a people become incorporated to the united states and the indian naturalization act which would automatically naturalize us thereby making us legal constitutional citizens of the united states and affording us all protections and rights under the constitution of the untied states and making us eligible for all types of benefits as well as giving us additional constitutional rights because native americans enjoy more constitutional rights than regular americans

7586719 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
7586720 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7586721 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7586722 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7586723 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7586724 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7586725 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7586726 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7586727 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7586728 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7586729 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7586730 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7586731 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7586732 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
7586733 believes a woman is entitled to a dead body no matter what
7586734 you need to know that barack obama is a monster and a liar who would be very much at home in communist china where killing babies is an industry
7586735 believes so firmly in abortion he is so radical in his support for abortion and infanticide that he believes that if a woman chooses abortion shes entitled to a dead body no matter what
7586736 obama opposed bills that would have required medical attention be given to babies who somehow survived the killing fields of the abortion table and would have given the aborted baby legal rights
7586737 sen obamas embrace of text messaging reflects the groiwng popularity as a branding and marketing tool part of the allure texts have an immediacy that emails and phone calls dont

7586747 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it

7586811 no and you are right juliet is as dead as elvis
7586812 she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof
7586813 what was most galling was that there was nothing i could do this cruel disease takes its own course
7586814 i had to keep telling her the bad news over and over again

7586817 i know this will sound corny but the answer to all the problems is love of country
7586818 when the filipino people begin to think of country in terms of their bunso the youngest child in the family their grandchildren and great great grandchildren and their future then it will not be corny anymore
7586819 it would be na ve to think that there are no foreign interests at play in the signing of the moa
7586820 i can only hope that malaysia is a sincere broker for peace and has not trained its sights on the liguasan marsh referring to the moro stronghold in mindanao i also hope that the united states has no colonial interests in this part of the globe
7586821 we certainly dont want to happen to mindanao what happened to kosovo

7586831 anything that provides new insight and helps people study the bible is good

7586834 i do think you do lose something when you start demolishing any book of the bible
7586835 im not going to jump off the roof or anything like that
7586836 but id want to be quite careful in pitching this as a bible
7586837 they are constantly on the lookout for something new and different
7586838 their motive is to get closer to god and hear his message bible one bible two bible three bible four are all mechanisms to hear that message clearer
7586839 what we do here in publishing we do for the purpose of getting people into scripture to get into god
7586840 some of the things we do not everybody likes but thats ok
7586841 committing yourself to one job for a life time is a different notion for this generation
7586842 the young generation is not as attracted to the church as in previous generations
7586843 there was a need for one parish not to have a resident priest for a six month period for six months the priest will not live there new arrangements will be made once we complete our dialogues

7586945 you get to know people and get your foot in the door
7586946 youre dealing with an aspect of society thats not always pleasant
7586947 in srebrenica at the time we had to protect ourselves from the bosnian muslims rather than protect the muslims from the serbs
7586948 we talked about their possible testimony they stressed that the serbs did not commit war crimes against the muslim civilians when they were passing through several dozen of their villages in srebrenica municipality the dutch soldiers were securing they came over at their own expense and said they will testify and invite more of their fellow soldiers to testify too they left belgrade on thursday
7586949 they told me they came here in apprehension and worried because they expected to be hated in serbia just like back home they said in srebrenica at the time they had to protect themselves from the muslims rather than protect muslims from the serbs serb army according to them was helping the muslim women and their children bringing them food and water

7586951 i was a mess in some ways and that had nothing to do with my choice of career i was the luckiest girl in the world when i got the princess diaries films but all the driven behavior that you need to be successful as a teenager didnt help me when it came to my private life and social situations
7586952 so going to university helped me a lot i used to worry too much and take myself too seriously
7586953 a poisoned arrow thrown by the pope at you personally and it will be more than a miracle if it be not your irrevocable warrant of death
7586954 nor are things any better or circumstances calmer in america where some regions are so hostile to catholics that their governments seem to deny by their actions the catholic faith they claim to profess
7586955 cameron and a friend were involved in returning an injured dog to its owner
7586956 diaz brought the dog in her house and gave it some food and water
7586957 her assistant posted a found german shepherd sign and the dogs owner diazs neighbor who was driving around the area came across it
7586958 made time to visit the vet where the dog was being treated
7586959 a web 4 0 virtureal real entity with virtual representation environment that smashes through traditional flat 2 d web pages to create a 3 d personal internet experience that makes the web come alive

7586971 we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release in my opinion i dont think our title has any similarity or links with harry potter
7586972 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar warner bros values and protects intellectual property rights however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
7586973 michelle wrote her own stump speech and you know shes refining it now i think as were going into the general election
7586974 we have an opportunity for her to kind of step back and think about the message she wants to deliver so shes really working on it as we speak
7586975 some people will see confidence and others might see cockiness i think some people will see strength others might see arrogance
7586976 she comes across as someone who is extraordinarily independent and very much a force to be reckoned with
7586977 one comment made off hand might be easily misinterpreted by the opposition
7586978 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country
7586979 what i was clearly talking about is that i am proud in how americans are engaging in the political process
7586980 i mean everyone has said what i said in that we havent seen these record numbers of turnouts people who are paying attention going to rallies watching debates
7586981 i am proud of my country i dont know about you if you heard those words earlier i am very proud of my country
7586982 good preview of how republicans will attack michelle suggesting that she does not share american values mining a subtext of race
7586983 considering there are so many issues legitimate issues that you can use on barack obama to attack his wife to me is sheer utter stupidity of the highest level
7586984 mr obama is going to come to his wifes defense and its going to humanize both of them
7586985 there is less information about him to temper her comments against so what she says represents something a lot more important than perhaps other candidates in the past who have had a longer track record
7586986 were trusting that the american voters are ready to talk about the issues and not talking about things that have nothing to do with making peoples lives better
7586987 i also think these folks should lay off my wife
7586988 even though the beijing games have ended chinas opening up and exchanges with the world will not cease and the chinese peoples participation in the development and improvement of mankind will not change
7586989 i have to think twice about who i speak with about delicate issues because im afraid afterward theyll be arrested
7586990 of all the ways in which we tried to game out what rock bottom would look like even we would not have anticipated that two septuagenarians would be sentenced to re education through labor while the games were going on
7586991 as happy as we may be about the progress that was made the olympics have also created new human rights problems and that makes for a lousy balancing of accounts
7586992 but china has always been a big place for us to continue our work and of course well carry on
7586993 what interesting or out of the ordinary things have you ever done to get connected to the internet and or company network when working remotely
7586994 had to climb on my mothers roof once it was so fun i actually saw a naked neighbor girl
7586995 drove 15 miles away from old faithful geyser to achieve a complete internet connection due to static from geyser emissions energy
7586996 i went up to the top of a mountain and worked for a week from a tent
7586997 plugged into electricity from the city of seattle that was on a pole on the sidewalk but only for a few minutes
7586998 held my laptop out a window to get the wi fi next door so i could send an important email
7586999 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7587000 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7587001 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7587002 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7587003 it would have been the same way if i had won and barack was here supporting the unity of the party this was a hard fought campaign and there was a lot of intensity and passion associated with it in part because of the historic nature of our two candidacies
7587004 i dont know im doing everything i can possibly do and i think we have made a strong case
7587005 others feel an obligation to the people who sent them here that they were elected to represent
7587006 that however they decide to vote we will all be united behind senator obama
7587007 going with biden highlights the horns of the dilemma for senator obama he wanted someone who could reinforce his message of change but he needed someone with experience so he was forced into sacrificing one at the expense of the other
7587008 minutes after he was chosen as barack obamas vice presidential pick sen joseph biden d del revealed that he has begun writing a 50 000 word acceptance speech the address which mr biden has been working on around the clock is an abridged version of a 200 000 word acceptance speech that mr biden wrote when he ran for president in 1988
7587009 represented an opportunity to significantly boost the campaigns database of cellphone numbers especially among the young people sen obama is trying to court almost two thirds of people between the ages of 18 and 28 said they send or receive text messages monthly
7587010 the childrens crusade of early obama supporters will soon occupy the sweet spot of electoral politics and bring a new set of expectations to being courted and served
7587011 we also came away impressed by the dish network vip622s downconversion capability which is important for tv2 watchers and dvd archiving we recorded a few episodes of the sopranos from hbo hd to dvd and the downconverted standard def picture didnt have the issues weve noticed on some dvrs in fact it looked pretty good significantly better than the same episode on the standard def hbo2 channel in our experience the scientific atlanta 8300hd a common high def cable box does an inferior job downconverting hd shows to standard def
7587012 robotics shaped by and shaping the world in 2000 2050
7587013 we are after all democrats so it may take awhile
7587014 were not the fall in line party we are diverse but make no mistake we are unified
7587015 the beginning of power sharing not by consensus but by issue of the electoral weight
7587016 it gives them a significant amount of power to build the legislative assembly into a strong force for accountability one which is really going to force the executive mugabe to find a way to work with a parliament which may be led by hostile forces
7587017 work toward a professional parliament that will represent the true wishes of the people of zimbabwe

7587030 die spiele von peking waren perfekt organisiert und haben f r olympia 2012 die latte der erwartung sehr hoch gelegt f r die nachfolgenden generationen chinas haben die spiele ein wertvolles erbe geschaffen
7587031 olympia 2008 beweist die attraktivit t des sports es wurde die gr te zuschauerzahl seit beginn der olympischen spiele der neuzeit im jahre 1896 verzeichnet 20 prozent mehr zuschauer als vor vier jahren in athen
7587032 abschlussfeier unter zeitlicher beschr nkung gelitten hat und nicht so gut war wie die er ffnungszeremonie
7587033 die olympischen spiele haben den chinesen die chance geboten neu zu definieren was vaterlandsliebe ist
7587034 selbstbewu tsein gegen ber dem argumentationsstil der westlichen welt ist geboten gleichg ltig ob man lob oder kritik erntet china kann nicht immer alles akzeptieren
7587035 while the situation may in some respects have improved marginally over previous years china has fallen far short of its promises
7587036 even with the reporting regulations in place for the games there have been significant and systematic restrictions on media freedom at an absolute minimum china must extend the existing provisions and use this as the starting point for future reform
7587037 chinas constitution guarantees freedom of expression and until all media have the freedom to report without government interference this guarantee will remain hollow

7587117 at the establishment of our constitutions the judiciary bodies were supposed to be the most helpless and harmless members of the government experience however soon showed in what way they were to become the most dangerous that the insufficiency of the means provided for their removal gave them a freehold and irresponsibility in office that their decisions seeming to concern individual suitors only pass silent and unheeded by the public at large that these decisions nevertheless become law by precedent sapping by little and little the foundations of the constitution and working its change by construction before any one has perceived that that invisible and helpless worm has been busily employed in consuming its substance in truth man is not made to be trusted for life if secured against all liability to account

7587195 there are people who keep snakes because theyre fascinated with them and most of them do it responsibly
7587196 but there are a few people who want these snakes because they saw one on television or they want to show off by having a dangerous snake theyre a small minority
7587197 because they get themselves bitten or they break the law
7587198 theres definitely a profit motive because they can sell these animals for lots of money
7587199 what concerns us is that our ecosystem is so fragile that a wholesale unrestricted commerce in snakes could drive some of these species into extinction
7587200 we deal with people that are obsessed with having something whether its the only one the last one or the rarest one
7587201 thats why we have laws that limit how many snakes you can take out of the wild
7587202 i consult on snakebites all over the country and we get lots of calls after midnight
7587203 that means the person was bitten an hour or two earlier why were they working the snake that late at night because they werent responsible keepers and they werent smart enough to have their own snakebite antidote

7587254 in medicine it is necessary to have two important qualities as a doctor the first is that you not be disgusted by anything involving the human body

7587256 come on i know where the tractor beam controls are
7587257 i dont know but this was not what did it
7587258 rekani and i turned this off last time we were here
7587259 then they started to blast at us the first shot missed and hit here
7587260 so what are the odds that we would wind up on the same cruiser that we were
7587261 i dont think he is going to let us leave unless we go to him first
7587262 to make your trip easier come to the main terminal
7587263 i know but i doubt i will get through to him something seems a little out of the ordinary with him something beyond just him
7587264 but youve seen his life through his eyes you know him better than anyone else will
7587265 guess what two guests i have coming to visit me
7587266 why must you keep putting them through such torture they are still very young
7587267 i was still just a small child when you people came and took my family from me when you came and destroyed every last one of my race i am all that is left i have nothing to lose and everything to gain revenge for my parents is all that i have to live for young has nothing to do with anything anymore you are all the same in my eyes worthless
7587268 we have students that slip to the dark powers that are around us and we can no longer control their actions it was my padawan that turned his back to us and joined someone that taught him to feel nothing for life and everything for power not us we do not condone to the slaughter of innocent people and that is why we fight your fighters as we speak if you would stop we would stop but if you dont we must fight to protect these people that you are killing for no reason
7587269 none of these people are innocent not a single soul is innocent of every crime why protect these people if no one is innocent kai was your student you taught him you taught him to fight you taught him to feel you taught him to use his powers and yet you failed because of your failure he took his pain and suffering out on my race if you would have succeeded in teaching him i would not be here
7587270 even if i succeeded in teaching him someone else would have fallen for thorins tricks
7587271 someone else would have gone with him to your planet and someone else would have possibly succeeded in killing you so you have to be grateful for your own life not constantly grieve for others i have done the same for many years and it has done only harm to all around me
7587272 grateful for what i am disfigured for the rest of my life and my family and my entire race no longer exist i see nothing to be grateful for until i am done exacting my revenge then i will be grateful that i rid the galaxy of such lifeless killers
7587273 why do you refuse to not listen to anything i have to say
7587274 but im not getting any other response out of him
7587275 well i have some good news and some bad news
7587276 the good news is that i found a way to get back without having to go through the battlefield again
7587277 the way is to circle the moon and enter the atmosphere there and then fly under the radar back to the temple
7587278 and even then we might still get caught up within the battle a bit before we can land the computer is picking up activity within the clouds above the temple and town so i cannot guarantee that we wont run into any sarakoth
7587279 im not sure if we should take the long way back
7587280 rekani is not showing any signs that he is still completely with us and if we dont get him help quick he may never come back
7587281 we have no way to defend ourselves this time at all the sarakoth have complete control of the space above yavin 4 and i am seeing no signs of satirez and paj either
7587282 well i cant be sure because they were in one of their fighters
7587283 all i can see are sarakoth fighters attacking the innocent civilians and the defenders of the temple below i dont see any of them attacking each other
7587284 they could still be trying to stay under the radar themselves but when we left them they were being attacked
7587285 satirez and paj are fine theyve gone through plenty of training they know how to take care of themselves
7587286 you have to take in the possibility that they could have
7587287 i believe in them and you should too they are your friends dont you dare say they are dead because i know better
7587288 keep an eye on her im going to get us back to the temple
7587289 you were trying to fan her help me lift her to the table
7587290 youre best bet is to go around the battle her fever will break on its own we dont need to get ourselves into danger yet again
7587291 what do you mean you were not referring to junior
7587292 she is only early in her term but yes she is carrying our child
7587293 im surprised you didnt notice that you can feel the child in her
7587294 i guess because of how much ive been around you two it slow snuck by me
7587295 remember weve been trying to hide our relationship for the longest time and now that that is out in the open it was only a matter of time before we announced the child
7587296 how did we miss them we only just walked by there
7587297 that is sounding like a good plan right about now
7587298 remember i was already here and you guys carried me out
7587299 well he better get around to springing it because i didnt run all this way to disappointed
7587300 today i take my revenge on all the jedi in my parents name today i get to watch as my soldiers take from you what you took from me today i get to play god and take all life from your hands today is my day to become full again
7587301 so youve been the one behind this whole thing i find you pathetic
7587302 from the stuff toy you had sitting in your room to the jedi you killed and sent to yavin to the manipulation of the sarakoth to the point that you are having them fight this war for you you cant do anything yourself and instead you have ever one and everything around you do it for you
7587303 who do you think was showing you all those visions
7587304 premonitions nightmares i fed them all to you i wanted at least one of you to know my story and to see that i am not willing to hear such lies as your leader is willing to tell me i plan on wiping the universe clean of all the jedi so that no one else has to feel the pain i went through everyone will be safer without the existence of all of you
7587305 so you are killing innocent civilians to make a safer place for the innocent because that is showing how great your ruling is going to be
7587306 if we were to let them live they would have warned you of our approach our surprise left you defenseless and we will finish this with very little casualty of our own
7587307 necessary what about the people that are trapped in the battle you started and still continue outside
7587308 you wont be able to get close enough before ill have you in as much pain as your friend
7587309 this is exactly the point i was trying to make earlier
7587310 my body has been basically destroyed all i have left is this machine and because of the sarakoths vismortian bacteria and this machine allow me to stay alive and they even boost my power i dont have to do anything myself anymore

7587321 despite a nationwide clamor against illegal immigration only 55 of more than 18 000 police and law enforcement agencies across the country have signed agreements to coordinate with u s immigration and customs enforcement
7587322 in a series of changes this year direct supervisors are being encouraged to forgo suspensions of officers who they believe will change their behavior or just made a one time mistake and instead opt for written warnings
7587323 police officials believe the shift could turn around a department forcing officers to think about their actions instead of automatically being suspended and often getting paid for those days by a union insurance policy

7587388 we zijn onlangs begonnen met het nemen van juridische stappen tegen partijen die betrokken zijn bij de productie van de film getiteld hari puttar warner bros hecht sterk aan copyright en intellectueel eigendom echter het is ook onze policy om niet uit te wijden over rechtszaken die nog lopen
7587389 wij hebben de hari puttar titel al in 2005 geregistreerd het is dan ook erg jammer dat warner bros pas nu besluit bezwaar te maken zo dicht bij de release van onze film naar mijn mening zijn er geen overeenkomsten tussen onze film en de harry potter serie
7587390 in true speakeasy fashion we will have a small featured cocktail list a delicious array of spirits to enjoy and live jazz
7587391 are crime scene photos where children are being subjected to sexual abuse
7587392 if i were to take a woman to a hotel room commit rape and take a picture no one would call that pornography
7587393 but over the past nine years the whole attitude to the problem has become very antagonistic theres little interest politically and publicly in providing proper treatment facilities it has done such disservice to children
7587394 it was 8am on a monday over a year ago when suddenly there were all these voices in my house i thought they were jehovahs witnesses at first then they said they were the police they didnt tell me why they were there for ages but they knew things about my children their names and what they were doing i got more and more scared i dont think ive ever shaken so badly then they showed me the search warrant i couldnt believe my eyes the words indecent images of children i was in shock and had no inkling of what my partner was doing yet at the same time i had a sort of sudden understanding of why he hadnt been easy to live with for so long i had to send the police off to the business we run to arrest him i thought thats the end of my world the first thing he said when he was arrested was im going to have to commit suicide thats the first thing i thought hed do when i read the search warrant ive known him for 20 years i knew what hed think meanwhile they searched the house took away any computer materials the senior policewoman came with me to wake my teenage daughter i told her what had happened she didnt take it in then we went to the school my other daughters were taken into a room one by one with me and their older sister and the police and told what had happened they were devastated then without me they were questioned about their relationship with their father it was devastating that their dad had this interest and also that someone might think he was doing that to them which was not the case they chewed us up and spat out how do you deal with it we did lots of talking we were all sitting on a bed that night and someone thought of dad all on his own and we sent him a text saying we loved and supported him and were there for him he didnt come home he could have but didnt it was better that we had some space we spoke on the phone the next night it was dreadful hes such a kind hearted person and he felt strongly that he wanted his children to have a childhood yet it didnt occur to him that he was taking away someone elses ive always thought the people doing these things were monsters but i cant think that any more because this does not define him he has a heartfelt desire to deal with the problem and it is something he has to atone for he got a non custodial sentence but this has tainted him forever i feel tainted forever i didnt tell anyone for an awfully long time my mother and siblings dont know i did tell a few friends but aside from one couple who stood by both of us they support me but not him i dont blame them but it upsets me it doesnt work unless they support all of us im an open person but i cant communicate with people in the way i used to there is always this black cloud that i cant tell anyone about i feel sad about it but i made the choice for my family to have as normal a future as possible and for my future and his to be as normal as possible wed been together for years but actually got married after this happened just our daughters were present we realised our family was the most important thing in our life and as a couple we have a lot of work to do but that has to come after he has done the work on himself first if i didnt have absolute confidence that in his heart he wants to overcome this i couldnt do it none of us view his arrest as anything but positive because it is really the only route out he needed help to stop i know that he tried to stop himself at least once because actions he took which didnt make sense at the time now fall into place but how could anybody with three daughters addicted to illegal activities of this nature and on whom the entire family was financially dependent ever admit what he was doing
7587395 when my husband and i were first arrested we were about to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary so i thought i knew him
7587396 the police came to our door on a winters morning just after 6am arrested my husband and took away the hard drive of our computer
7587397 i never looked at child pornography it said on the website that these were artistic images
7587398 normally i would give a player like leodis a 2 nd round grade because he still has a lot to learn and his confidence is shaky but the fact that this kid can come in and impact on special teams while he gains his confidence is a big plus and pushes his lti into a first round talent grade right now im not totally convinced he has the hands to make interceptions that would make him a top cb in the nfl he reminds me a lot of antoine winfield cb minnesota vikings only bigger antoine has had a good career but it could have been even better if he had the ability to intercept the ball and gain turnovers for his team leodis can be better than antoine if he can continues to return kicks and punts at the next level without fumbling and intercept the ball when he is in coverage there is no doubt about leodis athletic talents but his mental make up is shaky he looks a little squirrelly in coverage he takes a lot of false steps when covering one on one his bump and run techniques need to be worked on and he can be intimidated into making mistakes that being said leodis should be an outstanding cb in the nfl and should move up the charts the more he works out so lets sum this up leodis has the raw talent to be an impact cover corner with strong tackling skills that can also impact on special teams and looks to be of good character that equates to a first round talent grade in my book
7587399 warner bros heeft het plan om een film met meerdere superhelden zoals superman vs batman even in de ijskast te zetten superman returns uit 2006 was ons een beetje tegengevallen de film deed het maar matig aan de kassas red de personages zijn daardoor niet zo in de markt gezet als wij hadden gepland als de film wel had gewerkt waren we nu bezig geweest met een vervolg dat dit jaar met kerst of volgend jaar in de bioscopen zou verschijnen nu is het plan om superman opnieuw te introduceren zonder daarbij nog te denken aan een superman batman crossover
7587400 these are genuine documents nobody can challenge you just give me your photographs and choose a name in four weeks youll have a new identity
7587401 because bulgarias in the european community you have full rights in this country you can live here legally take advantage of the free nhs everything and no one can stop you travelling
7587402 he said its easy to find buyers especially on fridays at the main jumma prayers when the mosque is packed he then handed me a passport and asked me to deliver to a bangladeshi whos here illegally
7587403 i was so furious i came straight to the news of the world not only is it against our religion to commit fraud these documents could be used by extremists
7587404 i can help we can make as many passports as you want
7587405 these are 100 per cent genuine passports i know a bulgarian who has a connection in the home office over there thats how i get them i charge 2 500 but as you will want more i can do them for 2 000 a piece
7587406 the word twat was used in context it was meant to be a nasty word on purpose because this is a nasty character
7587407 cant you just take care of all this usability stuff by following some simple rules

7587413 the dogs had been running around the farm i suspect that they had been dumped
7587414 they were in bad order they were starving and covered in fleas and mange
7587415 the bitch in particular was severely suffering she had no hair at all
7587416 they wouldnt have survived much longer if they hadnt been found
7587417 we need to determine whether or not they were used for fighting to determine whether or not they can be re homed
7587418 if they are fighters unless the can be rehabilitated they would have to be put down we couldnt take the risk that they would be re homed and then maul a child or attack other dogs
7587419 their skin is infected swollen and raw and so the dogs are very distressed its a very painful condition
7587420 the state these dogs are in is through sheer neglect if it is treated early it is not too much of a problem its going to take a long time to treat now but they are getting plenty of tlc from the staff
7587421 english bull terriers are not common and we believe someone in the area will have seen the dogs running around and may know who the owner is because we believe these dogs have been neglected and we would like to find anyone in the area who has seen them
7587422 this is a criminal offence under the animal health and welfare act 2006 there is a duty of care for anyone looking after an animal
7587423 10 then said jesus unto them be not afraid go tell my brethren that they go into galilee and there shall they see me
7587424 16 then the eleven disciples went away into galilee into a mountain where jesus had appointed them 17 and when they saw him they worshipped him but some doubted
7587425 19 then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews came jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you 20 and when he had so said he shewed unto them his hands and his side then were the disciples glad when they saw the lord
7587426 24 but thomas one of the twelve called didymus was not with them when jesus came 25 the other disciples therefore said unto him we have seen the lord but he said unto them except i shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side i will not believe 26 and after eight days again his disciples were within and thomas with them then came jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said peace be unto you 27 then saith he to thomas reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing 28 and thomas answered and said unto him my lord and my god 29 jesus saith unto him thomas because thou hast seen me thou hast believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed
7587427 22 who is gone into heaven and is on the right hand of god angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him
7587428 20 which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places 21 far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come 22 and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church 23 which is his body the fulness of him that filleth all in all
7587429 5 and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood
7587430 1 why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing 2 the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the lord and against his anointed saying 3 let us break their bands asunder and cast away their cords from us 4 he that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh the lord shall have them in derision 5 then shall he speak unto them in his wrath and vex them in his sore displeasure 6 yet have i set my king upon my holy hill of zion 7 i will declare the decree the lord hath said unto me thou art my son this day have i begotten thee 8 ask of me and i shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession 9 thou shalt break them with a rod of iron thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potters vessel 10 be wise now therefore o ye kings be instructed ye judges of the earth 11 serve the lord with fear and rejoice with trembling 12 kiss the son lest he be angry and ye perish from the way when his wrath is kindled but a little blessed are all they that put their trust in him
7587431 1 the lord said unto my lord sit thou at my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool 2 the lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of zion rule thou in the midst of thine enemies 3 thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning thou hast the dew of thy youth 4 the lord hath sworn and will not repent thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek 5 the lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath 6 he shall judge among the heathen he shall fill the places with the dead bodies he shall wound the heads over many countries
7587432 36 therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made the same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ
7587433 46 and why call ye me lord lord and do not the things which i say
7587434 28 come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest 29 take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls 30 for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
7587435 38 then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
7587436 16 and now why tarriest thou arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins calling on the name of the lord
7587437 35 then philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him jesus 36 and as they went on their way they came unto a certain water and the eunuch said see here is water what doth hinder me to be baptized 37 and philip said if thou believest with all thine heart thou mayest and he answered and said i believe that jesus christ is the son of god 38 and he commanded the chariot to stand still and they went down both into the water both philip and the eunuch and he baptized him
7587438 47 can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which have received the holy ghost as well as we 48 and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the lord then prayed they him to tarry certain days
7587439 11 in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of christ 12 buried with him in baptism wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of god who hath raised him from the dead
7587440 41 then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls 42 and they continued stedfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers
7587441 8 but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judaea and in samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth
7587442 5 these twelve jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go not into the way of the gentiles and into any city of the samaritans enter ye not 6 but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel
7587443 11 wherefore remember that ye being in time past gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands 12 that at that time ye were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in the world 13 but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of christ 14 for he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us 15 having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of twain one new man so making peace 16 and that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby 17 and came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were nigh 18 for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father 19 now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellowcitizens with the saints and of the household of god 20 and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief corner stone 21 in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the lord 22 in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of god through the spirit
7587444 18 i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you 19 yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because i live ye shall live also 20 at that day ye shall know that i am in my father and ye in me and i in you 21 he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him 22 judas saith unto him not iscariot lord how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world 23 jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him
7587445 5 there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee
7587446 10 fear thou not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee yea i will help thee yea i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness
7587447 5 let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as ye have for he hath said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee 6 so that we may boldly say the lord is my helper and i will not fear what man shall do unto me
7587448 39 the enemy that sowed them is the devil the harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels 40 as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world 41 the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity 42 and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth 43 then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father who hath ears to hear let him hear
7587449 49 so shall it be at the end of the world the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just
7587450 9 and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight 10 and while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel 11 which also said ye men of galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven this same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven
7587451 11 now when they were going behold some of the watch came into the city and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done 12 and when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel they gave large money unto the soldiers 13 saying say ye his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept 14 and if this come to the governors ears we will persuade him and secure you 15 so they took the money and did as they were taught and this saying is commonly reported among the jews until this day
7587452 62 now the next day that followed the day of the preparation the chief priests and pharisees came together unto pilate 63 saying sir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days i will rise again 64 command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and say unto the people he is risen from the dead so the last error shall be worse than the first 65 pilate said unto them ye have a watch go your way make it as sure as ye can 66 so they went and made the sepulchre sure sealing the stone and setting a watch
7587453 61 and there was mary magdalene and the other mary sitting over against the sepulchre
7587454 1 and as they spake unto the people the priests and the captain of the temple and the sadducees came upon them 2 being grieved that they taught the people and preached through jesus the resurrection from the dead
7587455 43 joseph of arimathaea an honourable counsellor which also waited for the kingdom of god came and went in boldly unto pilate and craved the body of jesus 44 and pilate marvelled if he were already dead and calling unto him the centurion he asked him whether he had been any while dead 45 and when he knew it of the centurion he gave the body to joseph
7587456 24 but thomas one of the twelve called didymus was not with them when jesus came 25 the other disciples therefore said unto him we have seen the lord but he said unto them except i shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side i will not believe
7587457 26 and after eight days again his disciples were within and thomas with them then came jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said peace be unto you 27 then saith he to thomas reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing
7587458 19 then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews came jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you
7587459 36 and as they thus spake jesus himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them peace be unto you 37 but they were terrified and affrighted and supposed that they had seen a spirit 38 and he said unto them why are ye troubled and why do thoughts arise in your hearts 39 behold my hands and my feet that it is i myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have 40 and when he had thus spoken he shewed them his hands and his feet 41 and while they yet believed not for joy and wondered he said unto them have ye here any meat 42 and they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and of an honeycomb 43 and he took it and did eat before them
7587460 39 and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the jews and in jerusalem whom they slew and hanged on a tree 40 him god raised up the third day and shewed him openly 41 not to all the people but unto witnesses chosen before god even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead
7587461 12 now if christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead 13 but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is christ not risen 14 and if christ be not risen then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain 15 yea and we are found false witnesses of god because we have testified of god that he raised up christ whom he raised not up if so be that the dead rise not 16 for if the dead rise not then is not christ raised 17 and if christ be not raised your faith is vain ye are yet in your sins 18 then they also which are fallen asleep in christ are perished 19 if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men most miserable 20 but now is christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept 21 for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead 22 for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive 23 but every man in his own order christ the firstfruits afterward they that are christs at his coming 24 then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power 25 for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet 27 for he hath put all things under his feet but when he saith all things are put under him it is manifest that he is excepted which did put all things under him 28 and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that god may be all in all 29 else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead if the dead rise not at all why are they then baptized for the dead 31 i protest by your rejoicing which i have in christ jesus our lord i die daily 32 if after the manner of men i have fought with beasts at ephesus what advantageth it me if the dead rise not let us eat and drink for to morrow we die 33 be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners 34 awake to righteousness and sin not for some have not the knowledge of god i speak this to your shame 35 but some man will say how are the dead raised up and with what body do they come 36 thou fool that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die 37 and that which thou sowest thou sowest not that body that shall be but bare grain it may chance of wheat or of some other grain 38 but god giveth it a body as it hath pleased him and to every seed his own body 39 all flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of flesh of men another flesh of beasts another of fishes and another of birds 40 there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another 41 there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for one star differeth from another star in glory 42 so also is the resurrection of the dead it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption 43 it is sown in dishonour it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power 44 it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body 45 and so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul the last adam was made a quickening spirit 46 howbeit that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual 47 the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the lord from heaven 48 as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly 49 and as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly 50 now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither doth corruption inherit incorruption 51 behold i shew you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed 52 in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed 53 for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality 54 so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory 55 o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory 56 the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law 57 but thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ 58 therefore my beloved brethren be ye stedfast unmoveable always abounding in the work of the lord forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the lord
7587462 30 and many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book 31 but these are written that ye might believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that believing ye might have life through his name

7587501 1 in the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre 2 and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it 3 his countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow 4 and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead men 5 and the angel answered and said unto the women fear not ye for i know that ye seek jesus which was crucified 6 he is not here for he is risen as he said come see the place where the lord lay 7 and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him lo i have told you 8 and they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy and did run to bring his disciples word 9 and as they went to tell his disciples behold jesus met them saying all hail and they came and held him by the feet and worshipped him 10 then said jesus unto them be not afraid go tell my brethren that they go into galilee and there shall they see me
7587502 9 and as they went to tell his disciples behold jesus met them saying all hail and they came and held him by the feet and worshipped him 10 then said jesus unto them be not afraid go tell my brethren that they go into galilee and there shall they see me
7587503 4 and declared to be the son of god with power according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead
7587504 18 and jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth
7587505 21 from that time forth began jesus to shew unto his disciples how that he must go unto jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day
7587506 17 and jesus going up to jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way and said unto them 18 behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death 19 and shall deliver him to the gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify him and the third day he shall rise again
7587507 28 then said jesus unto them when ye have lifted up the son of man then shall ye know that i am he and that i do nothing of myself but as my father hath taught me i speak these things 29 and he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me alone for i do always those things that please him
7587508 28 for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins
7587509 10 the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy i am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly
7587510 28 marvel not at this for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice 29 and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation
7587511 14 and if christ be not risen then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain
7587512 19 if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men most miserable
7587513 11 in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of christ 12 buried with him in baptism wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of god who hath raised him from the dead
7587514 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you 12 therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh 13 for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live
7587515 7 for none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself 8 for whether we live we live unto the lord and whether we die we die unto the lord whether we live therefore or die we are the lords

7587559 1 in the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre 2 and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it 3 his countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow 4 and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead men 5 and the angel answered and said unto the women fear not ye for i know that ye seek jesus which was crucified 6 he is not here for he is risen as he said come see the place where the lord lay 7 and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him lo i have told you 8 and they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy and did run to bring his disciples word 9 and as they went to tell his disciples behold jesus met them saying all hail and they came and held him by the feet and worshipped him 10 then said jesus unto them be not afraid go tell my brethren that they go into galilee and there shall they see me
7587560 30 and many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book 31 but these are written that ye might believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that believing ye might have life through his name
7587561 27 and ye also shall bear witness because ye have been with me from the beginning
7587562 8 but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judaea and in samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth
7587563 22 beginning from the baptism of john unto that same day that he was taken up from us must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection
7587564 32 this jesus hath god raised up whereof we all are witnesses
7587565 15 and killed the prince of life whom god hath raised from the dead whereof we are witnesses
7587566 33 and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus and great grace was upon them all
7587567 39 and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the jews and in jerusalem whom they slew and hanged on a tree 40 him god raised up the third day and shewed him openly 41 not to all the people but unto witnesses chosen before god even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead
7587568 3 for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures 4 and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures 6 after that he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once of whom the greater part remain unto this present but some are fallen asleep 7 after that he was seen of james then of all the apostles 8 and last of all he was seen of me also as of one born out of due time
7587569 34 saying the lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to simon
7587570 36 and as they thus spake jesus himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them peace be unto you 37 but they were terrified and affrighted and supposed that they had seen a spirit 38 and he said unto them why are ye troubled and why do thoughts arise in your hearts 39 behold my hands and my feet that it is i myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have 40 and when he had thus spoken he shewed them his hands and his feet 41 and while they yet believed not for joy and wondered he said unto them have ye here any meat 42 and they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and of an honeycomb 43 and he took it and did eat before them
7587571 2 until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen 3 to whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god
7587572 16 then the eleven disciples went away into galilee into a mountain where jesus had appointed them 17 and when they saw him they worshipped him but some doubted
7587573 6 and it came to pass that as i made my journey and was come nigh unto damascus about noon suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me 7 and i fell unto the ground and heard a voice saying unto me saul saul why persecutest thou me 8 and i answered who art thou lord and he said unto me i am jesus of nazareth whom thou persecutest 9 and they that were with me saw indeed the light and were afraid but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me 10 and i said what shall i do lord and the lord said unto me arise and go into damascus and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do
7587574 9 now when jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils
7587575 14 and when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw jesus standing and knew not that it was jesus
7587576 10 then said jesus unto them be not afraid go tell my brethren that they go into galilee and there shall they see me
7587577 3 to whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god 4 and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me 5 for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence 6 when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying lord wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel 7 and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power 8 but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judaea and in samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth 9 and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight 10 and while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel 11 which also said ye men of galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven this same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven 12 then returned they unto jerusalem from the mount called olivet which is from jerusalem a sabbath days journey
7587578 3 his brethren therefore said unto him depart hence and go into judaea that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest 4 for there is no man that doeth any thing in secret and he himself seeketh to be known openly if thou do these things shew thyself to the world 5 for neither did his brethren believe in him
7587579 21 and when his friends heard of it they went out to lay hold on him for they said he is beside himself
7587580 24 but thomas one of the twelve called didymus was not with them when jesus came 25 the other disciples therefore said unto him we have seen the lord but he said unto them except i shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side i will not believe
7587581 3 to whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god
7587582 27 and there followed him a great company of people and of women which also bewailed and lamented him
7587583 52 and they worshipped him and returned to jerusalem with great joy 53 and were continually in the temple praising and blessing god amen
7587584 28 saying did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name and behold ye have filled jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this mans blood upon us 29 then peter and the other apostles answered and said we ought to obey god rather than men 30 the god of our fathers raised up jesus whom ye slew and hanged on a tree 31 him hath god exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a saviour for to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins 32 and we are his witnesses of these things and so is also the holy ghost whom god hath given to them that obey him
7587585 41 and they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name 42 and daily in the temple and in every house they ceased not to teach and preach jesus christ
7587586 if the disciples were totally disappointed and on the verge of desperate flight because of the very real reason of the crucifixion it took another very real reason in order to transform them from a band of disheartened and dejected jews into the most self confident missionary society in world history
7587587 1 furthermore then we beseech you brethren and exhort you by the lord jesus that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please god so ye would abound more and more 2 for ye know what commandments we gave you by the lord jesus 3 for this is the will of god even your sanctification that ye should abstain from fornication 4 that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour 5 not in the lust of concupiscence even as the gentiles which know not god 6 that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter because that the lord is the avenger of all such as we also have forewarned you and testified 7 for god hath not called us unto uncleanness but unto holiness
7587588 25 wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbour for we are members one of another
7587589 14 and if christ be not risen then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain 15 yea and we are found false witnesses of god because we have testified of god that he raised up christ whom he raised not up if so be that the dead rise not

7587895 a lower corporate tax rate would encourage multinational corporations to invest more in the united states and for a given amount of investment to report a larger share of their worldwide taxable income to the united states instead of foreign treasuries
7587896 the positive effects of lower tax rates will be offset by the costs of increased government debt
7587897 the real cost of government is measured by what government spends not by the receipts labeled taxes
7587898 part of what has happened is that those who are able to work the stock market and amass huge fortunes on capital gains are paying a lower tax rate than their secretaries thats not fair
7587899 i am not going to comment on the politics of it

7587934 oy what are you doing in there dont you know that caves are dark and dangerous places to be avoided at all costs youd get out of there if you knew what was good for you
7587935 its not dark when you have a flashlight its actually quite bright in here its not dangerous either so long as you have a light source
7587936 are you mad caves are dark and dangerous didnt you hear about barley chriggs he went into a cave and got himself killed do you want to be killed just like him
7587937 barley chriggs didnt have a light source though did he
7587938 thats not the point the point is that he entered that dark cave and he died and so will you
7587939 not likely like i said its not dark in here when you have a light and barley didnt have a light so ill be fine
7587940 no you wont you are going to die because caves are dark and so many people not just barely have been just as deceived as you currently are you need to get out of that cave
7587941 deceived am i why dont you come down into the cave and show me why its so dangerous and dark when you have a light source it is not dark and not dangerous like you claim
7587942 im not going down there with you flaming madman thats where barley chriggs went and im nothing like that raving lunatic but i can see you are utterly deceived if you think its not dark and dangerous down there therefore i want nothing to do with you
7587943 nothing to do with me aye what are you going on about youre standing on the outside of the cave telling me that the cave is dark and dangerous while im standing in the cave and can clearly see that it is bright because of my light source and clearly not dangerous are you having a laugh
7587944 the only laugh im having is that you are so completely deceived that you actually think it is bright down there you are a raving looney
7587945 well im standing here looking at the brightness of the cave because of my light source why would i lie about that it makes no sense
7587946 you make no sense because you are deceived sooner or later you are going to drag more people into the cave with you is that honestly what you want to have a bunch of people lost or dead because of your tomfoolery
7587947 if people want to come into the cave then i see no problem with that so long as they bring a light source its actually quite safe if you have a light come and see
7587948 what it is safe and bright if you disagree then please come show me how it is dark and dangerous
7587949 pressures should ease in the coming months as commodity prices fall and the economy slows
7587950 in july they said that the market s spirit would return when the olympics came what spirit is that now we are all dead and have no spirit left in the market
7587951 recent data suggested that the slowdown has taken a firmer hold of the economy and the olympics may present some downside risks
7587952 the deceleration in export growth was the main reason for the slowdown in industrial output
7587953 eight percent growth in china is equivalent to a recession below nine percent would make the authorities quite nervous
7587954 if growth goes lower than 8 the government will be very worried
7587955 concerns over china s export health will translate into a complete reversal of the current tightening of policy

7587957 external demand will continue to weaken and the negative impact on exports economic growth and employment will emerge further
7587958 place a higher priority on containing price rises and curbing inflation and implement a tight monetary policy
7587959 the top leadership is carefully considering an economic stimulus package
7587960 this will include tax cuts and measures to stabilize domestic capital markets and support healthy development of the housing market
7587961 targeted pro growth policies widely expected from the government in the second half will have a countervailing positive impact on fai

7588031 but it turns out pollution in southern greenland was higher 100 years ago when north american and european economies ran on coal before the advent of cleaner more efficient coal burning technologies and the switch to oil and gas based economies

7588055 the foundation for effective decision making is driven by the technology of the implementation in addition continuous refactoring is integral to agile and since the product owner owns the backlog prioritizing refactors vs value stories is a critical skill that requires a technical foundation
7588056 i want to expand a bit on the concept of trust agile forces a very interesting and powerful change with the product mgt and development relationship for years its always been the same story pm asks for too much and development delivers too little its been a conflict since the beginning of time and its always the other persons fault for the context of this post i am going to declare one big assumption that the product owner is properly skilled and has all the leadership characteristics listed above the one i will add is that they should be a natural leader more than anyone else i believe the product is the person most responsible for keeping the team focused motivated and engaged a good product owner changes the conflict mentioned above completely their alliance is with the team and as a result the conflict switches from pm vs development to pm vs po the po is the person responsible for ensuring product management is happy with the results i have seen numerous situations where the po has passionately defended the teams performance its a wonderful thing the product owner is also responsible for fostering and maintaining a solid relationship with the pm if this doesnt happen it will create significant issues because ultimately the true stakeholders will start to question the ability for agile to deliver better results the po becomes the bridge between pm and development the po understands with specificity what it takes to develop sw as a result of this shift in conflict i personally believe all pos should report under the product management organization and not under development nothing changes from what dean posts above its all still critical the po should be collocated the pos alliance is with the team however the dotted line or direct line relationship to the pm creates a needed balance of power

7588067 riccione vive della bellezza del divertimento dello svago e il dna di veline quello di riccione
7588068 noi cerchiamo di promuovere il cosiddetto riccione life style veline si trova perfettamente al nostro fianco a questo progetto e quando abbiamo saputo che sarebbe stato ezio greggio a presentare abbiamo avuto lunanime consenso di tutti i cittadini dai bambini agli anziani
7588069 parla gi da sindaco ho bellissimi ricordi di riccione e delle citt limitrofe e quindi ci torno molto volentieri che in effetti si vede che sia stata rinfrescata e rinnovata
7588070 per me un grande piacere debuttare qui a veline che in un certo senso la cugina di striscia nellanno dei 20 anni
7588071 le ragazze che partecipano vengono semplicemente per passare una serata con gli amici ricordo elena barolo che era stata iscritta dai suoi amici si trovata coinvolta e alla fine quando ha vinto non sapeva se fare la velina molte delle veline che partecipano vogliono fare le giornaliste anche perch le stesse ormai sono scelte con un criterio da velina ovvero devono apparire bene in video
7588072 il significato di veline nella sigla che si intitola specchietti e soprattutto nella parte finale in dialetto genovese che cita l o can du leccia come veline vengono identificate nel loro esibizionismo per me veline sono anche tutti i politici che vanno a ballar a porta a porta o matrix e che non hanno niente da dire se non apparire e farsi vedere anche loro si mettono nella vetrina della tv per un appagamento del loro ego e il detto genovese liscrizione tombale su questo narcisismo o can de leccia in dialetto ligure colui che lo prende in quel posto ma dice che fa tuttaltro un amore che non va verso gli altri ma ripiegato talmente su se stesso fino alla sodomia
7588073 mammucari in questi giorni ha avuto una figlia da thais che poi faremo vedere nella prima puntata della trasmissione somiglia anche tanto al pap ma nonostante tutto una bellissima bambina
7588074 a dicembre quando abbiamo saputo le date di veline abbiamo convenuto con teo che questo sarebbe stato un momento molto delicato per lui
7588075 io lanciavo veline in questo modo sin dagli inizi poi venne a trovarci vittorio gassman nostro grande fan e la prima cosa che disse a me e enzino iacchetti fu di non prenderlo in giro
7588076 noi facciamo una parodia di un telegiornale dove c gente che balla e siamo un variet alcuni tg sono dei variet con una giornalista soubrette e un direttore comico e notizie panzane si dice che le veline vadano con calciatori bene almeno sono dei bei ragazzi pensate alle giornaliste che sono costrette ad andare con direttori che non sono il massimo della bellezza io non vedo lora che mi si chieda se vorrei che mia figlia facesse la velina risponderei affermativamente perch tanto si tratta di un ruolo
7588077 sarebbe interessante anche avere una velina rom per finora non si sono presentate perch hanno paura che greggio dia loro fuoco
7588078 noi siamo unentit molto forte che riuscita a passare indenne attraverso centinaia di trabocchetti

7588084 if we save one child from being abused its well well worth it

7588092 i want to see the president of the united states succeed in iraq his success is americas success and his failure is americas failure
7588093 this disconnect i believe is fueling cynicism that is undermining the single most important weapon we need to give our troops to be able to do their job and that is the unyielding support of the american people that support is waning

7588096 biden has carved out a niche as the democratic presidential candidate most willing to publicly rebuke antiwar sentiment
7588097 that there is any possibility in the lifetime of anyone here of having the iraqis get together have a unity government in baghdad that pulls the country together that will not happen it will not happen in the lifetime of anyone here
7588098 acceptable perhaps even satisfying conclusion to the great veep search
7588099 when biden went after john mccain with a vigor and yes a venom that has been missing from obamas stump speaking it was a tonic for the troops who have been waiting for a campaign that is more prepared to throw punches than take them

7588111 you work like crazy for seven eight months of the year to prepare to play 12 games those 12 games ought to be very exciting for them all the time
7588112 i think it brings a lot of motivation a lot of interaction with the fans
7588113 i think thats a good thing because i know the fans i guess want to see us before we go in i think it will be nice a lot of motivation for the team and a lot of motivation for the fans
7588114 the convention exemplifies the true rot of our democracy the presidential race gets almost all of the attention and every other level of government gets none because we have come to believe democracy is just a quadrennial vote for president
7588115 a voting system used in 34 states contains a critical programming error that can cause votes to be dropped while being electronically transferred from memory cards to a central tallying point the manufacturer acknowledges
7588116 russia did not want this crisis the russian leadership is in a strong enough position domestically it did not need a little victorious war russia was dragged into the fray by the recklessness of the georgian president mikheil saakashvili

7588119 even assuming that airlines improve fuel efficiency by about 50 percent in such a scenario the united states could go from having nearly 400 primary airports down to 50 or so

7588124 i will vote for hillary thats the promise i made to the people who elected me
7588125 and i think there are people nationally who are not committed to voting for the democratic party in november theres a saying that democrats fall in love with their candidate but republicans fall in line if we fall in love with our candidate thats problematic

7588193 but this could all be ending soon as i noticed that the s amp p500 index went up to 1 298 even as the average earnings per share of the s amp p500 dropped to us 51 83 from 60 39 earnings went down but the stocks went up weird
7588194 and this is a goodly drop in earnings which seems a little goodlier when you remember lew rockwell

7588208 en santa fe la cantidad de habitantes la concentraci n y la actividad de caza contribuyen a un incremento de las armas de fuego
7588209 el municipio ha decidido involucrarse en todo lo que tenga que ver con lograr una ciudad con mayor paz y tranquilidad vemos que vali la pena apoyar desde el gobierno de la ciudad esta campa a del gobierno nacional de entrega voluntaria de armas
7588210 una relaci n directa ante la cantidad de hechos delictivos
7588211 la resoluci n de los mismos sea significativamente menos tr gica a partir de la falta de existencia de un arma
7588212 las actividades que ha encarado la municipalidad han contribuido a acercar al ciudadano para que entienda que no va a tener ning n problema con la entrega de armas que es voluntaria y an nima y por la cual recibe entre 100 y 450 de acuerdo al calibre del arma
7588213 si bien las mujeres representan un porcentaje muy chico dentro del grupo de leg timos usuarios a la hora de la entrega de armas son las que m s se hacen presentes concientes de los peligros que genera tener un arma en una casa respecto a los chicos y la violencia familiar

7588215 en un principio pens en qued rmela por si entraba un ladr n no es que yo fuera a tirar a matar sino que pens en un disparo al suelo para asustar a un posible delincuente pero mi hija me dijo si entran a robar te van a terminar matando con el arma que ten s eso me dio miedo por eso la traje
7588216 est dando resultado por lo menos ya no se ve la cantidad de muertes que hab a hace un tiempo
7588217 la traje porque me parece que es una manera de terminar con el mercado ilegal de armas porque si llegan a robarme el arma s que se la terminan vendiendo a un delincuente adem s tengo hermanitos chiquitos y mi mam no quer a tener armas en casa
7588218 hacemos participar a toda la sociedad no tenemos nada oculto la gente viene entrega el arma y ve c mo es inutilizada

7588288 situations occasionally occur in which a patient suffers significant medical complications that may have resulted from the physicians mistake or judgment in these situations the physician is ethically required to inform the patient of all facts necessary to ensure understanding of what has occurred concern regarding legal liability which might result following truthful disclosure should not affect the physicians honesty with a patient
7588289 in addition physicians should disclose to patients information about procedural or judgment errors made in the course of care if such information is material to the patients well being errors do not necessarily constitute improper negligent or unethical behavior but failure to disclose them may

7588354 a best case scenario is little to no negative headlines in the media and the panel endorses the long safety of lasik and encourages further use of femtosecond lasers

7588397 so we can open a ferry between larnaca and gaza which will run regularly
7588398 we are waiting to know if something can interest us we have spoken about a possible signing but our coach can start the season in a relaxed mood because he trusts the squad he is in charge of
7588399 there were other clubs but when my agent told me the gunners were interested that immediately became the priority for both me and my father
7588400 you just have to look at what the club has done in the last few years arsenal put a lot of faith in youth and all the french players who have come here have made an explosive impression
7588401 theres a guarantee with arsenal theyre a club synonymous with success and then theres mr wenger
7588402 it was very important to know i wasnt heading into the unknown i dont feel homesick at all you hear more french than english in the dressing room
7588403 dont forget that im only 21 not 26 27 or 28 i dont have a lot of international experience so for my first experiment abroad arsenal is ideal
7588404 i was at a big french club and today im at a big european club when you arrive here you get an english mobile phone with all the important numbers in it
7588405 theres a guy on call 24 hours a day when you show up at training youre given your own personalized training program
7588406 its on a whole other level despite that its not a factory here in the canteen at midday you eat side by side with the womens team and the clubs youngsters arsenal is a family as well
7588407 if you told me today i could have the same career as him id sign up immediately with my eyes closed
7588408 at the time he was the best left sided midfielder in the world he scored and set up loads of goals we have pretty much the same characteristics instead of staying out on the wing he liked to come inside a lot
7588409 part of me wanted to move on to progress and raise my game
7588410 id been at lom since i was 12 and even if i didnt get to experience winning a title id seen it all the youth academy four years with the pros and good times as well as crises
7588411 at this very special moment for me i really want to send a message to the chelsea fans who in the past two years have always made me feel their support
7588412 unfortunately i am a strong believer that had bill been around we would not have seen the performances that we have
7588413 he did not have good team management skills so one of the good things about this team was that they enjoyed being there they were united as a team
7588414 unfortunately bill did not create that atmosphere over the last eight years
7588415 egal bei welchem turnier wir gerade spielen die fans kommen in str men in montreal zum beispiel fasst der center court 15 000 fans und er war jeden tag zum bersten voll

7588423 whether to stand him down or sack him were always considerations for the club and the board and the coaching staff
7588424 at this point in time we dont have all the facts and obviously its important that we do have all the facts before any further action is determined
7588425 he certainly wont be training or playing with the nrl team and i would say its highly unlikely hed play again this year
7588426 certainly if these allegations are proven then we are certainly into the territory of looking at not only his future at that club but his future in the game
7588427 obviously these are very serious allegations its now a matter for the courts but i certainly support the action of the sharks in standing the player down
7588428 it is a bit of a kick in the teeth luckily ive still got my teeth
7588429 from what i understand it was pretty cut and dried circumstances and the matters were not contested by the player
7588430 from what i understand happened this morning at court greg and his counsel said that he would be strongly denying the allegations
7588431 without greg birds qualities as a footballer it makes it a lot tougher for us its another obstacle we have to face
7588432 i think its a bit of a longshot to be honest but obviously no other countries are committed because they were all going to be playing in the champions trophy
7588433 well monitor the environment and see if any of the other countries are willing to participate were keen but i guess well just wait and see
7588434 we couldnt host anything you cant play cricket here in late september but i think wed be pretty happy to travel
7588435 it would be good for the guys to get a bit of cricket prior to the bangladesh tour and theyre all fit and ready to go
7588436 i havent had any updates its one of those ones where they are in transition at the moment
7588437 i think the cultural aspect of where he comes from and his background will have huge pressure on him
7588438 but dannys been living in rotorua since he was nine and nzg high performance manager david graham is so close to him so the indication weve got is that he wants to remain with new zealand
7588439 there is a really neat picture on one of the websites today of danny waving the new zealand flag after his win
7588440 hes going to carry a new zealand passport i guess one of the biggest indications is that he could have turned professional now but he is so determined to represent new zealand at the eisenhower its unbelievable
7588441 we are determined and have stated so many times that we want to help young amateurs transition to professionalism
7588442 understanding the tours they should go on the management groups they should associate with is very important and the united states is obviously a very big market
7588443 it was the only sensible decision that could have been made it took the icc a while to reach the right conclusion but they eventually did
7588444 its just that the political situation was so unstable and then the president resigned and factions had developed in the coalition government
7588445 there was an increase in taliban terrorist activity and the situation on the north west border with afghanistan was volatile so it couldnt happen
7588446 hopefully the situation will have improved in pakistan and it will be deemed safe to hold it or there is time to shift it elsewhere
7588447 the icc just ran out of time to do that on this occasion
7588448 theres no doubt he can start a test hes perfectly capable of that
7588449 it was great for timana to get the time that he got
7588450 we delayed his entry obviously and deferred to the blokes who had the background of test rugby first with the initial replacement option
7588451 but when timana got in the game my first instinct was that he did really well having watched it live
7588452 well have a look at the footage and pour over it and contemplate our combinations and what we believe will work for us
7588453 i think ive taken my opportunities this year so hopefully if i get a spot we can make it another good win
7588454 i see myself as a 13 but obviously stirlings captain and also had a great game yesterday but i could slot in at 12 or any other place in the backline
7588455 we can swap any time i can go 12 he can go 13 were both big centres and get over the advantage line and i think thats a bonus for us
7588456 if it was to happen i think youd just have to take it in your stride
7588457 that race in singapore will be a chance to get used to the humidity i expect in hawaii i am not going to taper for that race because i want my body to be quite tired
7588458 i have always been a lot more successful in the full ironman than the half
7588459 you have to go into it with the mindset that it is just another race i just want to do my best and not get caught up with the hype of it all
7588460 lultima volta avevamo una partita di campionato il mercoled precedente e una il luned successivo questa volta penseremo solo a vincere il trofeo ha spiegato il 34enne e uno di quelli che si vuole sempre avere nel proprio cv la supercoppa una partita speciale che si vuole sempre vincere non sar importante come la finale di mosca contro il chelsea ma sempre un trofeo che vorresti avere in bacheca

7588470 they claim that it demeans the referee and it would take the human element out of the game i have been to fifa meetings and listened to the arguments personally i believe we should bring technology on board and use it
7588471 when i put it to fifa i was almost put down they said that this is football it wouldnt work im of a different opinion i think it would work and take a lot of pressure off referees
7588472 you could have a policy like tennis where managers are allowed two challenges per game to the video referee
7588473 if the rangers manager walter smith had that option in aberdeen it would have solved saturdays dilemma but to be honest it is not going to happen during my time in football

7588483 that decision is not going to help things it only adds to the tension in the region
7588484 we will take any decision including up to a complete break in relations
7588485 there has been a dramatic worsening of our relations but we are not to blame

7588491 the lnp will need to be more than a name change if it is to oust anna bligh and kevin rudd
7588492 i am very disappointed and angry about what has become of the liberal party in this state
7588493 it didnt help that there was a billionaire standing on the sidelines saying to everyone that he had the money
7588494 i would be very surprised if the lnp won the next queensland election
7588495 theres nothing holding it together other than ambition and opportunism its reason for being is to win the next election and if it doesnt its likely to fall over
7588496 the reason i hadnt confirmed dates in australia is i really didnt know what i was getting into
7588497 but now i know i have a show that breathes and changes and is dependent on peoples moods and environment i cant wait to bring it home

7588514 so it was a big difference for us as our guys play press right on the line of scrimmage
7588515 when adversity strikes it is not the adversity it is how you react to it we have been a team that has done a good job with that and simply presented it is really up to each one of us to do our jobs a little bit better than we have been doing it we have talented football players we have people that can do the job we have to just step it up a notch
7588516 we are still not comfortable with kiwanuka in coverage if hes fooled on his initial read of the play re directing his long legs and big body into the correct direction takes a lot of effort and time making him a liability in space we liked his run support this week but to our eyes he still looks like a defensive end that is playing linebacker
7588517 you have to remember that he lined up with his hand on the ground in passing situations anyway so its not like the technique is going to be totally foreign to him

7588531 further good news is that the rate of increase among the youth in particular has slowed further as well as in women between 20 and 24 years of age
7588532 given that these trends have been found over a two year period we think that our prevention strategies are beginning to make a difference to behaviour
7588533 on tb control and the implementation of the tb strategic plan we are encouraged by the fact that 20 of our health facilities now have tb tracing teams as part of our efforts to reduce the tb defaulter rate from 10 to 7 in line with the target set by the president in the state of the nation address
7588534 equally in the msinga sub district where the first cases of xdr tb were identified a few years ago the defaulter rate is zero and the latest figures show that the rate of new cases of mdr and xdr tb have decreased significantly

7588601 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7588602 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7588603 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7588604 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7588605 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7588606 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7588607 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7588608 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7588609 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7588610 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7588611 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7588612 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7588613 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar

7588633 son unas lacras por que hablan mal del iphone yo confio en ti ciegamente ap sin nombre
7588634 anytime that apple approaches you to work on a project or look at a project you get excited and you want to take a look at it really quickly
7588635 when we took a look at what apple was doing we wanted to get on board
7588636 flashman is a video game management company that manages developers and publishers and various ips intellectual properties and is a partner of reverb which manages sales marketing and public relations
7588637 and so as we were working together we came up with the idea with working much closer so that we could build a publisher and actually launch video game titles through video digital distributed needs such as x box live arcade playstation nintendo wii pc and then obviously the apple iphone applications
7588638 when we met with the folks from apple they started talking to us about how they were going to be doing games for iphones and their plans for building up a video game section as big as they built up the itunes section for music
7588639 so publisher x got really excited about that and took a look at the group of video game developers that we had working for us
7588640 after talking to our developers we took a look at the various games that they could get ready for the apple app store launch and decided to launch with six titles
7588641 we were just trying to reach the launch date so we and other publishers and developers had to scramble pretty quickly for the initial launch we only had a six to eight week window to develop the games and go live by apples july launch date normally this process takes months upon months so the initial round of games that we launched are games that have been ported over from other platforms
7588642 its just like downloading music from itunes apple has really taken the lead in the way they distribute content to the consumers
7588643 critter crunch and zen pinball rollercoaster are two of my favorites we obviously have the casino titles which are great games but when you take a look at what weve done with rollercoaster pinball it really gives you that experience like your playing on a pinball machine the whole screen is the pinball table and when you play the game the touch screen acts as the flippers plus a great aspect that comes to the game from the apple iphone is the tilt sensor so when the ball is coming down and you want to move it you can tap the side of the screen and actually move the table a little bit just like you would in a real pinball game
7588644 in years past people thought of the games on cell phones as being as something really small something kind of cheesy that really wasnt like playing a real video game
7588645 but as the handheld market started to take off you saw the playstation portable nintendo ds and various handheld platforms start to bring much richer and bigger games over to those platforms
7588646 we are already in development for another five to ten titles
7588647 its just amazing that there are two companies based in twain harte reverb communications and publisher x that are doing such grand things with the apple iphone x box live arcade playstation network and things like that
7588648 its very confusing and we really dont know if its 100 safe
7588649 im not against vaccines but i dont want to do anything that would harm my daughter
7588650 we dont know if it will make a difference in the ultimate rates of cancer
7588651 the jury is still out on how much benefit were actually going to get with this vaccine
7588652 the crux of it is that we know how to prevent cervical cancer
7588653 one of the key questions is whether this huge outlay of money for the vaccine is a better strategy than reaching out to the women who arent getting pap tests and follow ups
7588654 even though it guards against two hpv strains the other hpv types need to be taken into account
7588655 it will take a long time before we know the true efficacy of the vaccine
7588656 if we vaccinate every single 12 year old it should reduce by half the number of cervical cancers in the next 35 years
7588657 the cdc and the fda checked out these reports very carefully

7588678 my plan got delayed but now im working on it
7588679 things will fall into place very shortly ill star in the film and direct it is that too much responsibility
7588680 im passionate about being a director ive lots to say and i hope audiences accept me as a director as much as they have as an actor
7588681 it will bring a smile to the face a tear to the eye that rk films was famous for
7588682 we get lots of offers to act together and id love to share camera space with him but dads busy with several acting assignments
7588683 im not making a conscious effort to walk in my fathers footsteps though hes my favourite actor and i dont mind being compared with him but i dont act or dance like him i want to be myself on screen
7588684 when the role was offered to me i grabbed it i wanted to be part of something that was so young so today
7588685 in saawariyan i didnt get the girl so god made up for that
7588686 i cringe when i see myself on screen so i avoid looking but people have liked my rapport with bipasha
7588687 ill have plenty of other opportunities to work with katrina

7588690 some good some bad it seems like ive said that all camp
7588691 well we have a week to get better and have more consistent of the good
7588692 there were some times out there we tried to slow it down and it actually worked against us
7588693 were used to going at a faster pace today when we got in that slower tempo we didnt perform quite as well
7588694 a lot more than what weve seen if we cant get some consistency there were going to have to go for it on fourth down a lot
7588695 we had a balk a wild pitch a homer errant throws walk off home run
7588696 we played for the cycle both teams across the board
7588697 i tried to get on base for matty i got a pretty good pitch to hit took a hack at it
7588698 it felt good right away it was an unbelievable feeling
7588699 that was very appropriate that that happened for him today because he does his work so professionally
7588700 whatever you ask him to do he does it and he does such a good job when hes out there
7588701 look i dont want to jinx him or anything because hes playing at such a high level but people have to understand sometimes preseason is all about mistakes
7588702 you dont get that many plays usually everybody is tired from camp and there isnt a whole lot of game planning to get people free the way you want
7588703 so its rare just very rare its not something you see a lot in the situations youre in during the preseason thats for sure im really excited about the way hes playing i think we all are
7588704 thats kind of the biggest thing not turning the ball over sometimes youre going to get tipped passes and things like that but im happy with that thats kind of the goal
7588705 cameron and a friend were involved in returning an injured dog to its owner
7588706 some people who were with me through thick and thin will be with me coming out this is kind of a thank you a tip of my cap to them for being great friends it will be very exciting then ill go to work
7588707 people were expecting so much from us last season and i think that kind of went to guys heads
7588708 now they dont expect anything from us i always liked being the underdog i hope people think were the worst team in the nation and talk bad about us every week
7588709 i can see the outside view that there is lots of inexperience
7588710 what people have overlooked is i have never seen a group of guys work harder since i have been at ucla we need to grow up and the only way to do that is by playing i feel there will be a dramatic change in every series we play from the first game and every game after that
7588711 he looks you right in the eye and tells you if he made a mistake i like that in guys
7588712 i dont know what outside expectations are nor do i care
7588713 i love it when people trash us it drives us
7588714 ive seen teams rise to levels that maybe individually you couldnt imagine
7588715 i played on a team that went to the rose bowl after starting 0 3 1 in 1983
7588716 expectations are low outside looking in not inside those are always high and we have to try to hold each other to them
7588717 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7588718 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7588719 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7588720 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7588721 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7588722 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7588723 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7588724 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7588725 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7588726 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7588727 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7588728 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7588729 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
7588730 there will definitely be some jobs up for grabs next year

7588753 i am like thee o night dark and naked i walk on the flaming path which is above my day dreams and whenever my foot touches earth a giant oaktree comes forth
7588754 nay thou art not like me o madman for thou still lookest backward to see how large a foot print thou leavest on the sand
7588755 i am like thee o night silent and deep and in the heart of my loneliness lies a goddess in child bed and in him who is being born heaven touches hell
7588756 nay thou art not like me o madman for thou shudderest yet before pain and the song of the abyss terrifies thee
7588757 i am like thee o night wild and terrible for my ears are crowded with cries of conquered nations and sighs for forgotten lands
7588758 nay thou art not like me o madman for thou still takest thy little self for a comrade and with thy monster self thou canst not be friend
7588759 i am like thee o night cruel and awful for my bosom is lit by burning ships at sea and my lips are wet with blood of slain warriors
7588760 nay thou art not like me o madman for the desire for a sister spirit is yet upon thee and thou hast not become a law unto thyself
7588761 i am like thee o night joyous and glad for he who dwells in my shadow is now drunk with virgin wine and she who follows me is sinning mirthfully
7588762 nay thou art not like me o madman for thy soul is wrapped in the veil of seven folds and thou holdest not thy heart in thine hand
7588763 i am like thee o night patient and passionate for in my breast a thousand dead lovers are buried in shrouds of withered kisses
7588764 yea madman art thou like me art thou like me and canst thou ride the tempest as a steed and grasp the lightning as a sword
7588765 like thee o night like thee mighty and high and my throne is built upon heaps of fallen gods and before me too pass the days to kiss the hem of my garment but never to gaze at my face
7588766 art thou like me child of my darkest heart and dost thou think my untamed thoughts and speak my vast language
7588767 yea we are twin brothers o night for thou revealest space and i reveal my soul

7588791 the alternate domination of one faction over another sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities is itself a frightful despotism but this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism the disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction more able or more fortunate than his competitors turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation on the ruins of public liberty

7588796 theres always going to be naysayers people that are going to say its fake but thats fine because you cant control everybody but i can control what i do my attitude how i approach the situation
7588797 how i approach the situation is i want to do everything in my power that football gives me to influence as many people as i can for the good because thats gonna mean so much more when its all said and done than just playing football and winning championships

7588825 my editor has pointed out to me the rather paradoxical circumstance that while no one has any trouble recognizing that there is plenty of bullsh around quite a few people remain stubbornly unwilling to acknowledge that there might be even in principle such a thing as truth in my discussion however i shall not even try at least not by any directly confrontational argument or analysis to settle once and for all the entangled debate between those who accept the reality of a meaningful distinction between being true and being false and those who energetically represent themselves never mind whether they are correct in doing so or whether it is even possible that they should be correct as denying that the distinction is a valid one or that it corresponds to any objective reality that debate seems unlikely ever to be finally resolved and it is generally unrewarding
7588826 i will simply take for granted the more or less universally accepted commonsense ways of understanding these notions
7588827 my discussion will be concerned exclusively with the value and the importance of truth and not at all with the value or the importance of our efforts to find truth or of our experience in finding it

7589021 when you talk to the policy strategists at hmrc they say the regime is benign and all their staff follow the rules but we find ordinary taxpayers have a very different experience on the ground
7589022 these are hugely draconian proposals that would allow the treasury to unjustly enrich itself at the expense of individual taxpayers the banks have been criticised for their unfair charges but if the banks shouldnt operate in this way why should hmrc
7589023 permitting hmrc to issue daily fines without authorisation from the general or special commissioners would remove a vital legal protection for taxpayers against the arbitrary use of power regardless of whether taxpayers could appeal the balance is shifted firmly in hmrcs favour and would inevitably result in greater use of daily fines

7589025 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia its to protect our european allies from any rogue threats
7589026 the strategic significance of the system consists of intercepting those few dozen missiles moscow can launch following a first strike its a crucial element to develop a nuclear first strike capacity against russia the original plan is for ten interceptor missiles in poland but once established their number could be easily increased

7589037 nato can act to stabiliz e this very dangerous situation

7589048 kremlin capitalism is a threat to the west by using its market strength in oil and gas resources to strong arm its neighbors and outmaneuver the us and eu
7589049 is to replace a pro western government with a new russian satellite reminiscent of the brezhnev doctrine its part of a broader campaign to annex new territory expand the russian empire conduct cyber attacks against the baltic states assassinate enemies and use economic intimidation through cutoffs of russian oil and gas shipments to ukraine and the czech republic it is important that moscow pays a concrete and tangible price for its latest aggression at least comparable to what it paid for the 1979 invasion of afghanistan
7589050 burned and houses broken unburied bodies lay rotting fresh graves were dug in gardens and basements most victims interviewed were ethnic georgians in central georgian villages some killings were carried out for revenge some involved theft and still others seemed to be that the power balance was shifting away from ethnic georgians to the ossetian separatists and their russian backers
7589051 georgians living in several of the villages said the russians occupying their land had treated them well done nothing to encourage them to leave and offered the only protection available from the south ossestian militias they feared most

7589058 support is likely and that after all the events that have occurred one should not expect otherwise
7589059 appealed to russia and to governments of other countries to recognize abkhazias independence
7589060 express such a will and if the russian president makes a relevant decision on this score
7589061 again said they will never agree to remain within georgia

7589311 given our analysis which shows that both fannie mae and freddie mac should have sufficient capital through at least year end 2008 under a variety of negative credit scenarios all parties could wait it out until market conditions improve

7589316 well i grew up on the beach you grow up on the beach and i think the natural inclination is to want to eat everything that you see
7589317 and then you get into the fried food and its like oh my god anything fried is good but a clam fried is heaven
7589318 well i used to work at a clam shack in marblehead called flynnies at the beach which doesnt exist anymore
7589319 but i fried clams and i brought calamari to the menu too because they werent doing calamari
7589320 i dont know what life would have been like without the fried clam so its kind of a mecca
7589321 you imagine the little fat bellies dropping into the oil start to salivate
7589322 actually 92 years ago my grandfather came up with the idea of putting some fried clams in his chip fryalator to deep fry em
7589323 and on july 4th big parade coming through he put a big sign out fried clams and sold 35 worth of product that day and thats the most he took in in any day of operation so he wasnt a stupid man so he kept them on the menu

7589331 as someone who has been a defensive single most of my adult life i still believe that solitude makes you a deeper person not a lesser one
7589332 if youre your own best friend you need to get out more
7589333 hugging oneself may be good for the soul but bad for the back
7589334 non vado a cercarle vengono loro a me io ritengo che sia dio a chiedermi di farlo e quindi le sposo
7589335 un uomo con 10 mogli sprofonderebbe e morrebbe ma la mia potenza deriva direttamente da allah ecco perch ho potuto controllare 86 di loro
7589336 invitiamo i musulmani di ignorare linsolente disprezzo di bello della shariya islamica che limita il numero delle mogli per un uomo a sole quattro

7589350 people think that if they take a medication their body absorbs it and it disappears but of course thats not the case
7589351 it brings a question to peoples minds that if the fish were affected might there be a potential problem for humans
7589352 pharmaceuticals are only present in very low concentrations and therefore could not be dangerous
7589353 septic systems are essentially small treatment plants that are essentially unmanaged and therefore tend to fail
7589354 i think its a shame that so much money is going into monitoring to figure out if these things are out there and so little is being spent on human health
7589355 they need to just accept that these things are everywhere every chemical and pharmaceutical could be there its time for
7589356 these are chemicals that are designed to have very specific effects at very low concentrations
7589357 thats what pharmaceuticals do so when they get out to the environment it should not be a shock to people that they have effects
7589358 its the latest in a series of pr moves designed to mislead the public from the fact that the government is asleep at the wheel here
7589359 any group that is opposed to a proven safe technology that enhances food safety is misguided
7589360 its a way to try to come in and clean up problems that are created in the middle of the food production chain i think its clearly a disincentive to clean up the problems at the source
7589361 hopefully therell be some manufacturers that will take that step
7589362 hopefully the public will be less concerned about it all the evidence suggests that theres not a risk
7589363 as far as the bush administration goes i think were seeing a whole raft of attempts to push through regulatory changes like this
7589364 ones theyre afraid they cant get passed under another president
7589365 every administration since fdr has been pro agribusiness and there hasnt been much difference in their policies
7589366 urban agriculture magazine 16 formulating effective policies on urban agriculture
7589367 urban agriculture is mainly an informal activity in maranguape introduced to the city by migrant workers urban agriculture however has to be integrated into the municipal planning as part of the main urban development plan
7589368 considering the alarming rate of unemployment in the city of rosario and the need to promote productive activities the municipality is committed to assigning land under contracts with farmer groups for farming purposes lots should have the minimal services for carrying out the proposed tasks
7589369 fitchs uncertainty regarding potential outcomes of aigs previously announced business unit review which is expected to be completed in late september

7589376 having been around for 34 years it is now stronger than ever with our ability to utilize it to grow numerous different businesses than what it was originally utilized for
7589377 the best way to make your brands work is to use your various different properties to cross promote the other businesses
7589378 it could be something where we have a cable operator promote a special giveaway for consumers who purchase a hustler tv movie to get a discount coupon for the local hustler hollywood store
7589379 now you have promotion for the channel and you get the consumers into the stores and they love it and when they buy something there is information on the cash receipts leading them to the websites
7589380 the hustler casino is one our biggest successes utilizing the hustler brand on a non adult entertainment enterprise and has been a huge revenue source for us
7589381 also we have strong presence in the apparel area with our hustler and barely legal branded clothing items including our recently successful hustler lingerie line and of course we have been very successful in the retail arena with our nationwide chain of hustler hollywood stores
7589382 you have to make sure that you are tied with something that is associated in some way with the theme of your company and brand
7589383 people have an expectation with hustler and you dont want to tie it in with something that is going to lead them to feel that it is not what they expected
7589384 shemale yum and black tgirls are two domain names which have branded and stuck pretty well among the models as much as the fans
7589385 within the transgender adult sites world weve been able to brand the company name grooby which a lot of surfers see as being synonymous with the quality and integrity of the specific sites we offer
7589386 its hard for us to make headway with the grooby brand
7589387 but that may just be something we need to build on as we release more non transsexual type sites
7589388 all the sites and projects we have have grooby on them
7589389 keeping the name out there for the potential models is just as important as potential customers
7589390 we have tried projects in the past that didnt work out because the material dried up
7589391 ive been very fast to distance myself from them as soon as they stopped working out and jettisoned them from our brand whilst keeping the customers informed being upfront and honest with surfers is extremely important
7589392 at the time it seemed like another way to market my photos
7589393 i just didnt realize the full potential of the web at that time
7589394 thats always been my style which is why my work features beautiful models beautifully shot having hot and believable sex its what made my name back in penthouse in the 1970s and what i still do today after all theres a whole new generation of surfers coming of legal age looking for exciting material on the web through my free galleries my website and now my dvds i am trying to reach them with quality joyful erotica and making sure my name is front and center on all of it

7589426 there were other clubs but when my agent told me the gunners were interested that immediately became the priority for both me and my father
7589427 you just have to look at what the club has done in the last few years arsenal put a lot of faith in youth and all the french players who have come here have made an explosive impression
7589428 theres a guarantee with arsenal theyre a club synonymous with success and then theres mr wenger
7589429 it was very important to know i wasnt heading into the unknown i dont feel homesick at all you hear more french than english in the dressing room
7589430 dont forget that im only 21 not 26 27 or 28 i dont have a lot of international experience so for my first experiment abroad arsenal is ideal
7589431 i was at a big french club and today im at a big european club when you arrive here you get an english mobile phone with all the important numbers in it
7589432 theres a guy on call 24 hours a day when you show up at training youre given your own personalized training program
7589433 its on a whole other level despite that its not a factory here in the canteen at midday you eat side by side with the womens team and the clubs youngsters arsenal is a family as well
7589434 if you told me today i could have the same career as him id sign up immediately with my eyes closed
7589435 at the time he was the best left sided midfielder in the world he scored and set up loads of goals we have pretty much the same characteristics instead of staying out on the wing he liked to come inside a lot
7589436 part of me wanted to move on to progress and raise my game
7589437 id been at lom since i was 12 and even if i didnt get to experience winning a title id seen it all the youth academy four years with the pros and good times as well as crises
7589438 at this very special moment for me i really want to send a message to the chelsea fans who in the past two years have always made me feel their support
7589439 unfortunately i am a strong believer that had bill been around we would not have seen the performances that we have
7589440 he did not have good team management skills so one of the good things about this team was that they enjoyed being there they were united as a team
7589441 unfortunately bill did not create that atmosphere over the last eight years
7589442 we are waiting to know if something can interest us we have spoken about a possible signing but our coach can start the season in a relaxed mood because he trusts the squad he is in charge of
7589443 police are investigating the woman most probably was not a nun

7589446 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7589447 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7589448 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7589449 reduced financial flexibility as the operating bank subsidiary bankunited fsb is increasingly challenged by asset quality deterioration
7589450 the departure of the companys senior management team and the declining financial strength of parent company national city corp
7589451 additionally capstone has informed fitch that it is not prepared to provide further information regarding the future of the companys servicing operation at this time
7589452 there was a very small number of painted vehicles and we understand quite a few of them went through to queenstown for skiing
7589453 its quite clear that it the undie 500 is seen as a magnet
7589454 its much improved on last year our belief has been student behaviour is improving but its still far from acceptable
7589455 its a booze trip it does have something to do with it
7589456 we had done all we could to distance ourselves from this years trip
7589457 there is no doubt the combined efforts of all these agencies resulted in reduced overall levels of disorder
7589458 in the end we remain dependent upon the responsibility of individuals involved
7589459 it seems to me he was giving some fairly generalised rationale that there has to be benefits to the consumer it has to be warranted there have to be alternative routes but theres no specific analysis that has been undertaken and if there was i would have pointed out to him straight away 50 a week is unacceptable
7589460 secret agenda to sell assets like kiwibank should they become the government this year
7589461 the prospect of having the 50 extra tax cut they promised the average worker snatched away with the weekly toll bill of course makes it clear that their policies are all about taking with one hand giving with the other but you dont end up any better off at all and arguably worse
7589462 but having said that the economic conditions probably masked any improvement we would have hoped to see at the gaming machine level
7589463 i think its a bit of a longshot to be honest but obviously no other countries are committed because they were all going to be playing in the champions trophy
7589464 well monitor the environment and see if any of the other countries are willing to participate were keen but i guess well just wait and see
7589465 we couldnt host anything you cant play cricket here in late september but i think wed be pretty happy to travel
7589466 it would be good for the guys to get a bit of cricket prior to the bangladesh tour and theyre all fit and ready to go
7589467 cest bien de rentrer la maison il est plus facile de revenir en russie
7589468 m me si certaines ann es nous attirons 1 7 million de visiteurs nous sommes malgr tout satisfaits en raison du temps il a ainsi plu par exemple le 21 juillet ou le 15 ao t qui sont des jours f ri s il ne faut pas un temps trop chaud car sinon les gens partent la mer mais bien sec quelques forains ne sont pas satisfaits de cette dition notamment ceux qui vendent des glaces ou ceux qui disposent de terrasses
7589469 il y avait des poubelles en suffisance cette ann e dhabitude en fin de journ e les poubelles taient pleines et les d tritus taient jet s c t de celles ci le site tait plus propre de mani re g n rale je salue le travail men par le service propret de la ville qui a nettoy tous les matins le site

7589471 noyce informs that dirt music is still scheduled for september next year
7589472 we just hope for a fine day and a generous public
7589473 the chinese were keen on showing a world that had grown up reading about its 19th century domination by europeans and its 20th century invasion by the japanese that its days of being a punching bag were over
7589474 you might as well get it in your head that china will dominate the medal count in every future olympics this will be the last time the us or anyone else has more total medals the chinese have too many people too much organization too much money available and too much of a focus on athletic success for anyone to compete if anyone really should
7589475 he had no motive if i spent my time being angry its not going to help me deal with it help me support my wife and my family if we sit around being angry at something thats already happened i just think its a waste of a lot of emotion
7589476 we struggle to describe the meaning of sportsmanship and humanity
7589477 we take a bunch of high minded hoo hah and call it olympic spirit look there is no way to make sense of senseless violence yet a man who reacts to that violence by refusing to allow anger to consume him surely is part of an integral equation of what is good and dignified about mankind
7589478 and now she was on the other end of the phone screaming to her husband you won you won the gold medal she was ecstatic yet what came next were the most poignant and powerful words of all nothing silence it was the great passion of the unspoken moment we just smiled into the phone mccutcheon said
7589479 i think the cultural aspect of where he comes from and his background will have huge pressure on him
7589480 but dannys been living in rotorua since he was nine and nzg high performance manager david graham is so close to him so the indication weve got is that he wants to remain with new zealand
7589481 there is a really neat picture on one of the websites today of danny waving the new zealand flag after his win
7589482 hes going to carry a new zealand passport i guess one of the biggest indications is that he could have turned professional now but he is so determined to represent new zealand at the eisenhower its unbelievable
7589483 we are determined and have stated so many times that we want to help young amateurs transition to professionalism
7589484 understanding the tours they should go on the management groups they should associate with is very important and the united states is obviously a very big market
7589485 infosys believes that the acquisition will accelerate the achievement of some of infosys current strategic corporate objectives including the continued expansion of infosys consulting capabilities

7589504 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7589505 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7589506 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7589507 its not that theres anything wrong with the choice of joe biden a majority rate the biden selection as excellent or pretty good voters think he is qualified to be president and with the exception of al gore in 1992 the public ranks biden as the most qualified running mate in recent times
7589508 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country
7589509 the privilege of being reminded just how decent people are
7589510 if i were barack obama right now i would be hoping against hope that the celebrities would just keep quiet about me
7589511 its true that after mccains celebrity ad every single hollywood person who comes out on the obama bandwagon is more evidence for mccains argument that he is a celebrity
7589512 and ill offer a million dollars to anyone who could prove otherwise in fact ive only talked to the senator once in the last year and a half on the phone
7589513 a reported 5 million on television advertising while mccain spent nothing
7589514 an indication that it could be supporters of hillary clinton who are holding out
7589515 a reported 5 million on television advertising while mccain spent nothing
7589516 the race in iowa while relatively close appears to be moving in obamas direction
7589517 most importantly for obama his supporters are much more likely to say they strongly support him which makes them much more likely to turn out on election day and much more likely to talk to friends and neighbors volunteer in the campaign and do the kinds of things that win elections
7589518 the secret to obamas ability to make virginia a close race can be found in his ability to attract 40 of the white vote while virginias black vote will likely be less than states such as georgia or north carolina it is substantial enough that when combined with such a strong showing among whites it falls into the recipe we see as necessary for obama to win southern states that have voted republican in recent years
7589519 tot de kern komen creatieve gesprekstechnieken voor een goed pastoraal gesprek
7589520 van mij hoeft het zo niet meer ik ben liever dood
7589521 kan de zuster er later op terugkomen met het team overleggen of contact opnemen met een geestelijk verzorger
7589522 eigen ervaring is van grote invloed op de zorg een verpleegkundige vertelde mij dat ze na het overlijden van haar eigen vader heel anders is gaan verplegen omdat ze veel beter snapte wat er bij mensen speelde
7589523 daarom is het belangrijk dat een verpleegkundige gevoeligheid ontwikkelt voor de themas die bij een pati nt kunnen spelen verpleegkundigen zijn vaak het eerste contact met de pati nt en kunnen het beste signaleren welke behoeftes er spelen
7589524 daar kun je verpleegkundigen bewust maken van de themas die bij pati nten kunnen spelen als gevolg van hun ziekte ook communicatievaardigheden zijn heel belangrijk de een zal zelf een gesprek aangaan de ander doorverwijzen
7589525 opvallend was dat de leerlingen niet terug kwamen met de vragen van de pati nt maar met hun eigen vragen bijvoorbeeld mag ik iemand uit de koran voorlezen als dat in strijd is met mijn geloof hoe kan iemand geloven dat haar overleden kleinkind niet bij god is
7589526 daarom moet je het in de opleiding inbouwen dan kunnen ze daar eerst mee aan de slag zodat ze later beter zien welke vragen de pati nt heeft
7589527 een pati nt had te horen gekregen dat de chemokuren niet meer aan slaan ze was in alle staten van de verpleegkundigen die met zijn twee n avonddienst hadden gaf er een haar pieper af en is bij de pati nt gaan zitten
7589528 je pieper zomaar afgeven doe je niet als je net begonnen bent dan krijg je de volgende dag op je kop als je net van je opleiding komt pas je je eerst aan aan de praktijk pas later durf je daar van los te komen en de zorg te geven die je eigenlijk wilt
7589529 nu heerst er vaak een taboe op het onderwerp of er wordt gewoon niet over gepraat
7589530 een verpleegkundige was s nachts bij een pati nt gaan zitten die niet kon slapen gaandeweg het gesprek bleken beide christelijk te zijn de pati nt vroeg de verpleegkundige om samen te bidden vijf minuten later sliep ze het kostte de verpleegkundige veel moeite dit voorbeeld te vertellen aan collegas maar daarna kwam er een levendig gesprek over het geloof een dergelijk gesprek hadden ze nog nooit gehad
7589531 invloed van geestelijke zorg op lichamelijke gezondheid is empirisch moeilijk te bewijzen wel is uit onderzoek de enorme waardering van pati nten gebleken voor een bezoek van de geestelijk verzorger deze waardering wijst erop dat er iets positiefs gebeurt op geestelijk niveau
7589532 de verpleegkundigen die aanvankelijk vaak scepsis hadden bleken na afloop van de cursus meer lol in het werk te hebben ook de pati nten voelden zich na de nieuwe zorg beter meest opvallende resultaat was het significant afgenomen ziekteverzuim op de vier afdelingen

7589562 heer wanneer hebben wij u hongerig gezien en te eten gegeven of dorstig en u te drinken gegeven wanneer hebben wij u als vreemdeling gezien en opgenomen u naakt gezien en gekleed wanneer hebben wij gezien dat u ziek was of in de gevangenis zat en zijn we naar u toe gekomen

7589564 het app l van mensen met autisme aan ons als gemeenteleden is ik kan niet zo goed bij
7589565 natuurlijk beleven autisten hun geloof ook dit zou wel bekend zijn als meer m t in plaats van ver autisten gepraat werd
7589566 het bieden van pastorale zorg is heel belangrijk autisten hebben vaak een laag zelfbeeld een zogenaamd leeg beeld van zichzelf wat je niet vertelt aanleert weten ze vaak niet vertel hem hoe hij eruit ziet wat hem persoonlijk nou zo bijzonder zo waardevol maakt
7589567 mensen die niet met n pastoraal gesprek geholpen zijn maar langere begeleiding nodig blijken te hebben
7589568 voor veel gemeenten is dit een nieuw terrein en men wil niet direct bij evangelische gemeenten te rade gaan ze krijgen soms te maken met ingewikkelde praktijksituaties van occulte belasting er bestaat dan veel onduidelijkheid over de manier waarop ze hiermee moeten omgaan
7589569 de gereformeerde gezindte is dit terrein aan het ontdekken wat ik merk is dat de nood groot is pastorale teams die besluiten n keer per maand samen te komen doen dat al snel n keer per week samen denkt men bijvoorbeeld na over de vraag hoe iemand met het occulte in aanraking is gekomen
7589570 er is geen terrein van hulpverlening waarop zo veel fouten worden gemaakt of zo veel excessen voorkomen als binnen het bevrijdingspastoraat
7589571 deels komt dat voort uit een verkeerd mensbeeld daarom is het belangrijk in te gaan op het bijbelse mensbeeld en op de verhouding tussen ziel geest en lichaam en de plaats die het demonische daarbij inneemt
7589572 hoe vaak gebeurt het niet dat binnen een christelijke gemeente een paar gemeenteleden met bepaalde noden geconfronteerd worden daarvoor gaan bidden en zo spontaan een gebedsteam ontstaat dat voor bevrijding en genezing bidt andere gemeenteleden staan er vaak heel huiverig tegenover en het kan een bron van conflicten vormen
7589573 principes te ontdekken die voor de dienst der bevrijding opgaan
7589574 wanneer is het nodig om te bidden voor genezing en wanneer moet men iemand doorverwijzen naar arts psycholoog of psychiater

7589578 its particularly revealing that the obama campaign feels forced to cast flimsy attack ads during his own convention barack obamas politics of hope is waning
7589579 economics is not something ive understood as well as i should
7589580 i am not an expert on wall street i am not an expert on some of this stuff
7589581 economics is not something ive understood as well as i should
7589582 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7589583 a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really

7589587 obviously this is not the way you want it to happen but its an opportunity for a lot of guys and i am one of the guys who has to step up and take advantage of it
7589588 im more concerned with the team that we have right here in our locker room and that this team mentally prepares itself as best we can

7589605 as democrats are coming together this week in denver to bring the change americas working families need and deserve john mccain is bragging about his support for president bushs failed and flawed policies and his promise of more of the same
7589606 the last thing the american people can afford is another republican who voted with president bush more than 90 percent of the time and thinks the fundamentals of our economy are strong only someone who cant keep track of how many houses he owns would look back at the last eight years and say we need four more
7589607 are you proud of the work and the work and the leadership of the commander in chief in this war
7589608 yes i am i think the president has led with great clarity and i think hes done a great job leading the country dont you all
7589609 the president and i agree on most issues there was a recent study that showed i voted with the president over 90 percent of the time higher than a lot of my even republican colleagues
7589610 the fact is that i have agreed with president bush far more than i have disagreed and on the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day i have been totally in agreement and support of president bush

7589614 however in recent years we have gone beyond the straightforward analysis of dyadic interactions between two individuals we now consider the role of eavesdropping deception and noisy environments in shaping signals and investigate how animals deploy them in various contexts

7589623 when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7589624 it is some form of ball tampering it is not about natural deterioration it is illegal isnt it
7589625 i loved the wrist release of flintoff jones and harmison but i always felt something was going on as the ball was reversing by the 40th over especially on a grassy pitches
7589626 one is used to seeing the ball reverse early on the much rougher tracks in the subcontinent where the hard surface makes the ball abrasive easily
7589627 to me it is a total hypocrisy on what is deemed to be ball tampering
7589628 there are huge inconsistencies for one side to complain about the other scratching the ball when they are deliberately sucking sugary sweets to shine the ball
7589629 people use suntan oil lip salve scruff the ball with finger and thumbs until they get caught if you apply suntan oil on you forehead or face or arms and rub the sweat on your body which is mixed with suntan oil and then rub the ball what is the difference
7589630 it is impossible to police if batsman edges the ball and stands his ground and no one says a word that is part of the game and if a bowler adds sugary saliva on the ball the spirit of the game is called into question there should be some leniency about what the bowler can do to the ball you dont want a cricket ball tested at the end of day for sugar for sun cream for lip gel for finger nails and whatever else you want to try and put on it
7589631 i actually wish marcus put a bit more mint on the ball so it deflected further off my glove
7589632 were talking about sugar coating using mints there are a lot more major issues in the game at the moment to worry about
7589633 i had no knowledge of it and i certainly wouldnt recommend anything like that
7589634 i dont know if it would even work i would never cheat in the game bowlers have used sweat and polish over the years to shine the ball there is an old wives tale from past years that sunscreen and brill cream helps the ball swing but i dont know about that
7589635 may polish the ball provided that no artificial substance is used
7589636 it depends on the evidence and circumstances so if something is brought to our attention it would be dealt with

7589738 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
7589739 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
7589740 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
7589741 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
7589742 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
7589743 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
7589744 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
7589745 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
7589746 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
7589747 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking

7589752 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
7589753 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
7589754 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
7589755 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise

7589762 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
7589763 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30

7589774 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew

7589840 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
7589841 if it werent for the cheesy caption that banner would look like incest
7589842 i sincerely hope with all my heart that when my daughter gets married i will not behave like a shell shocked asshat who cant handle a simple walk down the aisle
7589843 has no one figured out that hes telling her to
7589844 so why did lynn identify today as the wedding date when she wasnt even going to time the vows for today just because she likes saturdays for wedding whaaaaaaaaaaaat
7589845 eight more strips to go and itll all be over
7589846 they stare knowingly at each other as theyre reminded that marriage is the most important commitment that can be made and should be honored no matter what
7589847 except this dad is mostly modeled off rod johnston and lynn is currently pissed at him for leaving her for another woman so the
7589848 one of the things about lynn going back into the past and mucking around in it is that in six months 94 of coffee talk is going to forget about anthony as theyll be cooing about how lynn has a camera in their houses and we will never have to see his face on the dead trees again
7589849 i know this is what wedding ceremonies are actually like but theres a reason only people who care about the couple or are under some kind of obligation go to weddings
7589850 i half expect the officiant to remind them that their vows are supposed to be said out loud and that the correct response is
7589851 i cant be bothered to draw groomsmen for anthony or make up names for them
7589852 and love or hate iris it gives me a pang of sympathy to think theyre all standing there enjoying themselves and iris is in the hospital alone worrying over jim
7589853 i like the wall of text it makes for a good game of spot the irony your friends and family will be there to guide and support you i think johns though bubbling about gaining an accountant someone to do his taxes and retirement planning for free is the most honest thing a character has said thought about this wedding in weeks or ever
7589854 i guess we know theyll be supportive of this marriage since theyve been supporting it since before his first wedding
7589855 where is nick isnt he lawrences partner didnt he help donate all these flowers why dont i see him when i see lawrence
7589856 she hasnt noticed because the whole jim heart attack plotline was a lj got bored with or she just cant handle more than one thread in her magic wedding story at a time
7589857 how nice john wont have to pay someone to do his taxes anymore isnt that fabulous for him choosing your daughters spouse to benefit yourself its not just happening in rural india people
7589858 ive resigned myself to the fact its a given and that there arent going to be any changes for the better i find it incredibly shoddy lazy sloppy work and its absolutely unacceptable from someone like lynn theres no excuse for this crap
7589859 i have a feeling we wont see liz with a big grin on her face even after the vows are said it makes me wonder if lynn subliminally knows this is a lousy choice and is projecting that through her drawings without even realizing it
7589860 how can the irony of walter cronkites pontifications on marriage here re blandthonys first marriage be lost on anyone there is so much of lynns ambivalence toward men and marriage seeping out in this strip its disturbing
7589861 it must really gall lynn that she has to deal with this lovely wedding when it just reminds her that she hasnt got a man considering this wedding has been in the cards long before rod left her it must really burn her ass now to be reminded daily of being dumped
7589862 i know this is jstf and assclowny but id be ticked as hell if my future father in law thought
7589863 john apparently has no interest in actually forming a personal relationship with anthony and really who can blame him but will be exploiting the marital tie to get services for free if all the stuff that folks gave out of the goodness of their hearts for this wedding is any indication
7589864 boy nothing like a teal lavender and gray palette for the wedding i would have stopped before the teal roses though
7589865 and oh my look today is august 24th the date that until recently historians thought mt vesuvius erupted burying thousands of ancient romans under a violent spew of incinerating volcanic flow and choking dust the officiant declares assthony and lizardbreath manipulative bastard prick and shrieking harridan filled with rage because children behave like children husband and wife and reminds creepthony to kiss the bride
7589866 damn i was hoping for days of vows and on the day of until death parts you we see grampa die and fly off the heaven and marian callously demeaning iris one last time in the strip
7589867 dont hold your breath we havent pushed lynn to her full capacity yet in a few days you may be looking back nostalgically at todays clich that thought kind of makes you want to take a trip to the liquor store doesnt it
7589868 and tell me what was the point of seeing jim go through another heart attack hes not even missed or acknowledged for a second
7589869 seriously as far as storytelling is concerned what exactly was the point of jims heart attack and not being there for the wedding especially since it was supposedly rushed for his sake was this supposed to be some sort of dramatic irony even if i were someone who actually wanted liz and anthony to get married i would think the enjoyment of the wedding would be marred by jims absence
7589870 there really was no point other than that lynn was trying to inject some tension into the proceedings all she did bring down the mood the wedding would have been lame either way but now its lame and sad because jims lying helpless in a hospital bed someone should have told her that the last 2 3 weeks of present day strips are not the time to be pulling stunts like that but she probably wouldnt have listened anyway
7589871 please consider doing a point by point breakdown of lynns i only have 30 seconds a day essay versus the last several weeks of strips between this mess of a wedding the cheap theatrics with grandpa jim and running a week of retro strips when she only had about 6 weeks left to go i dont see how shes used any of it effectively
7589872 im actually kinda surprised that they didnt do any of the cliches we were predicting
7589873 this was so awful that my hand reflexively hit the close button the second it finished loading i have only the vaguest blurry idea of what actually happened and no desire to know more
7589874 for all the ponderous dialog in the foobian strips only lynn johnston would skip the part of the nuptials that says
7589875 elizabeth patterson i now pronounce your free will dead and your life over you may kiss your creepy icky husband if you can stomach it
7589876 todays fbofw would look good on a hallmark card that had been set on fire and flung into a sewer
7589877 theyre finally married good now i can stop all this vocally challenged hovering at the brink of expiration shit iris lets fake our deaths so we can get the fuck off this shark jump like weve been planning

7589880 we continue to have the same goal which is to reach agreement by the end of the year a lot of work ahead to do that and obviously its a complicated time but you know its always complicated out here
7589881 what we have been trying to do is to help the parties to see how their own conversations might converge and we are going to continue to do that
7589882 extremely important just to keep making forward progress rather than trying prematurely to come to some set of conclusions
7589883 generally we have re established the sideways pattern in existing home sales since october which given the general down draft in a lot of housing data it is certainly good news that we seem to have some kind of floor
7589884 right now the sign is encouraging not that its over but you are starting to see a bottom
7589885 prices have come down more than we have expected but sales and starts have actually held up better that may be a sign of realism out there that people have accepted the fact they cant get as much for the house as they thought they could
7589886 the acquisition of amds dtv business which will become the core of broadcoms dtv line of business will enable us to significantly scale and accelerate the completion of our digital tv product portfolio

7589888 we believe this should help broadcom gain additional traction in its digital tv business where its current efforts have disappointed investors thus far additional digital tv traction could also help broadcom cross sell chip content into digital tvs such as wifi video processors and potentially others
