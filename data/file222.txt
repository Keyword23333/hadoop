2220043 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2220044 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2220045 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2220046 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all

2220084 when i first met with them they were excited to be part of the norman rockwell weekend because of their affinity to rockwells 1936 painting of a barbershop quartet
2220085 i didnt know at the time was how dedicated to their craft they were and what perfectionists they were
2220086 that was quite a day traffic came to a complete halt in dock square as everyone took pictures while we did our photo shoot they harmonized and entertained everyone with their antics
2220087 when we went to downtown kennebunk to shoot photos there they walked around and sang at some of the local businesses the daily scoops customers were in for a treat because they had entertainment as they enjoyed their lunches that afternoon tourists visiting asked if this happened all the time in this quaint little small town

2220089 its strange hanging out with people who are not rocky a girl said i have to pull out and my first thought was thats what she said i blame you

2220102 rocky was the underdog character that everyone could relate to
2220103 i felt like i was in that same situation taking that million to one shot and going for it just like how stallone by struggling to get the movie made when he did took a gamble with his life that idea appeals to me and whether you win or lose just going the distance
2220104 if a woman isnt cool with this the truth is going to come out in the end so it helps to just admit it up front
2220105 most people just assume that was in a rocky anyhow
2220106 after all there arent any more rocky movies coming out that we can get different songs from

2220111 for over two centuries of growth and struggle peace and war the constitution has secured our freedom through the guarantee that in the united states no one will be deprived of liberty without due process of law
2220112 without acknowledgement of the protection afforded by the constitution solely because the executive believes that his indefinite military detention or even the indefinite military detention of a similarly situated american citizen is proper
2220113 any person is punishable as a principal under this chapter who commits an offense punishable by this chapter or aids abets counsels commands or procures its commission
2220114 unlike senator obama who voted against the mca and favors giving al qaeda terrorists direct access to u s civilian courts to contest their detention i recognize that we cannot treat dangerous terrorists captured on the battlefield as we would common criminals

2220121 runs directly counter to russias stated policy of support for georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2220122 georgia will not allow any foreign state to use its territory for military operations
2220123 proved incapable to fulfill the obligations and keep the peace in the region
2220124 are not the facilitators of the conflict settlement but rather its instigators
2220125 after deployment of russian peacekeepers ethnic cleansing of georgians has not been stopped it is confirmed that during this period more than 1 700 persons were killed in the security zone and that the peacekeeping forces committed numerous crimes against the peaceful population
2220126 friendly countries to deploy international peacekeeping forces in the conflict zone in order to substitute for the peacekeeping forces of the russian federation
2220127 we think it could further aggravate the situation in the region which is difficult as it is
2220128 are episodes in a giant battle for controlling the major deposits of caspian oil and gas primarily for routes to transport the caspian oil
2220129 the u s military presence will help ensure that a majority of oil and gas from the caspian basin will go westward
2220130 with your putins blessing the united states has received military bases in uzbekistan tajikistan kyrgyzstan and maybe kazakhstan
2220131 in the long run these bases are for dealing a strike on russia not bin laden
2220132 forget about everything you have become accustomed to during the last 20 years because things are going to be very different going forward
2220133 today we are witnessing the start of a new era for the u s economy and u s businesses an era that will be very different from the 1990s and early 2000s because the effects of the knowledge revolution have started to hit a wall and this wall has a name the u s consumer
2220134 even if the housing market comes back from the deep depression it has been in for the last 2 plus years and it will come back the economic environment will remain very weak
2220135 it will be the consumer calling the shots rather than producers and marketing and sales people

2220155 the most important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well
2220156 we work so hard to give so much of ourselves away
2220157 this didnt need to happen but it did and its the worst example yet of what has happened in the record business the last few years
2220158 executives now think they are more important than the artists and its so wrong who was president of capitol records when the beatles signed who remembers and what does it matter the arrogance and the ignorance thats the story of the record business

2220163 das ganze kommt mir vor wie ein unglaublicher marketing gag der auch funktioniert
2220164 al tiempo que las cuestiones relacionadas con la orientacion sexual se han convertido cada vez mas en temas de discusion y debate publico durante los ultimos a os el estudio psicologico de estos temas ha florecido tambien
2220165 except in the most intensively used central downtown areas it hardly seems that the service complications accompanying thoroughgoing separation of pedestrians and vehicles are justified
2220166 the greatest fear of west harlem residents is that theyll eventually be driven out
2220167 rather the point is to recognize that they are mixed blessings if we can counter their destructive effects these facilities will themselves be better served
2220168 big universities in cities so far as i can see have given no thought or imagination to the unique establishments they are

2220177 we are very pleased to have natalie return to the gopher womens hockey program
2220178 natalie was a great player during her time at the university of minnesota and we know that she will add great value to our program she brings a wealth of experience at the international and olympic level that will benefit our student athletes
2220179 i talked to brett about that and he felt that was clearly the best way to go he had no problem competing
2220180 ted has been a true professional through this whole process
2220181 in my view he has no ego i thought it was really masterful the way ted handled this situation particularly the trade and mike has been solid as a rock
2220182 im wishing him well i think all football fans want to see him do well and we pray he will
2220183 you do it every once in a while and you can get away with it
2220184 if you use him one time for two innings you may miss him for two games
2220185 you may lose two games because you dont have your closer or you will burn him out eventually he will be toast
2220186 if you start looking ahead and say ive got to get through this then get three outs in the ninth thats when things can kind of unravel quickly
2220187 thats when youve got to go out there and focus on what you are doing in the eighth inning and get back to the dugout then you can start concentrating on what youve got to do in the ninth inning
2220188 theres going to be action on the bases some guys on where you better be focused on what you are doing
2220189 what votes has steve cohen made in congress that you disagree with
2220190 everything is as good as you will ever see said peter ueberroth chairman of the u
2220191 if i was to issue a gold medal id issue the first one to the people of beijing
2220192 the people you meet in the streets are kind and friendly
2220193 they have planted enough flowers to cover six cities the volunteers are working at every stop along the way the only pay they will get will be to make their country proud and i think theyll achieve that
2220194 there are so many places i dont recognize it is modern clean very good its a big difference
2220195 when i arrived at the hotel they already had a crib for my baby in the room with a teddy bear in it they have gone above and beyond
2220196 these will be perhaps the most competitive games in history
2220197 the majority of pollsters are picking china to win the gold medal count they have created a formidable system we will have to contend with for a very very long time we know they are here to stay
2220198 this is not a political movement our job is to put athletes on the field of play
2220199 it makes it a lot harder to hit fairways when the wind is blowing like this youve got to hit it right down the middle and you cant really attack these greens from the rough
2220200 the conditions were much tougher than i expected this morning so i was happy that i was still able to go out and put together a decent score
2220201 the putter was the key to the round i putted pretty well yesterday but the greens were spiked up so i was excited about what i would be able to do in fresher conditions today
2220202 you never know you might shoot an 8 over and it comes down to sunday and you can still have a chance to win
2220203 the course is playing a lot harder today than yesterday
2220204 the winds a lot harder i know the guys playing in the afternoon its going to be very challenging for them
2220205 i just want to go out there and execute whatever we are in
2220206 any time you step between those lines you want to be at your best so any time i step on the field whether its practice a walk through whatever im trying to be perfect
2220207 i think you want to continue to see the progression and if that progression ever stops and its not where you want it to be then thats when you would make a decision
2220208 but right now everything weve asked him to do hes done improvements that weve asked him to make hes made
2220209 theres been more good than bad but i just have to be more consistent ive felt like this year more than last year i can have a bad play and continue to have a good practice after that in the past if i had a bad play id continue to have a downslide in practice i had a bad play here and there and i feel like after that bad play i pretty much move on
2220210 so i dont wanna be one of the boys one of your guys just gimme a chance to prove to you tonight that i just wanna be one of the girls pretty in pearls not one of the boys
2220211 i kissed a girl and i liked it the taste of her cherry chapstick i kissed a girl just to try it i hope my boyfriend dont mind it it felt so wrong it felt so right

2220218 if you can get drugs you can now lead a relatively normal life
2220219 i ran out of fingers and toes to count the inequalities
2220220 the scale up of antiretroviral therapy is the most ambitious public health undertaking of our lifetimes
2220221 weve already accomplished the impossible in the last 10 years
2220222 we can succeed but our future is precarious the technical challenges are formidable and the political ones are brutal
2220223 im behind her but theres a large number of undecided and theres soft support
2220224 a lot depends on two things how the undecideds break on election day and the turnout right now the turnout is stronger in her base than my base
2220225 i still think i can win this but things have to break my way
2220226 he doesnt even have access to even watch any of this its part of being a parent and monitoring what your childs doing
2220227 i do think that people intentionally hurting one another isnt our highest form of civilization
2220228 if youve never been to a fight before you say boy is that brutal
2220229 we have to educate the fans educate the legislators and educate the athletic commissions
2220230 were definitely in a era where the nfl was back in the day
2220231 the base salary for the nfl player is at least 250 000 a year the minimum something like that should start happening
2220232 weve gone back 20 years as far as documentation is required it seems like the old days
2220233 however for people who have a good credit score and are not in a declining area money is still available to them
2220234 id caution people to be very careful do your homework see the properties have an expert read over your mortgage documents if you want to rent make sure its allowed
2220235 taking a weird guy and convicting him of mass murder
2220236 we regret that we will not have the opportunity to present evidence to the jury
2220237 they didnt talk about one thing that they got as result of all those searches
2220238 i just dont think he did it and i dont think the evidence exists
2220239 he said he was not going to face the death penalty but instead had a plan to kill co workers and other individuals who had wronged him
2220240 there was this little girl on the tape jumping up and down and marta said let her come to us
2220241 they told me i didnt need flood insurance in iowa
2220242 so he helped clean the gym up every day until it was done
2220243 you could see right away that she had that something
2220244 and that is so important you can tell the ones who have that special quality
2220245 she walked with that big smile and i noticed right away she had that energy
2220246 we would play games and i always wanted to come back the next day
2220247 id say about a week and a half before we left for china the gym was finally in perfect condition
2220248 and it was just really cool to be in the beijing airport and hear chow speaking chinese to people it makes me really proud to know that i worked hard enough to get him back to his hometown and stuff
2220249 this is a 15 year scandal born of ignorance and inertia
2220250 we now know that millions of women might have been spared hiv unwanted pregnancies and empowered themselves in the process if they had access to this simple method
2220251 the female condom is 18 times more expensive than a male condom its obvious why women are not using it more
2220252 todays settlement sends a resounding message to the entire auction rate securities industry
2220253 this type of deceptive behaviour will not be tolerated and we will actively seek justice on behalf of investors
2220254 each deal is going to be different and there might also be differences in timing
2220255 its going to put some pressure on issuers as well some are working with dealers to restructure and refinance these things but some are not
2220256 it is our hope that the prospect of a penalty will make compliance with these terms and getting investors whole a real priority
2220257 omar will be convicted those military commissions are designed to convict
2220258 theres very little question what the end of the road is for omar khadr if the canadian government doesnt intervene and demand omars release from guantanamo to face due process in a canadian court
2220259 the fact that hamdan could be acquitted and still not released makes arguments over the trial rules more than a little absurd
2220260 but convicting someone with unfair rules cant ever be just
2220261 any verdict resulting from such a flawed system is a betrayal of american values
2220262 hamdan is probably guilty and probably a real terrorist but what is unfortunate is that instead of having a real conviction in a real court we have this very dubious process
2220263 while it is important to convict anyone who provides material support for terrorism it is long past time to capture or kill osama bin laden
2220264 we cannot treat dangerous terrorists captured on the battlefield as we would common criminals
2220265 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
2220266 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
2220267 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
2220268 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
2220269 we have failed to bring down the incidence of hiv aids in msm because we have not tried
2220270 gay bisexual and other msm are largely invisible in many parts of the developing world and in the majority of cases subject to varying degrees of discrimination violence and human rights abuses
2220271 i wanted to try my hand at classic american food
2220272 there isnt that many degrees between the little street cart
2220273 we did it for people who couldnt do tacos every day
2220274 its very coarse and not many people like it i suggest you choose something else
2220275 im pretty easygoing at restaurants and rarely make a specific request
2220276 pre proportioned or that the chef didnt want the meatloaf sampled without its accompaniments
2220277 we would otherwise visit regularly since its near our home
2220278 if mr schwartz wants to come back well give him a sample
2220279 we see from the web site that michel richard will in fact not be at citronelle that evening because he will be at the pebble beach food amp wine festival
2220280 why do people think it is okay to bring desserts to restaurants
2220281 it seems as if people forget restaurants are in the business of selling food not renting space
2220282 there are a few things every staffer needs to remember the most important is no diner wants to know about
2220283 i was terribly paranoid that my customers would know that i had taken a break so i always employed a few tricks that eventually my co workers adopted as well
2220284 i can appreciate the need for metaphors and colorful language in reviewing food but i have to wonder if you actually have a working knowledge of the flavor of lighter fluid and what the circumstances might be surrounding such dedication to palate development
2220285 these incendiary and personal attacks have no place in our politics and will do nothing to help the good people of tennessee its time to turn the page on a politics driven by negativity and division so that we can come together to lift up our communities and our country
2220286 steves a star he has a star quality if city hall had a star then steve kanellakos would be it
2220287 not every single minute of every day has to be totally organized ill be with a lot of my family and theyre fun to hang around with
2220288 it is quite an honor to be introduced by your dad
2220289 i wasnt exactly sure what to say to you except to start with god i love our country and i love what we stand for and i love being with you
2220290 the integrity of the rest of the championship is at stake
2220291 im not saying durham deliberately prepared a bad pitch but if theres no penalty they and other teams with strong seam attacks will always want these sort of pitches
2220292 the game is going to be a shambles and we wont produce test cricketers
2220293 the pitch panel asked all the usual questions but apparently they think there was nothing wrong with the pitch its not sour grapes because i would have said the same if wed won
2220294 its ridiculous and i cant say how bad we feel about it even shivnarine chanderpaul couldnt score runs on that pitch if the ecb are not going to do anything about pitches like that why waste money sending inspectors round the country
2220295 both times we have had a pitch panel in my four years here kent have been involved they are used to playing on good pitches in the south
2220296 ask anyone what they like about meetings and theyll tell you instead why they hate them
2220297 surprisingly a study to be released later this year shows a great number of meeting moaners are total fakers
2220298 the chef cant really guarantee the integrity of the steak
2220299 it belongs in a coffee shop where the coffee isnt very good
2220300 what the deputies committee has raised is given the possibility that political fragmentation in pakistan is going to continue do we need to change our strategy
2220301 the argument that we may destabilize pakistan has taken us to where we are right now
2220302 pursuing the policy of public praise and private pressure on pakistan doesnt work
2220303 we need to enhance the capacity of hitting these targets
2220304 this is a highly complicated outbreak investigation focusing on products from one thermal processing line with a complex food distribution chain
2220305 all of the companys products are tested prior to release to the market
2220306 rigorous externally run tests and regular audits are also conducted to ensure that its products meet the highest standards as required by customers the department of agriculture and food safety authorities both in ireland and the uk
2220307 no other products are affected by this action and alternative supplies of the philly style steak and chicken fajita have been sourced
2220308 the subway chain would like to assure consumers that products from the suspect batches are no longer in subway outlets and that our customers can be confident eating in our stores
2220309 salmonella agona is very unpleasant but it is not life threatening for most people who usually make a full recovery
2220310 however serious complications can occur for older people young children pregnant women and people who are already sick with weakened immune systems
2220311 china has an ancient culture and this shows how the culture has developed
2220312 i dont have time to watch i have to make money
2220313 as long the turkish state insists on this war such actions will justifiably be expanded
2220314 we believe these actions carried out against economic resources have a deterring effect on its war to destroy the kurdish people
2220315 the world was watching and i hope they loved it too
2220316 i strongly believe societies that allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2220317 we have made it very clear that they would have to have made substantial progress on a verification protocol and that when the day passes august 11 we will take another look at all that information and decide how to act and when
2220318 i think we have made it very clear to them that that deadline is really not a deadline but a minimum amount of time that we have to begin making our decisions
2220319 not a measurable amount only a corner of a baggie
2220320 they advised us to get rid of it not to charge her with it
2220321 in my mind at that time i thought i wasnt being charged with the marijuana because they needed me to testify against my husband
2220322 at no point in time was there any talk whatsoever or any intention on the commonwealths part of not charging her with the marijuana charge in exchange for her testimony she had been willing to testify from the beginning it had nothing to do with the marijuana whatsoever
2220323 i guarantee you it would have been employed to the hilt
2220324 this possibility of a reward that ms ahmad perceived gave her a direct personal stake in the defendants conviction
2220325 this stake gave ms ahmad a powerful motivation to testify favorably for the commonwealth
2220326 the non disclosed evidence was sufficient to create a reasonable probability that the jury would see her in an entirely different light
2220327 did not receive a fair trial ending in a verdict worthy of confidence
2220328 were glad the judge saw it our way and we look forward to a full and fair trial
2220329 my reaction is we finally look forward to the opportunity to examine fully mr arthurs claim of innocence by assessing witness testimony and dna evidence
2220330 there is a good chance he is going to escape his sentence before all is said and done
2220331 having to face execution is something that most of us can never really imagine
2220332 i hired and paid money to thomas arthur not bobby gilbert to kill troy wicker
2220333 i hope to finally end this hope to finally prove the innocence that hes claimed for 26 years
2220334 what is it about george w bush that makes you want to serve him
2220335 i preemptively pardon everyone that might ever be indicted for anything
2220336 international law is something else entirely however and i imagine that some of those involved in this sordid interlude might want to be careful in choosing their vacation spots id avoid the hague for example
2220337 because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country
2220338 i call it the lexington project my friends but you can call it anything you want
2220339 we needed the woodchips to fill in the area the odours will be sucked out by big fans into the bio filter the odour goes through rocks and woodchips and then the air is released slowly back odourless
2220340 we knew a month before they were going to breakout we just didnt know when when we got there to see what was going on there were a lot of bodies
2220341 many gave false names because it was a great dishonour to the family
2220342 both japanese and italians could do as they pleased in their compounds the italians made there own wine and the japanese made their own saki out of rice and potatoes
2220343 we will do something just as wonderful and just as extraordinary
2220344 beijing has done something absolutely stupendous that everyone there will remember for the rest of their lives
2220345 it is our turn now and we look forward to it it is a huge challenge but it is one that we will rise to and emulate
2220346 we are not daunted we are really really excited what an inspirational show we cant wait to get started on our welcome to london in four years time
2220347 everyone expected an opening ceremony of epic proportion and china did not disappoint including a most spectacular finale
2220348 i thoroughly enjoyed my fish and chips served by the half naked man
2220349 the care of our clients is our number one priority and fundamental to this is giving them choices and respecting their wishes as adults
2220350 we are not going to comment in detail on every single aspect of the files
2220351 kate and gerry are as innocent today as they were on 3 may 2007 and if this number of people were in the apartment before the searches then i think people will draw their own conclusions about the strength of any material that was recovered
2220352 two years ago people were calling for us to buy back shares it just shows how quickly things change
2220353 wait until i get upstairs and see what the analysts have written about us
2220354 a very unsatisfactory situation made more so by the shadow it casts over the good performances across a wide range of our businesses
2220355 i dont want to do this job forever but right now you find me extremely galvanised to the task in hand
2220356 im not complaining about it its just that the speed of change is what caught everyone
2220357 at one level it doesnt affect you youre still interacting with colleagues about the same sorts of issues but the range of levers at your disposal is smaller and the pressures are on different parts of our business
2220358 so to the naked eye not very much has changed but when you get into the detail quite a lot has
2220359 its not entirely unwelcome many of the changes that have come about have been things where people have said this needs to change
2220360 its been the speed and degree of change thats made life difficult in this period of transition
2220361 maybe you have to be a bit of a masochist but its when things are tough that you really really do see organisations perform
2220362 im a great believer in adversity sorting out who the long term winners are going to be
2220363 happy go lucky very laid back and had a very kind nature
2220364 no matter what he would never have stopped his climbing
2220365 we believe the accident is to do with abseiling but we dont know the details it wouldnt surprise me if he had tried to help others thats what he was like
2220366 mountaineering was his passion he was very popular and had loads of friends
2220367 his eternal optimism and complete lack of ego will be a great loss to the climbing community
2220368 ian will be deeply missed by his family and friends
2220369 ian was clearly very driven and i have no doubt that in five years time he would have been one of the leading lights of british climbing
2220370 when you abseil you must take two ropes and he only took one rope
2220371 he was a lovely lovely man who lived for his grandchildren
2220372 he was a quiet inoffensive chap he wouldnt do any harm to anybody a really nice fellow
2220373 it would appear that the accused were only given access to lawyers after the trials began confessions were obtained while the accused were held incommunicado and in the absence of legal counsel and the court did not investigate allegations of ill treatment
2220374 in capital punishment cases especially the government has an obligation to rigorously observe all fair trial guarantees set out in the international covenant on civil and political rights to which sudan is a state party
2220375 qazi urges the appeal court to thoroughly review the 30 death sentences in line with the interim national constitution and the bill of rights
2220376 i hope the day comes that you return to your wife and daughters and your country and youre able to be a provider a father and a husband in the best sense of all those terms
2220377 they chose to make this a test case but they never imagined that it would result in such a stunning rebuff
2220378 the courts are moving to the position where government can fund religious activities and endorse religion without restraint
2220379 it takes you back to a very ugly time in history in texas when we killed people because of the color of their skin and their poverty
2220380 we have witnessed a frightening law enforcement culture in which the law is disregarded the rights of innocent occupants are ignored and the rights of innocent animals mean nothing
2220381 a shadow was cast over our good names we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
2220382 weve tried to establish a pattern of transparency and clarity about the way in which we do our work and im sure the chief will be cooperative and forthcoming in any investigation
2220383 if they deem it necessary to do that we welcome it
2220384 i hope the day comes that you return to your wife and daughters and your country and youre able to be a provider a father and a husband in the best sense of all those terms
2220385 i would like to apologize one more time to all the members and i would like to thank you for what you have done for me
2220386 though we dont think this type of advertising is appropriate for college sports we have tried this once before in this country and it didnt work very well
2220387 beer promotion during college sports telecasts undermines the best interests of higher education and compromises the efforts of colleges and others to combat sometimes epidemic levels of alcohol problems on many campuses today
2220388 we find it puzzling that ncaa advertising rules prohibit ads for cigarettes other tobacco products organizations promoting gambling and alcoholic beverages yet continue to allow ads for beverages with alcohol content of 6 percent or less beer the top alcoholic drink of college students
2220389 given the devastating problems caused by underage and excessive drinking much of it in the form of beer this policy makes little sense and flouts the core values of sports and learning
2220390 i think weve taken a very sensible very rationale very conservative approach and weve asked that any company that advertises alcohol during our games continue to include the message drink responsibly on its ads
2220391 i think weve taken about as a conservative an approach as any sport in the country while not everyone agrees 100 percent i think we represent what is a good balance in that opinion
2220392 our bylaws lump together names images and likenesses and the names are being used now so well have to go back and look at this
2220393 we will need to go back and look at our options we certainly are not giving up our model of amateurism
2220394 maakt een werknemer al duidelijk dat zijn informatie fotos en videos niet alleen worden bekeken door vrienden
2220395 democrats said bates 93 page ruling vindicated their dogged efforts to check potential abuses under bush and tentatively set hearings for september they said they expected white house officials to appear then to answer questions about the controversy over the fired prosecutors which led to the resignation of bush confidant and former atty gen alberto r gonzales last year
2220396 bates left unresolved whether administration officials would be justified in refusing to answer specific questions under the doctrine of executive privilege
2220397 that question and an anticipated white house appeal means the controversy is likely to spill over into the next administration where it could raise novel legal questions about whether ex presidents have the power to assert executive privilege after they have left office
2220398 bates said he hoped that lawyers for the two branches would settle the dispute and avoid further litigation he scheduled a conference for aug 27 to discuss their progress
2220399 the practical significance of the opinion will depend chiefly on whether the investigations persist into the next congress and on how the new administration responds said peter m shane a professor at ohio state universitys law school
2220400 he said there might be interesting questions yet presented about the authority of an ex president to make even qualified executive privilege claims on behalf of his former aides but he said that in general it is up to the incumbent president to decide while in office what is in the best interests of the executive branch as an institution
2220401 a former president may still assert executive privilege but the claim necessarily has less force particularly when the sitting president does not support the claim of privilege
2220402 its an afghan government plan he gates has endorsed and we are now working to achieve
2220403 now who would pay for that those are the discussions we are just now beginning to enter into it would be wrong to assume we are going to shoulder this burden alone
2220404 we are going to work with our allies to determine how we can finance this necessary growth
2220405 quality versus quantity we are focused there on remediating and reforming the police forces that currently exist
2220406 the main additional responsibility he is assuming is for the training mission which is just an essential mission for the afghans and for us
2220407 the sooner they are a capable fighting force and can assume responsibility for protecting their own people and their borders the sooner us forces and the worlds forces can come out
2220408 we are looking for options and ways we can streamline the command and control arrangements for us forces in
2220409 we are working on mediation efforts to secure a cease fire and we are urging the parties to restart their dialogue
2220410 we are asking our friends and the united states among them to somehow to try to mediate and try to persuade russia to stop this military aggression and invasion of georgia
2220411 what we heard is that the state department and the entire administration is deeply concerned and that they are heavily engaged with russia trying to de escalate the situation
2220412 what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2220413 to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in
2220414 all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia
2220415 we cant keep going back at it with pakistan cmon man where would that leave us
2220416 weve done war were in a different place now its not about india pakistan
2220417 its about india what can we do as a country what can we achieve
2220418 what do i care for pakistan we should all leave each other alone
2220419 we know the promise is weak but there is relatively little india can do short of military action and we do not have the stomach for that
2220420 danger is everywhere but i have to live my life
2220421 hes not here now and i am you cant reserve a spot in a checkout line
2220422 the issue at hand is not so much gun related as it is ensuring that district of columbia elected officials be able to discharge the duties for which their constituents elected them
2220423 this is to acknowledge with grateful thanks your contribution to mrs churchills red cross aid to russia fund
2220424 the address on the letter is not in doncaster but it is in the south yorkshire area
2220425 i am confident it is not a reproduction as it is hand written on both sides
2220426 we urge anyone with information about the letter or who believe it may belong to them to get in touch with us
2220427 we cant believe they arent coming they are boycotting and marginalising the families
2220428 we decided that we would support the main event on the friday
2220429 that is the official one the one on the sunday is not official
2220430 theres a whole range of issues ive got problems with
2220431 the whole wording issue and some of the politicians that are going to be there i think theyve the council have made a real mess of it altogether
2220432 they certainly didnt consult with us about the event there are more than ten families who wont be there
2220433 i have no objection with a family going its their choice but i certainly wont be part of it
2220434 as a council we have tried to do our best to mark the anniversary
2220435 i realise its a sensitive time and different people will react differently
2220436 but i cant legislate for how some families are going to react thats their prerogative
2220437 the un security council referred darfur and the other countries came forward voluntarily
2220438 strengthening domestic prosecutions so that the icc does not have to intervene should be the ultimate goal of every state
2220439 the resolve the african governments have to say that impunity must end
2220440 from a posture of active opposition to the very existence of the court to a position much closer to acquiescence in the courts existence even though it had problems with its conception
2220441 it is encouraging that you no longer see a strong effort within the republican caucus in congress or within the pentagon or the state department to dream up new initiatives to oppose the court
2220442 but that doesnt mean the united states has now turned the corner to seek out ways to cooperate with the court
2220443 because this is the first case there are a great many unresolved issues and potential bugs in the system about how the icc is to conduct judicial proceedings
2220444 the prosecutor rightly wanted to have a case that was very simple very clean with very strong evidence
2220445 like the quality of the air the athletes are due to perform in
2220446 beijing has come up short on the standards it set for itself
2220447 it was about seven oclock and i hadnt had any breakfast
2220448 id eaten about half of it when there was a nasty crunch at my back teeth
2220449 i spat it out and when i realised what it was i was physically sick out the van although my mate thought it was hilarious
2220450 it appears that the object came in with a delivery of fresh mushrooms and had not been removed by our rigorous washing process which is an extremely rare occurrence
2220451 we have sent a further letter of apology to mr enticknap along with 25 for the inconvenience caused and we thanked mr enticknap for taking the trouble to bring the matter to our attention
2220452 this was a whole snail and even if it escaped the washing process i dont understand how it got through the slicing and chopping
2220453 he was smart enough not to run for public office
2220454 i lament with some nostalgia over last years winner big red whos no longer with us perhaps i had part of him in a pepperoni pizza who knows
2220455 its a little disconcerting to me sometimes when i turn on the television set and also hear from my opponent senator obama we cant do this we cant do that we cant drill off shore we cant reprocess spent nuclear fuel we cant store spend nuclear fuel we cant feed the world my friends we can thats what americas all about thats what americas been about since our beginning
2220456 i believe that were coming on in the state of iowa have no doubt that in this race and in iowa im the underdog and weve got a lot of work to do and weve got a tough fight ahead of us but i have been an underdog in numerous times in my political life and in my life to tell you the truth and so im confident that we can win in this state and it would be a great honor we have a tough fight ahead of us we have a head wind a tough economy the republican party should be in a lot better state we republicans let spending get completely out of control and we dispirited our base
2220457 now we have to just energize the party weve got a lot of work to do weve got to reach the independent weve got to find the old and new reagan democrats and maybe an occasional clinton democrat in our efforts
2220458 you know and i know that sen obama will give a great speech at their convention before 75 000 people in denver i dont expect to match up with that and in the debates i expect him to do extremely well in the debates hes very very good
2220459 but i think its going to be substance that matters and i think its going to be vision for america and i think its going to be concrete plans of action but dont under estimate the challenge that we face
2220460 i really hate jaywalkers i despise them since i dont run the country all i can do is yell at em the other option is to run em over but as a compassionate conservative i would never do that
2220461 game show host and animal activist bob barker left weighed in on the deer hunt debate in a great falls neighborhood urging virginia officials to block it
2220462 he wrote up a couple of inches of copy on a recent murder victim but his editors cut it over space concerns
2220463 it used to be jammu amp kashmir now its jammu vs kashmir
2220464 the land issue is now symbolic and its the issue of our dignity as in the past 60 years
2220465 but by trying to choke us economically theyre proving it was only a marriage of convenience we too dont want them anymore
2220466 we cannot think of a better day to celebrate the beginning of a happy new family and the happiest moment for our country these two things should go hand in hand
2220467 we will always choose a lucky date for important events such as giving birth in the year of the pig or getting married or starting a new business venture on a prosperous date

2220523 bucovina is een regio die zich uitstrekt in het grensgebied tussen roemeni en oekra ne mijn familie van moederszijde komt van daar van het stadje tsjernivtsi bucovina is altijd een symbool geweest van een creatieve gemengde samenleving voor de tweede wereldoorlog stond bucovina bekend als een kruispunt van culturen talen en religies op de een of andere manier slaagden de mensen in bucovina erin om zonder problemen samen te leven die creatieve smeltkroes werd aan diggelen geslagen door het nationalisme en de racistische ideologie die de eerste helft van de twintigste eeuw de kop op stak ik vond het enorm jammer dat die plaatsen in continentaal europa die vaak ook een boeiende geschiedenis hebben nu totaal in de vergetelheid geraakt zijn aangezien ik er zelf wortels heb wilde ik proberen om de mythe en spirit van bucovina nieuw leven in te blazen ik wilde wel geen folkloristisch of sentimenteel beeld van die regio ophangen dus heb ik selectief gebruik gemaakt van een aantal elementen om zo een soort virtueel bucovina te cre ren als we bijvoorbeeld op een festival spelen voor een publiek dat weinig of geen affiniteit heeft met oost europa of de balkan zie je toch vaak dat de muziek die wij spelen bepaalde mensen zin doet krijgen om deze cultuur verder te leren kennen
2220524 eigenlijk hou ik niet zo van de term zigeunermuziek dat is een clich een stereotypering die ik liever vermijd er zijn fantastische muzikanten die dit soort muziek spelen die inderdaad zigeuner zijn maar er zijn er net zoveel die even goed spelen maar het niet zijn het gaat om het cre ren van fantastische muziek dat is alles voor ik met mijn bucovina club project begon had ik in de collectie van mijn grootmoeder al de meest fantastische platen ontdekt die muziek raakte mij echt en ik ben dan ook op zoek gegaan naar een manier waarop ik die ongelooflijke muziek populair zou kunnen maken bij het brede publiek zo is dan uiteindelijk het bucovina format ontstaan
2220525 zoals het vaak gaat in het leven waren er positieve reacties maar ook critici dat is natuurlijk te verwachten de afgelopen jaren was ik echter aangenaam verrast om te zien dat een album als disko partizani ook hoog in de charts stond in landen als turkije en griekenland deze muziek is enorm energetisch en het genre heeft een dynamiek gecre erd die nu zowel voelbaar is in het westen als in het oosten
2220526 nee ik geloof dat het net omgekeerd is sommige mensen komen me inderdaad verwijten dat wat ik doe niet authentiek is of dat ik de originele cultuur misbruik maar als je onderzoek doet naar de muziekcultuur van zuidoost europa zul je merken dat een heleboel invloeden terugkeren in verschillende landen dat is voor een deel een erfenis van het ottomaanse rijk dat zich vroeger over heel dat gebied uitstrekte maar je vind ook invloeden uit de griekse muziek de joodse klezmer en zelfs weense walsen dus zigeunermuziek is sowieso al een hybride muziekvorm daarom zeg ik ook dat deze muziek wars moet zijn van nationaliteiten of grenzen ik wil geen vertegenwoordiger van een bepaalde natie zijn maar van een spirit en die spirit is die van bucovina
2220527 this has an impact on my ability to contribute to the teams goals and by continuing i would be putting myself at further risk
2220528 there are two very capable athletes who can step in and help this team more than i can right now
2220529 the commonwealth isnt so big this is the world were competing against the biggest of the big
2220530 this was my main goal if you reach this you know youve really done well and i have
2220531 i was out due to broken wrists and ankles it was tough but i got here
2220532 melt down 1 000 oscars and mold them into a single giant oscar and place it atop his grave
2220533 if there is going to be a deal the deal will be modelled alongside the principles of the french model of governance in which you have an executive president and an executive prime minister both sharing executive powers i am told that there is no way that mugabe is going to be relegated to a ceremonial drama queen
2220534 as we stand here we are relying on information that is just trickling out of the talks and we do not know for sure at the end of the day that factually and indeed in terms of the truth if this is exactly what is going on
2220535 we could say we want to open the game up and play free flowing for four quarters but we know that wont happen sydney dont allow it scott said
2220536 not that we are going to try to fight fire with fire but we just know we need to be able to match them not only at the stoppages but just in the congestion
2220537 you are going from our home ground which is the biggest in the competition to the smallest in the competition so it does take a slight adjustment to your game style
2220538 sydney play very well in congestion so were going to need to adapt to that
2220539 having said that weve got some pretty strong forwards in some good form at the moment and the small ground gives you the opportunity to get it in there quickly
2220540 hopefully if we can do that they can take advantage of that
2220541 we are not kidding ourselves weve played three sides that are around us on the ladder so this is going to be another step up or two again this week he said
2220542 we could say we want to open the game up and play free flowing for four quarters but we know that won amp squo t happen sydney don amp squo t allow it amp squo amp squo scott said
2220543 embarrassed over his lewd on air comments about tasmanian mp paula wriedt
2220544 had enough of him and dump him from the line up
2220545 she got grumpy and thought that i was physically assaulting her but she should be so lucky
2220546 had enough amp squo amp squo of him and dump him from the line up
2220547 we have got the moonee valley criminal investigations unit detectives investigating a number of threatening letters allegedly sent to afl players
2220548 its so encouraging and pleasing to see that result tonight thats what they did i thought our boys were absolutely fantastic in just playing footy the way we want to play it he said
2220549 we know melbourne arent the best side in the competition we knew where they were but it was so important for us to stick to our task and we did that
2220550 i am very pleased very proud and love watching this group of boys play he said
2220551 some people might have turned the tv off tonight but if i was coming to a game of football i wouldnt leave watching this team play the way they played tonight it was just outstanding
2220552 they could have dropped off after a big two weeks but something inside them they didnt want to drop off
2220553 it was a level we couldnt even match from the first minute to the last minute he said
2220554 they geelong used the ball well and they moved the ball quickly they were intent and the first quarter was all about them and it was almost boys playing against men bigger bodies around the ball better decisions kicking easy goals in conditions that were slippery
2220555 it was incredibly disappointing on a very important night for the melbourne football club they really made us look second rate
2220556 i think if you have a look at the game youd have to say they were he said
2220557 again this floods over into their sexual meanings their sexuality is much more a matter of something that others do to them and define for them it is something relatively out of their own control at its most extreme edge little girls may come to realize that it is totally out of their control in dim inarticulate ways they may come to see themselves as the objects of massive sexual terrorism
2220558 children could be barred from joining sports and hobby clubs because of the increasing burden of red tape campaigners fear organisations which run activities for youngsters are already struggling to recruit volunteers because they must undergo criminal records checks but when a new child protection database is introduced next year which one in four adults will have to sign at a cost of 64 each it is feared that many groups which admit members of all ages will decide it is cheaper and simpler to exclude children
2220559 uhm yeah yer basically making up a bunch of bs reasons why its ok for you to do something that hurts people
2220560 maybe just maybe everyone else is right about this and you are wrong

2220563 weve gone for a very good mix of youth and experience and it will be interesting to see how the different combinations work
2220564 we will certainly look to mix our squad around during the tour to provide the whole squad with some quality time on the field
2220565 with that said we have named players in positions they are competing for ahead of our next super 14 season we arent just plugging gaps with different players so it will be interesting to see which players emerge on this tour
2220566 im excited for guys like pat oconnor and junior pelesasa who have had long term injuries and have fought their way back to fitness
2220567 it will be an extremely important experience this tour for so many of our squad and we are looking forward to kick off this friday night
2220568 that was fabulous youre on the hot tamale train tonight yes you are aieeeeeeeee
2220569 the point is the joys of gardening cannot be ceded simply because you end up with nothing but frustration the risk of abject failure is all part of the joyful process
2220570 everybody here is outta site you cant dance and stay uptight
2220571 the move is consistent with our strategy to focus on our core competencies which include growing our portfolio of publishing businesses and building multi platform communities of customers based on our branded content
2220572 we are keeping it intact we will use our consumer marketing expertise to help it increase growth
2220573 we use qsp and value them as one of the top quality subscription agents in the business
2220574 we also work with subscription programs that are run by time inc and i think that qsp is a good fit with time inc they have a dedication to the business and want to ensure that the magazine subscription business remains vital
2220575 how can it ever be possible to convey to people that we can suffer the same pangs of jealousy emotional distress at being parted from a loved one and suicidal tendencies when it appears the child who is the object of affection seems to have vanished for ever as
2220576 i get so desperately in love with these people any of them you know if i had any sort of relationship with anybody in the first place i wouldnt have it if i didnt like the person there comes a kind of possessiveness that nobody likes i wish i werent possessive nobody likes anybody who is possessive but if you are by nature possessive you cant help being like that and i always get very much in love with them it sounds silly to express what you mean by being in love i want that person all the time you know and i dont find many people like that
2220577 paedophilia leipzig study on the societal and psychological situation of paedophile males
2220578 these type of improvements continue to show the level of commitment the college has to athletics
2220579 these upgrades will not only enhance the fan experience but make merkert gymnasium an unbelievably attractive place to play
2220580 all images of child sexual abuse including drawings and computer generated images
2220581 this is a welcome announcement which makes a clear statement that drawings or computer generated images of child abuse are as unacceptable as a photograph
2220582 you are the obscene bluse ribbon you filthy fucking pedophile
2220583 62 of the child pornography they surveyed did not show sexual contact
2220584 immediate and unconditional lifting of the suspension on all ngo field operations
2220585 immediate resumption of food aid across the country widespread hunger and worsening malnutrition are unavoidable
2220586 its been disappointing to not follow up on playing finals last year but weve been severely impacted by the unavailability of guys through injury and the positive out of it has been the young kids weve been able to play this week we are coming off a good win but again lose three players out of the side that beat peel on the weekend
2220587 thats what weve dealt with each week and that hurts especially when they are the quality of wulff cowell and hancock this week and merrington glancy agostino and mills are quality players that have missed significant parts of the season
2220588 the experience of a tough year can only build us and make our future better the young players are developing game tallies now with guys like jon eastwell daniel macaulay and aaron sweet around the 30 game mark trevor oliver has been injured but will be back and they are getting a good solid understanding of league football
2220589 it was unfortunate he plays with his head over the ball and unfortunately got one that he shouldnt have he will miss the rest of the year now and its disappointing because hes just the type of player that we need out on the park to help our younger kids he hasnt had surgery yet because his face is too swollen so they are delaying that
2220590 he has massive head trauma and facial injuries which is basically equivalent to someone that has been in a car accident with the extent of the damage hes a tough character though and hopefully will suffer no long term effects from it hes certainly had a good year and is vital to our club and a great role model
2220591 were not sure if its going to be the season or not for brent but at the moment its going to be at least a couple of weeks it is a big decision now for brent to see if he will play for the club again
2220592 we have to make sure that we get him right and if thats the case we will want to give him the send off that he deserves when you get to that age players always weigh up whether they should play on or not and he is deciding that now but im sure he will stay involved with the club even if he does decide to hang them up
2220593 merro had his pin out last thursday which is why we named him in the 25 but we thought given the conditions on saturday that it was wise to get some more touch into him with a bit of luck he gets through training this week and will play on saturday
2220594 franks playing with a fair bit of pain with his knee but the type of person that he is means he wants to play as much as he can for us we just have to manage him during the week and do what we can to get him through the games hes played six games and im sure if we had him for the whole season wed have a very different looking win loss tally given the impact he can have on a game
2220595 marks was one of the best debuts of a 17 year old that ive seen we expected that he would do well given the type of kid that he is and he has a promising future in the game
2220596 luke is probably a natural forward but we thought it was an opportunity for his development to use him down back
2220597 when we have been at our best it has been with those three forward targets the two games weve had ben mckinley weve won quite convincingly with him noakes and merrington there so tom howlett can offer us that too he is still just a kid learning his trade and has lots to learn but he will be good for the future
2220598 don stirling has elite pace which is something that we dont have a lot of in our squad so to get him playing five games is exciting
2220599 when he gets the footy he is a real dasher and that will hold us in good stead ben noakes has been terrific playing a variety of roles and went back to the reserves on the weekend but kept his chin up and had 40 possessions they are the type of kids that we have coming through and its great
2220600 he was a mature recruit at 24 years of age and played colts back in 2001 here at east perth before playing in the amateurs
2220601 he was the all australian amateur ruckman last year and he has been fantastic he has got better every week as he picks up the tempo of wafl football
2220602 adams one player that goes under the radar a bit what he lacks in leg speed he makes up for with character commitment heart and is a great leader he has had his best year for us after a solid season last year and it has been good to see
2220603 hancock was terrific last saturday and we have been moving him around in different positions the last six or seven weeks and he has done well in them all
2220604 noakesy is a player that struggled to cement a spot in recent years but this year has become one of the best centre half forward in the comp he was recognised for him by being in the state squad and was unlucky not to get selected and his form since then has been very good as well
2220605 he has been a key for us this year and at just 24 he has six or seven more years of very good footy left in him thats exciting for him and us
2220606 joel has been getting better every week that he has played he started slowly and we knew that would happen given what hes come back from he missed last week but we are hoping he will back for saturday he will keep getting better and he and us are sure he will play at his optimum level next year
2220607 trent will be close to the best recruit in the competition this year and thats saying a lot with guys like ross young running around trent has been outstanding for us and done some good jobs on big name forwards when he was 19 he was close being the state full back before suffering his knee injury and he is regaining that form again now he is still young and has a lot of footy left in him
2220608 he has played the last two in the reserves and we are hopeful he is in contention this week to play we are also hopeful that tim has a few more years of good footy left in him
2220609 he lives down in manjimup at the moment so theres a bit of a travel issue there but he trains on friday nights with us and will play some league footy before the end of the season
2220610 trevor has a problem with his knee which he will have surgery on within the next couple of weeks he has played some reserves footy just to help us make up the numbers and that is credit to the character of some of our guys
2220611 sealy has played the last four or five weeks in the reserves but has a serious groin issue which he will have surgery on next week its the type of injury where rest wouldnt do it any good so he has been able to manage his training load and play reserves footy he has one more game left before having the surgery to get right for pre season
2220612 michael clark is playing at south bunbury as is ryan mackenzie and shawn colbung has taken 12 months off
2220613 thats more so to do with the disappointment of not getting picked up in the draft all that expectation became a bit too much but hes an exciting player and will be back next year
2220614 according to extra territorial law uk authorities can prosecute for sexual offences convicted overseas against children under 16 by british citizens or residents however since their introduction in 1997 these provisions have only been used to bring four prosecutions resulting in all of three convictions the successful use of extra territorial laws in the protection of children sends a strong prevention message consequently its use and promotion is essential in combating child sex tourism
2220615 according to extra territorial law uk authorities can prosecute for sexual offences convicted overseas against children under 16 by british citizens or residents
2220616 as should be obvious from the prevalence of pedophilia in the general population not all paedophiles molest children
2220617 one in four or one in five children are sexually abused before the age of 16 those critics would of course be wrong
2220618 british law often prohibits materials based on the possibility that they may

2220621 represents not merely a movement of crisis in the growth of capitalism but the very crisis serving a function within this growth
2220622 the metropolis is the general form assumed by the process of the rationalization of social relations
2220623 has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
2220624 willingness to let the force of the commodity rip into commodification itself as if unleashing some auto erotic self consuming energy
2220625 arises wherever this negative is completely internalized wherever the subject feels deep within himself the gravity of his task of
2220626 the indissoluble connection between negative thought and the capitalistic socialization process at a specific point in history
2220627 from the anguished discovery of the nullification of values to the use of a language of pure signs perceptible by a mass that had completely absorbed the universe without quality of the money economy
2220628 dadas ferocious decomposition of the linguistic material and its opposition to prefiguration what were these after all if not the sublimation of automatism and commercialization of
2220629 the destruction of values offered a wholly new type of rationality which was capable of coming face to face with the negative in order to make the negative itself the release valve of an unlimited potential for development

2220631 what we are actually looking at is the quality of the gas and the thickness of the coal seams
2220632 ideally we are looking for a number of coal seams each about two metres thick with gas pouring out of them but it doesnt always work out that way
2220633 sometimes it is hard to deal with misinformation and raw emotion in these situations but once we explain what the process is there usually a is that all response
2220634 gas for co fired power stations is much cleaner burning than coal
2220635 it gives off 40 per cent less carbon dioxide than coal and none of the pollutants

2220639 mugabe used to be my hero but i now consider him as a political criminal to the zimbabweans who were denied the result of their choice in the recent elections
2220640 whipped up the terror campaign before and during the elections
2220641 we have identified where the danger areas are and we will be looking to clear and slash areas to provide a buffer to nearby residences
2220642 we will be holding a meeting to discuss who we will be talking to and when we can talk to them
2220643 this will then be run past the streetscape sub committee at its meeting in early september as we will likely need their participation then signed off and put into action
2220644 consultation on the possession of non photographic visual depictions of child sex abuse
2220645 we note the absence of empirical research on this subject however we believe that the prohibition of such material and the criminalisation of those in possession of it is justified our view is predicated by the belief that any right minded member of society would find possession of such material abhorrent
2220646 we can find no evidence to suggest that the viewer reader of such material is any less likely to be sexually aroused or otherwise corrupted from that of
2220647 we can see no reason why the indecency threshold for nonphotographic depictions should be any different from that which applies to photographic or pseudo photographic depictions similarly we see no reason why the penalties should differ if there are any attenuating circumstances these can be reflected in the sentencing
2220648 we are concerned by the current proposal that would not include within the legislation non penetrative sexual activity between children or sexual images of children on their own
2220649 clearly any person within an interest in such animated images has demonstrated an inappropriate understanding of the need to be responsible towards the protection of children it is therefore our view that all images portraying or depicting child sexual abuse should be outlawed these materials encourage further fantasising and increase the potential for sexual physical harm to children
2220650 creating stand alone offences would ensure that anyone convicted of a relevant offence could be made subject to a confrontation therapy exploring the real reasons for their behaviour
2220651 a particular concern is and should continue to be the reasons for these images being stored on personal computers
2220652 although computer generated images cartoons and drawings may not be taken from actual photographs or images of children being abused the intention behind the making of these pictures shows an unnatural interest in the abuse of children the creators and distributors of these images should be mentioned in the new legislation
2220653 penalties need to be at the level suggested if the seriousness of possession of such materials is to be recognised a custodial sentence is an appropriate penalty offenders should be expected to serve three years as a result a custodial sentence of a maximum of five or six years should be applied as noted previously although it cannot always be proven that real children were initially used in the creation of these materials the intent and unnatural interest of such material is extremely serious and should be treated as such
2220654 although the society is not opposed to custodial sentences we are concerned that the adoption of a maximum custodial period would reflect a punitive rather than a therapeutic response our experience suggests that working motivationally with those presenting with such antisocial deviant interest is of greater value in the medium and long term
2220655 we have found that individuals can fuel their abusive fantasies by using images of children in different formats such as catalogues and even childrens drawings of non sexual subjects it makes complete sense to criminalise the possession creation and distribution of cgis cartoons and any other images designed to explicitly arouse inappropriate sexualised thoughts feelings towards children as technology progresses so to must our laws to protect children and to punish abusive behaviours
2220656 the justification that it is not or may be a
2220657 we note the absence of empirical research on this subject however we believe that the prohibition of such material and the criminalisation of those in possession of it is justified
2220658 a particular concern is and should continue to be the reasons for these images being stored on personal computers
2220659 is suggesting that people should only be arrested if they aroused by the images again what people think or how they naturally react is not the business of those people nor is it the business of the courts
2220660 clearly anyone who likes those images is a paedophile this makes him a danger to children this means he should be imprisoned
2220661 we can find no evidence to suggest that the viewer reader of such material is any less likely to be sexually aroused
2220662 today as we fast approach a decade of zinwas existence the plans for service delivery remain in boardrooms and all the nation gets are frequent updates of the challenges facing the authority
2220663 today water shortages persist and if everyone is to be honest with themselves zinwa is merely giving the same excuses for non delivery that local authorities gave when they failed to fulfil their statutory responsibilities
2220664 the city is currently experiencing pockets of high incidence of diarrhoeal diseases which could be attributed to the current water crisis but no deaths have been recorded
2220665 water shortages in homes schools churches beerhalls and other public places are of grave concern to the city as the hygiene in those places and the health of people is severely compromised
2220666 quality water provision is one of the items topping my agenda indications are that all is not well at zinwa in terms of meeting their mandate of providing quality water
2220667 consistently called upon the government to reverse the zinwa takeover and return the responsibility to manage water supply to the city council
2220668 we want a place for ourselves in the globalised world the question is how can we use resources such as coal for our own industrialisation
2220669 we dont want just to export raw materials no developed country lives just off the export of raw materials
2220670 we have the advantage of thinking about thermal power stations when new technologies are being developed and power stations can be built that pollute to the minimum amount
2220671 we should be taking drops out of the ocean instead of putting more in
2220672 in 50 years time will there by a vibrant middle class in tete
2220673 or will the same poverty continue and will the province just have more holes in the ground than it has now
2220674 a valid partner in dialogue with the government on matters related with coal logistics the supply of services social projects resettlement and environmental management
2220675 the well had significant hydrocarbon shows energulf believes the results of the operations to date have enhanced the prospectivity of block 1711 by demonstrating that hydrocarbons are present the company believes that the namibe basin south of angola will probably not be a commercial producer
2220676 i think this is great one way i used it recently was i set up a textmark for my daughters soccer team since due to weather and other factors practice times locations are frequently changing even at the last minute now everyone on the team can submit the textmark and get up to date information on when and where they need to be
2220677 edwards is smart hes doing this on another network when everyones going to be watching the opening ceremonies
2220678 elizabeth edwards has secured a primetime speaking role at the democratic national convention john edwards as of this point does not and people close to him think he will beg off
2220679 edwards had told associates he had been promised a prime time speaking role at the democratic national convention later this month but the revelation of an affair puts his public role in the party in doubt
2220680 i did not have sex with that woman ms lewinsky
2220681 you are discounting that obama would not have won anything prior to super tuesday and therefore had zero momentum without edwards sucking votes away from clinton
2220682 edwards said he has not taken a paternity test but knows he isnt the father because of the timing of the affair and the birth
2220683 if this was give coverage 1 year ago like it deserved it would have crushed edwards and helped hillary and there would be no obama or his braindead lemmings
2220684 as the law society we believe that judges should be properly remunerated but we dont believe that the remuneration should come from the reserve bank in terms of the law
2220685 we are concerned because some of the goods that were donated to the judges like plasma television sets are unrelated to a judges core business
2220686 there shall be charged upon and paid out of the consolidated revenue fund to a person who holds the office of or is acting as chief justice a judge of the supreme court judge president of the high court or a judge of the high court such salary and allowances as may from time to time be prescribed by or under an act of parliament
2220687 our judges are not and should never be a charity case the salaries and benefits of judges must be set at the right levels and be known publicly in the same way changes to presidential or ministerial salaries and allowances are publicly gazetted
2220688 the funding is provided for specific projects and the purchase of books and equipment the funding is secured from foreign entities and not from entities within the jurisdiction of zimbabwean courts this ensures that the independence of judges is not compromised by benefits received from potential litigants
2220689 senator obama will campaign around the country our surrogates will be active and the campaign itself will continue working with our grassroots volunteers to get our message out
2220690 of course attention will be diverted some but with only 20 days until our convention and about 90 until election day there isnt much time to lose
2220691 during the games were poised to be on the airwaves highlighting john mccains experience and proven judgment to lead
2220692 i would basically go silent for the next two weeks i think the american people have reached a saturation point with both senator obama and senator mccain
2220693 you spend some time fundraising you do not take anything away from the olympic spirit or more importantly the american athletes
2220694 the american people want to root for american athletes they dont want to be distracted at the moment theyre not going to forget that mccain and obama are out there the campaigns have to put the ego in check a bit
2220695 there are two marathons going on one in the olympic games and one in the presidential campaign and i dont think the presidential candidates can cease running their marathons during the olympics
2220696 all you had to do is think through the advantage that was given to someone like bush who could spend an additional 60 million in primary money and we couldnt and only spend the general election money
2220697 thats when clinton started his now famous bus tour going through the midwest we certainly didnt stand down
2220698 use a little creativity why not say if flip flopping were an olympic sport john mccain would be the first 72 year old to win a gold medal
2220699 ninety to ninety nine percent of the matter of the universe is made up of a dark matter invisible which generates propels and surrounds the visible like the sea surrounds the continents
2220700 synthesis and analysis are two wings of the same bird the rythm of the universes heartbeat tamed inside the infinitely small having mass successively contracted and deployed in the benefit of humanity
2220701 on the cosmic scale as on the terrestrial scale darkness or blackness forms an integral sine qua non part of color and light pocess
2220702 you need not take what we say about abortion seriously we dont really think it is all that bad its just this little religious hang up we have please please like us in spite of it
2220703 gives you the details you need to get your program running on a particular distribution
2220704 this is a beta program and theres no guarantee but yes if appchecker says your program should work with say ubuntu 7
2220705 programs c c symbols mostly functions with some global variables and libraries required by an application that are satisfied by dynamically linked libraries provided by a distribution
2220706 type information expected by the application matches the type of the object provided by the distributions libraries for example the layout of a data structure might have changed or the function parameter that had previously been a 32 bit integer may have been changed to a 64 bit integer another problem that cannot be detected by the appchecker is if the details of a functions behavior changes from one version to another
2220707 if you choose choose to share your results with us it helps the linux platform and helps the lsb get better for example it tells us what libraries linux developers are using that arent in lsb we can then include them in the lsb and that will make the lsb better
2220708 were at the lowest level in oil prices in months and there is a real feeling that the trend has turned
2220709 lower oil prices are good for businesses and good for consumers for the inflation picture and they will improve growth somewhere down the line
2220710 driven notably by its evolving economics iphone now unlocked greater subsidies leading to lower retail price and no geographic exclusivity
2220711 weve been working to introduce the obamas to the american people throughout the course of the primary season and the general election and will continue to do so
2220712 voters need to get a sense of who they are as a family
2220713 i love to look glamorous when theres a wonderful purposeful event that is appropriate but when im in iowa campaigning with the girls i am in gap shorts and a t shirt
2220714 my first job in all honesty is going to continue to be mom in chief
2220715 she wanted to open the doors and let america see who she is she invited ebony into her inner circle
2220716 for an intimate conversation about how they live their lives
2220717 doesnt have to look good just throw the sheet over it
2220718 ive had an opportunity to talk to people whove done this before i had a great conversation with hillary clinton i also talked to tipper gore lots of folks who have had great advice on how do you make sure that your kids are whole and grounded
2220719 please quit comparing michelle to jackie kennedy it sounds ridiculous and just forces people to look at her more criticly
2220720 name calling is the hallmark of the paid disinformation troll
2220721 i believe she wore red that day she granted semi exclusive interviews to one tv station and three daily newspaper reporters in arizona tearfully recalling her addiction which came about after painful back and knee problems and was exacerbated by the stress of the keating five banking scandal that had ensnared her husband to make matters worse mccain admitted she had stolen the drugs from the american voluntary medical team her own charity and had been investigated by the drug enforcement administration
2220722 i believe ive passed the age of consciousness and righteous rage i found that just surviving was a noble fight i once believed in causes too i had my pointless point of view and life went on no matter who was wrong or right
2220723 for the first time in my adult life im proud of my country
2220724 yes at times we were angry and at times we were hurt and to deal with those feelings in a society in which we were viewed differently we developed a thick skin a toughness that might reasonably have been interpreted as a certain arrogance
2220725 but we have learned that in todays america the better angels among us can and do prevail and we are humbled by the goodness we have found in our shared american dream
2220726 so whether you eat or drink or whatever you do do it all for the glory of god
2220727 those things really got me excited about student activities and student programming
2220728 its something i truly believe in a lot of people think education is just in the classroom but really life outside the classroom is a whole other aspect of the college experience students are exposed to so many things they wouldnt experience otherwise
2220729 but i want students to play a major role in the things we do
2220730 its important for all students to be involved in at least one activity
2220731 if theres something that fits your interest youre more likely to be happy and get the most out of your college experience
2220732 so im minding my own business last night making dinner and drinking a beer while law and order is on in the background is there anything more comforting than lennie briscoe sam waterstons eyebrows and the soothing chun chun of justice
2220733 i think treasuries are the most overvalued asset in the world bar none
2220734 i still prefer an overvalued treasury to an overvalued stock
2220735 will become worlds largest automaker by number of cars sold some day soon the growth in india is unbelievable roads are being constructed everywhere
2220736 it came about as a suggestion from uss new hampshire commissioning committee vice chairman doug bates
2220737 i thought it was a fun idea to have a beer produced in honor of the event
2220738 naming a beer is not an easy thing to do and we didnt think it was appropriate for any single person or group to come up with so it just made logical sense to put it in front of the commander and the crew
2220739 and i guess they had a great time doing it
2220740 we get a lot of requests from private people to do special beers and we say no to virtually all of them
2220741 but we thought this one had a lot of merit and it was worth pursuing
2220742 a hundred million bottles pause washed up on the shore
2220743 oh hes saying bottle i was wondering why he was singing about messages and bottoms
2220744 the salinity snapshot is made distinctive by its successful partnership approach
2220745 since its conception the event has been conducted as a collaborative initiative between industry government community and environmental and catchment representatives
2220746 it also serves to raise awareness among the local community about water quality in their catchment and encourage remedial action protection of the waterways
2220747 it has been a chastening experience and reporting a loss is something i and my colleagues regret very much
2220748 we are deeply disappointed to be announcing these results and apologise for the pain this has caused our shareholders
2220749 were in the middle of a financial markets crisis the industry is in a tight place and as a major participant in the industry we are in a tight place we are not alone in having taken write downs
2220750 i wont do this job for ever but right now you will find me extremely galvanised to do the task at hand
2220751 we reiterate our view that rbs has absolutely no need to sell rbs insurance
2220752 it annoys me when straight men assume those girl on girl snogs are all for them and i think its a pity when lesbians make the same assumption
2220753 thats what love is its ones own ego that one loves in love ones own ego made real on the imaginary level
2220754 i swear by almighty god that i will be faithful and bear true allegiance to her majesty queen elizabeth her heirs and successors according to law so help me god
2220755 senator obama and i share the goal of ensuring that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected i want to assure everyone we are working together with senator obamas campaign and the dnc and i am confident we will have a successful and unified convention in denver
2220756 i am completely committed to helping senator obama become the next president of the united states and urging all of you to do the same
2220757 i am going to continue to do whatever i can to help senator obama and democrats across the country win in the november
2220758 i have said repeatedly that i will do whatever senator obama asks me to do i am really focused and enjoying being back in the senate and working on behalf of my new york constituents this is senator obamas decision and his alone and i am going to respect the privacy of that process by not discussing it
2220759 the best senator i can be and to go on fighting every day for the issues i care about
2220760 ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
2220761 registration will get rid of all but the most vicious trolls and that would account of like 95 some sick nut who wants to go from computer to computer so they can keep posting even they will after a while just get tired of it either way it would get rid of such a huge percent it is well worth it
2220762 whats going on at wp the posts dont make sense anymore
2220763 fired bush backer one of several with possible nazi links
2220764 received numerous thank you letters from the republican national committee
2220765 profoundly affected the way america views itself and the world
2220766 i owe burnham a personal debt because throughout the years of traveling on the mashed potato circuit i have quoted him widely
2220767 nazi criminals were the principal beneficiaries of the cold war
2220768 the ultimate book about the worst kind of cold war thinking in which some of our most respected statesmen made shameful decisions that they mistakenly believed to be justified
2220769 ive been working my entire adult life to help build an america where economic justice is being served
2220770 youll start believing what they tell you about equal opportunity and the american way and all that sh
2220771 theoretically there is nothing that can stop the government from taxing 100 of income so long as the people get benefits from the government commensurate with their income which is taxed
2220772 i do not see why the government cannot tax those who have more and syphon some of these revenues into savings which can be utilized in investment for future development
2220773 i could bring church and community leaders together easier than i could as a community organizer or lawyer
2220774 the us will be the laughingstock of the world if oboma is elected
2220775 obama has put together an extremely valuable database of personal information of his supporters from his web site that can help tap donors activists etc for other democratic races so im wondering if he used this as clout to help swing the nomination his way
2220776 he clearly can inspire and motivate people and energize them which is a very important part of being president and hes smart as a whip so theres nothing he cant learn
2220777 he was very supportive i thought he showed extraordinary restraint in a fairly provocative interview while he was on his trip
2220778 george earned the nickname lips bush for his skill at giving blow jobs to his fraternity buddies
2220779 why is bush so hostile to the idea of gay marriage perhaps because until 1987 george w bush was gay
2220780 according to a group of 29 yale classmates who comprise gay ivy leaguers for truth bush was known to be at least sexually experimental throughout his time in college
2220781 one of bushs alleged former boyfriends anthony berusca class of 70 told the dallas morning news that bush was deeply conflicted about being gay even somewhat self hating
2220782 berusca is convinced that this conflict led to bushs drinking problems but describes the president as a gentle caring lover
2220783 in 1986 the bush family arranged for george to join worthy creations a church group in el paso that focuses on converting homosexuals through faith
2220784 a year later bush claimed to be straight born again and engaged to laura welch kitty kelly in
2220785 americas secret establishment an introduction to the order of skull and bones
2220786 can anyone think of one policy reason that would make a clinton supporter switch over to mccain
2220787 her husband has destroyed his legacy and hillary will be risking the same thing
2220788 this is mostly because the 80 90 vote along party lines this would probably be similar to republican numbers who would vote along party lines the other 10 20 probably have more concrete reasons why they voted for a specific candidate the democrats and republicans strategies of divide and conquer work pretty well considering so many people vote along party lines
2220789 unfortunately for her it seems like 80 90 of them are behind obama now now that 10 20 isnt inconsequential but it puts clinton in a much weaker position
2220790 there is a saying that the ends justify the means
2220791 and thats what mr bermudez the cia agent who commanded the fdn told us in honduras ok so we started raising money for the contra revolution
2220792 will admit that he was a large scale dealer in cocaine and there is no additional benefit to any defendant to inquire as to the central intelligence agency
2220793 whatever we were running in l a the profit was going for the contra revolution
2220794 i even drove my own cars registered in my name
2220795 and i was sitting in some meetings and heres meneses name again
2220796 danilo blandon is in charge of a sophisticated cocaine smuggling and distribution organization operating in southern california
2220797 the monies gained from the sales of cocaine are transported to florida and laundered through orlando murillo who is a high ranking officer of a chain of banks in florida named government securities corporation from this bank the monies are filtered to the contra rebels to buy arms in the war in nicaragua
2220798 cia winked at this sort of thing brunon indicated that now that u s congress had voted funds for the nicaraguan contra movement u s government now appears to be turning against organizations like this
2220799 was he involved with the cia probably was he involved with drugs most definitely
2220800 were those two things involved with each other theyve never said that obviously theyve never admitted that but i dont know where these guys get these big aircraft
2220801 he norwin and his brother luis enrique had financed the contra revolution with the benefits of the cocaine they sold
2220802 this operation as norwin told me was executed with the collaboration of high ranking salvadoran military personnel they met with officials of the salvadoran air force who flew planes to colombia and then left for the u s bound for an air force base in texas as he told me
2220803 dont do to mydd and expect their pretty graph to be impartial
2220804 the illegal cultivation of poppies for opium in afghanistan has reached a deeply worrying level despite the efforts of the afghan government and the help of the international community over the last five years
2220805 can anyone think of one policy reason that would make a clinton supporter switch over to mccain
2220806 i think they should stall for more time watching to see how the numbers move before the convention if i were them id say i have too much to do back in the home state to help obama out but will have time after congress reconvenes if his numbers are still hanging on through the convention then the clintons follow through on some real help
2220807 her husband has destroyed his legacy and hillary will be risking the same thing
2220808 if obamas numbers break clear of mccains range then the clintons should jump in
2220809 so your recommendation is for the clintons to wait until obama doesnt need them
2220810 nobody cares and we should all stop indulging their childishness and craziness and their imaginary victimhood nobody cares anymore
2220811 the convention is going to be a blast full of resentful seething women might as well make sure it falls on the day that everyones having their period a bunch of really wound up women drinking red wine feeling dissed and insulted can really liven up a party
2220812 if obamas numbers break clear of mccains range then the clintons should jump in
2220813 if obamas numbers break clear of mccains range then the clintons should jump in
2220814 through june exxon employees have given obama 42 100 to mccains 35 166 chevron favors obama 35 157 to 28 500 and obama edges out mccain with bp 16 046 vs 11 500
2220815 oh come on dawd fivethirtyeight com doesnt even pretend to be unbiased nate who runs the site is blatent in his pro obama stance and makes absolutely no secret of it
2220816 the first rule of chicago politics is to remember your friends and your foes
2220817 if all of hrcs supporters are behind bo then why is he sucking in the polls
2220818 she got more votes because he has a penis and she doesnt
2220819 but shell be allowed to attend the convention and shell have a role
2220820 we are working together to make sure the fall campaign and the convention are a success at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
2220821 im asked this question every day it is a question that is a very obvious one to ask i mean what will happen at the convention in respect to you know my putting my name in nomination a roll call vote and the usual kind of process that happens at conventions
2220822 were trying to work that out with the obama campaign and the dnc
2220823 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected
2220824 i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel that ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind senator obama
2220825 delegates can decide to do this on their own they dont need permission they can decide under the rules of the dnc i think it would be better if we had a plan that we actually put in place
2220826 it is a no brainer hillary was the only one who can talk from her brain and knows the facts that doesn
2220827 the most exciting primaries in the history of the usa stopped dead when hillary was forced out by the media and her own ignorant party
2220828 if obama wants unity then why isnt he working harder to pay off hillarys debt they made an agreement and she has come through to raise hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars for him and she handed over many of her endorsed unions and donors hillary speaks on his behalf and is constantly working to unify the party
2220829 shame on you barack obama democrats do not do this to democrats
2220830 ddawg let me get this right hillary clinton actually asked obamas small donors to donate to help pay down her campaign debt
2220831 8 regarding her debt dont leave out that she gave him 2300 also and he wants her donors to give to him so why should her donors give to him if his donors do not want to give to her you guys really do not believe in reciprocity do you
2220832 in an interview on new hampshire public radio last fall clinton explained why she was the only candidate who did not agree to new hampshires request that she take her name off the ballot in michigan
2220833 its clear this election theyre having is not going to count for anything i personally did not think it made any difference whether or not my name was on the ballot
2220834 race card race was always an issue right before an election in a state that had a good percentages of black voter
2220835 interesting less we not forget that it came out that obamas camp released a memo to the press about race before it even became an issue in the election which obama acknowledged and apologized for
2220836 2 like most powerful women she gets blamed for everything when did she tie him to louis farrakan it think it was louis farrakans endorsement that tied obama to him
2220837 3 again when did she denigrate people who have college degrees again it was the media obama campaign targeting and the polls that targeted those of us who are college educated as a matter of fact i am going to count that as a stupid statement from you because she has several degrees which would make it foolish to scorn other who have degrees
2220838 4 for the last time the dnc made them sign a pledge stating that they would not campaign in either of those states where in the statement did it say that they should not count and apparently the dnc and now obama agress that the should be seated 100 not 1 2 so give her credit for being the great forward thinking leader that she is by realizing that the dumb dems would need these states in november
2220839 5 okay so we are back on racial divisiveness well if black can be racist then so can whites so if blacks voted 90 for obama then whites can do the same as a black person i wish that more whites had voted along racial lines
2220840 8 settling the debt why should she not ask for obama to settle her debt since he is asking her donors to increase his coffers
2220841 and if you were the loyal democrat you claim to be youd support him
2220842 i dont know what the problem is with the obama camp they are negotiating her role kennedy kerry and even howard dean had there names placed in nomination
2220843 she s just a devil woman with evil on her mind beware the devil woman she s gonna get you she s just a devil woman with evil on her mind beware the devil woman she s gonna get you from behind
2220844 michael cornfield an adjunct professor at george washington university and an executive with a company that markets political organizing software says mccains program has a couple of bugs
2220845 the first he says is the lack of disclosure instructions to participants
2220846 caucuses are unfair small states have too much power lets change everything retroactively to make hillary win
2220847 theres a no chance obama will agree to share the stage with the woman who dared challenge his audacity
2220848 ddawg you still do not want to acknowledge that mi delegates were taken from her i understand you just can not mumble the words even
2220849 you know it is unfathomiable to me that hillary is so villified by so many who can not honestly say why they sincerly do not like her
2220850 tamara you should vote for obama because he will do the same things as president that hillary clinton would have they both want to get out of iraq and protect the middle class and reform our healthcare system and fix the problems caused by 8 years of the bush administration mccain on the other hand wants to continue the bush policies but obviously you dont care about any of that you dont care about this country you just want to hold a pointless grudge and elect president mccain out of spite shame on you
2220851 ddawg if you are a true democrat then you would be aware that when it was decided to count michigan then some of the delegates that belonged to hillary based upon the percentages were taken away and given to obama
2220852 hillarys deranged supporters we want our way or well ruin you cause we dont care if we ruin ourselves doing so reflect the narcissism that is cancerous in our society
2220853 i just wish she would do more to try and defuse the whole thing her behavior is probably just hurting the people she is professing to want to help i think the party was starting to come together
2220854 at the end of the day people will not acknowledge that hillary clinton was wronged by the democratic party
2220855 if obama doesnt like the classic and established nomination processes of the democratic party
2220856 in 1872 douglass became the first african american nominated for vice president of the united states as victoria woodhulls running mate on the equal rights party ticket
2220857 barack is as american as apple pie raised in the heartland but he also has the experience most people face today raised by several family members strong single mom has international heritage too
2220858 if you dont like caucuses then move to abolish them before the election is held
2220859 if the polls are right a public tired of republicans is beginning to think an increasingly bothersome obama would be no better and maybe a lot worse
2220860 in a tough year like this democrats could probably have defeated republican john mccain with a flawed but seasoned candidate like hillary clinton but long suffering liberals convinced their party to go with a messiah rather than a dependable nominee and thereby they probably will get neither
2220861 even her own party didnt support hillary clinton so why should you
2220862 requests to nominate a presidential candidate shall be in writing and shall have affixed thereto the written approval of the proposed nominee
2220863 aspergirl where on earth did you get the idea that i was a supporter of senator obama
2220864 so if your political appetite would so easily permit you to willingly and knowingly cast a vote for a culturally stunted septuagenarian military monomaniac like mccain then that vote would indeed reflect the total absence of any moral compass
2220865 your reflexively tribal prejudiced ideas more or less put you in the obama camp thats how they talk among themselves go look at dailykos
2220866 so if your political appetite would so easily permit you to willingly and knowingly cast a vote for a culturally stunted septuagenarian military monomaniac like mccain then that vote would indeed reflect the total absence of any moral compass
2220867 remember that its not so hard to switch from a centrist clinton to a centrist mccain why would you assume wed vote democratic ticket reflexively
2220868 just as fdr ted kennedy and all her male counterparts have done for hundreds of years yes hillarys name should be put into nomination whats the harm
2220869 oh and if lunatic hillary supporters actually carry through with your threats and vote for mccain then you idiots do not desrve the right to vote
2220870 no aspergirl were sick of posters like you who spout drivel and have no back up show is the link to your sources
2220871 freesia2 registered independent here and im hoping that somewhere here can give me information are you the democratic party or the clinton party it would help if that were made clear its getting a little confusing i cant tell if the party belongs to a large group or to bill and hillary clinton exclusively in which case it would something of the monarchy party and im not interested in voting for it thanks in advance for the information posted 07 11 pm on 08 06 2008
2220872 ladies get a grip there is no such thing as unicorns and when you wake up tomorrow unicorns will remain mythical
2220873 call 312 819 2008 obama headquaters amp tell him hillary is the only logicla choice even pat buchanan and david gergen say clinton can seal the deal for obama
2220874 but the problem is unless the democratic convention does the unbelievable and rejects obama and nominates hillary who was beyond a doubt the best candidate in the race weve got two very poor choices
2220875 kennedy kerry and even howard dean had there names placed in nomination
2220876 ive been working my entire adult life to help build an america where economic justice is being served
2220877 youll start believing what they tell you about equal opportunity and the american way and all that sh
2220878 theoretically there is nothing that can stop the government from taxing 100 of income so long as the people get benefits from the government commensurate with their income which is taxed
2220879 i do not see why the government cannot tax those who have more and syphon some of these revenues into savings which can be utilized in investment for future development
2220880 i could bring church and community leaders together easier than i could as a community organizer or lawyer
2220881 we corens are here now because the ancestors of these poles now going home used to amuse themselves at easter by locking jews in the synagogue and setting fire to it
2220882 the option to return to poland was not there for him for obvious reasons and by 1945 the poland he had left did not exist anymore
2220883 my sympathy for the plight of the modern polack is thus limited and if england is not the land of milk and honey it appeared to them three or four years ago then frankly they can clear off out of it
2220884 insulting even inflammatory in the same way as terms like nigger
2220885 weve received a handful of complaints about an article by giles coren and will consider whether there has been any breach of the code
2220886 negative emotions and tensions between the new eu immigrants and local communities
2220887 we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
2220888 theres been a drastic change in outlook by the political leadership from coming out show to lets let the olympics pass without a crisis
2220889 i think history will view the games as a significant milestone in chinas remarkable transformation
2220890 everyone knows im looking at the left back position i wouldnt say its a big problem but id still like someone to give us balance i just think a left footed player would give a bit more shape to our team at the moment theres only one player whos going to play left back against millwall and you know who it is
2220891 i feel weve got everyone fit which is a plus point i feel as if weve got people who want to play in the team and push each other if someone plays poorly theres someone there to step into his shoes the last two seasons we havent got off to a good start then for some reason we kick on and go on a good run so id like to get off to a winning start against millwall the main thing is we get off to a good start and get three points which gives everyone a lift its important we get off to a winning start
2220892 we believe that coal use will increase under any foreseeable scenario because it is cheap and abundant coal can provide usable energy at a cost of between 1 and 2 0 52 to 1 04 per million british thermal units mmbtu compared to 6 to 12 per mmbtu for oil and natural gas
2220893 mark takes over a key role within scotland at an important time his past experience in engaging with a wide range of stakeholders and his detailed understanding of the sectors will be valuable attributes in supporting his leadership of the councils future progress
2220894 a quicker and more effective way of discouraging this unlawful activity
2220895 many of these screenscrapers do not provide consumers with any useful services because consumers know that they will get the lowest fares only on ryanair com
2220896 however in recent weeks genuine passengers using ryanairs website have been suffering long processing times and slower access because of the huge volume of information being downloaded from our website by these screenscrapers all over europe
2220897 in all cases this scraping activity is unlawful and in breach of both ryanair coms copyright and terms of use
2220898 at a time when many people are struggling to afford holidays overseas airlines should be finding ways to make it easier for families to book and travel in the way that is convenient for them not making it even harder
2220899 this has never happened before airlines and travel agents work closely together and have done for years
2220900 they have taken a very very unfair and unreasonable approach
2220901 the coalition decided that it will immediately initiate impeachment proceedings
2220902 the coalition leadership will present a charge sheet against gen musharraf
2220903 if you ask the ordinary person what they are upset about in the country today is not the presence of the elected president
2220904 i will defeat those who try to push me to the wall i will go down fighting
2220905 the incompetence and failure of his policies has thrown the country into the worst power shortage in its history and eroded the trust of the nation in national institutions
2220906 ideally the army would want him not to be impeached but i dont think they are going to stand behind what would in essence be a military coup
2220907 we hope that 90 of the lawmakers will support us
2220908 unless something happens to people relevant to you you dont think about it it was quite an eye opener
2220909 three or four of them have already signed up but im going to get all the forms and try to get as many of them signed up as possible
2220910 the whole thing was a real tragedy i knew ben and played with him when he was at the club
2220911 we suspect this is a threat related to the olympics
2220912 it is a time when we must be extra careful about safety and we should not draw easy conclusions
2220913 theres nothing to worry about the park is completely safe
2220914 it is a trap if anybody tried to protest at these parks they will be arrested
2220915 maybe they felt that with the opening ceremony happening it was not an appropriate time to protest
2220916 no team came off despondent or deflated and none were heavily defeated or embarrassed
2220917 they came off buoyant that they had just played a team from europe and all wanted to know more about them
2220918 it was a great opportunity for the players and a chance for bridge colts to form a friendship with both maltese clubs
2220919 we could hardly be said to be flush with cash for education were in as much need as any other authority
2220920 weve had a good strong dialogue and we have received a lot of support so that makes it additionally odd that this press release has come out and theres no gloucestershire place in there
2220921 we were not aware that the government had 30m to divvy up for schools and if we had been wed certainly have been making our claim on it
2220922 i came into work and saw the news article about sir bobby and thought it was about time the club did something in his honour
2220923 i set the petition up and within two and a half hours more than 250 people had added their names
2220924 the man has done so much for ipswich town its time he was properly recognised for that
2220925 the area is closed because of a possible terrorist attack its just a defensive measure
2220926 we suspect this is a threat related to the olympics
2220927 do not stay on the same bus on the same train on the same plane in the same buildings or any place the chinese are
2220928 but if i talk about them anymore the police will come and take me away
2220929 take one second to think of the victims of mr hamdans support of terrorism
2220930 your sentence will be their justice your work is our justice and you shouldnt flinch from it
2220931 we believe that the notion of fundamental fairness would be deeply offended
2220932 david hicks got nine months then he was released he wasnt kept until the end of the war on terror
2220933 i dont know what could be given or presented to these innocent people who were killed in the u s
2220934 i personally present my apologies to them if anything what i did have caused them pain
2220935 was attacked by someone in the community who supposedly represents a higher degree of human decency
2220936 i have just chosen to take the reins of my career
2220937 we have a different view and mind set im doing it and im handling it and very happy very happy with it
2220938 i have this thing where its like okay ive chosen to bungee jump off this ledge i have to do it and if the cord snaps well i might as well enjoy the ride down
2220939 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
2220940 i write saying thank you scarlett for doing what you do and suddenly we have this e mail relationship
2220941 manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a non story
2220942 in view of the developments within the business environment and the strategic review process still under way tiscalis board of directors intends to review the business plan in the fourth quarter of this year
2220943 the changed conditions in the broadband market and telecommunication services in general
2220944 we are expecting the unexpected our preparations are constantly changing
2220945 climate change must be a wholly legitimate subject of protest and demonstration but if it is met by an arbitrary destructive and aggressive police response the consequences will undoubtedly be a continued alienation between police and many decent law abiding people particularly the young
2220946 what we are doing is part of a long tradition of civil disobedience
2220947 were not blas about breaking the law but the threat that new coal poses to our future on this planet more than justifies the actions we are taking
2220948 the searches have been absurdly over the top with everything from 26 foot banners to disabled access ramps taken away
2220949 its a concerted attempt to demonise people and alienate members of the public so they dont think it is safe to come here its a depressing a chilling attack on the right to freedom of expression and assembly
2220950 the climate change debate in the workshop was of a higher calibre than in the house of commons
2220951 from the moment the first concrete is poured to build the proposed new power station there will be a rolling blockade
2220952 we want there to be better information available for employers so they know exactly what undertaking these roles entails for their staff recognising the valuable transferable skills that an employee performing a civic role can take back into the workplace
2220953 if as some kind of gesture we said no to new coal fired power stations we would be in a very difficult position of not being able to develop this technology ourselves it requires some new coal powered fire stations for the technology to develop
2220954 world demand for coal is projected to rise by 70 by 2030 an average annual rate of 2 2 and the bulk of the rise will come from india and china
2220955 china is a nation built on coal so the idea that if we showed some kind of lead and we in britain say no to coal and china will say ok we will follow is just daft
2220956 we are responsible for 2 of emissions worldwide and we have a duty to tackle that
2220957 but the real gain here the real challenge and if we do not meet the challenge all is lost on global warming the stakes are that high is to bring on clean coal technology and carbon capture and storage
2220958 once we can develop those technologies we can help the chinese the indians and others to retrofit power stations and make ccs a component of new coal fired power stations that is the only way we are going to tackle this problem
2220959 if we were to have a moratorium on coal fired stations we would therefore most likely become more dependent on gas
2220960 i dont want to exaggerate but gas comes from some fairly unstable parts of the world and some not readily associated with human rights and democracy
2220961 i think if we did that at the moment when we do not know 100 that ccs is going to work the engineering has not yet been tested and no one is fully aware of what the costs might be then that would put an end to coal fired power stations and demonstration plant and people would build gas again
2220962 i heard an almighty bang and all i could think of was getting my boy out i didnt realise we had been hit
2220963 i went into his room which was pitch black and felt rubble on his bed i could also smell burning he wasnt making any noise as he was fast asleep i started screaming and then grabbed him and was shouting for luke
2220964 i have not seen it yet so i dont know how bad the damage is all i know is that the carpets are quite wet but i think it will be worse than that im dreading seeing it again
2220965 i have always been very frightened of thunder and lightning and i will be even more afraid now
2220966 i will have to live in that house forever now because they say lightning never strikes in the same place twice
2220967 i want to thank the firefighters and also the neighbour that came out to help
2220968 the lessons of the black flag orders of the first intifada have not been learned
2220969 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
2220970 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude and i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2220971 well why dont we do a hybrid of both candidates ideas we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars that way the offshore drilling carries us until the new technologies kick in which will then create new jobs and energy independence energy crisis solved
2220972 with barack obama his becoming president is them becoming president because michelle was there from the beginning without michelle he wouldnt be there
2220973 im going to have three bullheads in there i originally wanted six but the guy who has to clean it once a week said that hes not going to get in the tank with six of them hell get in with three once they get big enough ill have to get rid of them the guy who cleans the tank actually goes and catches the sharks himself because you know these sharks you cant just go buy theyre illegal
2220974 everybody just thinks im some guy out here thats punch drunk running around
2220975 i wouldnt be here if it was going to be a problem
2220976 trust me theres no difference between 12 and 13 years to me i could have retired and did all that
2220977 he makes me practice harder definitely running around trying to keep up with him
2220978 even though this is his 13th year in the league he hasnt slowed down a bit
2220979 but its still football youve just got to run and tackle the guy with the ball
2220980 if i can knock down an o lineman knock down some running backs hell definitely tackle whoever has the ball
2220981 im serious when you take on big guys like 353 pound offensive guard leonard davis and all that
2220982 ive never really gotten nervous for preseason games but im sure i will because im in a new uniform
2220983 it will probably be like my rookie year just get that out of the way and lets play football
2220984 a lot of people got tricked into thinking it was a hurricane but it was the destruction of the levee system
2220985 the same thing is happening right now in cedar rapids
2220986 it will put us back to how people thought about america after world war ii theres going to be before obama b b and after obama a b
2220987 a bit silly given some of the other people allowed into the country
2220988 when its believed their presence is not conducive to the public good and when they have been found guilty of serious criminal offenses
2220989 give him some color id give him better fitting suits john varvatos i mean i will say hes a man of a certain age so at least hes cleaned up and polished
2220990 tim gunn 54 telling new york magazine how he would boost republican presidential candidate john mccains style profile
2220991 the parties are working out appropriate arrangements for the children
2220992 at this point there are no child issues that the parties have not amicably worked out or are working out
2220993 nothing but trouble and every night she is partying if shes not inviting friends around to live it up she is starting fights
2220994 she was always my hero when i was growing up i feel like i have to be the mother now
2220995 it looked like nobody could fly over and get pictures or bother you really
2220996 i was as angry as a madwoman i said are you idiots you are well dressed people who look like you identify with society but you dont know whats going on on planet earth its incredible
2220997 we are hoping to accumulate at least one costume from each of his new movies
2220998 she clung to a tree with her son a small child in her arms
2220999 what attracts me is the curve free and sensual the curve i find in the mountains of my country in the winding course of its rivers in the waves of the sea in the body of the beloved woman the universe is made out of curves the curved universe of einstein
2221000 this land is ours and we will start putting up the khuta office again
2221001 it is possible that the president might still meet the traditional leaders as he is aware of the problems there
2221002 sikanjabuka is mafwe land and on june 19 all parties who attended a meeting of caprivi governor leonard mwilima including the masubiya chief kisco liswani iii accepted the proposal that the khuta would not be erected
2221003 we from the mafwe community were thus very upset when the masubiya started constructing the khuta again transporting poles with the tractor belonging to chief liswani
2221004 look for her playing the girl in the bumper cars and the girl on the carousel
2221005 two days later she got a call shed gotten the job
2221006 alexis says it was a lot of work but fun being on the set of a carnival the best part was she got to ride the carousel until 2 a m although it did make her a little dizzy after awhile
2221007 janvrin hit eaton in the face after that eatons head struck the edge of a pool table after striking his head eaton was unconscious janvrin hit eaton one time
2221008 we dont know what additional charges there are if any until we get the autopsy
2221009 to have a homicide charge you have to have intent even as low as negligent
2221010 it could still be ruled medically a homicide to charge a homicide you also have to say hes being charged with an intent he did it purposefully to cause the death the cause by the medical examiner is important
2221011 we have no direct evidence as to whether she actually removed the leads or whether the dogs somehow slipped the leads suffolk homes
2221012 the weather has been excellent and i am having a wonderful time
2221013 its been so peaceful i havent been so relaxed in ages
2221014 i have spent every night under the stars usually in whichever hedgerow looks the most attractive
2221015 i should be a bit further along but i spent a day in cambridge and another in kings lynn which was lovely
2221016 my feet were sore for a while when they got wet as i was walking along a canal path but apart from one small blister they have been fine
2221017 i walk from when i wake up from 4am onwards until when i feel like packing it in but i make sure i take lots of breaks in between
2221018 the defendant hit her husband first on the head and then in the back mr blow went upstairs to bed where he realised that he was wounded
2221019 on the night of the incident she was feeling very low and had felt her depression was returning she cant explain why it happened but said that something just snapped and she had no intention of causing her husband serious harm
2221020 mrs blow bitterly regrets her actions wishes she hadnt done it and has since volunteered to attend an anger management course
2221021 stabbing someone with a glass is a serious offence and we believe it crosses the threshold of a custodial sentence
2221022 it was always something that i liked doing when i was younger
2221023 people should sign the petition because it is an important campaign
2221024 we need to raise awareness because if we dont fight for it it will definitely be taken away
2221025 im hoping people will be responsive as they have been in the past about other changes that are bad for felixstowe folk
2221026 in felixstowe we have a higher proportion of over 60s so a higher proportion of our population will be affected by head and neck cancer
2221027 and they will have no choice but to travel long distances for treatment
2221028 we feel the decision has been forced through and not really thought about
2221029 police coastguards suffolk lowland search and rescue and network rail were looking for an 88 year old male who disappeared in ipswich suffolk homes
2221030 we have had a few confirmed cases of measles this year but not a lot however the problem is the take up it is on par with the national level of 85 per cent but it is too low
2221031 we need to raise the level to 90 95pc to stop outbreaks were just waiting for things to become worse as children get older they will go to school and be in closer proximity with one another and more outbreaks will happen
2221032 my advice is for children to be vaccinated against measles measles is a serious illness that has the potential to kill children suffolk homes
2221033 das unternehmen wird sicherlich nicht so aus der insolvenz herausgehen wie es reingegangen ist
2221034 das in dem m rderischen wettbewerb im textilhandel bestand haben kann
2221035 decided to resolve this by insisting she leave the flight and then called the police to forcibly eject her
2221036 send yourself roses thoughts on my life love and leading roles
2221037 since he has never been arrested for drink driving dog theft or anything else
2221038 knocking over plates and dishes is far more entertaining and dramatic than knocking over clothing
2221039 all i can say is its not very easy for a woman to be associated with the beatles i think all the wives did suffer and i think quietly suffer
2221040 the lyrics are more honest than ive ever been before
2221041 its a journey album from one place to another a growth album is what id like to call it the aggression comes in the production and in the rhythms and the drums
2221042 rock star he walks into the world and he takes your breath away id love him to be president quite honestly
2221043 john locke from lost the marlboro man and a judo master
2221044 nancy and david are spending all their time visiting the twins at the hospital
2221045 i really want to apologize to the fans that were going to see me in those shows
2221046 zero tolerance policy against discrimination and harassment in the workplace
2221047 bring a book not bring your own bottle bring a book and they need a make out room
2221048 although authorities have not revealed her identity to us we know these allegations are false because david copperfield has never forced himself on anyone
2221049 marriage aint easy but its great most of the time
2221050 after conducting a thorough investigation which included consulting with some of the top accident reconstruction experts in the country city prosecutors concluded that there was insufficient evidence from which a jury could find ms norwood guilty of charges beyond a reasonable doubt
2221051 its been nine months so yeah i guess thats about right
2221052 playing china in the very first game i dont know if it gets better than that
2221053 i hope were not too excited i think it helps us prepare for the rest of the competition
2221054 we had to make changes in the past weve spent two to three weeks getting ready for the games this time weve spent three years
2221055 i cant even imagine what former olympic coaches chuck daly and larry brown had to go through years ago i wouldnt say we havent taken it seriously but in the past we have been able to do that and win but other countries are better now
2221056 it is a very good round to be one shot from the leaders that is very good for the pga championship
2221057 it makes it a lot harder to hit fairways when the wind is blowing like this youve got to hit it right down the middle and you cant really attack these greens from the rough
2221058 the conditions were much tougher than i expected this morning so i was happy that i was still able to go out and put together a decent score
2221059 the putter was the key to the round i putted pretty well yesterday but the greens were spiked up so i was excited about what i would be able to do in fresher conditions today
2221060 you never know you might shoot an 8 over and it comes down to sunday and you can still have a chance to win
2221061 the course is playing a lot harder today than yesterday
2221062 the winds a lot harder i know the guys playing in the afternoon its going to be very challenging for them

2221067 my beautiful boy no more chess games mate this is it couldnt beat you anyway
2221068 the most amazing individual old soul in a young mans body
2221069 well her friends theyre all here theres going to be a lot of people aunts cousins its going to be nice
2221070 an equitable confidential settlement with no admission of liability by any party
2221071 there was a time when i knew all the secondhand bookstores in the area
2221072 i know there is a second story bookstore on p street no
2221073 ive gotten some very good books that are worth 10 to 20 times more in
2221074 work on other projects travel and regenerate a few creative cells
2221075 if its done right it could be the type of role you called peter sellers to do 35 years ago if you dont do it right were going to hell
2221076 the good news is that lindsay stopped herself called her sponsor and got herself back on track
2221077 the most unfortunate part of this is that lindsay has to share her one day at a time with the entire world
2221078 its unfortunate that this happened but jason is resilient and hell receive the best treatment available
2221079 i was among the first seven chosen in the team i wouldnt pretend that i was one of the seven best basketball players in america
2221080 but the method of selection at that time somehow placed me on the team
2221081 the reporter said you know theyre being held in hitlers germany
2221082 ohhhhh i just had never given it a moments thought
2221083 i was told by others that it was absolutely imperative that i play
2221084 but more important what kind of propaganda team would it be if there were no jews on the american team
2221085 the magazine has caricatures of hooked nosed people and it lays the blame for everything on the jews
2221086 but not obviously as bad as it got later on
2221087 if you dribbled it was a splash and it floated away
2221088 these two teams supposedly consisting of the best in the world and each scored only four points in the second half
2221089 it wasnt our turn it was the turn of the other group
2221090 we didnt get medals until much later oh we had a lot of beefs by the end of the games
2221091 its the dream of all sportsmen to make an olympic team and win a gold medal thats what is on your epitaph when they write your obit its going to say an olympic games participant i guess i was smart enough to know that all the time
2221092 its a technical correction the hearing was held but never posted in the papers
2221093 it provides a cushion of working capital to move forward and was used last year to reduce the tax rate
2221094 this funding will allow us to operate and prepare for a catastrophic event
2221095 im laufe des nachmittags wird sich der flugbetrieb bei cityline normalisieren
2221096 wir haben ein attraktives angebot auf den tisch gelegt das luft nach oben l sst und sind bereit einen schlichterspruch zu akzeptieren
2221097 the aspect of keeping a low profile isnt going to change with a new facility
2221098 we want to preserve as much of the natural beauty as we can
2221099 were finding that many of the features of leed are what we want anyway
2221100 i am hoping it will directly affect the calculation of estimated family contribution because when any family has two children in college if they simply state that on the application their estimated family contribution is cut in half

2221106 bes desperately needs games and this serves a purpose because with all due respect to the reserve league that will not allow him to get back to the level he was at before

2221111 pompous religiosity where people try to demonstrate to the world how religious they are
2221112 even within the church truth has been substituted for spiritual relativism and religious tolerance
2221113 sexual immorality racism and abortion are just as prevalent from our pews and pulpits as they are in our secular universities
2221114 i am not offended i and id say most everyone else am simply amused that such empty statements are good enough for the sheep lets have a prayer for some vague reason so we can get in the papers
2221115 pompous religiosity where people try to demonstrate to the world how religious they are
2221116 violates the traditional one man one woman model of marriage
2221117 pompous religiosity where people try to demonstrate to the world how religious they are
2221118 the clause speaks of an establishment of religion what is meant by that expression it referred without doubt to that establishment which existed in the mother country an endowment at the public expense in exclusion of or in preference to any other by giving its members exclusive political rights and by compelling attendance of those who rejected its communion upon its worship or religious observances
2221119 violates the traditional one man one woman model of marriage
2221120 different views add flavor and it would be boring if everyone here agreed on everything
2221121 the civil rights of none shall be abridged on account of religious belief nor shall any national religion be established
2221122 congress shall make no law establishing any particular denomination in preference to another
2221123 things have been this way for a long time therefore things should remain this way
2221124 the posters on eds blog are not all or even mostly lefty obama worshipers who want to outlaw homophobic speech
2221125 who here thinks that people should be denied equal rights based on the comparative gender of their sex partner
2221126 the mere fact that they happen to be in public does not violate the text in matthew because they could be there with the right attitude
2221127 but when you pray go into your room close the door and pray to your father who is unseen

2221132 i cannot believe the state they have left it in i dont know if it was someone else that doesnt belong to the mela that is responsible hopefully the council will come and clean it up as soon as possible
2221133 joanne originally had the idea and asked me to go along with her and i agreed

2221167 if auditors made a recommendation that the firemans association files its taxes differently why didnt it get done
2221168 the previous board of selectmen had an opportunity to fix this
2221169 the first this board heard about this was last week
2221170 selectman bruno federico and i are the senior members of the board with two years
2221171 accountants make suggestions all the time i think recommendation is the key word in this
2221172 there is a difference between a mandate meaning you must do this and saying you should do this
2221173 were going to look at it and decide what to do about it
2221174 this board is not at all hesitant to review previous board decisions
2221175 i dont know what to tell you the previous board dropped the ball
2221176 somewhere along the line the previous board of selectmen dropped the ball
2221177 we have to do as the selectmen suggest us to do because it is coming from their auditors if and when the selectmen come to the fire department and say you have to get your books audited we have no problem with that
2221178 there are committees that have a fund for this and committees that have a fund for that
2221179 i think everyone thinks the firemans association is a secret society or something
2221180 whether or not the fair was successful we wont know until all the bills come in
2221181 what the poor network marketing best network marketing network marketing and home based business ideas
2221182 it is a big job its one im really proud of her for stepping up to the plate
2221183 she created a community of change at the elementary school and to ask her to take on another challenge was a presumption on my part jeni will handle the external part the community parents grants paperwork and les will handle the internal culture and climate
2221184 why he chose to retire at this point he didnt share
2221185 there had to be some reason he didnt share it with us
2221186 the climate of the two schools was different there isnt that comfort zone for parents at the middle school
2221187 if all middle schools were like that yes but we know of viable working middle schools this was a perfect opportunity to build from the ground up
2221188 i saw trash cans go down the road and then i happened to go to the back and all of a sudden a swirling motion began up above our house and fences and everything started lifting up out of the ground
2221189 i saw debris flying whole fence pieces flying up above the houses i was concerned about the safety of my daughter i told her to get away from the windows and go in the hallway to be more protected suffolk homes
2221190 im staying very positive and they are not going to get rid of me that easily
2221191 they were fantastic days and when we came back from wembley it was fantastic the fans were amazing and i always thought they were crazy in a good way i loved my days at burnley
2221192 approve the site plan as long as methadone is not dispensed on the premises
2221193 they put me on methadone to help with withdrawals which made me flip out we need to get kids off of drugs but not with other drugs
2221194 you might as well open up a marijuana shop up the road
2221195 im living proof right here methadone makes you stupid tired
2221196 was an angel sent to help pull people out of the depths
2221197 believe me we are very good at what we do
2221198 we dont want a problem we understand your fears were here to bring treatment to a community that needs treatment
2221199 when you give them methadone as prescribed they are not impaired
2221200 the company will manage the process with sensitivity to limit the number of compulsory redundancies where possible by focusing on reducing headcount through natural attrition redeployment and more efficient use of contractors
2221201 gleiches geld f r gleiche arbeit h rt sich zwar gut an w rde aber die wirtschaft der neuen bundesl nder abw rgen

2221204 august is going to be a flop this very unsettled weather is likely to continue another depression coming from the south west will bring more rain tomorrow
2221205 it will remain changeable with rain or showers on most days but it could improve by the end of the month
2221206 the clouds had been building up all day they got to a certain height and caused heavy rain and thunder i recorded it as a slight storm
2221207 wir wollen mit den rzten ber die bessere verteilung der honorare zwischen den rzten und eine moderate honorarsteigerung reden

2221210 streik ist eigentlich kein mittel um die bewertung rztlicher t tigkeit voranzubringen
2221211 it makes it very difficult to get out of school get a job and pay off these debts
2221212 senior year in high school was the most stressful time of my life applying for more scholarships than you can imagine
2221213 ive heard too many students who couldnt choose the career they were interested in because they were afraid they couldnt pay off their debts
2221214 so this is a real issue for students affecting not just you but the needs we have in new hampshire and our work force to do the jobs we need to be competitive globally and in this economy
2221215 theres no way to go back pay off loans work and juggle all that
2221216 we do receive significant help from the public reporting instances of illegal dumping
2221217 dass es hier viele familien jung und alt gibt die noch ber hrungspunkte mit der kirche haben und sich einbringen das gef llt mir und ermutigt mich auch

2221221 diese leute tun viel f r die stadt indem sie sie sauber halten und trotzdem m ssen sie sich von leuten im vorbeigehen spitze bemerkungen anh ren wie das ist die richtige arbeit f r euch da liegt ihr wenigstens nicht auf der faulen haut das haben die frauen und m nner nicht verdient
2221222 nachdem mein vorhaben bekannt wurde habe ich nur positive reaktionen geh rt keine einzige war negativ denn viele b rgerinnen und b rger teilen wohl meine meinung erfreulich ist aber insbesondere dass auch die ein euro kr fte den eindruck haben dass sich das bild gewandelt hat die p beleien haben nachgelassen stattdessen h ren sie auch eher aufmunternde worte
2221223 es hat ja auch schon gro angelegte aktionen gegeben wie
2221224 un viaje es una escapada un punto y aparte una bocanada de aire fresco una experiencia nueva un cambio de banda sonora una tele apagada una aventura una casa vac a otra habitaci n llena un suspiro olores nuevos sonrisas un portazo a los problemas un reloj amigo un cuentakil metros en marcha una maleta llena un paladar sorprendido unos d as an nimos un tel fono en silencio en definitiva
2221225 the chinese delegation has already decided that the flag bearer will be yao ming
2221226 i never thought i would be chosen to carry the flag but maybe its happened because a lot of athletes identify with me
2221227 its unfortunate that this happened but jason is resilient and hell receive the best treatment available
2221228 approve the site plan as long as methadone is not dispensed on the premises
2221229 they put me on methadone to help with withdrawals which made me flip out we need to get kids off of drugs but not with other drugs
2221230 you might as well open up a marijuana shop up the road
2221231 im living proof right here methadone makes you stupid tired
2221232 was an angel sent to help pull people out of the depths
2221233 believe me we are very good at what we do
2221234 we dont want a problem we understand your fears were here to bring treatment to a community that needs treatment
2221235 when you give them methadone as prescribed they are not impaired
2221236 he brings added veteran leadership and playoff experience to our backcourt
2221237 a terrific ball handler with great passing ability and court vision
2221238 the aspect of keeping a low profile isnt going to change with a new facility
2221239 we want to preserve as much of the natural beauty as we can
2221240 were finding that many of the features of leed are what we want anyway
2221241 it is a big job its one im really proud of her for stepping up to the plate
2221242 she created a community of change at the elementary school and to ask her to take on another challenge was a presumption on my part jeni will handle the external part the community parents grants paperwork and les will handle the internal culture and climate
2221243 why he chose to retire at this point he didnt share
2221244 there had to be some reason he didnt share it with us
2221245 the climate of the two schools was different there isnt that comfort zone for parents at the middle school
2221246 if all middle schools were like that yes but we know of viable working middle schools this was a perfect opportunity to build from the ground up
2221247 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2221248 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2221249 we are a freedom loving nation that is now under attack
2221250 in the end they just moved in its unheard of its unparalleled its absolutely outrageous
2221251 i dont even have a word for it im just so happy very happy
2221252 olympic hosts like to celebrate the unique aspect of their culture
2221253 and for the chinese this is an opportunity to introduce the world to a china that many chinese believe is maligned and misunderstood
2221254 expect modern flash and glitter and special effects that just happen to be recalling 5 000 years of chinese history and culture
2221255 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2221256 the stagnant air in beijing has helped pollutants accumulate i really hope in the next couple weeks well have conditions that will help us clear up the sky
2221257 we dont convict people on the idea that they may demonstrate eccentric behavior or that they had the opportunity to commit a crime or had the knowledge to commit a crime and thats what the governments saying
2221258 if youre the anthrax killer and youre this evil genius that knows all about anthrax why would you leave it in precisely the same genetic state one year later one month later seven years later as it was in at the time of the killings
2221259 nobody saw him in new jersey they dont have any restaurant receipts or gas receipts or surveillance tapes or witnesses wheres a witness that can put him in new jersey or put him on the way to new jersey or put him on the way back from new jersey or having in his car a new jersey turnpike toll receipt
2221260 circumstantial evidence sure some of it is but its compelling evidence and our view is we are confident it would have helped us prove this case against dr ivins beyond a reasonable doubt
2221261 if i were the government i would be saying that as well
2221262 i think the truth be told this would have been a very tough case and i think its fair to say that the government should be very satisfied that they dont have to play that out and see how good of a case it is
2221263 can they point to any evidence that shows he actually did anything that constitutes these anthrax attacks was present at the place where these letters were mailed ever admitted it to any single person or to himself in a journal or diary entry or discussed it with another person
2221264 no one received material from that flask without going through dr ivins
2221265 we thoroughly investigated every other person who could have had access to the flask and we were able to rule out all but dr ivins
2221266 there are dozens if not hundreds of scientists contractors students professors who used that same anthrax the very anthrax that would have the same genetic component
2221267 it is reasonable to conclude that the federal eagle envelopes utilized in the attacks were purchased from a post office in maryland or virginia
2221268 post offices that service the entire width of the state of maryland and then the biggest post office in the state of virginia
2221269 dr ivins had not spent this many off hours in the lab at any time before or after this period
2221270 i got your e mail making me wonder if you thought that i was trying to get something from you by sending you care packages christmas or birthday gifts etc that had me rather worried so i decided to send you the things but from different places and with different names
2221271 where is a witness that can put him in new jersey
2221272 there is no motive that has been suggested to me that makes any sense
2221273 it is frightening to me as a citizen and certainly as a defense attorney for people to characterize citizens who have trouble or questions or disputes with members of congress as having a dark side
2221274 thats the only thing i can comment to that that does not prove a thing
2221275 based upon the totality of the evidence we had gathered against him
2221276 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
2221277 circumstantial evidence sure some of it is but its compelling evidence and our view is we are confident it would have helped us prove this case against dr ivins beyond a reasonable doubt
2221278 maybe i dont have direct evidence that theyre having an affair
2221279 you have to infer that theres been a death and that its been murder
2221280 probably 90 percent of the cases that are tried every day
2221281 can draw its own conclusions based upon the evidence the government has presented and the arguments and contrary positions that his defense lawyer has taken
2221282 based upon the totality of the evidence we had gathered against him
2221283 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
2221284 this guy has been tried hes been given the sentence hes been given and if the government tried to keep him past that 5 1 2 months his defense team which is very dedicated to him would be all over them and i dont think the administration wants to brook that kind of world reaction
2221285 they also got slapped down on the conspiracy charge so they had a double defeat here in some ways
2221286 charlie swift who has had this case for five years and mr hamdan embraced mr hamdan raised his arms and gave a victory signal the judge quite remarkably said i hope mr hamdan youre soon able to join your family in yemen and mr hamdan said inshallah god willing and the judge answered him inshallah it was an amazingly emotional scene

2221292 it is also possible that he will enter the political fray from another constituency in the telangana region
2221293 t he distribution of photographs and films depicting sexual activity by juveniles
2221294 difficult if not impossible to halt the exploitation of children by pursuing only those who produce the photographs and movies
2221295 live performances and photographic reproductions of children engaged in lewd sexual conduct
2221296 reasonable for the state to conclude that it will decrease the production of child pornography if it penalizes those who possess and view the product thereby decreasing demand
2221297 allow persons to be convicted in some instances where they can prove children were not exploited in the production
2221298 leave unprotected a substantial amount of speech not tied to the governments interest in distinguishing images produced using real children from virtual ones
2221299 oh but even the virtual stuff fuels an appetite for paedophilia
2221300 it violates the rights of children they are too young to consent to sexual acts

2221311 our yard doesnt have very much sun and my parents bought the plot as a family activity all my family is coming and working the garden when they can next year we should probably get two plots
2221312 its an opportunity for people to grow their own food with food prices as high as they are
2221313 we started because of the high number of rentals in town and people dont have space to garden
2221314 i have just enough space at home for a row of flowers but thats it

2221333 i guess if you watch csi or crossing jordan that might help get an idea although those shows are a little over dramatic and warp the truth a lot i go out on scene calls for homicides and accidents do the autopsies and determine the cause and manner of death
2221334 we work very closely with law enforcement and the state attorneys we also help identify unknown human remains and collect toxicology specimens i also teach med students on occasion
2221335 i did my last six months at unh at dartmouth in hanover

2221337 have fun in high school but think about your future
2221338 this is definitely the biggest crowd ive seen here in my recollection
2221339 the board and town administrator were very astute in their negotiations
2221340 im not going to sit here and swear to you that its going to eliminate all dead zones
2221341 but it should significantly diminish the ones we are experiencing
2221342 this is understandably a very sad time for the patients family and i would like to extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to them
2221343 our second quarter results reflect challenging conditions in the housing and mortgage markets that began in 2006 and have deepened through 2007 and 2008 said daniel mudd fannie maes president and chief executive

2221345 bad news in europe is good news for the dollar and bearish for commodities said phil flynn analyst at alaron trading
2221346 the markets are more focused on the dollar and its newfound strength oil is less looking at geopolitical risk and slowing demand risk mr flynn said
2221347 we are delighted to have received the grading and look forward to opening our doors to guests who can enjoy a genuine stately home experience when they stay with us
2221348 its fitting that in liverpools european capital of culture year we are now able to offer visitors to the city five star service in a five star environment
2221349 during his five years as chief constable in cheshire peter fahy has been very successful in developing the constabulary his skills and experience will be a real asset to greater manchester police and the communities it serves
2221350 there have been groups of people acting anti socially in the area for example drug dealers and drug users have been hanging around and people have been driving off road motorbikes around the estate
2221351 the dispersal zone will help us to tackle the anti social behaviour of the minority that can make residents lives a misery
2221352 we are extremely proud of these media workers who are members of cupe
2221353 and we are proud of the support offered both financial and moral from cupe members right across the country during the time they produced and distributed m diamatin during the last 16 months
2221354 while the lockout was unnecessary cupe is pleased that mr pierre karl p ladeau did in the end take good advice worked with his employees and reached a negotiated settlement that final act is the kind of media leadership canadians want
2221355 the senator has a track record of allowing opposing views at his public events
2221356 corruption is a small price to pay for human freedom but exorbitant if all you get in return is a slight decrease in drug use
2221357 i have never made but one prayer to god a very short one
2221358 thats how the meeting should start this is a free country
2221359 do you think that its appropriate to interrupt a presidential candidate from the press risers
2221360 its our country we need to start fighting for it in the public square i think obamas response to this heckler was brilliant i do wish hed now proscribe what i recommend for following events
2221361 this is how a meeting should start this is a free country
2221362 given that we just celebrated independance day i thought id share with you a quote by mark twain patrotism is supporting your country all of the time and your government when it deserves it and with that will you all please join me in the pledge of allegiance
2221363 woo hoo im behind you a hundred percent but dont push it
2221364 the worst part may be that no one has to say it its just sort of assumed that you will can you imagine the bullying a child would go through if they refused to say the pledge at school when everyone else is saying it
2221365 uh yeah honey you look great no i was not just checking out the czech republic shes got nothing on you
2221366 freelance photographer john quinn was shooting for bloomberg news when he heckled barack obama at baldwin wallace college this week there are no more assignments scheduled for him says a bloomberg spokeswoman
2221367 because i dont believe it i cant pledge my allegiance to a flag
2221368 i proposed reciting the pledge only if followed with a speech that insured it was not a mindless recital by noting where we are deficient that was my whole point to insure it was not a mindless recital
2221369 putting your money where your mouth is walking the walk witnessing by deeds not words and im sure many other phrases
2221370 to put it simply the medical examiners office is where medico legal autopsies are performed
2221371 im a medical examiner a medical doctor trained for medico legal death investigations such as autopsies
2221372 i guess if you watch csi or crossing jordan that might help get an idea although those shows are a little over dramatic and warp the truth a lot i go out on scene calls for homicides and accidents do the autopsies and determine the cause and manner of death
2221373 we work very closely with law enforcement and the state attorneys we also help identify unknown human remains and collect toxicology specimens i also teach med students on occasion
2221374 i did my last six months at unh at dartmouth in hanover
2221375 i was in the caribbean for two years studying basic sciences in grenada and st vincents then i came back to the united states and did medical rotations in new york new jersey connecticut massachusetts and new hampshire after graduating med school in 2000 i took a couple months off and actually substitute taught at winnacunnet then i went to orlando to do a five year residency in pathology and now i am in miami doing a one year subspecialty fellowship in forensic pathology ill be moving back to orlando in june to continue forensic pathology
2221376 have fun in high school but think about your future
2221377 there is no greater offense than a crime that goes unpunished and it is even more outrageous when the kidnappers the criminals are police officers or protected by police
2221378 a life sentence or the death penalty is not going to solve the kidnapping problem in mexico because the problem the cause of the problem is the corruption the collusion
2221379 die erfreuliche entwicklung belegt auf ein neues dass die deutsche wirtschaft international gut aufgestellt ist
2221380 daher muss alles getan um auch zuk nftige erfolge im au enhandel zu sichern
2221381 obwohl auch wir derzeit sp ren dass die umsatzentwicklung nicht mehr ganz so dynamisch ist wie noch im ersten halbjahr bleiben wir bei unserer ergebnisprognose weisen aber darauf hin dass diese nicht mehr komfortabel sondern nur noch knapp erreichbar scheint
2221382 this thing is just like pulling a thread in a sweater it can go on and on
2221383 the state is telling us what we need to do
2221384 weve been working the past three years or so to get to this point
2221385 we are pretty much shutting down for the month of august to save costs were hoping to revamp this fall
2221386 we are putting feelers out and trying to make it work we dont want to lose this place and were hoping the community feels the same way
2221387 the nonprofit idea is still in discussion and the friends of stone church meet on a weekly basis
2221388 id say right now its kind of stagnant not going anywhere and we need a remedy right now
2221389 this will bring us to a stage in the process where we will know where we are going for the reactivation of these wells
2221390 well know what it takes and a ballpark estimate for a treatment facility
2221391 its being looked at as a redundancy in the system but redundancy in the water system is good
2221392 what happens right now is during the summer the raw water quality from the reservoir is less than during winter for surface water supply so if this potential source works out and has the yields that we think it may then you are talking about an alternative source at certain times of the year that can be tapped into when raw water isnt as good on the surface water side
2221393 burton boss nigel clough takes after his dad brian a bit he makes sure they pass the ball well
2221394 there was a storm going through the area at the time there was some extreme weather
2221395 the local emergency services are based a couple of miles away from the crash site
2221396 were looked after responded to very quickly and assessed very quickly and the ones that did not require medical treatment at a hospital were taken to a community centre nearby where they were assessed by our medics
2221397 it was a head on collision and the front of the bus has been destroyed
2221398 there is a big rock wall at the side of the road and the vehicle seemed to have been wedged in against it
2221399 i was sitting in the 6th row so i got up and walked towards the front lavatory
2221400 i was totally lost in my 38 years in the united states i have flown several times have never been treated like this i was confused frustrated and did not know what to do except to go back and sit in my seat
2221401 i could not believe what i was hearing things were getting worse by the minute i was terrified and was almost in tears
2221402 i counted minutes i did not know what was going to happen to me when i was going to get out what was in the future as tears rolled down my cheeks i was praying which was the only thing i could do
2221403 he told me that he was going to kick my ass for every move i made i was scared and in tears all the time
2221404 i was exhausted depressed and completely depleted i just wanted to get out so i agreed to whatever the public defender suggested i pleaded guilty to a misdemeanour charge and agreed to pay the fine
2221405 sometimes an explanation for the reason why things happen is not always possible and the bizarre behaviour of the individual during your june 26 flight to las vegas supports this point
2221406 while i am unable to explain the circumstances surrounding the disruption i think it is important to offer my heartfelt apologies for any concerns you may have had as a result of this event
2221407 naturally we dont want this experience to affect your feelings about flying with us in the future or for it to be your last recollection of traveling with our company in fact we would consider it a privilege if you gave us another opportunity to provide you with better memories
2221408 put together all the minorities in the country and you will find more than 50 percent of the population is represented
2221409 we were sending a message to the indian government at the centre and in the states that there cannot be really a progress in the country until the minorities welfare is addressed we dont want handouts we dont want politicians to think of us only at the time of the elections we want meaningful and effective policies to defend the minorities and make them realise their full potential
2221410 we have been aware for quite some time that if the minority communities had good understanding and stood up against the divisive forces of the upper castes there could be a lot of progress in the country
2221411 in gujarat muslims and dalits have lived side by side for decades but when the 2002 riots took place many dalits took up arms against us but if they were aware that the upper caste people were poisoning their minds and using them to fight against us there would not have been violence and bloodshed
2221412 it is endeavours such as these that can be shared and seen as an inspiration to other minorities
2221413 a quicker and more effective way of discouraging this unlawful activity
2221414 we hope that by getting rid of screen scrapers we will speed up passenger processing times on ryanair com as well as ensuring that ryanair passengers are not paying unnecessary handling charges or higher fares
2221415 at a time when many people are struggling to afford holidays overseas airlines should be finding ways to make it easier for families to book and travel in the way that is convenient for them not making it even harder
2221416 the question were dealing with now is whats the best way to get more convergence between what we do within the non proliferation treaty and what india does outside
2221417 very clear that signing the non proliferation treaty is not on the cards
2221418 it is a tight timetable we are asking the nsg to move expeditiously we hope that will happen
2221419 india has a long and very solid record of nonproliferation controlling exports and a responsible international behavior in that regard
2221420 so it was considered as an arrangement that worked with regard to india not as some kind of model for other countries
2221421 we do understand that japans going to have questions and issues that they want to raise but the bottom line for us is this is the way to get the cooperation we want this is the way to get the support for non proliferation
2221422 building a regulatory strategy for marketing food supplements in europe the key steps to a successful product launch
2221423 this is where we were meant to be all along
2221424 this thing is just like pulling a thread in a sweater it can go on and on
2221425 the state is telling us what we need to do
2221426 weve been working the past three years or so to get to this point
2221427 dealing is not allowed and they can be thrown out of the organization and we certainly dont want that this is to ensure they support themselves and each other i thank abigail for the info
2221428 i went out too fast i was trying to stay with the pack
2221429 she went down there and did the best she could do its very difficult when youre running against the best in north america it was exciting to see her compete at that level
2221430 they melted down a little bit and i just kept going under par
2221431 i just tried to stay solid for the whole round because of my score i was in the third to last group and didnt know how i stood against the leaders but i knew i was in the hunt and they would have to shoot a pretty good number
2221432 i play competitively in florida but when im back here im working and dont play that much
2221433 i do a lot of teaching as well i practice 10 to 15 minutes here and there just to keep my game sharp but i havent played too many competitive rounds so it was somewhat of a surprise to play like this
2221434 getting away and going to a different venue was nice
2221435 we have had a busy four weeks at abenaqui so it was nice to get away for a while
2221436 at the end of the day it is about how many smiles can you put on kids faces
2221437 this program demonstrates how much fun hockey is for those that would otherwise not experience it
2221438 this free camp happens because of the support of the rinks at exeter and its donation of free ice as well as support from bauer philbricks sports and the seacoast lightning girls hockey program it offers a way for large numbers of girls to try hockey build friendships and get introduced to the basic skills of the game
2221439 this is one of a number of fresh and exciting initiatives that the rinks at exeter is offering since bill and karen linehan re established operational control of the rink
2221440 tales to go brings an interactive story time filled with arts activities healthy snacks and free books of their very own for children to keep
2221441 this is a really good example of what can happen when law enforcement and residents work hand in hand
2221442 janvrin hit eaton in the face after that eatons head struck the edge of a pool table after striking his head eaton was unconscious one of the things it says janvrin hit eaton one time
2221443 we dont know what additional charges there are if any until we get the autopsy
2221444 to have a homicide charge you have to have intent even as low as negligent
2221445 it could still be ruled medically a homicide to charge a homicide you also have to say hes being charged with an intent he did it purposefully to cause the death the cause by the medical examiner is important
2221446 although the towns actions did violate the parties prior practices the underlying conditions that gave rise to the established practices changed as a result of the department of labors ruling
2221447 accordingly there was no contractual obligation to continue the practices grieved by the union
2221448 obviously we are disappointed in the decision and we will continue with the process and take it to the pelrb
2221449 someone suggested we do a logo they saw one from another town on a t shirt at a race and thought it was cool we all jumped on it
2221450 a few people have asked me including my own son
2221451 we are looking for ideas on what people feel newton recreation is
2221452 but at some point in the future we might have to do some timber management
2221453 we hope to develop a brochure and map of the trails
2221454 the town forest is really important to people they worked hard to get this property under easement and i want the town to know its there
2221455 this is where we were meant to be all along
2221456 you and i have shared some significant trials and tribulations
2221457 this is the only real estate where lincoln and washington actually intersected
2221458 kids in high school need to know about that through the examples of washington and lincoln they need to think of what changes they can make in the world
2221459 i think i learned more in these couple of weeks than ive learned in three years of history classes
2221460 what can the declaration of independence tell us about life in 2008
2221461 there was nothing civil about it at all a house divided surely will fall
2221462 tell me what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life
2221463 tell me what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life
2221464 subsequent to our recent emergence as a publicly traded company through completion of a reverse merger today we are pleased to announce the closing of this private placement to provide chromadex with additional working capital to support our business expansion plans we are pleased with the amount raised and confident this financing will help position chromadex to support the next phase of growth in our quest to become the premier provider of phytochemical and botanical reference standards to the functional food cosmetic dietary supplement pharmaceutical life sciences and other industries
2221465 tell me what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life
2221466 council cannot accept an offer for land that is not on the market
2221467 if council chose to go down the path of selling off land it would need to go through the normal private treaty process of advertising and the like
2221468 it would be foolish of council to just say yes well sell it without me understanding or the councillors having considered that on balance it appears to be the best site from the eis and government regulations and economic point of view
2221469 we cant make a decision at this point in time
2221470 the letter stated the land was not for sale and secondly there cant be a discussion with council yet and therefore a decision to sell cannot be made
2221471 at the moment the offer is incapable of being considered
2221472 a day like this really shows how the community rallies together in tough times
2221473 i have a family myself and i was very touched when approached by libby bates and kathy baker
2221474 im so very grateful to everyone at the eden fundraiser
2221475 the support from the local communities everywhere has been wonderful
2221476 resmed and bigger rival respironics inc control about 80 percent of the 2 billion u s market for sleep breathing devices a rapidly growing market as people become more aware of the links between sleep disorders and heart disease and diabetes
2221477 the condition affects about 4 percent of middle aged men and 2 percent of middle aged women men in general suffer from sleep apnea more often than women children can also have sleep apnea sleep apnea in children has been linked to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or adhd some studies suggest sleep apnea runs in families studies have linked sleep apnea to high blood pressure heart attack and stroke up to 50 percent of people with sleep apnea also suffer from high blood pressure people with sleep apnea are three times more likely to be involved in motor vehicle accidents people with sleep apnea sometimes fall asleep unexpectedly during the day such as while talking on the phone or driving risk factors for sleep apnea include being overweight and having a large neck losing even 10 percent of body weight can help reduce the number of times a person with sleep apnea stops breathing during sleep african americans pacific islanders and mexican americans may be at increased risk for sleep apnea smoking and alcohol use increase the risk of sleep apnea continuous positive airway pressure or cpap is the most common noninvasive treatment for moderate to severe sleep apnea
2221478 janvrin hit eaton in the face after that eatons head struck the edge of a pool table after striking his head eaton was unconscious one of the things it says janvrin hit eaton one time
2221479 we dont know what additional charges there are if any until we get the autopsy
2221480 to have a homicide charge you have to have intent even as low as negligent
2221481 it could still be ruled medically a homicide to charge a homicide you also have to say hes being charged with an intent he did it purposefully to cause the death the cause by the medical examiner is important
2221482 none of us knew if it was going to be called off or not so we had to play as hard as we could we all were hoping it would be called off though because it was literally impossible to play the greens were completely under water
2221483 there was nothing the nhwga could do about it today
2221484 between the gusty winds and heavy rain it wasnt possible i dont think anybody would enjoy playing in that weather
2221485 this thing is just like pulling a thread in a sweater it can go on and on
2221486 the state is telling us what we need to do
2221487 weve been working the past three years or so to get to this point
2221488 we only had two teammates for yesterday and today so we knew we were short handed
2221489 yesterdays break didnt work out but at the end of today the efforts were all worth it for the win and the champagne
2221490 shes probably one of the most determined people ive ever met
2221491 i certainly wouldnt have been able to walk 14 years without his help
2221492 he is definitely the best orthopedic doctor hes so current in his field
2221493 the biggest thing is he totally understands the athletes mind he worked with me as if i was already an olympian
2221494 its fun working with high level athletes it gives you a tremendous about of gratitude
2221495 sleeping over at the amc huts is an experience like no other but bring an extra flashlight and keep it with you you never know who could be creeping around your bunk at night
2221496 you cant complain or whine or you cant come ever again
2221497 on my hikes i met people who claimed to have had ghostly encounters so i began exploring the history behind the stories i was hearing on the trail
2221498 they were taking a track log of the track i needed
2221499 these guys winter hiked a lot while they were camping they heard the sound of someone crying and shrieking and didnt know what it was all they could imagine was that it was a bird but there were no birds to be found
2221500 their history is what makes those spirits alive the people who originally built these places and brought them to life their stories are already part of the land waiting to be rediscovered by families and children
2221501 this is where we were meant to be all along
2221502 redeemed a spiritual misfit stumbles toward god marginal sanity and the peace that passes all understanding
2221503 house of wits an intimate portrait of the james family

2221511 everywhere people like to dance tap their toes or sing along with good music that enters the room like an old friend
2221512 all too often innocent law abiding people suffer tragic consequences and the loss of loved ones due to this careless disregard for human life
2221513 well be especially vigilant during high risk nighttime hours when impaired drivers are most likely to be on the road
2221514 our message is simple and unwavering if we find you driving impaired we will arrest you no exceptions
2221515 all maine state parks and historic sites offer unique experiences for visitors
2221516 this year i hope residents will take advantage of maine day to travel to a property that they have never been to
2221517 whether its close by or 100 miles away this is the day to get to the place youve always wanted to visit
2221518 this one has kind of a funny feel about it
2221519 wally and mary lou williams are among the best friends that the forest society and the cause of conservation in new hampshire ever had
2221520 they took a profound interest in the work of the forest society and in the conservation efforts of their home town hampstead and neighboring atkinson
2221521 the present conservation land in hampstead has beautiful well maintained walking trails that are enjoyed by many people
2221522 im excited that this new parcel will allow access to the existing trails on the back land
2221523 government is too big he wants to grow it taxes are to high he wants to raise them
2221524 congress spends too much and he proposes more we need more energy and hes against producing it were finally winning in iraq and he wants to forfeit
2221525 at the time of the merger no one anticipated an impact on jobs in wilmington
2221526 john mccain through this whole thing has said zero about his connection to dhl
2221527 whether its a vote changing issue or not i think it might be a little too early to tell its a matter of making sure our situation here stays on the front burner
2221528 one of the worst job catastrophes that any community in this nation is facing
2221529 we are going to need some involvement by the german government
2221530 im thankful for all the help we received without it things would be devastating
2221531 i didnt really think anything of it when he went overseas
2221532 but the army told us wives they would be different when they returned
2221533 we were there to support each other and if we had questions have someone to talk with
2221534 it makes them very self conscious and not trusting of people
2221535 he started screaming in our bed something about get down incoming guns yes sir heard roger it was frightening i was thinking what happens if he starts swinging i got out of bed and slept on the couch he didnt take offense to it it takes them a while to get back into the rhythm of being a civilian again were still not there
2221536 he was easygoing about talking to people now he was not social and was paranoid he thought there were people following him hed ask what is that black box on the road or why did you ask me that the military expects them to turn that switch were waiting at home doing it all ourselves and they come home and add more stress its like who is this guy the kids dont know who he is holy mackerel they come back so different
2221537 im supposed to understand their feelings but it doesnt seem like they understand me
2221538 when we had the veterans returning party there were no balloons because we had been warned that if even one popped it could set them off
2221539 a neighbor shot off fireworks and it was pretty loud a trigger for paul
2221540 i ran around the house and hes lying with his face in the ground patting the grass
2221541 the next year on the fourth of july neighbors in dover were setting them fireworks off and my husband was on the floor trying to get under the bed
2221542 we ended up losing our duplex and with four kids moved to the projects in dover
2221543 my two oldest got out of control hanging with the wrong crowd
2221544 i called the manchester v a and explained the paranoia the high anxiety he was either not sleeping for days or just sleeping and not changing clothes they said admit him and he stayed two months they put him on meds and counseled him
2221545 i headed to hanscom air force base and asked if i could stay in their lodging
2221546 save said they were looking for people to start a support group through them and asked if i were interested yeah i was interested
2221547 they asked no questions and even agreed to shut down a few hours once a month so thered be no gunshots
2221548 she was so small she was sneaking under the fence from the little dog play group to the big dogs
2221549 i hired a psychic for her who does really good work with lost pets
2221550 for you dog lovers out there imagine coming home and hearing nothing silence and not knowing whether your dog is even alive my friend is in total anguish
2221551 they are praying for me lots of them came to the door to door search
2221552 part of it is the way we see ourselves but its also how other people see us
2221553 historically weve been denied our manhood so we really want to cling to it as soon as boys are able to walk we call them little man anything that threatens that manhood we dont want
2221554 we know that the rate of suicide is going up in the black community
2221555 and studies show that one of the ways depression manifests itself is through aggression
2221556 if you feel like your life is not worth much then the lives of other people arent worth much either and you behave in a way thats not responsible
2221557 im not saying that depression robs you of discerning right and wrong
2221558 im saying if youre looking for causes dont overlook depression
2221559 we find that abms decision to lead their workers to that room under false pretenses to be deplorable
2221560 these tactics are not just morally unjust but it does nothing to deal with the underlying problem of our broken immigration system
2221561 our policy is full compliance with the law and as such we cooperated with immigration and customs enforcement in this matter
2221562 if we were to find out later that that wasnt the case then we would terminate the contract
2221563 im a single mom and the only way i could find work in order to sustain my family was to come here
2221564 unfortunately in my country there arent jobs and there isnt work
2221565 politicians who choose to use profanity leave the impression that their vocabulary is lacking that they are incapable of choosing proper less vulgar words to express their emotions
2221566 im a fairly passionate person about certain things and the death of a child is tremendously difficult i said some pretty kind of rough things during the time of the sgt stephen liczbinski death as well
2221567 i wanted people to understand just how serious i was about this particular situation
2221568 as far as numbers in the parliament are concerned we have done all our homework and have been contacted by several groups of senators and national assembly members from the opposition all through the night ever since we made the announcement
2221569 we already have the support of 18 members of the opposition they naturally want to be remembered as voting on the right side of history
2221570 it is a process that symbolises that no individual or institution is above accountability it is a step towards democracy and parliamentary sovereignty
2221571 we are just implementing the mandate given to us by the public in the general election on february 18
2221572 talks with iaea in the past two days were constructive and the two sides have reached some agreements

2221578 should he or she visit a local automobile dealership to make a request for a loan from gmac
2221579 this is an indictment for failure to disclose gifts that are controversial in terms of whether they were or were not gifts its not bribery its not some corruption its not some extreme felony
2221580 did you hear that dick cheney was snubbed by the republicans and not invited to speak at the republican convention
2221581 will create 40 50 less carbon emission and use half the fuel of other similar houseboats
2221582 i think the people who know what the fire department needs are already here on the inside
2221583 annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability over a protracted period of time and risks to price stability in the medium term remain on the upside
2221584 die in tierversuchen bereits zu krankheiten und geburtssch den gef hrt hatte

2221586 oh thats ok ill just add you back into the system since youre here
2221587 the only physical problem with this cat is that he is overweight
2221588 what impressed us most with the family was their current background with animals their pets are well cared for and loved
2221589 he will be on a diet for well over a year to be close to that
2221590 less than two weeks before election day a scandal erupts that threatens to cripple the presidents bid for a second term but before the incident can cause irreparable damage a mysterious fixer is called to the white house the ultimate spin doctor conrad brean robert deniro has the uncanny ability to manipulate politics the press and most importantly the american people
2221591 part of it is the way we see ourselves but its also how other people see us
2221592 historically weve been denied our manhood so we really want to cling to it as soon as boys are able to walk we call them little man anything that threatens that manhood we dont want
2221593 we know that the rate of suicide is going up in the black community
2221594 and studies show that one of the ways depression manifests itself is through aggression
2221595 if you feel like your life is not worth much then the lives of other people arent worth much either and you behave in a way thats not responsible
2221596 im not saying that depression robs you of discerning right and wrong
2221597 im saying if youre looking for causes dont overlook depression
2221598 they were lying on their sides on the floor and a lot of them were in really poor condition because they had been sandblasted in the past and then repainted colors in like baby puke green with things like bike reflectors as jewels
2221599 this carousel is a significant piece in a number of ways
2221600 its a childrens ride so its great for kids its a great addition to philadelphia because it was produced here its a great addition to the carousel world because it was almost written off and now its back
2221601 its wonderful that the please touch museum was able to pull this off
2221602 it is our mission at dhs to support and protect vulnerable children
2221603 i intend to hold every staff member and provider accountable for upholding that mission
2221604 ive been running into brick walls since i got here
2221605 i just want to be able to give my father a proper burial but i dont have money to bury my father
2221606 they asked me would i be interested and i said yes
2221607 we are in a gridlock in the senate today on judges
2221608 the party with the president gets three and the other party gets one
2221609 if mccains the president well just send the same letter in
2221610 for most black americans obamas candidacy represented a kind of racial milestone the natural next phase of a 50 year movement
2221611 but for michael nutter the reverse was also true not supporting obamas candidacy marked a kind of progress too
2221612 it demonstrates a continuation of this notion that the african american community unlike any other is completely monolithic that everyone in the african american community does the same thing in lockstep
2221613 if they come down here and theyre going to solicit these girls then they may be approaching one of our officers
2221614 some of the sexual acts are done nearby and in plain view of children
2221615 i would argue vehemently that its not a victimless crime
2221616 when you run these types of operations you just never know who is going to solicit
2221617 they said they just couldnt believe what they were seeing
2221618 i felt like i couldve gone faster but not knowing the course is tough but it all went well
2221619 i ran the race last year and it was 90 degrees so it was nice to come back and run in this weather
2221620 i like the course and its nice going downhill that last half mile of it
2221621 i hadnt run a 5k since last cross country season so its been a while
2221622 cory was running with me and he was telling me what was going on
2221623 i like the whole atmosphere around this race there are people at every corner cheering you on and there is a big barbecue after you cant beat it
2221624 training is going well but its just not time for racing yet
2221625 even though my season didnt go so well i still ran well at the beginning of the year now im just looking forward to the upcoming season
2221626 now you have right in the heart of coal country the beginning of the solar century
2221627 it couldnt happen at a better time it couldnt be a bigger vote of confidence for pennsylvanias alternative energy policies
2221628 to think that were still sitting on probably 300 to 500 years of coal reserves it just shows that were trying to be innovative
2221629 the legacy of coal was one that when they left they left the scarred landscape behind as well
2221630 it was difficult to get anybody to take a second look at carbon county
2221631 the reality is we are putting the nuts and bolts together on the states entire energy package but that will come to fruition
2221632 just a commitment letter from the governor would suffice for the company to get the proper financing to make this thing work
2221633 what were doing fits hand in glove with the requirements
2221634 women have a right to health but protecting that right often depends on a partners support
2221635 by liberalising restrictive abortion laws and investing in abortion safety we can save the lives of tens of thousands of women every year
2221636 these core values respect rights and responsibility underpin a vision of a society where women are valued and sexuality is viewed as a normal and healthy part of being human of being young of being alive
2221637 due to expected market conditions accurate earnings predictions especially for banking are not feasible
2221638 this 2 0 1 firmware update cant load up soon enough take the pain away
2221639 the launch of mobileme was not our finest hour there are several things we could have done better mobileme was simply not up to apples standards it clearly needed more time and testing it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
2221640 the vision of mobileme is both exciting and ambitious and we will press on to make it a service we are all proud of by the end of this year

2221643 when life throws you a curve you learn how to swerve
2221644 the arbitrator emphasized that he found a contradiction as to who initiated the sexual encounter which could not be resolved because the patient did not testify
2221645 as the applicable regulations make plain and as should be immediately obvious the question of who initiated the encounter has no bearing at all on whether baldwin violated the regulations
2221646 thats why you always show up at a fiba game with money in an envelope
2221647 the region needs access to reliable supplies of natural gas
2221648 we will provide a clean safe effective solution to new jerseys energy needs
2221649 our dock does 6 million to 10 million a year in seafood landings
2221650 each of these terminals would be located in prime fishing grounds thats where the fish are and thats where we fish it would put us out of business
2221651 this is a tremendous victory for us but more important its a tremendous victory for all property owners in new jersey
2221652 gallenthin says any city doing redevelopment has to support the acquisition by substantial evidence of blight
2221653 they have a plethora of information to supplement what has already been submitted
2221654 i think the court has made it abundantly clear to long branch and cities across the state that there are limits to how they can use eminent domain
2221655 small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids have been identified in the milk of nursing mothers and a few adverse effects on the child have been reported including jaundice and breast enlargement
2221656 hes a true professional it was equal or better than broadway as far as i was concerned
2221657 bobs love of theater is contagious his standards incredibly high and his work ethic impeccable
2221658 i only planned to stay a couple of years i stayed because i loved it
2221659 it reminded me life is short and you have to make the most of it
2221660 like p t barnum he exudes energy and creativity he motivates people
2221661 i chose to make my hobby and my passion my career
2221662 we always thought and bob promoted that we were performing on a greater level than high school and you take that with you
2221663 bob taught us theres going to be rejection in life
2221664 you can have confidence even if you dont get that leading role
2221665 i doubt id want to get into my costume now
2221666 if he sat there and just watched id think something was wrong
2221667 tap into the camaraderie that was associated with a chance to connect with an audience after high school those experiences are few and far between
2221668 and they are not receiving the support they should from the department of licenses and inspection
2221669 theres a concern of what an influx of students is going to do in an otherwise quiet residential neighborhood
2221670 do any of you guys have beds that we can just temporarily remove or ones we can just make look like sofas tell them the landlord lives downstairs if they come to the door just say all five of you are cousins
2221671 temple cant provide housing but now the nearby streets cant either somethings got to give and students are soon going to find out if they havent already that neighborhood families are not giving up without a fight
2221672 i try to be a good neighbor and try to keep my property well maintained and cleaned
2221673 when you take that grass away the character of the community changes
2221674 by pouring concrete down where you used to have grass youll have more reflective heat from the sun the grass absorbs some rainfall and it creates a cooling effect for the neighborhood
2221675 then i went up to the 11th floor and filed a complaint
2221676 we cant get a straight answer out of l amp i
2221677 im starting to get concerned because people are getting more callous in their treatment of the animals
2221678 there are more people who are violently chasing them with kayaks and personal watercraft
2221679 instead more and more were experiencing nature represented technologically through television and other media children grow up watching discovery channel and animal planet thats probably better than nothing but as a species we need interaction with actual nature for our physical and psychological well being
2221680 in general control oriented people are the kind who try to keep up with the joneses
2221681 they have a harder time controlling their reactions they more quickly become one of those parents than the parents who are able to separate their ego from their kids and events on the field
2221682 regardless of their personality type all parents were susceptible to becoming more aggressive as a result of viewing actions on the field as affronts to them or their kids
2221683 however that being said it took autonomy oriented parents longer to get there as compared to the control oriented parents
2221684 its very skinny and it almost looks like a dog
2221685 it looks like all of the others foxes that we get in that have mange
2221686 this was something that we never saw at all until the early 2000s and now it has become the most common cause of skin infections in the u s
2221687 but in truth the majority of people who die from mrsa infections are old sick in the hospital and would have probably died shortly from something else if the mrsa infection hadnt killed them first
2221688 the probability of a young healthy person dying from mrsa is very low
2221689 although all hospital personnel know we need to wash our hands frequently in practice people sometimes forget
2221690 a simple question did you wash your hands before they touch you may help remind them
2221691 none of the treatments studied had any significant benefit over no treatment at all
2221692 its not in the realm that you would expect it to be if these interventions were really performing
2221693 broadband is a critical tool for home based business development as well as education and health service improvements
2221694 to maximise success all parties must be involved and committed to broadband in the same way that we are to road power phone water and sewer services
2221695 we are here to support improvements to the network and can provide valuable mapping demographic and all important local knowledge to assist the broadband development
2221696 the evening that i met her she had babs written on her sweater
2221697 every night wed walk through the village and have an ice cream sundae
2221698 and this one day i stopped and held her hand
2221699 all the guests in the hotel said we wish you lots of luck
2221700 die positive entwicklung wirkte sich auch auf die besch ftigung aus
2221701 das macht unsere unternehmen wettbewerbsf higer sichert technischen fortschritt und arbeitspl tze am standort deutschland
2221702 mit modernsten simulationsmethoden in kombination mit den leistungsf higsten rechnern ist es m glich diese extrembedingungen nicht nur herzustellen sondern auch eins zu eins mit normalen reaktionsbedingungen zu vergleichen
2221703 if it took departments such a long time to achieve the first target of 30 by 2005 it may take them even longer to meet the new target
2221704 these principles include the provision of adequate resources to advance gender equality incorporating gender perspectives into all the work of departments and meeting equity targets
2221705 the problem persists with the modest target of 2 not being met
2221706 such an approach should not only focus on policies processes and numeric targets
2221707 there needs to be a conscious effort to effect a change of attitudes and behaviour so that the commitment to implement policies can be secured
2221708 i will need to be convinced why we need to borrow more
2221709 if the public is demanding change and demanding results what we need is the will to get it done
2221710 i would need to take a case by case basis
2221711 if you want the status quo vote for jeb bradley if youre looking for change vote for me
2221712 im not into trading favors i never have and never will
2221713 the legislation is there for a reason and that is to stop the spread of disease
2221714 breaking this legislation at the height of an epidemic meant spreading the disease was more likely we think this sentence does send out the message that farmers need to comply with legislation for safety and prevention reasons
2221715 but the shipyard is about so much more than facilities
2221716 impacts men women and children across the entire nation its time for a change
2221717 this administration has tried to undermine the rights of labor unions in order to save a few pennies
2221718 india has a long and very solid record of non proliferation controlling exports and a responsible international behaviour in that regard
2221719 there should be no discrimination if they want to give such nuclear status to india we expect the same for pakistan
2221720 in this country you need huntering flogging to make you work
2221721 is this ramrajya in this country so this is swaraj this is the concept of swaraj
2221722 it is a pathetic state of affairs that only two sates viz states of uttar pradesh and arunachal pradesh have responded and other states did not bother to file their responses some of them have simply engaged their counsel who are appearing in court and as usual they have made prayer for time to file responses
2221723 everytime i say aids is a black disease it irks everyone
2221724 whites call me racist and blacks say you have stigmatized us
2221725 whats more disturbing is there are so many people more concerned about what other people think of us than whether we survive or not
2221726 over the last five years the white house and congress have increased spending on hiv prevention treatment and support programs for low income countries dramatically at the same time that domestic spending has remained all but flat
2221727 i think its better if they think ill of us and were alive instead of thinking well of us and were dead
2221728 the ama understands that patients want to access the scheme while it remains in operation but seeks to make it clear that doctors can only refer patients with a chronic medical condition who are under the care of at least two health care providers in addition to their gp and whose general health is affected by their oral health
2221729 the federal government intends to close the scheme to all patients as soon as possible after parliament resumes there will be no transition period thus no rebates for treatment commenced while the scheme was in operation but continuing after the scheme closes
2221730 the ama regrets the abolition of this scheme which has allowed patients with serious conditions to receive medicare rebates for dental care
2221731 prolonged closures of the river entrance are not unusual with rainfall and to a lesser extent water extraction being the two primary factors in governing the rate at which water levels rise in the estuary following closure
2221732 the last opening of the river in february of 2007 was a natural opening after minor flooding took the estuary water levels to near record heights
2221733 the entrance remained open for approximately 14 months prior to this years closure
2221734 i believe the nsw government will deliver unworkable regulations governing the trucking industry in our region particularly around fatigue
2221735 this is principally due to a lack of truck stops particularly along the princes highway
2221736 there is also an issue with stock carriers and the challenges they have with stopping carrying cattle and sheep causing disruption to other stopped truck drivers
2221737 when we see the regulations in black and white and have met with the users well decide whether or not the coalition will support the new laws which have caused nothing but angst among the industry
2221738 the recent road transport safety bill was supported by all parties as it was designed to remove confusion of australia wide rules but the regulations that are now to go with it are of great concern
2221739 the ambiguous and inappropriate rules to do with log books are generating a lot of concern
2221740 the liberals will also be keeping a close eye on the issue of truck stops and truck changeover points
2221741 there are not enough truck rest areas as it is and to hear a number of them are being closed is a big problem
2221742 if truck drivers are given specified times and distances to travel but dont have rest areas in which to pull over how can the legislation be justified
2221743 we will continue to talk with drivers and business operators to hear their concerns so that when the regulations come out at the end of next month well know exactly what to look for
2221744 tell me what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life
2221745 we can waste time trying to figure out who shares what part of the blame or we can move forward and do better from here on out
2221746 its part of racing and its part of everyday life where the economy is forcing everyone to save on money
2221747 were about five years late getting slots and i dont understand that states have them all around us and you can see it has helped the industry in those states but more than that it has helped those states support other programs and reduce taxes
2221748 i have to operate without that and try to stabilize and grow the business
2221749 we want to attract younger people and i think todays younger people are looking for more stimulus
2221750 a race is a short window what do you do during those 20 minutes between races to keep younger people energized and engaged i dont know what the answers are right now
2221751 it is not something the mjc wants to do but business is down significantly and operating three facilities is a significant expense but were not evicting anyone were relocating everyone to laurel or bowie the mjc is taking on that expense i know well be upsetting a normal way of life i appreciate that and were going to do everything we can to make the move as easy as possible
2221752 theyll indicate on that letter whether they are accepting or declining sign it and then return it to me
2221753 at that point ill have a clearer picture of what were looking at
2221754 the mtha and mjc had no choice but to suspend the fall stakes schedule
2221755 weve been in discussions for months and there just isnt any other answer cutting the stakes and the days are the only way to maintain the present purse levels and keep us competitive with surrounding states there really was no choice
2221756 its disappointing but our goal is to maintain the 160 000 a day purses and thereby the quality of our races
2221757 at this juncture i dont know what is or isnt available in terms of sponsors
2221758 the de francis dash is something my sister and i are very proud of
2221759 it is one of only three grade i races in maryland and one of just five grade i sprint races in the country
2221760 at the same time i understand completely the issues and challenges that have forced this action and as disappointed as we both are were 100 times more alarmed and worried about the current state and possible future of the industry
2221761 without humour at times gallows humour we couldnt have survived numerous dictators from ayub and yahya khan through zia ul haq to pervez musharraf
2221762 i think the chance for him from his point of view to get here was to be someone that he never was and that was to put up a huge fuss and a huge stink and thats just not brett favre
2221763 i think he always wanted the best for his teammates and the locker room over there and therefore he was willing to let general manager ted thompson and the guys over there do what they could do ultimately it ended up the best situation for them too because they dont have to play them this year like he would have if he would have gone to tampa
2221764 i was just watching it as a fan of football and thats all it was
2221765 i love playing against brett because hes such a great competitor and hes one of the best ever to play this game
2221766 so i always look forward to playing him i wish he would have stayed i had a chance to play against him in his last couple of years but him going to the afc the best shot now will be having to hopefully face him in the super bowl
2221767 if they let this guy play then they must have brain damage and we dont really even have to try to tackle that number 28 we just have to wait for him to forget that hes playing football and give us the ball
2221768 go get a freakin good qb who isnt 35 years old
2221769 man if that jackson guy figures a few things out that is going to be one ba team to deal with in the next few years
2221770 as a woman who has been working on the ground i cannot control the volume of reports that came to me personally on women and girls raped in zimbabwe during the political violence
2221771 i am still trying to come to terms with what happened and why it happened
2221772 only arthur mutambara has been kind enough to send priscilla misihairabwi mushonga to represent women the mediator is male and all those who give us updates are male showing that those to be liberated first are males and when they think we should they will call us so far these are male talks and it is a shame that they have not pronounced peace plans which we can work on locally
2221773 we must be given a platform to break silence on rapes that were perpetrated by the youth militia we want the leaders in our country to pay particular attention to this
2221774 we would like to see to it that we deal with issues of rape as a weapon of war in zimbabwe and the region it must not happen again we have the names of those who raped women and government must allow justice to prevail
2221775 we demand a revamping of the legal and policy framework beginning with constitutional reform adoption of legal measures that restore the dignity of women and girls and the building of public trust in law enforcement agents
2221776 women since they bore the burden of the political violence demanded that they be granted assistance in rebuilding their shelter and accessing health education and other services
2221777 surely you cant tell me that you have no women with functioning brains and mouths in your parties
2221778 arent you ashamed of yourselves this year the only one with a woman on his team is arthur mutambara that is just unacceptable both of you have female vice presidents what is their role it just showed you only wanted them to get your votes
2221779 i would like young women to have hope as they once did that with laws policies and attitudes changing they can become anything they dream of not just sex slaves
2221780 having such a spectacular tall ship visiting the waterfront is great news for ipswich
2221781 not only do visits like this help ipswich celebrate its wonderful links with tall ships of the past but it also helps us to draw attention to the magnificent progress that is being made at the waterfront
2221782 were sure hundreds of people will be drawn to see the picton castle during her time in the town
2221783 while they are taking a tour of such a special craft it will be a great opportunity for visitors to see the transformation of the area and the real progress being made in turning it into a fantastic place to live and spend time
2221784 they offered them to us for two months free so i said frees free well try them but i wasnt convinced then as soon as i got on i was sold
2221785 this is the most exciting day ever in my life
2221786 the american flag means everything in my life everything that describes me coming from another country and going through all the stages that i have to become a u s citizen this is another amazing step for me in celebrating being an american seeing my fellow americans coming behind me in the ceremony and supporting me will be a great honor the highest honor i dont even have the words to describe how happy i am
2221787 in this day and age loyalties are lacking in sport and often money talks too loudly
2221788 i think when it comes to issues like that there are certain traditions that need to be followed in sport and the ioc should have ensured this didnt happen
2221789 its the olympics and it doesnt matter what time they ask us to swim
2221790 it might affect the times because its the morning and nobodys used to swimming then but everyones on the same playing field and truth is nobody remembers times anyway
2221791 its the olympics and all that matters is who wins the medals
2221792 m rk ut platsen och rapportera till polisen om du kolliderat med bj rn varg j rv lo lg hjort r djur utter vildsvin rn eller mufflonf r
2221793 the biggest thing we are looking for is the obvious they have to be able to sing
2221794 i have given out 32 bins of the 50 we have already the uptake has been really good and we have just ordered another 50
2221795 its a perfect opportunity for companies wanting to become greener
2221796 we will deliver the bins and empty them and would love as many people as possible to have one or more in their offices
2221797 it is categorically untrue that lor al paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign for feria hair color
2221798 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2221799 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2221800 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2221801 i think wolves are a club where if you can get a couple of glamour players that will excite the crowd and give them heroes
2221802 wolves is a big club with a big crowd but i think mick mccarthy will want players that maybe he can develop
2221803 mick bought the kid stearman from leicester and i think he will go on looking for that kind of signing
2221804 but i think somewhere along the way ironically they need a paul ince type of player somebody of that kind of stature to keep them ticking over
2221805 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2221806 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2221807 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2221810 they put me on methadone to help with withdrawals which made me flip out we need to get kids off of drugs but not with other drugs
2221811 you might as well open up a marijuana shop up the road
2221812 im living proof right here methadone makes you stupid tired
2221813 was an angel sent to help pull people out of the depths
2221814 believe me we are very good at what we do
2221815 we dont want a problem we understand your fears were here to bring treatment to a community that needs treatment
2221816 when you give them methadone as prescribed they are not impaired
2221817 if i could have gone back in time i would have announced the decision in march and set a date a few months in the future

2221826 afghanistan vertegenwoordigt op dit ogenblik meer dan 90 procent van de wereldwijde opiumproductie
2221827 de sector heeft een snelle groei gekend sinds het taliban regime in 2001 van de macht werd verdreven er wordt gemeend dat zowel kringen van de huidige afghaanse regering als van de taliban rebellen profiteren van de opiumteelt
2221828 meestal worden ze legaal ge xporteerd maar worden ze nadien naar afghanistan afgeleid voor illegale toepassingen
2221829 afghanistan zelf heeft geen legale industrie n die de aankoop van dergelijke chemische producten zouden vereisen
2221830 it seemed like i couldnt get away from them that they had their own life they were demanding to be written you know it was like i had to keep my catchers mitt on all the time to get these songs and that was a great great feeling
2221831 it was a multi layered education to tour with him right after high school because you know i not only got to sock in this time with my dad but i also watched him from the wings every night for a couple of years and that was an education in itself
2221832 i mean at that time i didnt think about becoming a performer myself but i think in some way i assimilated what i saw you know his natural way with an audience
2221833 these songs are from black cadillac and this is a record where the past the present and the future are like mixed parts and all come together
2221834 it was very well balanced and he wasnt self referential to any great degree
2221835 you know there are only a couple of his own songs on there
2221836 this is the sound that i want and i can teach it to my guys
2221837 i got the kids involved in as much as i could baseball softball gymnastics tap ballet scouts michael was never a scout but the girls were scouts
2221838 michael grew up with the smell of chlorine it was such a natural environment for him
2221839 people often wait around to speak with me to ask questions
2221840 to me theres a very fine line between the athlete coach and parent everyone has their roles if you sat here right now and told me youd give me 200 million to recite michaels world fly record i could not tell you that yet there are parents whose child is trying to beat my son who can spit out those things out i dont get involved in that i talk to michael as a parent
2221841 they go to an athletic event and their kid isnt doing their best time they get upset with the child they think that it always has to be better better better better not realizing that even for the most talented swimmers its a progression
2221842 parents just need to chill realize that it doesnt help to set expectations especially unrealistic ones put yourself in their shoes do you map things out so carefully in your own life such as i am going to be ceo of a company does it fall out in nice little pockets same with kids their progression is not going to fall into nice little pockets there may not be another michael phelps for decades even though i have parents tell me their son is on the same track

2221863 we have only been here three weeks and two days and the hill has been closed three weeks and two days so we dont really know how it has been affecting our business although i am certain it has had some impact on trade
2221864 the most aggravating factor has been the noise and the dust and having to keep the door shut which has made it less inviting for customers
2221865 i will be glad when it is back to normal we have lost the passing traffic so people dont see that we are here and many pedestrians are avoiding the area because of the work

2221881 after processing the food is practically devoid of any nutritional value to make up for what is lacking vitamins minerals amino acids and supplements are dumped into the mix if the minerals added are unchelated chelated means minerals will more readily combine with proteins for better absorption they will pass through the body virtually unused most are added as a premix and if there is a mistake made in the premix it can throw off the entire balance veterinarians marty goldstein and robert goldstein have stated that the wrong calcium magnesium ratio can cause neuromuscular problems as an example when i had the commercial pet food tested by mann laboratories for my court case most of the minerals showed excess levels
2221882 the whole of this area is now part of a growth area and for the first time in many years we have the potential for significant government funding for infrastructure
2221883 if we are having to take the pain of new housing at the governments behest then we should be going to the government to get some help to ameliorate that pain
2221884 it is unrealistic to expect developers to provide everything on our shopping list because we need to get housing in a range which people can afford so we need to be mature in what we demand from developers but we have the right to ask more from government
2221885 developers already have to bear the costs of social housing within projects legal agreements for infrastructure eco homes what is not needed is another tax at a time when the industry is facing a difficult time and finances are much tighter
2221886 developers are seen as easy targets it is true there have been a good few years and people have been making good money but now people are losing money its cyclical
2221887 government is expecting the industry to meet targets for house building but this will just act an as a disincentive
2221888 people will say should i sell that land should i borrow the money will i be able to sell that housing i think it will put people off

2221941 were always looking for opportunities to show off our wears and theres such fertile ground in this house
2221942 i think all of us were compelled to build something inspired by the craftsmanship in this house and the opportunity to show our work in a historic setting
2221943 i think people should come to learn more about the furniture created most of these people exhibit very rarely in the portsmouth area because theyre so well known

2221948 just because it is has been a quiet summer does not mean dic have lost interest they are happy that things have now become low key and they are awaiting developments
2221949 it is normal legal procedure for companies to wait three months after the granting of planning permission before signing the lease

2221954 i did not want to come to this club and have an easy training session i wanted to come here and fight for my place in the team
2221955 fulham are a top team and they have a great gaffer here a great training ground and it was my first choice
2221956 i was always confident the deal would happen and im happy to be a fulham player i wish everton all the best but im looking forward now
2221957 i had a good few years there and enjoyed it although i had a few injuries in my second year
2221958 we dont want one and we are not seeking one we dont have to sell the player or any player at this stage we dont have to offload players simply because of that situation
2221959 some players were going to leave anyway and that will still happen but its not entirely because of our failure to qualify for the champions league
2221960 we had some money there anyway but we are finding a difficulty in getting a level of player that we want to bring in thats been a difficult task over the close season
2221961 but there is some money there for us to bring in a couple of players yet
2221962 there are specific areas of the field that we want to improve on and hopefully in the three weeks remaining of the transfer window we will be able to do that
2221963 nobody likes to be criticised in any way shape or form
2221964 but you dont become a football manager expecting to go through your career without receiving a level of criticism
2221965 if you are not prepared to accept the criticism you shouldnt become a football mananger
2221966 it comes with the territory when you lose out in the manner we did you expect criticism and its deserved
2221967 i have to accept that ive had it before and it doesnt make it any easier at the moment but you have to try to recover and get on with it and thats exactly what we will do
2221968 we are not responsible for how people react we can only feel the disappointment of the result the other night and every one of us involved feels it
2221969 from the chairman all the way down we feel the disappointment
2221970 the one thing we have to make sure of is that the disappointment doesnt allow our domestic results to be affected
2221971 we suffered a big disappointment midweek and even after a couple of days the disappointment doesnt go away
2221972 but we have to make sure it doesnt affect our overall season
2221973 there is that little bit extra pressure on us to do well in the league and our thoughts must be on that we cant let ourselves be affected too greatly going into our first league game
2221974 like every other club when you dont have european football thats whats left for you to aim for and everybody aims to do as well as they possibly can
2221975 we would hope to do well in the league we certainly made up the gap that was there between ourselves and celtic last season and they were good enough to go on and clinch the championship at the end when we fell just short
2221976 we have to make the spl our aim for the season and the retention of the two cups we won last year would be something wed look for as well
2221977 im still devastated by what happened at leicester and the fact im no longer there
2221978 but i want to get back in the game as soon as possible this is the first time in 30 years ive not had a pre season as a player or as a manager
2221979 but im waiting for someone else to fail arent i thats the nature of football management and in the meantime im left to re educate myself
2221980 im looking to exploit as many media opportunities as possible and am taking my a licence qualification
2221981 im going to watch as many games as possible and hopefully the call will come
2221982 you have got two great big sides in league one this season in leicester and leeds
2221983 hopefully he will develop a strong relationship with the chairman and the players should certainly find it easier than in the championship
2221984 leicester are down at the moment but i look at one of the greatest stories in footballing history
2221985 when bill shankly took over at liverpool they were a second division side in the doldrums
2221986 people said he was crazy when he said they were going to win promotion and be champions of europe
2221987 its like a warzone and everyone needs to be pulling together in the trenches and thats what id say to leicester
2221988 if you back a manager then as an owner you are entitled to expect a return on your investment but there needs to be realism as well
2221989 qpr is another fantastic club i had five years as a player and five as manager and id love to see them back in the premier league
2221990 i felt that the irish fa had provided a viable solution for matches to go ahead in the ifa premiership and ifa championship tomorrow and i extend my sincere apologies to all those affected by this late postponement of the league programme

2222010 the movie uses money to define wealth but makes people question just what it is they are contributing to in their quest to achieve it in india some people have very little but still consider themselves wealthy in the west being an economic superpower people are taught to equate money with wealth and status

2222048 there were 10 of us artists writers curators some people who fall under all these things
2222049 the windows had traditionally been rented as an artists studio space and typically was occupied by one artist we saw it as an opportunity to make a public art space
2222050 i cant speak for everyone who got involved but i wanted to curate outside of film and photography
2222051 daniel and i went to school together at the san francisco art institute
2222052 i just really liked his black and white drawings hes going to be painting the walls the ceiling and probably the floors its going to be an epic cave painting

2222069 this song is for every broken dream every high and every low
2222070 this song a long pause this song is for you
2222071 it was a little slow in may but once the schools let out in june
2222072 ive been pleased and surprised and i didnt hold out high hopes
2222073 to be honest i did not anticipate a great summer
2222074 we sell the things you want not necessarily the things you need
2222075 most of our guests are from new england or are canadians
2222076 once they get their heating bills well vacations and going out to dinner are the first things to go
2222077 the hotel owners are telling me that reservations look good for the fall
2222078 but i worry about oil prices people getting their bills and looking at them this time of year
2222079 in the fall we get a lot of european customers
2222080 they usually have no children or their children are grown and they have more money to spend
2222081 our hotels are full our stores are busy and its hard getting a dinner reservation around here
2222082 for july 4th we had a beautiful weather weekend and some businesses had their best weekend ever
2222083 some businesses are down but a lot more are holding their own and doing better than anticipated
2222084 there are no sites yet in this document and we are at a very early stage in the process
2222085 later in the year there will be potential sites for waste treatment facilities to move away from landfill but we will still need addi tional landfill or overfill as well
2222086 we are building criteria we can carry forward for the future of suffolk
2222087 by looking at the criteria first we can be confident that the second stage will only involve sites that are feasible and suitable
2222088 it is business as usual for us and we need to plan for the future of suffolk and put down good strong policies so we can move forward
2222089 i think theres some progress being made but its slow
2222090 were trying to get together but weve got some ground to cover
2222091 the next four or five days should hopefully bring some answers and things will start coming together
2222092 weve been through this before where it turns into an august situation
2222093 it counts theres the excitement of the players coming up here and getting a victory in this stadium against this team
2222094 though we dont think this type of advertising is appropriate for college sports we have tried this once before in this country and it didnt work very well
2222095 all we told him was tell the truth and cooperate
2222096 i mean hes not very vocal he doesnt have a lot to say but when he does have something to say he says it and the players listen
2222097 i think it was more of a transition like during the season when guys on the defense or the offense would come up to me after plays or at halftime when we were struggling and the whole team would tell me yo kev get the defense up
2222098 for the most part since ive been here ive been playing on natural talent so the coaches have been telling me whats going to take you to the next level and whats going to make you that much better of a player is the technical stuff
2222099 the fans need to know that we will only do whats right for the football club in the short term medium term and the long term
2222100 selling a 29 year old full back for 6million a year after we bought him for 2 5million and doing so in the knowledge that we will replace him is right for the football club in the short term medium term and the long term
2222101 hes saying 6 mil but i bet it was 4 or 5
2222102 we have no intention of selling him no desire we would like jimmy to stay
2222103 given the amount of money given to the club by chairman mr al fayed were reluctant to start re signing contracts that have got two years to go
2222104 woo woo hold your horses lads just because he isnt getting a contract offer now doesnt mean he isnt going to get one in the near future if its a matter of finances then it is simply down to removing a few players of the wage bill for example if rangers had dipped into the pockets and spent 4 mill on davis and removes his wage 20 grand a week and newcastle sign healy 15 grand a week in sheer desperation then you can bet your boots jimmy will get a new contract lets not forget he has just got back from a year and half on the sidelines
2222105 in some ways made things more difficult because the expectations became so high then we won the european super cup and fa cup the following season and so suddenly everyone was saying ok the next step will be the premier league title
2222106 but then when you dont win it people say oh you cant go to that next step when maybe we were operating at the next level up but because the other teams around us were progressing as well it didnt seem that way
2222107 in some respects we were maybe our own worst enemies but of course id prefer to have that problem to be talking as a champions league winner people are talking now about us not having won the league for 18 years but it was 21 years since this club had last won the european cup
2222108 the key is not to say that we can win the title because its clear that its the most difficult league in the world to win look at the final of the champions league last season it was between chelsea and united who are at the top of the table in england
2222109 its clear that we are going in the right direction and progressing we have got good young players coming through who will be important while those with experience are settling down now so it could be a very good season for us
2222110 hey clarkee you want a list of bad buys by saf
2222111 dufferwho tottenham hotspur fan thats the talk of yet another spurs fan raving on about liverpool
2222112 i think hes a really good striker city should keep him
2222113 i really like pierre dreossi the clubs general manager and i believe that is reciprocal
2222114 at the end of last season he promised me that if there was a good offer he would accept that i could leave
2222115 this offer exists it comes from everton who want to buy me for more than 8million euros
2222116 i want to leave rennes everton are offering me 1 5 million euros a year rennes could never offer me that much
2222117 i owe everything to rennes my formative club but they must understand me in africa i have a family to feed and i am very ambitious
2222118 everton are a very established club in the premier league managed by david moyes a coach who puts trust in youngsters
2222119 i have spoken to him on the phone he wanted to invite me to visit the club i hadnt the time to do it
2222120 it annoys me when i hear the rennes directors say i am going to extend my contract i am not going to extend my contract
2222121 rennes must understand me there are things you cant turn down
2222122 i want the directors to come to an agreement i have confidence in that
2222123 i have seen that rennes have recruited a player with the same profile as me kader mangane signed from lens this week
2222124 harrisonm youre right its nearly as funny as liverpool and title contenders being mentioned in the same breath
2222125 what have i been doing for the last 34 years i must have missed something or been asleep somewhere
2222126 they are saying because of scolaris experience chelsea are going to win the league i do not understand that
2222127 i have exactly the same squad as last season and i have to be confident it is not deteriorating i cannot see how that can possibly be the case
2222128 i would have concerns if my team was full of players the same age as ryan giggs but it is not
2222129 in people like anderson nani and tevez we will see a lot of improvement
2222130 and the older ones have looked after themselves their concentration levels are still good and so is their desire
2222131 if anything paul scholes passing is the best it has ever been
2222132 it will not be easy you expect arsenal and liverpool to improve and you would think chelsea with their experience will be there
2222133 but i have to feel this team can defend its title
2222134 at this particular time we are not in the best position fitness wise but it doesnt concern me unduly
2222135 there is a great quality in the squad and a great enthusiasm a lot of them are exhilarated by winning the european cup
2222136 chelseablue666 chelsea fan cant help it pal mourn i nho hads given us a real scare i accept that but once we r given the charge no portugeezer or scholar or fool can change united s destiny yeah but maybe u rivals can get a chance to enjoy cos i dunno where united might head after saf and ronaldo leave the club till that time big fool scholarly
2222137 how many managers has fergie seen off so far in his career big phil will be no different
2222138 hmm i wonder if i can find a sport which i have no knowledge of and go take pictures
2222139 well you started at the top for lacrosse then these guys are the cream of the top

2222145 the change in working hours is the canary in the coal mine
2222146 first you see hours get short and eventually more people will get laid off
2222147 i sincerely hope hull get the deal otherwise meite will be challenging luke moore for the paul williams plonker of the year award
2222148 hes s t anyways no heart take him worst type of defender for a struggling club to buy tho if you ask me
2222149 they need some minutes on the clock before the start of the season
2222150 the community shield is a prestigious match but i have used players in it who were not quite fit and we are more or less in the same situation again
2222151 you can suffer this kind of thing from time to time when you have had a cruciate operation
2222152 we are trying to manage the swelling but he is not ready to take part in any games it is unfortunate for the lad because he was looking forward to the new season
2222153 i dont no wat to say were is g neveil gona play we cant let him come back in the first team after wat wes brown has done over the last season dont think gary will be able to do a better job than wes i have grate respect for gary but think hes past it a bit an wes is the future
2222154 i know him really well and if victor was here that would be absolutely fantastic for us
2222155 but david is having enough problems himself getting players in and victor is at the olympics in any case and so i dont think david will be in the position to let players out on loan until such time as he got his own squad sorted out
2222156 joey has been working very hard on a fitness programme and is just getting his head down which is what he has done ever since i came back to this club
2222157 his training and attitude have been excellent while ive been at this club ive spoken to him and know he has just wants to get back to playing football simple as that
2222158 joey is fine but he wont be featuring in any games until we get him match fit theres no way he can regain match fitness between now and the start of the season and theres no way it would be sensible to give him a game at the moment
2222159 bluetrojan the quotes from keegan are simple statements of fact now i would much rather see barton kicked out of football completely but your comments about keegan being an idiot and lining himself up for being called a fool underline your own lack of intellect and or maturity keegan is one of the football greats and is widely respected for his achievements and i very much doubt that there are many neutrals who share your low opinion of him
2222160 king kev appears to be a bigger idiot than i thought in barton you have a felon who is a nasty little piece of work that should never be allowed to play professional football again lets wait for the next incident either on or off the pitch i know you have been out of the game for years mr keegan but your comments seem to indicate youve been hanging out on another planet wake up before everybody says your a fool
2222161 i have spoken with my agent and everything is on for me to sign for celtic
2222162 a fee has been agreed between the clubs and my agent is dealing with all the personal terms
2222163 that means i should be in glasgow on saturday and i hope to finalise everything and undergo a medical before they play on sunday
2222164 its the biggest move of my career and im very excited about it
2222165 robinho is very angry with the way the madrid bosses are dealing with him
2222166 he calls me every day to know whether anyone has spoken to me about his future and i always have to tell him that no one has called
2222167 i have been trying to speak with someone from the club for three days robinho does not understand what is going on
2222168 his ambition is to become the best player in the world but he wont achieve that at madrid because they treat him like a normal player
2222169 he didnt like at all the idea of being fourth choice in the plans madrid have had this summer
2222170 first they wanted to sign cristiano ronaldo but couldnt their second option was rafael van der vaart third is valencia striker david villa robinho is fourth
2222171 robinhos plan was to play for real madrid for many years
2222172 he is getting affection from chelsea coach luiz felipe scolari he knows robinho well and calls him every day
2222173 yeahh robinho must to calim to chelsea because chelsea is a big club and he can to win a new ecperiece with chelsea whith chelsea robinho can o be a player of year
2222174 nobody from barca has asked me about berbatov there has been no movement on that front all i know is what i read in the papers
2222175 we will have to wait and see what happens it is a question of waiting a bit more and then we will see how things turn out
2222176 all i can say about that is that i know nothing about it either we have a list of forwards and we are working on that not on what journalists or agents are saying
2222177 many things have been said and half of them are just not true
2222178 if we look at things along general lines then tottenham are the club that has been the busiest this summer
2222179 all the major clubs will finish changing their squads next week the champions league starts then and some leagues too
2222180 i do not expect many surprises but there could be some interesting late moves
2222181 after reading reports i dont think it would be to bad if tottenham let berbatov go yes he is a great strike one of the best ive seen however selling him for 30 million pounds to united could open up funds to get players like david villa and arshavin which have both shown interest such an attack would definitely be one of the most feard all over england and possibly in europe all that and they could still have around 10 million to spend on a good solid defender given that they have only spend 1 million this summer by buying for 40 million and selling for 39 good bit of bussiness good luck to them
2222182 only tottenham have dared continue negotiations but as it stands nothing has developed
2222183 my desire to leave is still as strong but there is nothing more to do now other than hope for a miracle
2222184 i understand perfectly well that if i dont move on now i probably never will
2222185 im just hoping that one fine morning the bosses at gazprom will wake up in a good mood and say weve had enough of arshavins whining lets let him go
2222186 when tottenham made their offer i was sceptical at first
2222187 but after ramos called me personally and told me that that they were selling robbie keane and that he wanted me in his side the situation changed
2222188 when a coach shows an interest in you especially such a renowned and strong coach then that is already half of the success of any move
2222189 i also like the way tottenham play so i agreed in principle to join
2222190 a short while later a representative from spurs arrived to discuss my personal terms and contract
2222191 the discussion didnt take long and we agreed on everything quickly only then did my asking price go up
2222192 tottenham have a decent squad with luka modric dimitar berbatov and other players and the club is fully capable of fighting for a place in the champions league
2222193 the main thing is to try my strengths in a league like the english premier league and play against the likes of manchester united chelsea and arsenal on a regular basis rather than once every five years
2222194 i am sure tottenham will be back to make another more suitable offer for arshavins transfer
2222195 there is no set time period or deadline for this zenit are doing everything in the correct way
2222196 if tottenham can sell robbie keane to liverpool for 25 million euros then in my opinion they should pay good money for arshavin
2222197 27 years old and not even a blip on the radar before euros never heard anyone rave about him or linked to any top euro clubs destined to flop
2222198 if u guys read the article it says after spurs made the offer ramos called me personally nothing wrong there in my eyes we made the offer to the club before contacting the player
2222199 he will unfortunately get snagged by another club i can understand stoke getting things wrong in these big signings but how come my team always seem to drag things out and 1 lose the player or 2 pay an overprice because of a made up bidding war
2222200 i think if stoke sign him they will do well and im really glad for stoke they deserve some good players
2222201 there will be some movement before the transfer window shuts i feel we do need two or three more players but whether we can get those in at the rates we want remains to be seen
2222202 a club has tabled a bid for zheng zhi but its not to our valuation so at the minute hes still a charlton player
2222203 there is no chance of me looking to hide away after what happened on the final day of last season
2222204 its not my style i shall take my seat as normal in the directors box there will be nothing different
2222205 but yes it was a wake up call at the time i never thought i would see such vociferous fans aiming those words at me
2222206 and of course we had to admit we had made mistakes last season when it came to carson yeungs attempted buy out of the club there was point to be made but perhaps not in that fashion as no one had died after all
2222207 what happened in the days after the blackburn game rejuvenated me
2222208 several people went out of their way to come up to me and tell me they wanted me to stay so i rediscovered my optimism out of what was a dark day for the club
2222209 now its another season and a new challenge and im looking forward to it
2222210 as he gets older i think he will appreciate being here more and more
2222211 the longer people stay at this club you tend to not want to leave rio ferdinand is an obvious example of that
2222212 i think you all need to stop posting pointless messages on here 1 manchester united fans will back ronaldo and their team 2 liverpool fans will back gerrard and their team
2222213 hang on a minute youve taken my e mail in the wrong way
2222214 well kids are so much better at multi tasking than older people its because theres so much media out there email texting games chat they can easily switch from one to the other

2222226 we know the whole community will be shocked by this act of random violence and i want to reassure the public that we are doing everything we can do to pursue the killers
2222227 we appeal to anyone out there who may have some information however small you may think it to be to come forward and tell us what you know
2222228 i would like to state that ryan was a decent hard working young man and loving son
2222229 i would urge anyone that knows or saw anything to come forward and assist officers from operation trident in their ongoing efforts to trace witnesses to this cold blooded and reckless act
2222230 it makes it a lot harder to hit fairways when the wind is blowing like this youve got to hit it right down the middle and you cant really attack these greens from the rough
2222231 the conditions were much tougher than i expected this morning so i was happy that i was still able to go out and put together a decent score
2222232 the putter was the key to the round i putted pretty well yesterday but the greens were spiked up so i was excited about what i would be able to do in fresher conditions today

2222235 pstros nds is a midp implementation running on the cldc java machine compiled for the nintendo ds it allows you to run some java programs and games written for the mobile phones on your nds to achieve this goal one needs a java machine for processing the bytecode and a program library that implements the midp api in this case the suns kvm java machine was used thanks to torlus and davr for porting it for the nds and providing the source and an altered version of the pstros was used as the midp library both parts were built into the single binary to simplify the execution of the java code on the nds
2222236 but it was visually inacceptable the nds roto scaller simply discards some lines instead of making the pixel interpolation
2222237 we are looking at all possibilities selling the mobile phone under our brand acting as oem for major mobile phone manufacturers as well as supplying to telecom service providers for their bundled packages the price range of our mobiles would be rs 499 2 000 in the next two years there will be 500 million new connections in the country we want to have a good share of that
2222238 its a competitive business i support this theres no other way but they should have done it in the summer when theyre not racing
2222239 no other state keeps their track open when theyre not racing no other racing jurisdiction in america maryland tracks should close when the summer tracks open and the people at bowie they should make them rent the stalls
2222240 five days after the meet ended the track was closed and we were on the road two weeks later they turned the water off then the geniuses in the mtha decided were having year round racing they dont look at the bigger picture the tracks have to look out for themselves
2222241 the only source of cash the association has is the purse account every dollar spent is a reduction in purses
2222242 theres going to be a lot of drama and people saying i lost on the scale thats some expletive
2222243 i was willing to put my life on the line to make this happen i was going to win this tournament i was going to make sure that everyone back home knew that i had given my best and i gave it my whole effort i look back at it and know i gave it 110 percent ive been through cutting weight so many times i know the process this time my body wouldnt do it i just stood up and then i was looking at the ceiling
2222244 i want to let them know that everything they said all the encouragement didnt go in vain
2222245 honestly this was the first time in five years that i came to a tournament and everything was working even though my shoulder is hurting which will need surgery after the olympics i had no other problems i came in 100 percent healthy

2222247 this is the 16th year for the race and the 33rd year for the barbecue
2222248 its 100 percent done by volunteers we use the money for groups like families first aids response seacoast the seacoast family ymca and the salvation army we gave cross roads house a check for 25 000
2222249 we usually sell at least 1 000 and wed rather have leftovers than not enough
2222250 weve been running with the kids for the past 11 years
2222251 running with them was started by sister mary maximillian she started running with a girl who had violent tendencies and was very disturbed we discovered that running is a great tool its a natural antidepressant it makes us focus better and were happier
2222252 we run every day and they share their thoughts with us
2222253 when im down here in the minors i know i can get these guys out
2222254 and hes commanded his slider a little bit more its more consistent with the tilt to it hes not hanging as many hes more consistent hes got a better feel for it that just comes with repetition
2222255 but i dont want to get too far ahead of myself that doesnt do me any good
2222256 his stuff was good before but his command was off
2222257 i think he was trying to overthrow now hes doing a great job of staying within himself and commanding his pitches
2222258 i was able to run and i didnt have any problems after that
2222259 we did something new today so it will be interesting how the knee responds
2222260 if i dont have any problems then i think thats going to be a big step forward
2222261 selbst nach aussagen der stadt w re entenwerder von der anlage her geeignet gewesen f r ein camp aber der schwarz gr ne senat will unseren protest unsichtbar machen
2222262 trotzdem sind wir froh einen platz vertraglich besiegelt zu haben der aufbau wir nun in windeseile beginnen wir lassen uns auch durch einen zwar sch nen aber abgelegenen platz nicht davon abhalten eine woche lang die themen die uns wichtig sind und wof r wir uns treffen an die ffentlichkeit zu bringen
2222263 wir w nschen uns nun einen guten kontakt zu unseren nachbarn wir laden alle hamburgerinnen ein uns im camp und unser veranstaltungsprogramm zu besuchen und an den aktionen teil zu nehmen

2222265 i have all the respect in the world for chad as a person and a player
2222266 he gave his heart and soul to this organization for a long long time i really appreciate everything he has done
2222267 im happy with the people we have here right now
2222268 we have three quarterbacks right now on the team and were finding it hard right now to get all three of those guys the work they need but were doing that
2222269 i am fine missing a start is news to me
2222270 i feel great no one has ever discussed missing a start with me i am pitching i have not discussed missing a start with anybody
2222271 do i feel as good as id like to no but its that time of year
2222272 the integrity of the rest of the championship is at stake
2222273 im not saying durham deliberately prepared a bad pitch but if theres no penalty they and other teams with strong seam attacks will always want these sort of pitches
2222274 the game is going to be a shambles and we wont produce test cricketers
2222275 the pitch panel asked all the usual questions but apparently they think there was nothing wrong with the pitch its not sour grapes because i would have said the same if wed won
2222276 its ridiculous and i cant say how bad we feel about it even shivnarine chanderpaul couldnt score runs on that pitch if the ecb are not going to do anything about pitches like that why waste money sending inspectors round the country
2222277 both times we have had a pitch panel in my four years here kent have been involved they are used to playing on good pitches in the south
2222278 listen to the greek byzantine choirs recording of the divine liturgy in greek then well talk
2222279 field recordings made at monasteries in greece dont sound anywhere close to the greek byzantine choir
2222280 the nasal sounding stuff the old man sings before the divine liturgy
2222281 sounds more like the muslim call to prayer than christian singing
2222282 in the trisagion but it is nonetheless a wonderful translation which adheres quite closely to the greek text
2222283 some elements of of the traditional interchange between two choirs are preserved through the use of alternating soloists
2222284 increase the understanding and appreciation of both the spirituality of orthodox worship and the heights of musical expression to which its chanting aspires
2222285 i cannot exclude electricity from my thinking when i think of making any plans i have to factor the lack of electricity
2222286 we cannot work without electricity because generators are not dependable
2222287 when i decided to purchase an updated model of my bakery i did not think of electricity
2222288 i could not operate it at all because of the inconsistency of electricity the bakery needs stable power it cost around 45 000 dollars now im ready to sell for 20 000 dollars
2222289 now the province gets power from iran under a contract signed about two years ago between the iraqi government and iran
2222290 it is supposed to build voltage regulators each 100 kilometres from the border to the province to avoid loss in the power
2222291 there is another line of power from iran which is being worked on and should be finished within a month
2222292 this will have a great effect on the improvement of the voltage and increasing the hours given
2222293 some houses burnt down because of the extremely high voltage from these
2222294 scientists will be shocked to see what iraqis are doing it shows how much people are suffering
2222295 the shortage of rain which last winter was 30 percent of what it was in previous years has led to an obvious impact on water levels in the tigris and euphrates and their tributaries
2222296 the lack of water from irans al wand river and from the darbandikhan dam in the kurdistan regional government krg has caused lake hamrin to lose nearly 80 percent of its capacity
2222297 people cannot sleep on the housetops at night where it is cooler
2222298 well it is ironic that one of the newer forms of energy production has somewhat of an impact on wildlife in the big picture it may be less than some other forms but there is a certain level of impact on wildlife
2222299 we definately need to be concerned with wildlife with the land and projects like that its just part of our heritage we want to keep going
2222300 convinced that we can build wind energy and other sources of energy responsibly but we have to have the science underpinning the decisions thats gonna be critical and fundamental to doing it responsibly so that we can have both the wildlife and conservation values as well and the energy we obviously need for this country
2222301 im against it not to say this is a bad thing to do i think its very good idea to have this halfway house for our criminals or parolees is definitely help them get off their substance abuse whatever it may be i just dont think where theyre wanting to put it is in my backyard is right
2222302 the truth about it is these people have been to treatment anywhere from six to nine months theyre getting ready to exit the system and were trying to provide places for them to come to so that they can practice the skills that theyve already learned so that we can enhance those skills so that we can teach them more skills
2222303 it is a natural result of what is going on in iraq under this u s occupation that so many iraqi students failed the high school exams
2222304 how can a student pass such difficult exams feeling terrified exhausted in the heat in darkness without electricity having to work in the absence of a dead or detained father and all the problems of the world over his head
2222305 i am ashamed of the results my school achieved this year
2222306 i cannot tell you what percentage we achieved because that will reveal me and my school you do not really believe we are living in a democratic country do you
2222307 if a student is the son of a senior government official or of a member of an armed group how can we stop them from cheating we would be killed
2222308 the low number of students who passed the exams shows credibility and discipline
2222309 i live in an old two room house with my family after we were evicted from shab quarter of amiriya in baghdad
2222310 there are five of us plus our parents in the small place that lacks most living necessities such as electricity not to mention the noisy atmosphere of the crowded space i passed arabic and english because i am good at them but failed the other exams that needed me to study hard
2222311 my father was detained by u s forces in 2005
2222312 his fashion shop was looted by the so called iraqi army who came with the americans to take him away and so now i have to work as a labourer to support my family
2222313 i decided to stop fooling myself by dreaming of going to college and becoming a lawyer
2222314 one has to face reality that iraq is finished as a country
2222315 the americans and their collaborators need us as dirty policemen and garbage collectors who locate roadside bombs for them
2222316 we must realise that college has become a luxury that we cannot afford

2222329 she basically sets the table for us on every play she makes other players shine on the court id say that over 50 percent of our points begin with her either making an assist or digging out a tough serve
2222330 i played outside hitter in middle school because at that time i was a lot taller than the other girls
2222331 after a little while the other girls started to grow and soon enough i wasnt the tallest anymore
2222332 thats when i switched to libero i love the position because its all about passing and if youre playing well you set the tone for the whole game
2222333 she made the varsity team that year because she played very well the previous summer and she had a smooth consistent fluid movement toward the ball she makes everything she does look easy
2222334 it was very exciting being with all those older players
2222335 it took mcintosh a little longer than usual to start being vocal her sophomore year
2222336 i think because she was younger than most of the team she didnt want to step out of place and yell at the older players
2222337 once she started talking with seniors like chelsea daley however she seemed to be more comfortable
2222338 that game against simi valley she was all over the court going after every ball
2222339 she had a fire in her eye that was new and she seemed to cover more of the court
2222340 there was a couple times where simi would have a huge hit at the net and then would start cheering thinking they had already gotten the point only to see mcintosh had made a nice dig
2222341 last season we were without one of our best players daley who wasnt just a good player but was also a natural born leader
2222342 we were all friends last year but chemistry wise something just clicked off
2222343 i think that role just comes with being a senior
2222344 id like it if the other girls looked up to me because i feel i can relate to the younger girls since i also played on the varsity team as a sophomore
2222345 at the banquet last year i challenged her to break the school record and get 400 digs i believe she can do it
2222346 she seems to always know where our big hitters are going to be
2222347 they had tattoos patches everyone was crazy for them especially the germans theyre just nuts for them huge fans

2222354 a cataract is a clouding of the lens of the eye
2222355 and they tend to grow gradually so changes in vision may not be noticeable at first
2222356 we can manage some of the symptoms of cataracts in the early stages with sunglasses or eyeglasses with anti reflective lenses
2222357 but when the cataract interferes with daily activities its time to consider surgery
2222358 those are dollars we could be spending in the classroom
2222359 many people would drop from the service so the fees would continue to go up and in the end no one will want to ride the school bus
2222360 it doesnt hurt for parents to help officers by referencing the section in the vehicle code
2222361 there are going to be hundreds of students who will be all over the streets walking on bikes and in cars who were formerly safely on their way home in the buses
2222362 of course we want to accommodate families with transportation but we had to scrutinize expenditures and take a look at everything
2222363 i completely understand the funding dilemma that the school has and that they have to make cuts however a plan should have been devised between the city and district prior to canceling the high school transportation
2222364 if parents think transportation is a priority they should insist upon it so school officials reevaluate their priorities and make cuts elsewhere
2222365 it should be a great night its a full moon and we will have vendors on hand selling popcorn and other movie treats
2222366 i think we picked a fun family film that has relevance to the world today
2222367 for the first time last year movie sales were overtaken by game sales so we know that the demand for the product is out there and there are a lot of gamers in the area

2222377 we had not been given a chance to review the last and most controversial section before it was printed up and i felt that the process had not been done fairly the trust that had built up over the past few weeks was rapidly evaporating for me
2222378 today we shall see the final version of the document which reports the conference but there has been no process by which the members of the conference can agree the text
2222379 i think if the north american churches dont accept the need for moratoria then at least we are no further forward as a communion we would be in great peril
2222380 a clear and detailed specification for the task and composition of a pastoral forum
2222381 there was a sense that that sort of external support was something worth pursuing
2222382 sacrifice has to be accepted voluntarily thats true thats why this means something about consent there are those i know who wont be willing to take on that kind of sacrifice there is something about the preservation of the global fellowship that is bigger than any of us

2222384 in a statement bishop ingham called the wcg document copies of which were distributed to bishops for discussion punitive in tone setting out penalties and the like instead of inviting us into deeper communion with one another through mutual understanding in the body of christ
2222385 bishop ingham also questioned why the windsor report was being regarded as an agreed benchmark from which it is assumed we can move forward
2222386 bishop ingham said that the wcgs proposals seeks to impose a singular uniformity upon the complex diversity of our communion
2222387 if the proposals are accepted by the communion it will put the anglican church of canada in the position of having to support and defend irrational prejudice and bigotry in the eyes of our nation he added
2222388 the positive effects in parts of the communion when homosexual people are accepted as gods children are treated with dignity and choose to give their lives to christ and to live in the community of faith as disciples of jesus christ with fidelity and commitment
2222389 it is not a bad thing to live and work together without resolution walking by faith and not by sight

2222422 karadzic case offers court a chance to repair its image
2222423 milosevic at times seemed to be in control of his own trial turning normally sombre proceedings into a freewheeling forum in order to air his many political grievances
2222424 of course it will take some months before the prosecution and defence will be ready to start it will be a complex trial but we are fully aware of the importance of being efficient
2222425 a major failing of the system was exposed in the conduct of the milosevic trial where the considerable degree of lenience offered to the defendant proved counter productive
2222426 is acting as a lawyer and not as the client in the courtroom
2222427 the judges priority is to respect the defendants right to defend himself one of their methods of doing that was to say to him he being an intelligent man a lawyer and a banker and everything else youve got two hours three hours four hours two days to cross examine this witness and crucially its a matter for you how you spend your time
2222428 you have to think how much worse it might have looked if theyd been jumping down his throat the whole time saying you cant ask this you cant ask that that would have been to deprive him much more publicly and obviously of a fair trial
2222429 by doing things that people think were political speeches he took bad points and he revealed things about himself which in fact had he conducted the case in a more measured way and been more careful to take good points might never have emerged
2222430 so he emerged as a bully and intolerant unamusing and that may have worked to his disadvantage
2222431 a lot of the things that are constantly being bandied about in the media like for instance telling a suspect to shut up or limiting his ability to rant about particular events are not actually doable
2222432 i would say that attention to procedure and a rather relaxed view giving mr karadzic the necessary time even if it means ranting is i would submit important
2222433 i believe that it is better for the court to move slowly than for it to appear to be moving fast this is one case where seeing justice done is probably more important than justice being done
2222434 icty has to persuade ordinary serbs that regardless of what happened to milosevic the trial of karadzic despite all the years of him as a fugitive and despite all the frustration will be a normal trial with the individual presumed to be innocent
2222435 he must be seen to be airing all that he wants to air including all the conspiracy theories like the promises that he supposedly got from the americans
2222436 it doesnt really matter if he brings new ones all the time but he shouldnt be allowed to chew over them like a dried up curd forever more which is what we used to have with mr milosevic
2222437 experience is hugely valuable and the court now has a whole lot more experience with the problems of unrepresented defendants that they didnt have in the milosevic case it was a new problem
2222438 i dont think that the lets say modus operandi of milosevic ever came out clearly as it might have if the trial had proceeded to look at his career chronologically and look more closely at the antecedents of the kind of things he ended up doing
2222439 i think the challenge in a sense is not going to be quite as great
2222440 i think if the prosecutors are wise and i have a great deal of confidence in them when they prosecute the trial i think theyll seize on that and use a lot of very direct evidence
2222441 under conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction in whole or in part of those national ethnical racial or religious groups
2222442 i believe that the karadzic trial is their best shot to prove that genocide occurred in bosnia in 1992 and i think even more so than in the case of mladic they will have the evidence at hand to prove mens rea genocidal intent and the various deeds which were effectively carrying out that intent
2222443 the indictment needs to be expanded to take account of the criminality of milosevic and the involvement of milosevic and belgrade in these crimes
2222444 in order to lay out the history of srebrenica you need to have evidence of what part milosevic took in it they might add that in i think they probably may do
2222445 the milosevic trial is a thing of the past and his guilt or innocence not being definitively established its much easier more advisable to focus on karadzic as an individual perpetrator rather than trying to weave a complex web around him when in fact at least for most of the war he was the primary perpetrator
2222446 to me theres no judicial utility to linking him to milosevic and belgrade beyond what is necessary to establish that it provided him with perhaps some of the means to carry out what he did
2222447 most of south ossetian territory has been liberated and is under georgian control

2222450 a full scale aggression has been launched against georgia he said insisting that his nation would yield neither territory nor its liberty

2222460 other shop traders also told me that people were saying to them that it was offensive and that i should cover her up or move her
2222461 but i dont want to offend anybody so i moved her i dont think you would found this response in leeds or york i dont think anyone would bat an eyelid
2222462 they the breastfeeding group were a bit upset that i moved her because they wanted to see her
2222463 the ferag finishing lines we have acquired recently give us the opportunity to relocate finishing from greaves to our other print sites thereby improving efficiency and reducing transportation
2222464 who led the israelites when confusion reigned supreme among the children of god amai mugabe rose as a mother of the nation
2222465 in a nation that had to contend with a resurgence of political violence following the harmonised elections
2222466 amai mugabe toured homesteads of victims of the barbarism and helped them begin to reconstruct their lives literally from the ashes and while taking the opportunity to help the victims amai mugabe became one of the first national political leaders to condemn violence after the elections
2222467 i think the whole thinking is that whatever the result of the negotiations in pretoria the two should be seen by the general populace in good light
2222468 the first lady amai grace mugabe turns 43 today with a determined effort to see the improvement of lives among disadvantaged children in zimbabwe the plight of disadvantaged children including hiv and aids orphans and children with disabilities has been a major priority in her charity work the first ladys patronage of danhiko project which is a school for people with disabilities and her grand plan to establish an orphanage in mazowe bear testimony to her commitment to disadvantaged communities
2222469 at the end people will say although he has killed people and maimed thousands he has given us land and agricultural implements and has economically empowered us and they will be ready to forgive him
2222470 in history benevolent despots only remained in power as long as the people allowed them to if the people had a change of mind then the despots were deposed quickly for almost ten years mugabe has been fighting the will of the people by stealing elections
2222471 but if mugabe has improved the lives of the people it was only to strengthen his own authority
2222472 oh no you see it is simply a very young girls record of her own thoughts and impressions and consequently meant for publication

2222487 its a danger to human life a danger to marine life and to future life
2222488 i do not condemn the international criminal court indictment against sudanese president omar hassan al bashir
2222489 if museveni had said anything contrary it would have been a surprise
2222490 what moral authority does he have to discredit a court which he has dealt with in trying to solve one of his biggest political challenges lra
2222491 possible indictment is like a heaven sent opportunity for museveni
2222492 finally sins against uganda are catching up with him thats what one expects museveni to think
2222493 most of the african leaders backed al bashir because of the fact that al bashir is a sitting president and many of them are leading countries in situations similar to sudan and some are worse
2222494 in uganda we are using both the icc and the traditional alternative justice mechanisms so we shouldnt be seen to be promoting impunity by backing bashir
2222495 most of the african leaders are behaving as if bashir is already convicted
2222496 our president should know better because he has used the icc to bring justice to the northern conflict
2222497 president kagame is not expected to endorse such a move icc indictment of al bashir
2222498 he has already been indicted by the spanish and french courts so he is opposed to universal jurisdiction
2222499 we are going ourselves to investigate and work closely with the sudanese government
2222500 even if i dont get a tenured position i will work for the local school because the wages have doubled
2222501 there are a large number of graduates but only a few positions are available through the competitions
2222502 more secure for the future as long as there is a real chance of getting a tenured position
2222503 meeting the demands of the 21st century able to withstand new challenges and comprehensively guaranteeing the military security of the state
2222504 it is hard to say what exactly caused this lack of progress
2222505 it was either that mikael harutiunian who replaced serzh sarkisian as defence minister was unprepared to embark on real change or that the political decision to begin reforms had not been taken at the highest level
2222506 in any case for many months nato representatives were extremely sceptical about the capacity of the armenian military leadership to push forward defence reforms successfully
2222507 this calls for an extremely careful and thorough approach so that the rights of military personnel are not ignored
2222508 in present day armenia the army is the only state institution which basically has the unconditional support of society irrespective of their political sympathies
2222509 in my view the armenian army will not weaken but on the contrary become stronger because peoples level of trust in their armed forces will increase
2222510 more regulated and precise planning of defence spending as foreseen by our ipap will ensure that our army can be optimised
2222511 russias military presence in armenia is fully justified in terms of guaranteeing the security of our republic
2222512 our reporters are working in some very risky areas and are taking on some very edgy topics
2222513 we were told that we could lose our business or even the whole company
2222514 the companies that do run these kind of ads in opposition papers get audited by the tax service the health and safety directorate and even the fire service and these agencies uncover a lot of problems
2222515 they are told that from time to time placing ads in independent newspapers is permitted
2222516 but placing one ad in an independent newspaper requires that it als be placed in some four to five official newspapers and no ads are ever allowed in opposition newspapers otherwise the punishment can be harsh
2222517 firstly these companies dont actually need advertisements at all because of the shadow closed and monopolistic economy the second and main reason is the control exerted by the presidential administration they want to keep newspapers dependent most of the media in the country id say 90 or 95 per cent are financed by the government
2222518 taking this as a basis the advertising market here should be no smaller than 100 million manats 123 million us dollars in reality its just two million manats
2222519 the ad market in azerbaijan is run according to ideological rules
2222520 in western countries small businesses control 60 to 70 per cent and large ones 20 to 30 per cent of the advertising market in azerbaijan 90 per cent of the advertising market belongs to big business
2222521 in 2005 we signed one year advertising contracts with five banks
2222522 however on the eve of the parliamentary election in october 2005 all five banks refused to place ads with us later we started to publish our magazine as a weekly but after that before the next elections we had to halt operations
2222523 the instructions are that a company that places an advertisement in an independent paper also has to run ads in a couple of state newspapers the companies themselves have confirmed this to us
2222524 foreign companies operating here prefer to place advertisements in newspapers published in english and russian
2222525 there are ads placed in our newspaper but the income from them does not cover the expenses of the editorial office
2222526 there needs to be supply and demand if the advertising market is to develop it looks as though the electronic media is more developed than print and advertisers prefer to place ads in the electronic media
2222527 to solve this problem we submitted a concept note on state support for the media to president ilham aliev a month ago if advertisements are controlled from a single centre the problem of placing unequal numbers of ads in different newspapers will be resolved the press council can perform this role
2222528 the press council primarily consists of several small unknown and state newspapers
2222529 once the council starts pushing for ads in its own newspapers the situation will become even more difficult for independent and opposition newspapers
2222530 our reporters are working in some very risky areas and are taking on some very edgy topics
2222531 there are going to be times when we cant wait for somebody now youre either on the bus or off the bus if youre on the bus and you get left behind then youll find it again if youre off the bus in the first place then it wont make a damn
2222532 i have so much energy and my stamina is incredible for a 54 year old and to me the best part is that i did it all by myself without spending money having surgery taking pills or trying the latest diet fad
2222533 when you get to this point of the year there are no flukes
2222534 unless you have a huge setback youre going to be there all year long
2222535 theres no question its going to be a three team race the rest of the way it would be nice if it was a one team race but that would be no fun
2222536 i havent done anything because we havent played anyone yet
2222537 its practice so of course we go hard but the coaches want to see what you can do when the lights go on its big for rookies because you want to show that you know the defense and can play the system im looking forward to it im excited
2222538 for the older guys if youve been around the block a couple of times you know what youre going to have to do when you get out there play a couple of plays during the preseason and be healthy for the regular season
2222539 what we are doing out here live in practice is more important preseason is tough because you arent really game planning
2222540 i want to look at guys who are trying to make this team and how that second and third group plays who shines
2222541 were looking for some good backup people at linebacker we have five safeties so i think there is great competition those guys are going to play a lot especially guys like sean considine j r reed and quintin demps we have to kind of sort that out
2222542 then i think its going to be beneficial for a guy like mcdougle who i think is having a great preseason well see how he does in a game the whole preseason is big for him
2222543 you know all i can do is take care of the things that i can control
2222544 its been so long since i played a game im just looking forward to getting pressure on a quarterback again
2222545 im giving 110 percent in practice and thats what ill do in this game then the chips will fall where they may
2222546 last year it was your first nfl game experience so there were a lot more unknowns
2222547 he went out and did a 10 mile run while he was here he came back and he was coughing up blood he didnt run again
2222548 is that when i can see them i realize theyre not all that far away
2222549 how could a nation that gloried in his triumph treat him like a second class citizen
2222550 the question is as valid as the story is phony he did not throw his gold medal away but lost it and devised a powerful fable to cover his own carelessness
2222551 his rigid rules on amateurism were being ridiculed by journalists and tested by an increasing number of athletes who saw everyone making money from their efforts but themselves
2222552 it was razor blades to edit and i would write my own stuff to go along with it to get information on an athlete i would go to the encyclopedia britannica or that sort of thing
2222553 smoggy as hell giving way to just plain smoggy and with luck there could be a shower heavy enough to scrub a few thousand tons of carbon based particulates from the air
2222554 i think its because he does it in a non glamorous fashion he doesnt blow guys away or shatter bats or get a lot of strikeouts but hes the type of guy who can frustrate an opponent because you look up in the sixth inning and youre being shut out
2222555 when you have a sinker it doesnt matter if the opposing team is looking for it
2222556 when he has his sinker he can go six shutout innings like tonight
2222557 ground ball pitchers can always work themselves out of trouble
2222558 at the same time kyle is good enough to get himself out of trouble youve got to give him credit for that
2222559 coming into camp this year i was just trying to make the team so as long as im pitching up here i dont care
2222560 i like both roles whether you are starting or relieving you are trying to get guys out once you toe the rubber its all the same
2222561 setup guys guys that can pitch in the eighth inning they dont just grow on trees
2222562 theyre just not there for you to have you never know what you have until somebody goes in and actually does it in the situation he has the right demeanor for it i dont think were going to attempt to make him a starter i think hes found his niche on what hes going to do
2222563 i think it would be hard to find somebody to do what he does in the bullpen theres something to be said for having some success where hes at and leaving him alone you dont know how well he would adapt going back to starting
2222564 going to be a function in large degree to what our uniform staff suggests but i have general philosophies and one of them is if it aint broke dont fix it the eighth inning is an important role somebody is going to have to convince me otherwise but my job is to be open minded and see what the best role is for jim and the team
2222565 significant attention to increasing our starting pitching options this offseason
2222566 i think the role that fits johnson greatest is as a starter
2222567 starters are tough to find and you can always go back to the other way if you needed to but he has pretty good command and a decent feel hes a big durable kid and one thing he does is throw strikes
2222568 he throws strikes has a nice assortment of pitches and goes right at hitters from the standpoint of having the pitches to do that i believe johnson could be successful but will he be able to bounce back when he blows a save or two saves in a row the only way to find out is to put him in that role and see what happens
2222569 there must be clearly a distinction between the fog and pollution
2222570 the fog you see is based on the basis of humidity and heat it does not mean this fog is the same as pollution there can be pollution but the fog is not necessarily pollution
2222571 they do not have the same confidence they once had can we return sport to its very essence to the fair play concept we must if we do not then part of the world as weve known it for all of our lives is going to leave us
2222572 the public will desert any sport in time if theyre not satisfied by its integrity
2222573 there is a level of sophistication and intelligence that is evolving all the time
2222574 hes endured and hes still throwing the same stuff it shows that pitching isnt about throwing hard its about being smart
2222575 as far as i know im going to play in 2009
2222576 theres a lot of baseball left to be played this year and thats what i need to remain focused on i have to get through this year healthy but if i do that i have all intentions of playing next year
2222577 its usually one of the first things that goes through my mind
2222578 youre taking him away from the people who could help him thats not something were comfortable with right now
2222579 the team is doing great things i just want to stay out of the way believe it or not i can stay out of the way
2222580 i hope this is the last change well make for a long time
2222581 it wasnt that weird because id never done it before
2222582 hes like the pudgy guy who shows up at the company picnic everybody is laughing and then he walks away with all the trophies
2222583 its just real old and they havent kept it up ive heard stories about former mets manager art howe coming off a road trip and finding a rat a live rodent on his desk i remember us trying to catch a rat running around in the bullpen
2222584 this is a baseball game and these games are important because teams are trying to make the playoffs and everybody understands that
2222585 of course we didnt score and when you dont score youre not going to win
2222586 there must be clearly a distinction between the fog and pollution
2222587 the fog you see is based on the basis of humidity and heat it does not mean this fog is the same as pollution there can be pollution but the fog is not necessarily pollution
2222588 they do not have the same confidence they once had can we return sport to its very essence to the fair play concept we must if we do not then part of the world as weve known it for all of our lives is going to leave us the public will desert any sport in time if theyre not satisfied by its integrity
2222589 there is a level of sophistication and intelligence that is evolving all the time
2222590 if you find a small lump just go and have it checked
2222591 itll be too late if it got big like mine
2222592 she can look at it and remember me as who i was mums brought me these i appreciate what mummys done
2222593 but i will be thinking about her anyway when im up there
2222594 we had some momentum going on our side after tuesday nights game and you come in here and before you know it youre down
2222595 its always going to be starting pitching starting pitching not only sets the tone for you but gives you the feeling that youre going to have a chance one way or the other
2222596 i think its a good road trip if we wouldve won today it wouldve been a great road trip
2222597 theres some room for improvement but i cant fault the effort its just that at this particular point in time we know were capable of doing more if everything just kind of goes a little bit better
2222598 you never expect that but you do envision this when you were a kid for your first at bat you want to go deep and it actually came true so its real special
2222599 that means a lot it means my names going to be in the record books for as long as baseball exists so its real neat
2222600 the only time you think about the wall is when youre in wrigley field because if you hit that wall youre not going to get up for the most part you just try to find the wall and make a play
2222601 certainly you have to be real careful what you ask for sometimes i havent asked for anything i understand that its not always greener on the other side i do know that when you have to play 162 games you just never know whats going to happen
2222602 there comes a point in time when youve gone that far that you just leave all your options open
2222603 i dont know that that would be a time to need or desire to shut all my options off it wouldnt mean that i couldnt sign with them at the end of the year ive been here for a long time and im willing to stay anytime the team comes to you to talk youre always going to listen but thats about as far as i can go because nothing has ever come about
2222604 i think im probably more prepared to handle it now
2222605 i just didnt want to deal with it for six weeks of spring training and thats probably the same way i feel this next winter if they are going to do something id rather have them do it before i go to spring training
2222606 coming from where i came from as a kid from the dominican republic i never even dreamed about this happening
2222607 its always something that would be very special to me
2222608 but like i said in a couple months when the seasons over ill sit down and make those decisions
2222609 its great to hear that the fans of baltimore want a winner because theyre great fans i was one of them for a long time
2222610 i think it would probably be different if the orioles had won a lot recently but with the dominance of the yankees and red sox those fans are just hungry
2222611 the great thing is on the field i keep getting traded to a better situation last year we were so close with the braves and couldnt get over the hump this year i went to the team with the best record in baseball thats nice but its tough having to move your family so much
2222612 it was a huge thing in my life right next to my two children being born
2222613 my mom she cried and ive never seen my dad cry ever until last night
2222614 i know he hasnt written himself off but myself personally and im not speaking for club president andy macphail and im not speaking for chris ray i dont know the benefit of what could be gained by bringing him back to the big leagues for a week or so in september
2222615 i think the conservative approach is a lot more wise
2222616 that decision to bring him up is totally andy macphails
2222617 hes done a good job were six games over 500 since he took over weve got a long way to go offensively but hes really laid the groundwork for some of the right stuff offensively the guys like playing for him
2222618 it was one of the hardest decisions i have made in my boxing career
2222619 we expect gross margin to be about 31 5 reflecting approximately 23 million related to stock based compensation expense down from 34 8 in the june quarter this sequential decline is expected due to three primary factors first the full quarter impact of the back to school promotion second a future product transition which i cant discuss today and third the one time true up of our contract manufacturer deferred margin that we realized in the june quarter
2222620 the fun part is figuring how this all fits into apples strategy as not just a maker of computers but also as a seller and distributor of entertainment content
2222621 the ntt chip is not just an h 264 decoder it encodes too which is what makes it so special the last i heard nhk was claiming the chip could compress a 1080p video and audio stream into four megabits per second down from the 20 megabits normally required if we assume apple will apply the same kind of wink wink nudge nudge transcoding to 1080p that theyve already applied to 720p in the apple tv then it is within reason to expect theyll claim to distribute 1080p over itunes in two megabits per second
2222622 how to keep on keeping on in your charmed and blessed happy marriage
2222623 that the us is not at the center of the war of ideas and in that way we can accomplish our goals with people who dont necessarily like our policies
2222624 the focus becomes defeating an ideology not making ourselves liked
2222625 helping anti radical muslims defeat the ideology of extremists is precisely the right strategy for waging the battle of ideas
2222626 contest under way in most muslim societies for control of social educational cultural and political power
2222627 much larger in scope and duration than peaks and valleys in the arab israeli peace process or other regional issues
2222628 and we need to be actively engaged on the hopeful constructive side of this battle
2222629 its a clash of perceptions and a clash of narratives
2222630 our role is to be a facilitator of choice to allow young people to make their own choices rather than imposing them
2222631 to simply say we have our differences with you about the iraq so lets just move beyond that i dont see where it takes us
2222632 even if you were able to somehow remove that you still have the fact that they do not see this common enemy that us policy is focused on
2222633 if you start talking about islam saying we know what good islam is and what bad islam is when youre doing that as westerners you get into trouble
2222634 the conventional wisdom is that because of the alleged unpopularity of the us in muslim societies any connection with the us government or even many us quasi governmental agencies is the kiss of death for local activists
2222635 the reality is that local activists are smart and mature enough to recognize issues where they welcome us support and issues where they may disagree with us policy not letting the latter dissuade them from the former
2222636 it was all for show if mr hamdan does not go home in december
2222637 i would like to apologize one more time to all the members and i would like to thank you for what you have done for me
2222638 i can reassure you that the defense department is hard at work on this issue
2222639 i hope the day comes that you return to your wife and daughters and your country and youre able to be a provider a father and a husband in the best sense of all those terms
2222640 the decision showed what the jury thought hamdan was worth
2222641 there is a perception that trying people in front of the military was going to be a rubber stamp process
2222642 this shows they are conscientious following instructions and are making rational decisions
2222643 the government attempted to inflame the emotions of the panel
2222644 its true there are work opportunities in yemen but not at the level i needed after i got married and not to the level of ambitions that i had in my future
2222645 i personally present my apologies to them if anything that i did has caused them pain
2222646 you have found him guilty of offenses that have made our world extremely unsafe and dangerous
2222647 the government asks you to deliver a sentence that will absolutely keep our society safe from him
2222648 the problem is the law was specifically written after the fact to target mr hamdan
2222649 we wanted to spend as little time as possible coming up with an exploit so we picked miller breached a macbook air one of three laptops up for grabs in the
2222650 we sat down about three weeks ago and decided we wanted to throw our hats into the ring
2222651 it took us a couple of days to find something then the rest of the week to work up an exploit and test it
2222652 i used to think server side vulnerabilities were easier to exploit but now i almost think its easier to exploit the client side think about a browser theres a million things it has to do it has to handle images and video and audio and thats where the danger is these days
2222653 we have a lot of colleges and universities in pittsburgh
2222654 we might not be coming across a ton of macs right now but were steadily seeing more and we needed to be proactive
2222655 its not like we get a mac and say oh well guess we cant do anything with this one
2222656 we will get into the computer it just might take us longer id like to see us be more efficient about it every time we get a mac we have to go looking for help
2222657 its no surprise he was attractive to a team thats in first place we just felt going forward it would give us an opportunity for some others in our organization who have some upside to get a look over the rest of 08 and 09 i think we have that guy a right handed setup reliever in our system and im going to need to fill some other needs so i can use the dough
2222658 computer display all known sources of dilithium crystals in the kraxon nebula
2222659 despite a softening global economy we delivered solid gains in worldwide sales pc shipments and profits
2222660 we didnt have any fear and weve got to look at it the same way just work hard and our ability and team spirit will come out
2222661 hopefully we can turn it around and make it automatic promotion
2222662 the only problem would be if we start dwelling on last season and since weve been back at training we havent
2222663 when you play in front of a decent crowd and atmosphere its something that you miss
2222664 weve got to be careful you can feel that youve made it but you have to work very hard to maintain the level
2222665 we got our striker in and gavin williams as well and they do enhance the squad
2222666 i dont think it was luck last year weve got a good group of footballers
2222667 every game we played i didnt feel that the opposition was in any way that far better than us
2222668 una obra modelo de este pa s y un orgullo de todos los espa oles
2222669 una ciudad de m s de un mill n de viviendas
2222670 they are gonna try and make you afraid of me
2222671 dont penalize me because i am black dont oppress me because i am black
2222672 i probably got more from that dream playing in the nfl and not accomplishing it than i got from any of the ones i did accomplish
2222673 the brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something
2222674 do not stay on the same bus on the same train on the same plane in the same buildings or any place the chinese are
2222675 there should be increased production in all major sectors of the economy he gono addressed symptoms as opposed to the root causes
2222676 what monetary policy that was a political statement that was made the nonsense about zimbabwe being under sanctions was not monetary there were a few currency changes but that is where it ends freezing wages is not going to end hyperinflation
2222677 we are looking at a situation whereby the us dollarisation of the economy is going to increase because our own money would have become worthless
2222678 the main causer of hyperinflation is gideon gono who is printing money which is being used for handouts and is being given to political thugs to beat up people
2222679 we believe that any central bank should know the amount of money that is in circulation and clearly allowing people to scrounge for old money from their drawers will make it impossible to know how much currency is on the market it could further push up inflation
2222680 if you drive us more than you have done we will impose emergency measures and we do not want to place our country in a situation of emergency rules they can be tough rules you know
2222681 we want to leave you with the freedom the flexibility to make decisions you businesses need to be rewarded for your efforts customers also need a fair price not ripping them off
2222682 the rate at which prices are rising is a major cause of concern which needs to be addressed
2222683 the reserve bank no longer has the capacity to print wads of useless currency so gono has decided that the old coins must get back into the system at their face value meaning that if one has a 5 coin it is as good as 5 dollars in todays new currency
2222684 even just seeing one color of an m amp m helps say ooh thats something different
2222685 some of the first creative i saw was very serious and indulgent and treated the product like this very rich new m amp m thing
2222686 my fear was i didnt want to do just the product shot and be devoid of the humor and fun of the brand
2222687 is this a serious commercial or is it supposed to be funny we assure you its funny no we are not taking ourselves this seriously
2222688 we found that premium chocolate lovers want the smooth creamy taste to be the first thing they taste in a chocolate product so the smooth shell of m amp ms premiums enables them to taste the chocolate first
2222689 its not exactly flavored but dissolves quickly but into rather unappealing waxy flakes
2222690 if you solve that problem you are enabling them to enter the economy
2222691 because it could lead to higher air pricing which could deter travel
2222692 there should be a secondary negative impact on travel over all
2222693 we would expect the capacity cuts coming up in q3 and q4 to continue to push air fares higher putting ongoing pressure on ticket volumes
2222694 as most publicly traded travel companies have reported economic uncertainty and high fuel prices are affecting the broad travel market and significant airline capacity reductions in the fall will also have a negative impact
2222695 i think the broader point is that the actual revenue we get from the markets that are being impacted by these capacity cuts is relatively modest compared with our overall business size
2222696 im really pleased to be here at villa its happened quite quickly
2222697 i think at the minute villa are a notch above boro and theres a great opportunity for me to play european football as well
2222698 the right back position caused us a few problems for us last season in terms of us not having a natural right back
2222699 luke is a natural right back and played for england not so long ago he did very well for boro last season and this is a great opportunity for him
2222700 i can achieve all my ambitions at this football club
2222701 obviously i talked to the manager and hes very positive and ambitious thats what i am i want to get back into the premier league and show people what i can do
2222702 nicky is a quality natural left back who played for england 18 months ago
2222703 obviously the injury to freddie bouma has left a gaping hole on the left freddie had a wonderful season for us last year and this wasnt necessarily a priority for us before the injury
2222704 but nicky shorey is more than a back up hes a quality player on the ball and is up for the challenge
2222705 prepare for global temperature rise of 4c warns top scientist
2222706 theres a lot of misinformation so thats why this study is so important hundreds and hundreds of parents think this works but we need serious evidence
2222707 a lot of children with autism have gastrointestinal problems such as constipation and diarrhea whether these problems are related to brain development is open to question there are neurotransmitters and neuroreceptors in the gut that correspond with those in the brain there are some scientific reasons to think that some kids may benefit from this diet
2222708 researchers have long wanted to find a way to move a patients disease into the test tube to develop cells that could be cultured into the many tissues relevant to diseases of the blood the brain and the heart for example
2222709 now we have a way to do just that to derive pluripotent cells from patients with disease which means the cells can make any tissue and can grow forever this enables us to model thousands of conditions using classical cell culture techniques
2222710 no systematic differences between cultivation systems representing organic and conventional production methods were found across the five crops so the study does not support the belief that organically grown foodstuffs generally contain more major and trace elements than conventionally grown foodstuffs
2222711 if there were no proper control here blood leaving the mothers blood vessel would trigger release of serotonin platelets would aggregate vessels constrict and the foetus wouldnt get what it needs
2222712 we believe that 80 percent of women experience postpartum blues because of this effect of interleukin 1 beta if our hypothesis holds true lowering interleukin 1 beta levels may be a better treatment option
2222713 en ap ritif notre clatante saison 2008 2009 et en guise de
2222714 had this dark picture of a woman in a wheelchair being pushed over the top of the cliff and that formed the story of the black tower
2222715 were anticipating 500 attendees to the conference and at least that many more through the trade show
2222716 the festival is already canadas biggest annual event focused exclusively on green building and its still growing
2222717 our goal is to provide delegates with the tools they need to inject some green into their businesses
2222718 the festival is all about market ready strategies and products that support better more environmentally intelligent building
2222719 tipped way too far into the positive not to go tumbling headlong into the negative
2222720 ive set my sights on providing spectators with one of edinburghs best free shows for which we must thank the generosity of our main sponsor royal bank of scotland
2222721 this is a wonderful opportunity for visitors to sample the spectacle of the tattoo these mini events have gone from strength to strength and are now a regular fixture on the calendar rbs is a proud sponsor of the 59th tattoo and we are delighted to offer the performance to a wider audience
2222722 reflect challenging conditions in the housing and mortgage markets that began in 2006 and heave deepened through 2007 and 2008
2222723 as long as the companies can go to the debt markets and fund themselves then treasury can sit back and not intervene
2222724 never in the history of this country has ghanaians benefited from such tremendous development than under the npp available records in road construction and expansion of education infrastructure are commendable
2222725 this years election is not about talking we have to put our achievements in the public domain for the electorate to make the best choices for themselves
2222726 women today are expected to have careers and specialized skills to enable them fend for themselves and their dependants better and compete with their male counterparts effectively in career and political opportunities and also to give them the confidence to make their voices heard when it comes to airing the views on general issues of life
2222727 i would put one billion dollars into the northern development fund as seed capital to cater for the development of roads construction of small scale dams and harvesting of rain water to modernize agriculture
2222728 development projects under the npp were shared equitably its programmes policies and interventions have national character these include national health insurance scheme nhis school feeding programme and capitation grant that had benefited all ghanaians
2222729 reach out to people who have had or are living with long term illnesses and want to share their experiences expectations and treatment options
2222730 one of our objectives is to campaign towards the inclusion of autoimmune conditions in the national health insurance scheme at the moment even though some of us pay our premiums we still have to pay for expensive tests and medicines
2222731 for example mri scans are vital in monitoring many autoimmune conditions and yet there is only one functioning mri scanner in ghana
2222732 this is unfortunate because although they were traditionally classified as rare the diseases have actually been found to be not so uncommon within our society
2222733 if you are lonely this is your chance to meet people who understand and can empathize
2222734 if you log on to www sharecare com you can read other peoples experiences and also share yours
2222735 it is governments policy to develop systems to reduce the burden of disease mortality and disability suffered by those afflicted with the disorders and to reduce inequality in access to health and health services
2222736 the cost of financing health care especially chronic disorders such as autoimmune disorders is very huge
2222737 i have been going to court on a number of occasions and listened to the proceedings and i must state i was taken aback by the judgement i thought tsatsu has done the best that he could and rather than throwing him to jail i genuinely believe he deserves an honour
2222738 if any one thought that his sentence will dampen my spirit they will be disappointed
2222739 if you serve a nation that does not honour its heroes you will think twice about making certain sacrifices
2222740 i think the sentence is too harsh he meant no harm to the state when he was executing his job at the gnpc so i think the judge should have given him a lesser sentence
2222741 i am stepping down from the volunteer role i recently agreed to take on with the obama campaign as arab american and muslim american coordinator in order to avoid distracting from barack obamas message of change
2222742 oh the us will be fine i think that we are having an important debate about how we keep the country safe those are important judgments for the american people to make
2222743 any action should be according to the rule of law and consistent with their constitution and this is a matter for the pakistanis to decide
2222744 we will continue our close ties with the democratically elected government of pakistan
2222745 im very public about the statement that we believe that any actions in pakistan be consistent with the rule of law and with their constitution
2222746 ive made the comment that im going to make about the actions that are going on
2222747 we have consistently said the internal politics of pakistan is an issue for the pakistani people to decide our expectation is that any action will be consistent with the rule of law and the pakistani constitution it is the responsibility of pakistanis leaders to decide on a way forward to succeed as a modern and democratic country
2222748 starting salaries do not tell you a whole lot but there is a real divergence in dollar terms as you go over the course of a career
2222749 when the earthquake happened the ground went up and down up and down
2222750 and then from left to right the stairway broke and collapsed i tried to rescue patients out of here
2222751 i dashed out of the building and i just narrowly escaped
2222752 i think particularly at the olympic level at the top level the pressure comes as much from expectation of what people think you can do as it does from your competitors
2222753 michael is able to basically ignore all of those things which is super hard to do
2222754 i think thats just a very familiar pattern that he does and it gets his mind in a place where it needs to be
2222755 i remember clearly the first time he swam at nationals he swam very very well in the prelims and came back that night and i was very curious to see how he would do the first time in the finals and he just walked out and did his normal routine thats very rare that you would have some kid who is 14 up on the blocks stretching and doing all this stuff while the other guys are sitting back in their chairs most kids would succumb to peer pressure and do what the other guys were doing but he just totally did his own thing
2222756 i think its about time that someone else take the responsibility and im happy to pass the baton on to someone that im sure i have inspired
2222757 thirty six years is a long time to be honest if he doesnt do it then it was not meant to be but it does not take away from his greatness hes shown a different kind of courage than i did i was not chasing seven gold medals
2222758 i hope he does it but the odds are against him
2222759 thats not a knock on him but there are always going to be upsets my guess is there is going to be an upset in beijing
2222760 michael is going to have something like that in his own way
2222761 im sure that usa swimming will offer him a little more protection but hes not only going to need a bodyguard hes going to need two bodyguards
2222762 its things like that that absolutely just make me go literally insane
2222763 they fire me up so much thats like the final touch that gets me and puts a fire in my stomach if people want to talk i encourage it because i love it it motivates me more than anything
2222764 honestly i really dont feel like swimmers feel like they can beat him
2222765 i bet there are some but hes so dominant in everything he swims most swimmers are just trying to get second thats definitely not the case with me i always feel like i can beat him
2222766 i think the hardest challenge is just understanding that no matter what happens in these meets michael is going to be judged by people who dont truly understand what hes doing
2222767 if he wins seven it will be why didnt he win eight
2222768 the mrl committee has been a good committee and weve worked hard
2222769 we all got along well and id just like to thank everyone
2222770 i was doing the wongarbon walk so i thought why not do it here
2222771 i thought i would start one up and get people doing the walk once a year
2222772 weve had up to 30 people including children and mothers with strollers
2222773 i look forward to more people taking part it is really lovely when the full moon is out
2222774 we thought we would have a break last year but everyone has been saying weve got to get it back this year which is what we intended to do anyway
2222775 this year we have entrants from sydney wagga parkes trangie gilgandra dubbo and of course narromine for the derby
2222776 first prize is 800 second 400 and third prize is 100
2222777 the industry is at a crossroads with many farmers facing myriad issues affecting the way they do business but we need to find a way
2222778 we want to see sustainable environmental practices sustainable food production levels and also prosperous rural communities so farmers can continue to do what they do best
2222779 the feature race is the sky channel narromine gold cup which carries a total of 26 000 for the one race
2222780 this year the club has been able to attract wonderful sponsorship and this race will be sponsored by mph rural
2222781 the cup an open handicap will run over 1600 metres
2222782 it is interesting to note the first gold cup was donated by bookmaker clarrie rogan and valued at 100 pounds a little different to the 95 000 prize money on offer this year
2222783 they are mph rural pacific seeds big n fertilisers agrigrain castlemac fertiliser services neville owen pty ltd ferrari gardener robert handsaker ford radios 2du zoofm whitneys jewellers narromine pharmacy and macquarie clothing
2222784 it will be a great days racing at narromine on sunday august 17
2222785 the evening that i met her she had babs written on her sweater
2222786 every night wed walk through the village and have an ice cream sundae
2222787 and this one day i stopped and held her hand
2222788 all the guests in the hotel said we wish you lots of luck
2222789 these lines read the new value so self balance is updated
2222790 we saw an opportunity to help people be more environmentally responsible and still get the latest and greatest technology
2222791 the more visitors we have the richer well get the more people the better
2222792 and the people are rustic its great to bring my daughter here to see this way of life
2222793 i wanted to come to shangli to see the ancient landscape
2222794 its said there are relics here dating back to the qing dynasty circa 1644 1911 those of us born after 1980 we dont know much about this so we can come here and learn from the experience and get a taste of ancient times
2222795 the water can be used to make tea if old people drink it theyll have a long life if young people drink it theyll earn more money if students drink it theyll get the top score on their exams
2222796 be more concerned with your character than your reputation because your character is what you really are while your reputation is merely what others think you are
2222797 lets plunge ourselves into the roar of time the whirl of accident may pain and pleasure success and failure shift as they will its only action that can make a man
2222798 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled or where the doer of deeds could have done better the credit belongs to those people who are actually in the arena who know the great enthusiasms the great devotions to a worthy cause who at best know the triumph of high achievement and who at worst fail while daring greatly so that their place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat
2222799 i was among the first seven chosen in the team i wouldnt pretend that i was one of the seven best basketball players in america
2222800 but the method of selection at that time somehow placed me on the team
2222801 the reporter said you know theyre being held in hitlers germany
2222802 ohhhhh i just had never given it a moments thought
2222803 i was told by others that it was absolutely imperative that i play
2222804 but more important what kind of propaganda team would it be if there were no jews on the american team
2222805 the magazine has caricatures of hooked nosed people and it lays the blame for everything on the jews
2222806 but not obviously as bad as it got later on
2222807 if you dribbled it was a splash and it floated away
2222808 these two teams supposedly consisting of the best in the world and each scored only four points in the second half
2222809 it wasnt our turn it was the turn of the other group
2222810 we didnt get medals until much later oh we had a lot of beefs by the end of the games
2222811 its the dream of all sportsmen to make an olympic team and win a gold medal thats what is on your epitaph when they write your obit its going to say an olympic games participant i guess i was smart enough to know that all the time
2222812 one would think that employees within a weapons laboratory would pay careful attention to the behavioral signs of their co workers and appropriately report those concerns
2222813 no one wants to report on a colleague and friend but were dealing with life and death situations scrutiny should be stricter
2222814 im really the only scary one in the group others are talking about how sad they are or scared they are but my reaction to the wtc pentagon events is far different of course i dont talk about how i really feel with them it would just make them worse seeing how differently i reacted than they did to the recent events makes me really think about myself a lot
2222815 he has been this way for a number of years and was still able to carry on his professional life at usamriid
2222816 i dont even have a word for it im just so happy very happy
2222817 when the circadian system is not receiving normal light that in turn might lead to changes in brain systems that regulate mood
2222818 our study provides a new animal system for antidepressant devel opment many existing animal models depend on stress our model is a stress free means of producing a depression it might be parti cularly relevant to seasonal affective disorder but we think that it is relevant to depression overall
2222819 one would think that employees within a weapons laboratory would pay careful attention to the behavioral signs of their co workers and appropriately report those concerns
2222820 no one wants to report on a colleague and friend but were dealing with life and death situations scrutiny should be stricter
2222821 im really the only scary one in the group others are talking about how sad they are or scared they are but my reaction to the wtc pentagon events is far different of course i dont talk about how i really feel with them it would just make them worse seeing how differently i reacted than they did to the recent events makes me really think about myself a lot
2222822 he has been this way for a number of years and was still able to carry on his professional life at usamriid
2222823 marriage creates more stable relationships and families more financial security and a better environment for the rearing of children all of these are desirable things in which the state has a legitimate interest
2222824 be given the same civil contract with all the attendant legal rights and obligations after all legally committed couples provide the same financial and familial stability in short everyone who wishes to marry could be given a civil union agreement from the state
2222825 conservatives should like the arrangement because religious institutions will not be forced to recognize relationships that they feel are contrary to the teachings of scripture
2222826 society appears to have little defense against the abyss of human decadence such as for example misuse of liberty for moral violence against young people motion pictures full of pornography crime and horror
2222827 were at the lowest level in oil prices in months and there is a real feeling that the trend has turned
2222828 lower oil prices are good for businesses and good for consumers for the inflation picture and they will improve growth somewhere down the line
2222829 driven notably by its evolving economics iphone now unlocked greater subsidies leading to lower retail price and no geographic exclusivity
2222830 it seems that weve got a lot of selling based on the stronger dollar
2222831 energy demand destruction and the dollar return have formed a quiet alliance to bring the oil market down and today the louder of the two is the dollar
2222832 the market has been ignoring the tbilisi pipeline situation and now the problems with russia the move lower really now has a momentum of its own with the financial players coming out
2222833 how have you managed to gather some many of them here and what is the connection with red cross
2222834 thousands of friends of the senator and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2222835 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2222836 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2222837 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2222838 when you look into a mirror do you like whats looking at you now that youve seen your true reflections what on earth are you gonna do
2222839 i actually walked the country to see who i am who i really am but i dont know what the result of that will be
2222840 in merrills case its as serious and in a sense more serious because there was a clear effort at manipulation of research which is even a greater issue than the misleading sales of these auction rate securities instruments
2222841 i thought shes 9 years old and shes going to be scarred for life
2222842 but they can cause scarring or darkness to the skin that can be permanent
2222843 it may mean you can never dye your hair again
2222844 this was a little booth set up at the hotel pool and i didnt think anything of it
2222845 when a firefighter dies everyone knows him because we are all from the same cut
2222846 it affected everybody emotionally but everybody accepted the challenge and went back to what we do everyday
2222847 they are experiencing great grief about the missing and those who are injured
2222848 step up and do the right thing for their investors
2222849 this was not a mutual mistake by financial services companies this was a deliberate effort to ensnare consumers with great damage
2222850 its obvious in the case of ubs and we have internal documents that prove this that they were well aware of the problems in the marketplace that they manipulated them
2222851 investors have been locked in a nightmare with these securities
2222852 were talking about 19 4 billion that were seeking to get returned
2222853 that money has effectively been out of the american economy for several months that has caused significant economic damage in this country
2222854 our research reflected the honest belief that auction rate securities offered higher returns in exchange for less liquidity and noted that market changes had begun to occur
2222855 thousands of friends of the senator and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2222856 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2222857 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2222858 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2222859 when you look into a mirror do you like whats looking at you now that youve seen your true reflections what on earth are you gonna do
2222860 i actually walked the country to see who i am who i really am but i dont know what the result of that will be
2222861 the key for fannie and freddie both and also for banks is do they have the capital to get through the next year or so
2222862 so if they can hold if they are not taken under by a wave of defaults now itll be a good business two years out it looks like they can but there are a lot of negatives out there too
2222863 while we expect that 2008 will be our peak year for credit related expenses the total amount of credit related expenses will be significant in 2009
2222864 none of the plans that weve advanced contemplate access to any treasury line weve not asked them and they have not offered
2222865 i dont think its by any means inevitable that they will go insolvent but after the legislation we dont know what the capital will be
2222866 we are no longer investors in fannie mae and freddie mac
2222867 that was founded in 1989 to counteract fast food and fast life the disappearance of local food traditions and peoples dwindling interest in the food they eat where it comes from how it tastes and how our food choices affect the rest of the world
2222868 martyn has been a great player and ambassador for york city
2222869 we felt it would not be right to stand in the way of his personal progress when he has so much talent and ability
2222870 martyns current contract was due to end next summer and we therefore felt it was best for the club to accept scunthorpes offer
2222871 the board will be ensuring a significant portion of the transfer fee is allocated to colin walkers playing budget to strengthen the team further now and during the season
2222872 we played very well away from home but didnt get results but home form was excellent
2222873 were going to have to tweak our form away from home this year
2222874 its always going to be difficult but it makes it more interesting for us and gives us great incentive
2222875 it was important the club protected their interests in a proven goalscorer
2222876 paul has tremendous spirit and im delighted to bring him here
2222877 he will give us everything and im sure he will be a favourite with the fans here once again
2222878 l a s fine the sun shines most of the time the feeling is laid back palm trees grow and the rents are low but you know i keep thinking about making my way back
2222879 you cant play with any toys no you have to go to sleep
2222880 im wearing the armband on the pitch but there are plenty of leaders out there
2222881 you want to play well every week and you hope that everyone looks at you and thinks hes doing well can i do the same
2222882 we got wins under our belt last year and we want it to be a knock on effect
2222883 lordly these forests in the winter o rama and the godavari droning in its deep mountain gorges lordly these sun bright uplands and arch blue skies and red jungle blossoms nodding in the breeze lordly all these tranquil days and starlit frosty nights when by the warm brazier we blend the fragrant wine and we remembered you ayodhya gracious city of flowers gracious city of the jeweled hills beyond the mountains we longed to stand once more at the threshold of your glory
2222884 everyone has been really positive since the end of last season
2222885 we had a meeting before everyone went away for the summer and we said that season was finished there and then
2222886 so everyones gone away and done their end of season programme theyve done it well so we looking forward to the start of the season
2222887 theres been a big turnover of players and the people we wanted to stay are staying and the ones we wanted weve brought in
2222888 at the end of the season you want to relax and switch off but youve got to be fresh go on trials and try to prove youre good enough
2222889 it gets harder and harder as the years go by especially around the smaller clubs
2222890 basically the budget at darlington had been slashed by half and they took me into the office to tell me they couldnt keep me because they hadnt got the funds
2222891 they talked to me about their situation i talked to them about my situation and it was best for both parties that i got out i knew kings lynn were interested and the club is in an ideal location as its near home in boston
2222892 about 15 to 20 thats 1 6 of footballers are losing their jobs at the end of every season
2222893 if you or i were in an industry with a turnover that high then wed be seriously worried adding to the insecurities players face they are also increasingly being given short term contracts and not two year contracts like they used to
2222894 if you look at the standard of league one and league two its becoming higher and higher
2222895 youve got clubs like shrewsbury spending 170 000 on players so its becoming tougher to get the right calibre of player
2222896 telling a player he is no longer wanted is something that you get used to i think the player usually has an idea so its not that difficult when it catches a player by surprise then its a case of explaining why but life goes on
2222897 it is not a nice thing to tell people but it is a necessity youve got to do it because football is a rat race it is a results orientated business
2222898 if a manager doesnt get results then he gets the sack so if a player does not do his job then he has to go and someone else has got to come in it is a vicious circle but unfortunately thats the way football is
2222899 nearly 99 of boys want to become footballers so when they walk through our doors youve got to tell them the truth not everybody makes it
2222900 youve got the be in the right place at the right time the boys come in and theyre very negative in the way they play because they worry too much about making mistakes its a case of changing their thought process
2222901 i was working in switzerland on euro 2008 for swiss television and christian smith got in touch
2222902 he knew the chairman here and they got in touch for something else my name was thrown in and here i am
2222903 weve known each other for 12 years and gone through a few things as players and coaches
2222904 weve done our coaching badges together and we have the same philosophy of how football should be played
2222905 eddies got loads of experience in terms of coaching and me too obviously not as much as some managers who have been in the job for 20 years but weve got enough
2222906 its an ambitious club and personally i am very ambitious so i like that and hopefully we can work on the longer term
2222907 ive lost a couple of important players who were here last season so we will have to see how well we can replace them and get on with them
2222908 there is a little bit of money available to spend but in league one the financial resources are limited
2222909 i guess everybody has his own personal touch but you try to gain from your experience that you had as a player and from the good coaches you had during your career
2222910 if such drugs are safe and effective in humans they hold out the promise that we may be able to get the positive health effects of exercise without much exercise
2222911 help people who are too frail to exercise and those with health problems like diabetes that are improved with exercise
2222912 were small and were best explained by common genetic factors with opposite effects on exercise behavior and symptoms of anxiety and depression
2222913 in genetically identical twin pairs the twin who exercised more did not display fewer anxious and depressive symptoms than the co twin who exercised less
2222914 it is unknown which genes might be involved in voluntary exercise behavior and in the risk for anxiety and depression
2222915 only voluntary leisure time exercise is influenced by genetic factors whereas the other type of exercise directed and monitored by someone else is environment driven the absence of causal effects of voluntary exercise on symptoms of anxiety and depression does not imply that manipulation of exercise cannot be used to change such symptoms
2222916 the antidepressant effects of exercise may only occur if the exercise is monitored and part of a therapeutic program
2222917 the key for fannie and freddie both and also for banks is do they have the capital to get through the next year or so
2222918 so if they can hold if they are not taken under by a wave of defaults now itll be a good business two years out it looks like they can but there are a lot of negatives out there too
2222919 while we expect that 2008 will be our peak year for credit related expenses the total amount of credit related expenses will be significant in 2009
2222920 none of the plans that weve advanced contemplate access to any treasury line weve not asked them and they have not offered
2222921 i dont think its by any means inevitable that they will go insolvent but after the legislation we dont know what the capital will be
2222922 we are no longer investors in fannie mae and freddie mac
2222923 i will shoot you if your joints dont become normal
2222924 in that document when the water policy comes out it will not include a canal
2222925 its a very poor effort by a number of different groups in particular the ract was looking forward to hearing from fuel companies and their representatives and perhaps to shed some light on what is going on in terms of pricing in tasmania
2222926 we think its a much more accessible level of communicating to the public our plans
2222927 the industry needs to actually start doing things on the ground
2222928 part of it is the way we see ourselves but its also how other people see us
2222929 historically weve been denied our manhood so we really want to cling to it as soon as boys are able to walk we call them little man anything that threatens that manhood we dont want
2222930 we know that the rate of suicide is going up in the black community
2222931 and studies show that one of the ways depression manifests itself is through aggression
2222932 if you feel like your life is not worth much then the lives of other people arent worth much either and you behave in a way thats not responsible
2222933 im not saying that depression robs you of discerning right and wrong
2222934 im saying if youre looking for causes dont overlook depression
2222935 the fifth chakra is also a center of creativity another form of symbolic communication as we open up this center we open up our creative potential the greater our resonance within the greater the power within our creations
2222936 the moon encompasses psychic energy clairvoyance and communication without words in the fifth chakra all the elements of the lower chakras earth water fire and air are refined to their purest essence and dissolve into akasha
2222937 we do not have the luxury for stretching out this process any longer the only thing that the legislature should be focusing on is reaching a budget compromise immediately
2222938 great many of the bills the legislature passes do california more harm than good
2222939 the governors message was clear focus on the budget and the budget only
2222940 weve got to get the message to state legislators that they have to do the same hard work we do to balance their budget tell the legislators we are fed up and arent going to take any more of it
2222941 i simply cannot support a budget without a solution to the central valleys water supply a vote on a budget that adequately reflects our states priorities is only half honest unless we are simultaneously addressing the issue of water supply
2222942 people might want to do better with their health but the lack of money the lack of medical care and the lack of access in low income neighborhoods to healthy foods and safe physical activity are the things that low income people in fresno and the valley areas face
2222943 republicans democrats those who live in the valley and all california residents alike will benefit from a new medical school through the training of additional physicians who will serve the region and california biomedical research aimed at the treatment and prevention of illnesses and the economic benefits
2222944 the energy policies of republican john mccain and democrat barack obama havent been easy to nail down theyve become flip floppers on energy as the public has grown restless on the issue and now paris hilton offers a compromise that makes sense and she was joking
2222945 i guess there isnt much we can do if there is no money for the program but its unfortunate when the economy is bad it is best to give people more opportunities and now we will be giving them less
2222946 as far as the big box stuff is concerned companies are looking for ways to improve their logistical efficiency and san joaquin county is still a good place for that
2222947 raw materials especially leather are through the roof stuff that used to cost us 100 is now 125 to 130 and you cant pass those costs on to customers in this economy they cant pay it
2222948 if we miss the connection with kids at the end of their high school days chances are we missed a great opportunity for them to be a part of the community
2222949 oh lisa it sounds like you had a great time i have to add to my previous comments

2222956 quite how united fans will react to ronaldos announcement is anyones guess although being as fickle as the next set of sheep theyll probably boo him half heartedly for 10 minutes before being won over by a dive in the opposition box
2222957 sir alex ferguson heard my arguments i heard his and it was settled that the best thing would be for me to stay
2222958 i can confirm that next season i will play for manchester united
2222959 i flew to portugal some weeks ago and we cleared the air and he spoke to some of the players

2223028 we believe the court should be empowered to make the tribunal pay the costs of that case so that innocent consumers are not out of pocket for unreasonable amounts
2223029 were not saying that this will result in any loss of jobs but it certainly makes the longer term ability to keep bringing the resource in there and building that bridge to the future more difficult
2223030 and basically put those 310 people out of work and the result being that jobs were going to be created elsewhere at the expense of scottsdale
2223031 now thats lost at the moment and i think weve got to get back to what was real whats really caused this position that were in at scottsdale
2223032 so that there are other applicants that missed out at the time im sure would still be prepared to come forward again
2223033 what is illogical just as it was proposed in relation to apec is to schedule these works when there are major events in this city
2223034 so we want to be able to do that as quickly as we can but we have to balance that against being a successful profitable organisation thats here for the long term
2223035 i mean weve been provided with media releases and so on and theres a lot of questions that need to be asked as to how these changes will impact on our members and in particular over what period of time
2223036 if youre playing in the australian wine industry its important to change shape in order to accommodate those impacts on the business
2223037 were going to do further exploration its too early to say absolutely whether its going to be a mine but what we can say is the results are highly encouraging
2223038 there are some of the most significant results for that area around the nabarlek mine in many years
2223039 we think the prospects are quite good to extend it even further
2223040 the more gas they have on site in and around the ichthys discovery the more likely it is that they would be looking at long term infrastructure
2223041 the closest residential address is 700 metres but the closest people to be impacted are actually children

2223052 his human rights record seems to be based on the chinese play book so he has little credible to say in that area

2223081 the connection i would walk into a store with my camera and tell people that i was making a documentary about the vanishing of small business and they simply let me in
2223082 i think that i connected with the store owners because we both knew that this story should be told otherwise stores are simply disappearing into thin air

2223240 shortly before brett was born there was a council by election and someone asked me to stand
2223241 when they were building the pool there was this beautiful fig tree in the park next door
2223242 the shire engineer was determined to cut it down because he thought its roots would be a hindrance when they dug the pool but i was totally against it
2223243 one morning id dropped kit off at work early and was coming back past the park when i saw council workers swarming all over the fig in the process of cutting it down
2223244 i turned around drove back to council and as i stormed up the steps i heard this voice say to me now calm down judy its too late you cant do anything about it
2223245 it was the shire engineer hed wanted to get it out before i saw what was happening
2223246 when they finally did start digging the pool there wasnt one root from the fig anywhere near it

2223264 we do know that the techniques used in making indian or hasty pudding are age old gruels potages porridges frumenties and puddings were made from earliest times we also know that specific pudding recipes very similar in nature to those for indian pudding appear in early english cookbooks but these use wheat flour rye flour oatmeal ground rice crumbled bread or cake or other cereals and starches in place of the corn meal further there are records that various indian tribes and civilizations in the new world were making some form of corn meal gruel or pudding oftimes sweetened with honey or native berries but it is exactly the combination of the ancient techniques with the indigenous new world crop corn flavored with the colonial products of ginger nutmeg and molasses which i believe makes indian pudding a contender for our national dish
2223265 the tree is slightly more cold hardy than the peach tolerating winter temperatures as cold as 30 c or lower if healthy the limiting factor in apricot culture is spring frosts they tend to flower very early around the time of the great lakes region meaning spring frost often kills the flowers furthermore the trees are sensitive to temperature changes during the winter season in their native china winters can be very cold but temperatures tend to be more stable than in europe and especially north america where large temperature swings can occur in winter

2223288 the likelihood of it getting here some professionals speculate that its just a matter of time we really dont know but were taking the appropriate steps in this state to prepare for the potential arrival of emerald ash borer
2223289 we have traps that are set up throughout the state but to this date the beetle has not been discovered in a trap and it has been discovered in other states by the public and so the public is a very important part of helping the emerald ash borer not move here into kansas

2223324 im the other half of bruce when he lets me out i push bruce aside then im free to run about
2223325 when you go out to bat youve just got to bat you cant be a captain when you are batting
2223326 i just batted like i normally do i like to keep it simple do the simplest things as well as i can i went out to enjoy myself
2223327 i wouldnt say it is an easy job it can only get worse but ive had more good days than bad days
2223328 steve was magnificent to see him back to see him smiling and laughing again was great
2223329 if at any point we believe the transaction will take longer to close than expected and we are not able to procure interim financing at terms we find acceptable we will further moderate our spending
2223330 its very surreal a lot of guys have put more effort and a lot more time into this than i have for some this is their third olympics for some its their second olympics but its my first and its come quite quickly this is only my third year of international rowing in the four and im just taking it as it comes just enjoying it yet going out to do the best that i can
2223331 its pretty spectacular three boys from the same town are going to the olympic games in the same year and in the same event rowing
2223332 two of us are in the same boat class for two different countries its amazing how weve all come through the same system with bobby platt
2223333 now were going to the olympic games to try and achieve something big you cant really put it into words
2223334 as soon as i started getting into international rowing and competing a little bit more then i started to know who he was
2223335 i started to look up to him at the 2004 olympics and hes the guy you aspired to be like
2223336 ive the utmost respect for him and he is still the guy i look up to
2223337 whenever we go out to race theres obviously that little bit of rivalry about but i want to race him for the respect i have for him and the respect i have for his crew
2223338 in munich last year the difference between us winning gold and the irish not qualifying coming 12th was less than five seconds thats what youre looking at
2223339 and even this year its a lot tighter its down to about three seconds to win a lightweight event youve got to have a perfect race on the day some people can get that some people cant
2223340 i think to be to be an elite sportsman at this level youve got be a grafter it doesnt come easy to anyone
2223341 you might have a good physiological basis or you might have a good strength basis but to be at the top level youve got to work quite hard for it and youve got to graft and its the same in technique
2223342 youve got to keep plugging away at it stroke by stroke outing by outing we do 15000 strokes a week and youre never going to be perfect at the end of that so its hard work
2223343 mum dad my sister rebecca whos never actually been to an international rowing event before my brother peter and my girlfriend abi are all coming out to china to see me
2223344 im looking forward to having them out there experiencing the olympic games as a family every four years weve sat and watched it on the tv and now as a family were going to experience it ourselves its different its an incredible feeling
2223345 for every sportsman who wants to do well theyve got to aim right at the top
2223346 for a footballer its the world cup final for a rower its got to be the olympic games and youve got to aim right at the top and set your goals as high as you can
2223347 its six minutes of your life six minutes of that day and thats nothing in the grand scheme of a 24 hour day so you get on and do it its one of the most painful things you do some say its worse than child birth but i dont know you just got to get on and do it
2223348 we will run out of atmosphere before we run out of fossil fuels
2223349 forget about everything you have become accustomed to during the last 20 years because things are going to be very different going forward
2223350 today we are witnessing the start of a new era for the u s economy and u s businesses an era that will be very different from the 1990s and early 2000s because the effects of the knowledge revolution have started to hit a wall and this wall has a name the u s consumer
2223351 even if the housing market comes back from the deep depression it has been in for the last 2 plus years and it will come back the economic environment will remain very weak
2223352 it will be the consumer calling the shots rather than producers and marketing and sales people
2223353 innovation be it real or presumed wont determine when it is time to replace or change your gadget
2223354 this highly anticipated bollywood flick definitely managed to surge my enthusiasm
2223355 didnt have a guy and a girl falling in love in mumbai or london it had a guy and a girl falling in love in australia
2223356 what a dork coming for a movie like love story 2050 and spending time on his phone
2223357 well all we see is a dick theres no theatre there are no women seated next to it theres no face its just a dick so why dont you boys come to the slammer and taste the long arm of the law
2223358 theres a guy in there doing his thing you know touching there you know his package
2223359 if people want freedom all you have to do is get a bloke to ride on a horse bare naked
2223360 i cant help them unless i know what method they are planning to adopt can i
2223361 let no man ever actually use an encyclopedia except to act as firmaments hiding snogging lesbians in dusty libraries
2223362 now that i have mentioned the word man i better create a figure out of flesh to go with it
2223363 my creation the man will have dominion over everything on earth including fish fowl foal and fungi everything except his penis size thats pure destiny
2223364 i assigned you specific tasks to complete why are you acting like a dick
2223365 youre the one who created me from a bison penis
2223366 take your mate into your bedroom and bonk her as you please and by the way that lamp by your bed is just a plain old lamp it doesnt have a hidden camera or anything now go bonk
2223367 you are fucking on my couch even though i commanded you to take utmost care of it do you know how long ive been waiting to sit on that couch
2223368 for directly disobeying me i curse you with premature ejaculation and early baldness
2223369 i shall greatly multiply your sorrows and your predicaments you will not even get a proper desk job until you put a slimy smelly cock in your mouth and suck on it like a hungry vampire bat on oprah winfreys black tits
2223370 what do you have to say against the charges of sexual harassment leveled against you by the man and the woman did you really harass them what is your side of the story
2223371 i dont know what to do you have to help me out those ruthless carnivores are asking for an explanation from my side what do i do i cant just tell them i banished those two horny freaks because they had sex on my couch im the almighty for crying out loud
2223372 satan are you listening to me im under siege here what do i tell the damn press
2223373 well im currently working on something for fox network but i suppose i can let you use it to extricate yourself from this mess
2223374 ok theres this forbidden tree and a talking snake right
2223375 as the subject but i knew they were personal emails sent by my fan s requesting me to live up to the title of my blog
2223376 wipe thy ass for i have bestowed upon thou the task of beginning a new religion
2223377 there is a difference between humaour and being vulgar i think this belongs to the later
2223378 saber que es la nica que nos falta no creo que nos presione porque es lo que so amos todas
2223379 para ganar el oro tenemos que ser las mejores y para eso hay que ganar todos los partidos para nosotros todas ser n finales en este tipo de competencias no hay equipos accesibles
2223380 how do i put this they were the strange people
2223381 heard a message that id never heard before in my life and ive never left
2223382 id say im a lutheran and when i moved to a new town id only look at lutheran churches now we look for churches the other way around is it a good church what does it do what does it believe in what denomination it belongs to is a secondary issue
2223383 we can take advantage of programs being offered by both denominations
2223384 we started as a baptist church but then we realized that the evangelical free church has a lot of great programs that the baptists dont have and the other way around
2223385 its we join you as opposed to you run us
2223386 we were two small congregations about a block apart that both were in danger of closing
2223387 so we did it out of necessity but weve come to realize that its been very fortunate for us because its consistent with this congregation we want to open our doors to a wider spectrum of folks and having our feet in both denominations helps us cast a wider net in terms of a welcome
2223388 there were a couple of bumps in the road but in the long run its been great
2223389 in the old days you identified yourself by what you werent
2223390 there was fear of other denominations but theres a new paradigm in which we define ourselves by the values we hold in common and that has taken the fear out of it the outsiders have become the insiders
2223391 i think were going to see much more of this in the future
2223392 once the innovators do it others are less fearful of it and denominations are starting to see this as a strength theyre not threatened by it
2223393 it also makes it easier for churches to find ministers maybe they cant find one who comes from their exact religion but they can find one who came out of the same seminary were seeing more of that of presbyterian churches hiring ucc ministers for instance and theyre comfortable with it
2223394 its calculated to encourage people to vote against the measure
2223395 its going to throw the legitimacy of the election into question because it is so one sided
2223396 in fact the budget bill was the very next item on the agenda but democrats chose to adjourn before we could take it up because they are afraid to debate the issue
2223397 from what ive heard about him ive only heard that hes a very intelligent player and hes always been pretty accurate with what he did with the ball i know the guys a competitor
2223398 we have three quarterbacks right now on our team and were finding it hard right now to get all three of those guys the work they need im happy with the people we have here right now
2223399 i could have lost my whole future im back here trying to do everything i can do to get back on the field be a leader and be a role model for the little kids
2223400 even driving to the store i think about should i put my seat belt on should i not i had to separate myself from a lot of my friends or people i grew up with they know what ive got to do
2223401 he is a very direct player with lots of pace and is a natural and proven scorer
2223402 although roy can play wide right and midfield i see him as a striker and im sure hell be a big success in the spl
2223403 im also certain that united supporters will enjoy seeing him play for the team
2223404 roy is a player i know very well having tried to get him from cork before his move to sunderland
2223405 in fact he might have been one of my first signings for dundee united had it not been for interest in the player from the premiership i tried to obtain him on loan last season and am absolutely delighted to eventually get him to tannadice
2223406 hell benefit greatly from playing regular first team football at the highest level in scotland and therefore this deal is not only good for dundee united but will also be to the advantage of the player and his club
2223407 how do i get all the expert help i need to ensure that my infrastructure is always available so i can have the strongest platform to build my business and at the same time have a predictable cost structure that once budgeted performs at an acceptable return on investment
2223408 we dont leave the base as much as id like were trained to be on the ground and thats what i prefer doing but i guess that means the situation is getting better for the iraqi people and thats what weve been trying to achieve
2223409 the heat and boredom get to you but im happy with all our equipment and the conditions were living in
2223410 theres a vast difference since then and the situation is changing daily we dont go out on the ground now unless necessary and it is looking good for the iraqis future hopefully this will be my last tour in iraq
2223411 we dont want one and we are not seeking one we dont have to offload players simply because of that situation
2223412 there is some money there for us to bring in a couple of players yet
2223413 we dont have to sell the player or any player at this stage
2223414 some players were going to leave anyway and that will still happen but its not entirely because of our failure to qualify for the champions league
2223415 we had some money there anyway but we are finding a difficulty in getting a level of player that we want to bring in thats been a difficult task over the close season
2223416 but there is some money there for us to bring in a couple of players yet
2223417 nobody likes to be criticised in any way shape or form
2223418 but you dont become a football manager expecting to go through your career without receiving a level of criticism
2223419 it comes with the territory when you lose out in the manner we did you expect criticism and its deserved
2223420 from the chairman all the way down we feel the disappointment
2223421 the one thing we have to make sure of is that the disappointment doesnt allow our domestic results to be affected
2223422 there is that little bit extra pressure on us to do well in the league and our thoughts must be on that we cant let ourselves be affected too greatly going into our first league game
2223423 like every other club when you dont have european football thats whats left for you to aim for and everybody aims to do as well as they possibly can
2223424 we would hope to do well in the league we certainly made up the gap that was there between ourselves and celtic last season and they were good enough to go on and clinch the championship at the end when we fell just short
2223425 we have to make the spl our aim for the season and the retention of the two cups we won last year would be something wed look for as well
2223426 hes a very solid defender whether he plays in defence or in midfield
2223427 hes a good guy he means well its just hes been in some sticky situations some things he probably shouldnt get into i think it definitely hit home with this i dont expect brandon to be in any more situations like that for the rest of his career and probably for the rest of his life
2223428 i just see him growing day by day and he understands what it means to be a leader as an athlete to be a leader in the community help kids he wants to do those type of things hes a guy thats got a big upside not only on the field but off the field
2223429 and hes a natural leader but hes got to show people in the community that this isnt talk
2223430 it just shows you what a class organization that were dealing with that mr marshall and his attorney find out about this as the result of a press release
2223431 they didnt even have the courtesy to contact mr marshall directly or his lawyer the league appears to be more concerned about its image than treating its players with dignity and respect the best part of this is we get to appeal this suspension to the very commissioner who chose to suspend him in this fashion
2223432 its in the past and all i can do is worry about now i cant worry about yesterday
2223433 im just going to do everything im supposed to do whether its off the field or on the field and get past this
2223434 its just being the best player i can be in the community and on the field thats all it is its not hard you know its not rocket science
2223435 and like i said i have a job to do and i plan on getting it done
2223436 any time you lose a guy like brandon for a couple of games its going to hurt
2223437 because he does stuff on the football field that not many people can do he opens up some big windows for me hes an easy target
2223438 i dont know if you put a letter grade on it or a number from 1 to 10 its been fantastic
2223439 that was a rough deal everybody knows that i really truly believe we have the right guys in the right areas on this team to get everything out in the open
2223440 guys talked steve knew he did wrong but the biggest thing out of all of them was ken lucas for ken lucas to get up here guys could really release a lot of emotions about listening to ken and feeling how he felt
2223441 i know the question youre saying but when steve came out of his mom he had that edge
2223442 i truly believe that guys feed off steve when steve plays offensively defensively everybody feeds off steve that is just my opinion i know when the lights come on he will still be the same steve

2223498 its a family business and weve given it our best go but the fall in business in middleton has affected us in every way
2223499 im dipping into my own pockets to make sure those whove booked weddings and paid a 1 000 deposit get their money back
2223500 its devastating at the end of the day it was a nice family business they were always nice and always gave you a warm welcome the food was lovely
2223501 its such a shame that the business rates are so high in middleton that family businesses cant survive
2223502 peter jackson from link4life jumped in straight away and offered us the heywood civic centre free of charge for the night which is great because we wouldnt have been able to afford it otherwise

2223509 there is a lot of negativity surrounding the housing market at the moment which is why its important to highlight to first time buyers that its not all doom and gloom
2223510 with the offer of 95 per cent mortgages still available on the development and the five per cent deposit paid first time buyers can move in almost immediately with little extra cost to worry about and no expense to fork out on carpets
2223511 i didnt want to come out because i was having a lot of fun just running around
2223512 our team isnt ready to play the colts yet well go back to the practice field and next week well flip the order and go from there
2223513 i dont think you can hang your hat on one night to win any job
2223514 i played solid today made the right reads and ran the offense thats been my goal as long as i continue to do that i think ill be fine
2223515 just seeing everybody in the locker room afterward everybody is happier everybody is listening to music everybody is talking dancing singing
2223516 its just night and day when you win and you lose
2223517 obviously getting him back is going to get more people in the box which is going to enable us to have one on one coverage outside and i think we have the receivers to do it with
2223518 and as we go through the preseason we will start a different quarterback in a different game
2223519 thats the plan right now were going to make sure that all of our guys have an opportunity to play with the first unit its an open competition for those guys and this will be the first opportunity for them
2223520 i think itll be a good test for our offense right now we just need to go out and compete i dont think it means anything weve got four quarterbacks here so you just go out and compete and see what happens
2223521 i think everybodys a little excited heading in to jacksonville
2223522 for me itll be good just to get one game under my belt and then ill start to feel more comfortable
2223523 when they tell me to go in the game ill go
2223524 and when they tell me to come out ill come out

2223529 ive been playing well and its getting better every week i know a lot of the guys and it just feels like another pga tour event
2223530 i thought going out early it was going to be softer on the greens but that wasnt the case
2223531 the wind started whipping when we got out there and the greens were not receptive either
2223532 i called home and said this is the hardest course ive ever played if i were to play here every day i dont know if i would enjoy it
2223533 its a very difficult golf course no doubt about it the greens are very undulated very fast it really tests your patience and you have to be on it every shot

2223537 we were surprised by the variety of clay minerals in this region
2223538 but whats interesting is that we find the same ordering of the clay materials everywhere in mawrth vallis its like a layer cake of clays one on top of another all these layers are topped with a frosting of lava and dust we can see the clay layers where an impact crater has carved a hole through the surface or where erosion has exposed them
2223539 but it does suggest the long term and common presence of liquid water and concomitant active chemistry on the red planet in the distant past
2223540 a single death is a tragedy a million deaths is a statistic
2223541 these are high stakes tests and we have an obligation to get them right
2223542 we have to be able to stand by these scores and ensure they are accurate

2223562 this is not a finished action this is not a done deal by any means
2223563 although it would be one commander in charge of both missions the missions would not be blended in any way
2223564 so youd have the isaf mission and youd have the oef mission and theyd remain separate and distinct
2223565 so youve got u s forces that are not all under the command of a single u s officer in afghanistan

2223594 inilah kaifiyyat membaca doa nisfu syaban bahawa hendaklah sembahyang sunat kemudian daripada sembahyang maghrib 2 rakaat maka ayatnya yang pertama kemudian daripada fatihah qulya ayyuhal kafirun dan ayatnya yang kedua kemudian daripada fatihah qulhu wallahu ahad kemudian memberi salam maka membaca yasin 3 kali dengan niat yang pertama minta dipanjangkan umur kerana ibadat kepada allah taala dan niat yang kedua minta rezeki yang banyak serta halal kerana buat bekal ibadat kepada allah taala dan niat yang ketiga minta ditetapkan iman kemudian membaca doa ini s ehingga akhirnya majmuk syarif hal 99 100 kaifiyyat seperti ini tidak ada dalam sunnah nabi s
2223595 solat 6 rakaat pada malam nisfu syaban dengan niat menolak bala dan niat supaya dipanjangkan serta membaca yasin dan berdoa tidak syak lagi ianya merupakan perkara baru bidah dalam agama ianya juga bercanggah dengan sunnah rasulullah s a w orang yang mensyarahkan kitab ihya berkata solat ini 6 rakaat malam nisfu syaban masyhur di dalam kitab kitab yang terkemudian yang datang daripada sufi dan aku tidak dapati solat ini juga doanya mempunyai sandaran yang sahih dalam sunnah tatapi ianya berasal dari amalan para masyaikh berkata ashabuna sesungguhnya dibenci berkumpul untuk menghidupkan malam nisfu syaban sama ada di masjid atau selainnya al najmu al ghaithi ketika mengulas tentang menghidupkan malam nisfu syaban secara berjamaah beliau berkata bahawasanya perbuatan ini telah diingkari oleh para ulamak ahli hijaz antaranya atho dan ibn abi mulaikah juga para fuqahak madinah serta ashab imam malik dan mereka semua menyatakan ianya bidah tidak thabit dari nabi s a w dan juga para sahabat menghidupkannya secara berjamaah imam al nawawi berkata solat rejab dan syaban merupakan bidah yang mungkar lagi buruk
2223596 adapun doa sehingga akhirnya telah diketahui melalui syarah kepada kitab ihya bahawasanya ianya doa yang tidak ada asalnya al sunan wal mubtadaat hlm 72
2223597 seolah olah si pendusta yang keji ini tidak mengetahui bahawasanya selain dari nabi walaupun dia bersembahyang selama umur nabi nuh sekalipun dia tidak akan mencapai pahala seorang nabi pun
2223598 berkatalah syaitan kesusahanlah bagiku dan sia sialah pekerjaanku pada setahun ini dibinasakan dengan satu saat jua dengan sebab membaca doa doa ini
2223599 inilah khasiat fadhilat doa haikal yakni tujuh doa daripada nombor 1 sampai 7 dan sampai qul auzu birab binnas bahawasanya adalah diriwayatkan oleh nabi kita s a w pada suatu hari sedang nabi kita duduk dalam masjid madinah maka
2223600 adapun fadhilat doa haikal ini terlalu banyak kadar diambil ringkasnya sahaja disini sesungguhnya tiadalah syak lagi barangsiapa tiada percaya doa ini nescaya menjadi kafir
2223601 those little ones are more than a full time job and taking breaks is healthy even if they are back to back

2223604 a dismal swamp on which the half built houses rot away
2223605 a place without one single quality in earth or air or water to commend it such is this dismal cairo
2223606 cairo has a heavy railroad and river trade and her situation at the junction of two great rivers is so advantageous that she can not well help prospering
2223607 the 2003 04 edition of the cairo pilots has a high standard to live up to
2223608 the current group of players looks poised to maintain that standard certainly a lot is expected of them
2223609 i think a lot of us who supported the independent board thought it would provide more rigorous financial accountability but this doesnt sound like a very responsible use of the taxpayers dollars
2223610 its hard to believe they would have to spend that kind of money to bring in a cfo
2223611 i think at this point if they are an independent board they have to make independent judgments to do what they believe is necessary to stabilize the system
2223612 we would like to have a permanent ceo in place before we have a permanent cfo
2223613 i got quotes from them and it was far more than anything we are talking about here

2223633 to make people rethink the proposition that it is rightly so a criminal act to kill and eat our own kind but that its ok to kill every other species but our own and eat them
2223634 at the same time youve got some pretty strong capital inflows to the u s we kind of have the perfect circle of fundamentals bumping into strong technicals
2223635 the world was watching and i hope they loved it too
2223636 i strongly believe societies that allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2223637 the chinese government and people have seriously implemented the solemn commitments made to the international society since beijing won the olympic bid in 2001
2223638 we are all going to miss sarge who was a patriot first and a professional golfer second
2223639 he will always be remembered for winning the 1969 u s open the last player to win after being in local and sectional qualifying

2223644 the results from the recent tracking campaign have been presented in our meeting last friday the presentation was well received and it was decided to continue with another massive study after christmas using a slightly different set of parameters the foreseen study will need about the same computing resources as the one just completed maybe more probably not less the results of the previous study will be presented at the forthcoming particle accelerator conference 2006 in edinburgh
2223645 theyve agreed in principle to a set code of conduct
2223646 this is the three internet groups we named directly google yahoo and microsoft in addition to a large number of other stakeholders human rights groups ngos other technology firms theyve all agreed in principle to this code we dont anticipate the final agreement and the final language of this code to be finished for another few weeks perhaps i would estimate it sometime in september
2223647 over the next few months the initiative will be finalizing organizational steps we anticipate a more detailed public announcement to launch the initiative sometime this fall
2223648 some companies continue to be very resistant to the idea of independent monitoring
2223649 therell be a separate organization that will independently audit and manage the agreement they will be in charge of assurance
2223650 microsoft will block access to windows live spaces content only where we receive a legally binding notice from a government indicating that the material violates local laws or if the content violates our terms of use
2223651 there are some limits to what the companies can practically do and what they say are willing to agree to do in the face of a government demand
2223652 our hope is that a code of conduct like this will embolden any company to think first when faced with a government demand that contradicts international human rights agreements
2223653 on a business level that decision to censor was a net negative
2223654 because it is a dynamic environment where new demands arise all the time we decided to replicate here the service outsourcing model implemented in the headquarters in france this will allow us to gain more flexibility and focus our efforts and investments on our core business
2223655 the contract was signed using the unit price times quantity used pricing model in which saint gobain will perform monthly payments according to the service utilization
2223656 thus all the critical applications supporting the business will run in our service provision center
2223657 leaders are performing well today have a clear vision of market direction and are actively building competencies to sustain their leadership position in the market service providers in this quadrant have a strong worldwide presence provide a broad range of services invest in innovative service tools and technologies and articulate a clear vision of current and future customer requirements and storage service solutions
2223658 ibms unique approach to storage and data services is founded on a client view of the problems they are trying to solve therefore we integrate across our company with ibm research and development the many recent ibm acquisitions like xiv diligent and cognos and with our robust partner network to provide end to end client solutions
2223659 in my opinion this honor from gartner shows that ibms evolving winning and well executed strategy is paying off and demonstrates our continued commitment to helping clients more efficiently store manage and understand and leverage data so they can align their it and business strategies to grow their respective businesses
2223660 collaboration addresses the needs of workers no matter where they are a leading differentiator for wireless carriers will be the richness of the capabilities they can carry on their networks to empower the growing mobile work force
2223661 if you can take technical skills and turn them into something entrepreneurial
2223662 lots of people who graduate from mit start up their own technology firms
2223663 the net effect is that they are more ambitious when it comes to money
2223664 the raw talent is a primary factor but i think the experience somebody gets at their college plays a part
2223665 the network of people you meet and the kinds of experiences you have in and out of the classrooms helps form who you are and what you become
2223666 the happiest and richest people look for schools to help them develop their talents in whatever field that owns their soul
2223667 people in my class were very good at jobs where they follow rules doctors lawyers professions where you learn stuff and do it by the book
2223668 people who really break out of the envelope the really creative people in the world far more often than not did not go to brand name schools
2223669 the mobile web presents one of the largest emerging market opportunities weve seen in a decade as billions of people look to access a wide range of services both for business and personal use
2223670 utilizing software assets from ibm research combined with our services offerings provides unique opportunities to help companies quickly adapt to the mobile environment
2223671 its far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price
2223672 my duty of enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong
2223673 oh no its happening without us people are going to go write real software for this chip i was sure it would happen sooner rather than later and i wanted to be involved from the beginning the chance to get in on the first stages of the pc revolution seemed the opportunity of a lifetime and i seized it
2223674 i was afraid others would have the same vision we did
2223675 it seduces smart people into thinking they cant lose and its an unreliable guide to the future what seems the perfect business plan or latest technology today may soon be as out of date as the eight track tape player the vacuum tube television or the mainframe computer
2223676 it is obvious that a number of large companies were so set in their ways that they did not adapt properly and lost out as a result
2223677 he was one of the first at that time to say theres a business here
2223678 we didnt want to give anyone a reason to look elsewhere
2223679 we wanted choosing microsoft software to be a no brainer
2223680 growing up my parents always encouraged us to read a lot and think for ourselves they included us in discussions on everything from books to politics
2223681 take our 20 best people away and i tell you that microsoft would become an unimportant company
2223682 the single most important development to come along since the ibm pc was introduced in 1981 more important than the arrival of graphical user interface
2223683 that kind of mental acuity is handy for anything you want to do with excellence
2223684 wow this is mine for me to enjoy how lucky
2223685 as ive said many times i believe brian westbrook is the best running back in football
2223686 he can do it all from that position whether its running catching the football or blocking
2223687 even after an hour there was no guarantee that the track would be up to standard
2223688 the threat of more storms was real and we decided to cancel for the safety of the horses and jockeys
2223689 not every single minute of every day has to be totally organized ill be with a lot of my family and theyre fun to hang around with
2223690 it is quite an honor to be introduced by your dad
2223691 i wasnt exactly sure what to say to you except to start with god i love our country and i love what we stand for and i love being with you
2223692 we feel good about what was done but he is a three to four week scenario right now
2223693 so its scary for us from a standpoint at the tackle position but thats where we are at and we expect him back for the start of the season
2223694 we dont think he was physically quite with the rest of the team
2223695 he had a little tweak he has had it before we worked him back and probably could have went back on the field this morning
2223696 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2223697 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2223698 i dont think too many people question that i think a lot of people question what happened this offseason
2223699 you see teams go out in free agency and spend on a lot of guys and everyone says oh theyre going to be great and go to the super bowl it takes chemistry and to me thats the most important thing you can have all the talent in the world but if the chemistry is not there it wont matter
2223700 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds
2223701 if you had picked a number higher you wouldve gotten more money on your metrocard
2223702 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2223703 he still has the utmost amount of respect from the guys in this locker room here and we wish him well wish him a good season and hope to see him in tampa
2223704 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2223705 it is good to have him here when you play with a legend you cant help but feed off of it i think hell fit right in with both the team and the city
2223706 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year
2223707 the truth is i dont really care if i fight in the ufc or somewhere else
2223708 for a company that is as loyal to me as i am to them
2223709 the misconception is and the thing that people are getting wrong is that i realize im blessed i was part of the ufc and im blessed with what theyve done for me
2223710 i wouldnt be in the situation im in if it werent for them
2223711 is that from an economic point of view i have to think of economics i was a business major you have to think that way i think about taxes and my roth ira and my retirement plan and how long can i do this for i know im not randy couture and i know i cant be 44 years old and still compete i gave myself a five year plan to do what i can and thats what i was talking about
2223712 the only thing is theyre a business and they want to keep their expenses low and their income high and in that theyre no different than me
2223713 if you work for dell and you were offered a lot more money to come over to apple and build macs the economics of it and the financial aspects of it would play a part this is the same thing
2223714 he just wants to work and work and work and is constantly looking to find a way to get better
2223715 im honestly not worrying about my contract or anything like that because i hired great people to do that for me so i wouldnt have to
2223716 and i understand this is a performance business its up to me to perform and thats why ive done what ive done over the last few months i want to hold up my end of this thing which is the fighting end if i do everything else is going to be fine
2223717 do you see jesus christ as the son of god and believe in him as the route to salvation and eternal life
2223718 they make food taste better theyre calorie free and most are anti inflammatory

2223745 there is a lot of dumbing down going on but i dont think we need to panic i think we just need to teach our children well
2223746 so its been a week since rc1 and rc2 is out there
2223747 theres a lot of random changes in there and im hoping were starting to calm down but one particular kind of random change is probably worth pointing out explicitly due to the things it can result in the fact that a number of architectures ended up using the lull after rc1 hah to do the include asm xyz gt arch xyz include asm renames
2223748 the dirstat with rename detection on so as to not show the movement as huge changes is fairly usual with most of the changes in drivers along with an ext4 and xfs update making fs show up pretty high too
2223749 the big advantage hammer has over tux3 is it is up and running and released in the dragonfly distro

2223752 daniel noted that hes been working on the tux3 design for around ten years
2223753 they india have very good batting line up actually one of the greatest batsmen is sachin tendulkar it was really big moment for me when i got that wicket i am really happy
2223754 in form man sehwag has batted really well i was a bit nervous at that time opening spell but when i got that wicket i gained confidence and that is why i got three wickets
2223755 i really enjoyed bowling at this wicket actually i got confidence and that is very important thing
2223756 we should have got a much higher score than what we got at the end of the day but this is part and parcel of test cricket
2223757 and i think we are still very much in the game if we have one or two early wickets in the morning we can be right back into the game
2223758 it is a fantastic wicket to bat on to be very honest there was hardly anything for the bowlers there was nothing for the fast bowlers nothing for the spinners it is just that we did not bat well we should have got much more score than what we got
2223759 there was hardly any grass on the surface to be very honest
2223760 its like a dream come true but the icing on the cake for me was claiming the wicket of sachin tendulkar i have admired him so much and hes my favourite player and i was thrilled when that finger went up
2223761 i had played in the warm up game against india two weeks ago and it helped me to gain some confidence but to bowl to sehwag was a challenge and i was a bit nervous its been a perfect day for us and hopefully well go on to win this one

2223770 he dont talk act or carry himself as a black person
2223771 well i dont know what that means im saying thats what i think that they would say
2223772 even though black society would pull for him i still think that they think in the back of their mind that the only reason he is in is because he talks acts and carries himself as a caucasian
2223773 he dont talk act or carry himself as a black person
2223774 i understand it to some point if i put myself into a favre fanatics shoes
2223775 the things i cant understand the things i really take personally is when im driving up to the parking lot gate and punching in my punch code and somebody says f u to me that kind of bothers me or when a little kid is yelling swear words at me that kind of gets to me the boos they expect a high level of play and they miss brett favre i understand that but the f u and the little kids saying swear words to me i dont understand that
2223776 do people really feel better about themselves after they say stuff like that to me its disappointing im not too dumb im not going to say anything back to them its not my style its against my religion

2223780 spain didnt even put pau gasol on its 2000 olympic team and he was good enough to be drafted in the nba that season
2223781 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2223782 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2223783 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2223784 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u
2223785 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world
2223786 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control
2223787 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2223788 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2223789 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2223790 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2223791 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2223928 i dont want to go into detail but i explained everything to one friend i trust and they said i dont blame you
2223929 i found a little stallion of my own and hes just a little gem
2223930 weve been doing the long distance thing and its been like dating someone on the lunar space station what with the phone calls and time difference
2223931 sending that by email was the worst thing i ve ever done but i can t turn back the clock

2223934 he gave a prized car a ferrari with his racing number 82 on it to a long time pal
2223935 the sudden move angered his children its especially hard for them to come to grips with whats going on
2223936 the word theyve been given is that he has only a few weeks to live
2223937 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2223938 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds

2223945 we had other programming commitments and respect for other audiences so we cant keep all the people happy all the time
2223946 the ratings results from thursday for make me a supermodel and the soccer show the decision was vindicated
2223947 i think every one of the new signings has been excellent there have been some very good additions made to the squad
2223948 we have players who can cover multiple positions and do it well so no one can be in their comfort zone and that bodes well for the squad
2223949 when youve got a small squad you need competition in all positions and the gaffers provided that in abundance
2223950 theres strong competition among the goalkeepers as well beast brian jensen has been on fire in training and stopping everything hes like batfink
2223951 diego penny has come in as well and hes a strapping lad and an excellent shot stopper and gabor kiraly has put in a good shift also
2223952 there are tough decisions for the gaffer to make all round but its an excellent problem to have

2223954 ive gone from watching it every day to once or twice a week which isnt a good thing because i love it
2223955 in a word money with the cost of new drug development hovering in the hundreds of millions of dollars the pharmaceutical industry decided there wasnt enough of a market to make male hormonal contraceptives worthwhile

2223957 the enviable fortune to work with some of the most beautiful women
2223958 our ancestors were probably designed to make some estimation of the possible pool of alternatives and some estimation of their own worth relative to the possibilities

2223960 iron plays a very important part in the reactions in our cells that produce damaging free radicals which glom onto cell membranes and dna and may translate into aging of the cell

2223963 between love and madness lies obsession love madness its my secret
2223964 the manic pixie dream girl archetype is largely defined by secondary status and lack of an inner life
2223965 anyone who telegraphs their so called weirdness so outlandishly is not actually weird theyre merely quirky enough to be vaguely interesting without having their own thing going on theyre completely mainstream but have one really big tattoo or occasionally sing really loud in the shower
2223966 like the magical negro the manic pixie dream girl archetype is largely defined by secondary status and lack of an inner life

2223969 if we had no sexual harassment we would have no children
2223970 a boss impregnates his secretary either through semi consensual sex as a result of harassment or from full on rape the odds are pretty high that the pregnancy will be unwanted making the woman more likely to abort
2223971 i wanted to try to some way kind of do what they used to do when they traveled around in the old days
2223972 taking the train where the players can move around and relax a little bit will give us some time that i think we need at this point to get ready for a game
2223973 i had me a long vacation not saying that i wanted it
2223974 its football season and im happy to be back to work
2223975 im doing everything that im supposed to do to make sure i get reinstated

2223977 ive never really gotten nervous for preseason games but im sure i will because im in a new uniform
2223978 ive ridden on the train before when i was in washington its going to be fun for everybody
2223979 if you do this well in an hour imagine how good it could have been

2223983 la criminalidad no es una realidad ontol gica de determinados comportamientos y de determinados individuos sino que se revela mas bien como un status asignado a determinados individuos por medio de una doble selecci n en primer lugar la selecci n de los bienes protegidos penalmente y de los comportamientos ofensivos a estos bienes considerados en las figuras penales en segundo lugar la selecci n de los bienes estigmatizados entre todos los individuos que cometen infracciones a normas penalmente sancionadas
2223984 el conflicto y la v ctima del delito resulta siendo v ctima del sistema penal en fin estas son algunas de las razones que los abolicionistas propugnan para precisamente abolir el sistema penal

2223992 we are trying to convince them to take the cruise back theres nothing they can do here they have a five day cruise coming back

2223995 the house is completely gutted and mark is completely gutted it is going to have to be rebuilt completely
2223996 roadside advertising causes a distraction to drivers and could result in accidents
2223997 when people stop commonsense happening people like us who are trying to survive in business will do all sorts of other things

2224073 police call handlers have a vital role to play in ensuring all relevant information is recorded and disseminated to give officers attending scenes as many facts as possible to assist them
2224074 there is no escaping the fact that some key information was missed
2224075 however this was not due to some malicious or deliberate act rather it was due to simple human error a mistake
2224076 there is no suggestion the outcome would have been any different
2224077 instead of laying blame on one individual it is more important that durham constabulary learn the lessons from this incident and ensure improvements are made in their call handling practices

2224150 les auteurs des chroniques guerri res sont souvent tr s explicites dans leurs vocations on sent leur complaisance embellir et d tailler les exploits anatomiques de leurs h ros en vue dimposer quelques images brutales et path tiques
2224151 le plus souvent on se donnait un r pit de quelques minutes on se retirait de la ligne du combat pour se recueillir au moins un instant avant de se tuer juste linstant dun dernier po me en tout cas dune derni re pri re
2224152 ii meurt non il se tue et tout est diff rent ii ne voit plus la dure n cessit qui le broie mais la souverainet quil exerce en sunissant son destin ii va s teindre sans doute mais non sans un dernier flamboiement qui fascinera il le sait bien tous les tres qui se savent mortels ii se fait flamme dun instant dans lincessant brasier de l ph m re ses fautes pass es ses erreurs ses faiblesses tout est consum dans l clat de la mort volontaire par del le pardon il se donne la gloire et loubli au plus haut de lhumain

2224156 il y a bien longtemps un pauvre voyageur tait sur le point de mourir de faim
2224157 comme mes ennemis doivent me redouter en voyant de quoi je suis capable
2224158 its good to know it can be done here everyone was saying go to adelaide i said no i can get it done here and the staff have been excellent
2224159 ive been waiting for two years for this its worth waiting for
2224160 we are trying to be proactive and limit alcohol fuelled incidents that happen in identified problem areas
2224161 there have not been a great number of instances when we up the ante in november that could change
2224162 we use it for intersection control wherever there could be conflict between pedestrians and cars
2224163 the lord of the sign in before you can post messages
2224164 we currently operate a day service to port lincoln from adelaide and return six days a week and a night service to port lincoln from adelaide and return daily
2224165 due to low passenger loadings and increasing costs particularly the massive increase in the price of diesel we will no longer operate the night service from adelaide to port lincoln
2224166 the early morning departure from whyalla will now depart at 6am rather than 5am
2224167 it goes a long way to help us achieve our goals
2224168 the gallery has been going quite well but we have decided to move as a family at the end of this year
2224169 the student exhibition was fantastic and i really want to express my gratitude to all the exhibitors people who have purchased works and the schools who have provided positive feedback since the gallery opened
2224170 it has been hard going since october 2007 when i started to work towards the gallery
2224171 i did try to get another operator in place but it wasnt possible
2224172 this gallery is a co operative venture and unfortunately it requires a high level of passion and dedication to keep it going
2224173 it has been hard as a family to be apart and the time is right for a move
2224174 there is a lot of lifting and moving to do for a small committee it is an enormous amount of work
2224175 if there are some people who would like to help it would be greatly appreciated
2224176 by getting more volunteers involved it not only makes the work easier and cuts down on time involved but it also adds a bit of fun to the whole process
2224177 if you can help out please come to jubilee park basketball stadium at 9am on saturday morning
2224178 many hands make light work and your help will be appreciated
2224179 something needs to be done for the people of whyalla
2224180 if you look 10 to 14 days in advance its not that hard to find a fare for 108
2224181 in the last financial year 42 per cent of customers travelled on the 108 fare
2224182 it was a unanimous vote of aeu members it is not just about wages but funding for school programs and other critical matters
2224183 students were advised not to attend stuart high school on monday until after 12 15pm
2224184 our campaign will leave the government decision makers in no doubt about the changes needed
2224185 we have repeatedly urged the government to address our pay and conditions
2224186 they have not taken the opportunity to shift their position in order to give any real consideration to our concerns
2224187 whyalla is sitting in a great position to capitalise from investment being made in the city and the region
2224188 the future of whyalla has never looked brighter and for me it will be great to be a part of this growth
2224189 working within the whyalla economic development board office for the past three years has provided a good understanding of the issues that the community and in particular small business are facing
2224190 whyalla already has a strong business community we aim to identify and provide specialist training for small and medium enterprise in areas that are required
2224191 we are looking to attract additional business to key precincts to provide the critical mass needed to attract volumes of consumers
2224192 we will then be able to target specific sectors where they are currently lacking
2224193 it will look at where the gaps lie so we are able to attract the right mix of retail services within specific areas
2224194 if i put candles on the tables and put my waiters in suits and play jazz i can be a typical three star restaurant and i know i have the cooking skills to do that but its been done ive played this game ive heard this album im done with it
2224195 i think lets just be a fun restaurant with great food noise isnt always a bad thing my plates are from ikea and theyre 2 99 youve got some restaurant raters that will include you only if you use high quality silverware fancy got checklists well i summarily reject that im not spending 95 on a plate so some critic will put me in his book
2224196 we started with 100 ideas and 50 of them have worked out
2224197 in 1994 we started what eventually became the largest earth day festival in the united states
2224198 with the wide range of environmental issues confronting our planet from global warming to depleting energy sources our focus is to promote awareness of public transportation options global warming and alternative fuels and energies
2224199 it explains clearly and simply the reasons why we have to not be passive about this situation

2224202 you cant complain or whine or you cant come ever again
2224203 on my hikes i met people who claimed to have had ghostly encounters so i began exploring the history behind the stories i was hearing on the trail
2224204 they were taking a track log of the track i needed
2224205 these guys winter hiked a lot while they were camping they heard the sound of someone crying and shrieking and didnt know what it was all they could imagine was that it was a bird but there were no birds to be found
2224206 their history is what makes those spirits alive the people who originally built these places and brought them to life their stories are already part of the land waiting to be rediscovered by families and children
2224207 najaf is now more important than baghdad there everything deteriorated because of the violence here we have stability
2224208 all of this is being done by an iraqi company and another one from the united arab emirates
2224209 this year weve opened a clinic for heart catheterization and today we started work on a center for neurological sciences
2224210 why not let residents build like crazy here with a shiite led government in charge in baghdad
2224211 najaf is now number one in iraq in terms of reconstruction projects and economic power
2224212 itll take another decade for us to be number one in the middle east
2224213 the electricity is still bad and we only have it for two hours after six hours of blackouts yassen says
2224214 the drinking water is a problem too some neighborhoods in najaf get no water and others get contaminated water
2224215 we look for development for najaf but at the same development for diwaniyah for samawa for hilla
2224216 we have not to forget other governments in the same style saddam has done he has concentrated all his efforts on baghdad tikrit and mosul for example so we ought not to make the same mistake

2224228 away from the utopian revolutionary politics there is still an engagement of these forms with the eye and mind that is tremendously stimulating
2224229 we have seen a tide of increasingly jejune depoliticised versions of constructivism perpetrated by western graphic designers over the years
2224230 when you couldnt turn around with out seeing a lame version of lissitzky i remember a sherlock holmes poster done by the illustrator that made no contextual sense
2224231 it doesnt hurt that there was a political component to the movement
2224232 people believed in something that was radical in its day thats seductive
2224233 i was always a bit wary about this nostalgia for constructivism
2224234 obviously their ideology is hopelessly obsolete not only in a political sense everything was about usefulness and artistic expression was largely discredited yet there was some general democratic idea in the air art for everyone art for the people which is appealing even today maybe especially today in the time of marc newson and ron arad six digit or seven digit furniture sales one is longing for some kind of artistic work that is more accessible
2224235 not towards the old nor towards the new but towards the necessary
2224236 i think it is a general compla cency lack of pathos absence of criticism or any kind of controversy
2224237 on a deeper level avant garde is only avant garde when it counters some other established order since ikea has won all over the world its become that established order nowadays to do art one almost has to take a stand against ikea or at least provide a critique of some kind
2224238 to reduce the number of objects in the human environment to rethink and simplify the material qualities of everyday life
2224239 construct ivism appeals to designers because its references are graphic and graphic art appealed to the constructivists because it was the means to mass communication for all
2224240 the constructivists were looking for behavioural change within their society and saw graphics as a way of integrating art into the new society they were building the worry for the designer now should be how we can sell reduced consumption or educate people to make informed decisions to be able to survive and adapt
2224241 construct ivism appeals to designers because its references are graphic and graphic art appealed to the constructivists because it was the means to mass communication for all
2224242 what matters is that design is a way of reflecting social undercurrents the futurists supported mussolini whereas rodchenko was a socialist revolutionary i draw a sense of dynamism and optimism with no intention of a political connotation if you look at some of rodchenkos paintings youll see he anticipated abstract expressionism by a good 50 or 60 years its so abstract its completely apolitical rodchenko was more about humanism and humanitarianism than communism
2224243 what happened between 1914 and 1935 has dictated everything that has happened since in any area of design
2224244 many graphic designers get excited about constructivism as students its inspiring to students to see how nonrepresent ational shapes can be laid out to make a pleasing and dynamic pattern constructivism can be seen in the history books as proof positive that what designers do can have meaning and change peoples ideas as everyone knows you cant go wrong with red and black you dont have to be able to draw and you can use a couple of basic typefaces and make your own powerful looking designs
2224245 despite the ignorant uses of style there is a need to recreate history if only to embrace knowledge

2224283 supervisor mirkarimi im worried about whos patrolling the streets of san francisco right now
2224284 we urge all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2224285 we are working on mediation efforts to secure a cease fire and we are urging the parties to restart their dialogue
2224286 grave concern and it will certainly lead to retaliatory actions
2224287 additional reinforcements has been sent to the region to help the peacekeepers prevent bloodshed
2224288 we usually buy 6 000 gallons of chicken fat and can yield 5 500 gallons of biodiesel
2224289 once we get 3 000 gallons we are going to run a test batch to generate b100 biodiesel
2224290 its shameful and its just so signature classic pg amp e
2224291 what they are doing is to try to scare san franciscans to then scare their supervisors
2224292 they are literally scared from the feasibility study because they know that san francisco will best be suited for charting its own energy destiny
2224293 of the nine hundred cities in the united states that are public power cities every one of them shows that they delivered cheaper electricity and better than the private utility
2224294 the california state board of equalization says all of pg amp es state assessed san francisco property was worth 1 2 billion in 2007 the boards appraisers assess pg amp es property for tax purposes and their final figure includes millions of dollars of property that san francisco would not want to own including their downtown office complex
2224295 problem is apparently it is illegal to use a companys investor financial statements to assess them for taxation purposes
2224296 what we have now is people who know how to use weapons and who now want to play politics
2224297 there is no doubt the violence will increase in kirkuk if its case does not get solved
2224298 we found out that armed action will not get the united states out of iraq
2224299 after five years of directing painful blows to them they did not budge from a single meter in the country
2224300 entering the elections is to change the current reality in our area the domination of the sunni spectrum by the iraqi islamic party
2224301 we cant have a first rate education system in texas with a second rate accountability system
2224302 the texas election code specifies that all documents filed with and retained by political parties are public information with several exceptions an attorney with the texas secretary of states office has told us that the copies of the precinct convention lists are public information and that members of the public are entitled to make copies of that information
2224303 mtvs launch 25 years ago or apple incs ipod launch five years ago and todays video game companies like he can dance
2224304 because we still see sales volatility from week to week especially around paycheck cycles
2224305 with the end of the stimulus checks we know consumers are spending more cautiously
2224306 to be with these other athletes who are on the cover with me now i can cheer and watch them at the beard the youngest u s swimmer to ever bring home the gold after her performance at the 1996 games in atlanta was also playing nintendo olympics game with the power pad where you started out as the turtle and worked your way up to the cheetah
2224307 my family would have competitions against other families who were close friends and wed rock it wed do the triple jump and the hurdles and all of that fun stuff
2224308 like every guy its a major part of my life especially when you travel overseas
2224309 video games pass the time so much easier than just playing cards
2224310 all the guys i know bring a ps2 psp and a controller with them to the international competitions they get into some pretty heated madden tournaments
2224311 olympic track athletes spend a lot of free time trying to be the best in their favorite video games so much so our fingers sometimes get more tired then our legs do in actual races
2224312 for me it keeps me off my feet it keeps me engaged and i dont waste a lot of energy playing them
2224313 maybe some young kid will play the game and be inspired to go out and train in real life with the goal of really being in the some day
2224314 action figures bobbleheads and t shirts sweeping in bat dollars beyond the films 400 million record smashing box office no
2224315 i think publishers have concluded the only games that work are the surefire 500 million box office kind of games like spider man and
2224316 the transformers game really surprised people how well it did but the movie was big i dont think they expected movie to be this big
2224317 were hoping to help evolve the way humans interact with machines
2224318 after came out i wanted to use the force to make my cereal box float into my hands
2224319 for now were focused on the video game application for epoc but we see possibilities beyond this such as market research or health care
2224320 often when companies make products that are comfortable and easy to use by the public interesting applications on the medical side
2224321 anything like that would require approval from the which takes years
2224322 but the possibility is there if simply from a cost standpoint our product is in the hundreds whereas most eeg machines cost between 50 000 and 250 000
2224323 im not sure its at the point of being as precise as it would need to be
2224324 i dont see it being a mainstream device in this form that said its certainly beyond a gimmick game issues aside its uncanny
2224325 when the item on screen did what i thought it to do it was surreal
2224326 this is science fiction stuff emotiv has jumped the first hurdle in simply making the device now they have to make it work with most games if they do this could hit the jackpot
2224327 the same user can have a variety of make up tips for different occasions such as business dating or formal gatherings you would find colours that are good on you but you never realised before
2224328 the new software targets women in their 20s and 30s
2224329 including children elderly people and women who were not considered core game players
2224330 it is a dialoguing cultural religious social army devoted to ideological and scientific jihad and freeing brains and hearts and the human spirit from the western secular hegemony
2224331 we are trying to move as quickly as possible but let us see how the opposing parties move
2224332 at the present moment it does not appear that the army will support him they will definitely not make any mistake of opposing the will of the people of pakistan
2224333 it is a very difficult time but at the same time it will be a very historical time if the remainder of the military dictatorship is removed
2224334 laura and i and a lot of our family are here to cheer you on
2224335 were just a handful of a lot of folks who care about you a lot there are going to be a lot of people pulling for you
2224336 we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
2224337 we continue to be candid about our belief that all people should have the freedom to say what they think and worship as they choose
2224338 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2224339 candor is the most effective where nations have built a relationship of respect and trust
2224340 this has got to be a historic moment father and son two presidents opening an embassy my dad was a fabulous president
2224341 foreign and european affairs minister bernard kouchner is extremely preoccupied by the events in south ossetia georgia he deplores the loss of human life
2224342 france calls on all parties to cease hostilities immediately and return to without delay to negotiations which are the only way to resolve this crisis
2224343 i am shocked by the escalation of violence in south ossetia in the last 48 hours it is still unclear who is responsible for the new outbreak of violence
2224344 all combat operations must be stopped and all the forces that have been led to south ossetia in the last 48 hours must be pulled back i have expressed that opinion to georgian president saakashvili and russian foreign minister lavrov on the phone
2224345 chancellor angela merkel has urged the conflict parties in south ossetia to show calm and restraint and called for an immediate stop to all use of force
2224346 we have enough membership to support that area we needed to be able to serve them
2224347 lets pick up the car and pull out the jack
2224348 the tire isnt screwed on yet if we pull that car up to get the jack the tire will fall off then the car will slam to the ground
2224349 i have two shot guns tear gas a gas mask a bullet proof vest four stun guns a bazooka and a dead hooker but no jack
2224350 as of thursday morning at nine oclock i thought it was cut and dried but by 9 30 it was all off again
2224351 we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
2224352 candor is the most effective where nations have built a relationship of respect and trust
2224353 this has got to be a historic moment father and son two presidents opening an embassy my dad was a fabulous president
2224354 whats the evidence that he did anything other than know how to make anthrax and have all kinds of it at his disposal
2224355 there are a lot of armchair detectives and instant experts out there formulating opinions not based on a full set of the facts the only airtight cases in life are on csi in prime time
2224356 there were a lot of things going on but weve tried to keep the players away from everything
2224357 we want them to enjoy their football and theres a massive positive feeling around the squad
2224358 it is a big ask to get people down there but i have had a couple of friends who have helped me out
2224359 gary harris has been to watch a couple of games in the bristol area when we were looking for players while jason dodd has looked at a couple on the south coast
2224360 were getting as much help as we can in and around the southern area
2224361 his policies have weakened the federation and eroded the trust of the nation in national institutions
2224362 the coalition believes it has become imperative to move for impeachment
2224363 jtf guantanamo conducts the safe and humane care and custody of detained enemy combatants legally ethically and transparently
2224364 detainee must be monitored observed and recorded by on duty mps
2224365 we have to assume that the frequent flyer program what its details were was not designed to strengthen the comfort and resolve of the prisoner
2224366 but there is no peace and democracy in burma and its impossible to go home
2224367 american people care deeply about the people of burma and we pray for the day in which the people will be free
2224368 the noble cause has many devoted champions and i happen to be married to one of them
2224369 twenty years have gone by everything is still the same or maybe worse in burma
2224370 we know that burma is a very rich country rich in natural resources and the junta uses those resources to prop themselves up for their own benefit not for the benefit of the people of burma
2224371 i want to play and improve and help the squad to better last years success
2224372 ive had good seasons before at wolves and want that again rather than being on the bench
2224373 dad will we have birthdays when we get to heaven
2224374 hey idiot if you are wearing cut off shorts and reeboks chain smoking and carrying a six pack of beer with you on a par 3 course dont talk to me about my kids being too loud
2224375 through the olympics people feel they are experiencing their own success
2224376 im happy to be living in this era with such a big event taking place

2224386 historically russia has been and will continue to be a guarantor of security for peoples of the caucasus
2224387 i do not think that this is the end of the farc i do not think that the farcs days are numbered
2224388 they have a fight that will last for a long time
2224389 you are exploring the south pole and discover two bodies frozen in the ice immediately you know that it is adam and eve how
2224390 however even if i am allow to embed ads i will not use them
2224391 its making texts accessible in all sorts of ways without dumbing down
2224392 think about the commitment to reading that story thats a lot of reading
2224393 every single school library ive been to in edinburgh has manga pictures on the wall theyre already doing this its simply a question of doing it formally
2224394 sh nen is for boys sh jo is for girls people read across but thats the intention
2224395 for every anime there is eventually a manga for every manga there is eventually an anime
2224396 but if you watch spirited away you know youre missing half the references
2224397 you become the guy by the side not the sage on the stage
2224398 this is about what its like to arrive in a place where you dont know the language or the culture or even the counting system
2224399 there are so many questions so many possibilities with this book westminster college said right we need lots of this
2224400 a way back into comics for female readers who hadnt read comics for a long time
2224401 theyre reprinting old comics like girl and bunty you could teach about the history of a place from comics of the past
2224402 this is the point at which study and joy come together this is one way in which you may actually engage people
2224403 a very political book someone was saying they consider it an art book
2224404 i actually think theres a whole unit of teaching there in itself
2224405 am 1510 avs nugs youve got to be kidding me cant get the signal in parker after 6 a m this is a huge mistake unless they actually get a stronger signal tell kevin medina that his station is weak weak weak
2224406 might be the nastiest more race baiting ad of the entire election cycle
2224407 while hes in our churches clapping his hands and tapping his feet hes the only senator who thought our kids shouldnt be allowed to pray in school
2224408 if you hear shots in the night pow pow pow dont leave your hammock everything will be okay
2224409 there are some big teams that have dropped down from the main conference while some of the teams that have been promoted are talking of big things
2224410 its never easy but we have kept the bulk of our squad and we have to look to improve on last season
2224411 hes been with us for two seasons and has been one of our better players
2224412 hes still keen to progress in the game and i think hes got all the attributes to do that and we wish him all the best
2224413 that guys family has more wrecks than a family of circus daredevils
2224414 the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country
2224415 confuse the dreary recitation of politically correct gibberish with sensitivity that they think they have arrived at through their own value clarification
2224416 supporting entrepreneurship is vital to ensure the growth of irelands economy particularly as we compete more against new european union countries and the far east for international business research indicates that ireland has an increasingly entrepreneurial culture but that more needs to be done to support women in enterprise this event raises the importance of this issue and will also provide valuable supports and networking for all those who attend
2224417 the recent gem report found that only four out of ten women believe that they have the knowledge and skills to start a business this event will show women how to overcome the typical difficulties associated with starting up or growing a business
2224418 this is the first time the county amp city enterprise boards and other state agencies have come together with the specific intention of providing a holistic offering to women in business
2224419 the outcome for those attending will be that they come away from the day inspired informed and motivated to fully exploit their potential as entrepreneurs
2224420 a crude mix of right wingery lame puns and puerile innuendo
2224421 the art of good writing for a sensitive and intelligent person is not in knowing what to write but in knowing what not to write no ingenious insertions can improve a composition as much as relentless slashing of lines and paragraphs
2224422 maaf bapak dan ibu kamar di hotel kami penuh sama dengan hotel hotel lainnya karena di kota ini sedang ada tiga
2224423 though we dont think this type of advertising is appropriate for college sports we have tried this once before in this country and it didnt work very well
2224424 beer promotion during college sports telecasts undermines the best interests of higher education and compromises the efforts of colleges and others to combat sometimes epidemic levels of alcohol problems on many campuses today
2224425 we find it puzzling that ncaa advertising rules prohibit ads for cigarettes other tobacco products organizations promoting gambling and alcoholic beverages yet continue to allow ads for beverages with alcohol content of 6 percent or less beer the top alcoholic drink of college students
2224426 given the devastating problems caused by underage and excessive drinking much of it in the form of beer this policy makes little sense and flouts the core values of sports and learning
2224427 i think weve taken a very sensible very rationale very conservative approach and weve asked that any company that advertises alcohol during our games continue to include the message drink responsibly on its ads
2224428 i think weve taken about as a conservative an approach as any sport in the country while not everyone agrees 100 percent i think we represent what is a good balance in that opinion
2224429 our bylaws lump together names images and likenesses and the names are being used now so well have to go back and look at this
2224430 we will need to go back and look at our options we certainly are not giving up our model of amateurism
2224431 the growth of our team is going to come from within we will have to raise our level of performance the foundation was sort of laid last year after a little bit of a slow start we are going to have to build on that identity
2224432 a good entry of horses will be there on the day from far and wide it should be a great event and everyone is welcome
2224433 roger bassam must be seeking a district of north vancouver council seat
2224434 im not able to comment about that i guess you can draw your conclusions but i cant comment about that
2224435 for us the most important thing is that our client is properly represented and we understand that with time everything will be solved
2224436 we are as surprised as the rest of puerto rico is
2224437 we understand that everyone is presumed innocent and we will wait until the evidence is presented
2224438 its killing us because he gets a lot of open shots
2224439 if he makes just one or two more shots every night were probably winning some close games instead of losing them
2224440 ive been a life long fan of scotty bowman and i am truly humbled to have him join our hockey operations staff he is one of the greatest minds in the history of our sport and will undoubtedly be a great asset to us in our day to day operations
2224441 to you from failing hands we throw the torch be yours to hold it high
2224442 we are pleased to renew our affiliation with the cincinnati cyclones
2224443 we are very happy with the development of our prospects under chuck weber and dean stork our players have benefited from playing in a winning environment and we hope this affiliation will benefit both organizations for years to come
2224444 the montreal canadiens are one of the most storied franchises in all of sport
2224445 they have been excellent to work with and have provided us with players that helped us win the kelly cup championship this summer being affiliated with hamilton has driven our players to want to quickly develop to be part of their future we are proud to be connected with both franchises
2224446 if we keep it all in perspective there hasnt been any real hockey trades to my knowledge since july 1 and i dont think there will be until teams go through the arbitration process and have a clear understanding of what their financial obligations are
2224447 i knew there would be a grace period where not a whole lot would happen in the nhl and were in the middle of that period when things begin to happen and if we dont have a clear idea of where were headed at that point i think maybe well get a little more frustrated
2224448 well still have about 10 million and maybe a bit more to spend so we are going to be open to opportunities
2224449 were only going to do it under circumstances we like
2224450 i knew steve would get a chance somewhere down the road
2224451 coaches coach the players they are given with the acquisition of steve bernier and pavol demitra and hopefully mats sundin we think we can create the opportunity for offense
2224452 we hope to get it concluded in the not too distant future
2224453 what we have talked about is that if he mats sundin were to play a couple more seasons he would be the captain of the defending team in the olympics in the town that he plays in which we believe to be unprecedented and may never be available to a player ever again so we have talked about his captaincy of the swedish olympic team but we havent gone further than that at this point
2224454 his ability leadership and character were all over the top
2224455 boy it sure would be nice to have some good news once in a while
2224456 the minor character who wont make it to the end of the episode
2224457 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2224458 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2224459 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2224460 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2224461 whatever decision is made its going to be a collaborative decision
2224462 i think all this sort of speculation is much ado about very little
2224463 were just working out the details however those details play out that doesnt change the bottom line the fact that everyones on the same team here
2224464 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2224465 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2224466 neuropathy is a chronic and significant problem in hiv patients as there are few existing treatments that offer adequate pain management to sufferers
2224467 we found that smoked cannabis was generally well tolerated and effective when added to the patients existing pain medication resulting in increased pain relief
2224468 this study adds to a growing body of evidence that indicates that cannabis is effective in the short term at least in the management of neuropathic pain
2224469 while many medical blogs provide valuable information to the public are respectful in tone and are written anonymously others pose a threat to patient privacy and have the potential to threaten the integrity of the medical profession
2224470 unfortunately no professional organization has taken the initiative to provide guidance on this issue as the number of medical blogs grows professional organizations medical educators and the blogging community must address the challenge of this new medium by setting guidelines and standards for what is appropriate
2224471 cs15hammer what are you on let us see what the sailing rowing cycling etc people have to say to that dumb comment
2224472 you better come get your uncle i just killed him
2224473 they ask me why im high and my reply until the day i die dont wanna picture this cold world through sober eyes
2224474 plus all my homies wanna die call it euthanasia dear lord look how sick this ghetto made us
2224475 the aspirations of ladies in kenya and around the world are the same as they are here
2224476 they want to be treated like ladies by gentlemen what i teach is if you want to be treated like a lady you have to behave like one
2224477 i think its taken off because people are realising the world is an aggressive place but charm costs nothing
2224478 my parents taught me etiquette right from the word go and we had a nanny who taught us very well
2224479 that is a great advantage because everyone who wants etiquette training wants somebody british on board britain still is seen as the gold standard for manners abroad
2224480 you do have to remember different cultural signs whatever country you are in
2224481 for instance in the far east wrapping something in white can upset people because that symbolises death
2224482 in japan placing a business card in a back pocket is a big no no while you mustnt be too tactile and kiss women in india on a first meeting you do have to be careful to read up on different cultures but there is such a thing as international etiquette
2224483 i think the most dangerous place ive been in was nairobi recently ive heard gunfire
2224484 you sometimes get your blinders on and you say aha
2224485 we take the possibility of any adulterated product very seriously
2224486 the e coli must be present to begin with but if the meat is temperature abused the number of e coli that are present can multiply
2224487 if you look around you see that there are very very few restaurants that score 100
2224488 if we had 10 or more violations in a single visit that would be a flag
2224489 all of the things they found in this years inspection were handled immediately they issued the permits for us to operate right after they did their inspections and these things are clearly not connected to the e coli issue
2224490 even as we fight the epidemic globally we must focus at home and i intend to do so with my foundation
2224491 i have been extremely disappointed with the clinton foundation especially with it headquartered in harlem of all places that it has been silent on this issue
2224492 im very grateful and it is appropriate that president clinton is committed to taking this on
2224493 these days kids have a lot of stress that parents and maybe the kids themselves actually dont realize is there and they do need some way to cope with that
2224494 penny wong and prime minister rudd are set to join saddam hussein and the baathists of baghdad as only the second government in the world to have presided over the destruction of a ramsar listed wetland
2224495 i cant believe those idiots are standing in line to give apple their 300 then at amp t their 130 a month
2224496 will you at least tell us and keep us updated on what stock levels are so we standing in line can estimate if theres any point of us standing out here
2224497 exclusive apple enjoys making it impossible for their biggest fans to buy their products
2224498 well thanks for visiting im the mayor of this here town stay for some coffee will ya
2224499 thank god for that theyre here to play cricket they arent girls playing hockey
2224500 its a cosmetic thing total waste of time you do your talking in the dressing room and the pitch is for playing the game
2224501 this is his team he wants five bowlers and he wants freddie batting at six
2224502 so far you cant argue with it can you how many other times this summer have we threatened to bowl this lot out for under 200
2224503 this will end in disaster appointing a south african as england captain its a crazy decision

2224506 ill be anticipatin my true love will be waitin waitin at the end of my ride
2224507 i know what they take to do its four or five years out of your life it becomes all you can do and think about
2224508 most of the stuff weve had to reinvent its all ours now
2224509 how did shrek get on that swamp these things arent in the movies and they allow us to crack the story open and go a little deeper
2224510 im alive and i will survive and ill show the world i can take it
2224511 we wanted to make sure we could serve these kids
2224512 the cast accepts me for who i am and i feel a lot of love from the people around me
2224513 sometimes there are up to five to 10 children in one home and there are lots of rules you have to follow broadway bound gives me a lot of support and that makes me more confident
2224514 in the show they go to a selective arts school and we want rainier beach to become an arts magnet poor principal robert gary will have to turn people away
2224515 there are so many kids in the city who need a direction other than sports
2224516 i wonder why they got to go to the kitchen
2224517 gretta and i met two years ago playing for a cabaret i was doing called last years kisses that was all cover songs
2224518 i have never had a collaboration that was so abundant and easy at the same time when we sat down and started writing music together it had that extra spark after acting professionally for so long and sort of dabbling in music i decided this is where i wanted my focus to be i think we have found something unique with our love of melody and personal lyrics and also loud clanging rock
2224519 the only way to really learn how great life is is to go through the bad stuff
2224520 we were parting ways with our label warner brothers and didnt feel we were getting the love we deserved we sold all these records for the label and they were just willing to kick us to the curb it kind of makes you feel like you failed
2224521 all these things happened at the same time but within months i turned everything around
2224522 its awesome i love getting all the feedback from fans
2224523 who needs the major labels when you have fans who can tell you how youre doing
2224524 i think our fan base is definitely video game savvy
2224525 growing up all my buddies played halo constantly so i thought this is a no brainer people who play halo and grand theft auto theyre trapt fans
2224526 one night we went out and kind of got separated i had left her at a bar for a while and she went off with some other guy the next morning she called me and said nothing happened and i said oh whatever i dont need to hear that story
2224527 i thought you never know whos going home with who on any given night and so it kind of sparked the songs title
2224528 theres a part of the site called depth factor that i created
2224529 i put up the first few posts starting with one about confidence and why its so hard to come by
2224530 now its taken on a life of its own and people are doing their own posts people are discussing life and maybe deeper things that they wouldnt normally talk about with their friends at high school
2224531 we can help alleviate shortages by drilling for oil and gas in our own country
2224532 we have got the opportunity to find more crude oil here at home
2224533 as a nation we can have more control over our energy destiny by supplying more of the oil and natural gas well be consuming from resources here at home
2224534 it doesnt look good to say we need more oil but then export the refined products that youre getting it doesnt seem to be consistent
2224535 the fact is that the united states participates in global markets for both crude and refined products and there are any number of variables that impact supply and prices in those markets
2224536 forbidding exports of u s petroleum reduces the incentive for domestic suppliers to produce and could potentially lead to higher prices if u s production or refining declined
2224537 people are very concerned about the air quality in china
2224538 and i thought it would be great to do quintets and bach cantatas with an oboe part so oboe was the starting point for choosing the programs
2224539 we do need a chorus for one so well ask the audience to do it and rehearse a bit at intermission
2224540 there was so much experimentation that went on after the thirty years war with influences from france and italy seeping into germany so well do some instrumental music some vocal
2224541 some are retired some are summer people others have never heard anything like this its very gratifying to introduce people to something new
2224542 i found out i could be unrealistic about how long it takes to organize
2224543 i began it because i wanted to stay here in the summer
2224544 but this time of year theres a bit of anxiety
2224545 if strangers start talking to each other about our projects we think of that as success
2224546 in fact the crackdown on human rights defenders journalists and lawyers has intensified because beijing is hosting the olympics
2224547 the chinese governments policies in these areas will continue to impact chinas image abroad for good or ill long after the olympics spotlight dims
2224548 i think its very important because you use it for english and if youre writing a good story
2224549 if theyre small spelling mistakes i dont think it really matters but if you cant read the word at all it would be completely different
2224550 a bubble is simply trapped air a basketball is a type of bubble so is a balloon and air bags are bubbles that can save your life
2224551 their ephemeral nature makes them very appealing when you watch fireworks people are fixated on the sky because they know theyre momentary and bubbles are the same way i take them and do more with them than people expect you have to be in the moment and watching and if youre not theyre gone
2224552 you can place nearly anything thats wet through a soap film you can take a sharp needle and place it through a bubble and it wont pop as long as its wet
2224553 but dry objects absorb the liquid so it pops your finger absorbs the liquid like a sponge and the bubbles surface tension makes it burst but if its wet the bubble thinks of it as part of itself
2224554 there will be a kid trapped inside a giant bubble
2224555 when i go to put a kid inside a bubble i use all the science ive just taught the audience
2224556 i always had a love of science throughout high school and college and i decided i would combine all that with a medium that was different
2224557 theres an art to the bubbles and a science to the bubbles if you can take something thats ordinary and make them extraordinary people are drawn to that whether youre doing that with balloons or juggling skills or bubbles
2224558 we serve it as part of our birthday party kit and kids love it adults probably notice the difference in taste but kids think its awesome
2224559 we need to abolish our current anti doping rules and embrace a performance policy that recognizes the merit of using human enhancements
2224560 will continue to demand that the president release oil from our nations stockpile to provide immediate relief in 10 days unlike the mccain republican big oil plan that lowers prices at the pump by 2 cents in 10 years
2224561 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2224562 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2224563 we are a freedom loving nation that is now under attack
2224564 in the end they just moved in its unheard of its unparalleled its absolutely outrageous
2224565 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2224566 the stagnant air in beijing has helped pollutants accumulate i really hope in the next couple weeks well have conditions that will help us clear up the sky
2224567 najaf is now more important than baghdad there everything deteriorated because of the violence here we have stability
2224568 all of this is being done by an iraqi company and another one from the united arab emirates
2224569 this year weve opened a clinic for heart catheterization and today we started work on a center for neurological sciences
2224570 why not let residents build like crazy here with a shiite led government in charge in baghdad
2224571 najaf is now number one in iraq in terms of reconstruction projects and economic power
2224572 itll take another decade for us to be number one in the middle east
2224573 the electricity is still bad and we only have it for two hours after six hours of blackouts yassen says
2224574 the drinking water is a problem too some neighborhoods in najaf get no water and others get contaminated water
2224575 we look for development for najaf but at the same development for diwaniyah for samawa for hilla
2224576 we have not to forget other governments in the same style saddam has done he has concentrated all his efforts on baghdad tikrit and mosul for example so we ought not to make the same mistake
2224577 has grabbed more power for the executive branch than anyone since nixon
2224578 over 100 billion has been spent but parts of new orleans remain empty
2224579 ive bowled a lot of overs this year but it gave me the confidence to run up and know my areas
2224580 when you lose a captain like michael vaughan you look at yourselves
2224581 there was one leader which was kevin pietersen but the rest of us tried to lift our games it was a great team effort and a special day for kevin
2224582 you pretty much all have to be captain were all going to have to help him because he hasnt done the job before
2224583 weve been in good positions before in the series so its up to us now to nail this one home
2224584 if we have a full days batting well be in a really strong position in this test match
2224585 lyrical beautiful and set one hundred trillion years after the heat death of the universe
2224586 s 50 percent the dock is still a browse option in the
2224587 i dont propose to make a decision now i feel its only fair that i take proper time to consider all the material thats been put before me
2224588 he was a thoroughly lovely lad a very professional dedicated soldier and equally a very professional and dedicated dog handler
2224589 he was a brave likeable young lad and very respected by everybody
2224590 love you ken watch over hannah for me she will learn all about her daddy the hero
2224591 i wish the stuff they were into wasnt so expensive theyre into video games where the system costs 300 and the games are 50 when i was a kid we just had a ball and the backyard
2224592 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2224593 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2224594 we are a freedom loving nation that is now under attack
2224595 in the end they just moved in its unheard of its unparalleled its absolutely outrageous
2224596 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2224597 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2224598 we are a freedom loving nation that is now under attack
2224599 in the end they just moved in its unheard of its unparalleled its absolutely outrageous
2224600 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2224601 the stagnant air in beijing has helped pollutants accumulate i really hope in the next couple weeks well have conditions that will help us clear up the sky

2224604 dont even think about starting this conversation with your friend in the next room
2224605 if you wanted to hear great music and not get trampled this was the place
2224606 people are now coming around to the fact that growth is slowing both in the u s and overseas so demand for commodities will decline
2224607 everybody is scrambling to get out of the ship before the guy next to them
2224608 its amazing how fast commodities have become the last place people want to have their money
2224609 it looks like the bulls have run out of ammo
2224610 with poor demand prospects ahead theres not a lot of reason to be buying commodities right now
2224611 i dont see them with their scorched fingers coming back into the market that money is gone for a while
2224612 but were not expecting that to happen for at least a few quarters
2224613 but the question is how intense is it and how long will it last
2224614 a big part of what appealed to me about britain was how tidy it was how orderly how civilised
2224615 id never been to a place that was so manicured and so loved
2224616 its just not the place that i fell in love with
2224617 its like background noise people have come to accept it
2224618 if you have one broken window it indicates that we dont care so you get a second broken window and a third broken window and it indicates that society doesnt care about the society we live in
2224619 i want you to know that there is always hope
2224620 the popularity of prom nights for 20 and 30 somethings raises some interesting questions for budding sociologists was high school really the best time of our lives or was it so horrible we want a chance to do it over a la drew barrymore in never been kissed or has our generation just watched those john hughes movies too many times
2224621 imagine a hip hop and breakbeat influenced fat boy slim
2224622 the economy is limping along and businesses are doing whatever they can to remain competitive
2224623 so we had fewer people working shorter hours and producing more
2224624 and hes never done it its not a time commitment hes willing to make
2224625 when there is no more occupation there will be no need for these cells
2224626 i think the road is long before we reach that point
2224627 one hypothesis is that they mount an immune response that protected them
2224628 what the hell do you mean a prius would be the right thing to do plus it would make me look hot to all those eco bitches who want to get it on with someone who cares about the environment
2224629 does a prius make a guy hot or not would you date a guy who drives a prius or a hot sports car
2224630 prompted by consumer concerns about health issues and sites like
2224631 from a public health standpoint thats not going to help the consumer or the doctor to treat their illness
2224632 acting with an abundance of caution we are recalling the product from distribution channels until we can determine whether illnesses in virginia are connected to our operations or have some other original source or cause we wish to express our sympathy to those taken ill and we are working diligently to correct the situation
2224633 there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death
2224634 when i saw the tree i just thought save my kids
2224635 the insulation started lifting off the roof and twirling in the air
2224636 it looked like the top part of a funnel in the clouds with a trail of debris behind it
2224637 were one of the cleanest greenest festivals you can come to
2224638 hes really excited to come back and be implemented where he was at meltdown as a performer and emcee
2224639 they know theyre going to fall in love with a ton of new music
2224640 all of our talent is in my mind really profoundly good
2224641 from locals to nationals theyre all in the same bracket as far as talent goes
2224642 we are trying to impact the environment as little as possible
2224643 didnt realize you already checked the existing data max values
2224644 this is one of several major medical fraud investigations that are ongoing
2224645 theres too much money being illegally stripped from public health care programs and the potential impact to those with a legitimate need is too great to let such fraud escape federal prosecution
2224646 there are more people arriving at the ers and there are fewer ers
2224647 it takes me a month to get an appointment for my own doctor and im a physician for gods sake
2224648 half of people had waiting times of 31 minutes or less
2224649 the er has become the front door to the hospital
2224650 millions more people each year are seeking emergency care but emergency departments are continuing to close often because so much care goes uncompensated
2224651 this report is very troubling because it shows that care is being delayed for everyone including people in pain and with heart attacks
2224652 in the beginning gay men in places like san francisco and new york proved we could do prevention when we moved from that and started talking about the broad scope of the epidemic suddenly men who have sex with men became marginalized
2224653 they havent lived through the earlier days of the epidemic
2224654 this is a virus that is transmitted more easily via anal sex than vaginal sex
2224655 unlike ohio st and michigan it doesnt matter how good either of these teams are to make the blood boil
2224656 his bike flipped all the way over he landed on his shoulder and slid across the way once the emergency unit was on the scene he was adamant about not keeping them around officers marked vehicles everything his brother said they did not want any attention
2224657 as you can see the accident was a hard fall but it did not require an ambulance or firetruck
2224658 my initial thoughts were to assess what happened right away
2224659 the massive windowless walls with no windows or doors on the street and a door only visible from one of the four directions approaching the church is not us
2224660 prohibits zoning and landmarking laws that substantially burden the religious exercise of churches or other religious assemblies
2224661 its a question of whether the building is more important than the people worshiping inside
2224662 many people dont understand that a church is not just a house of worship
2224663 we need the resources for activity and ministry work during the week
2224664 the tenure issue is probably going to be the determining factor
2224665 i dont want teachers going back to school with this concept hanging over their heads
2224666 were confident things will be resolved by the beginning of school
2224667 we believe that teachers really do see the advantages of this
2224668 they know what rights they do and dont have they really believe this is going to be in the best interests of students and teachers in the long run
2224669 the washington teachers union negotiations team is very aware that our members are extremely concerned about their seniority and tenure rights and will not reach a tentative agreement that is unfair and leaves members vulnerable to arbitrary terminations and no due process rights
2224670 from all accounts this year is the most mismanaged programmatically and financially in the history of this program
2224671 there are just so many facets to it kids who didnt get paid kids who got paid who didnt work kids who may not live in the city

2224681 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2224682 theres a long tradition of actors who have disdained the hollywood establishment and then had some retribution for it within the hollywood establishment
2224683 he didnt live the way a star was supposed to live there was an expectation placed on him and he didnt satisfy that expectation and hollywood took retribution
2224684 i did not feel that i was given the material this season to warrant an emmy nomination and in an effort to maintain the integrity of the academy organization i withdrew my name from contention in addition i did not want to potentially take away an opportunity from an actress who was given such materials
2224685 first of all she did something crazy and that is she told the truth
2224686 at the very least she told her truth and in this town its not always a great idea because what you have to understand is television is a very collaborative industry and what shes essentially done is trash her writers these are people you have to go to work with every day
2224687 im going to be really honest right now he needs to just not speak in public period
2224688 it supports what we know about katie heigl that shes kind of an edgy mouthy girl whos a bit of a rabble rouser and as long as shes able to open movies and put butts in seats shes still going to have a career
2224689 i think women have a much more difficult time because when a woman makes demands as barbra streisand always did i think theyre more likely to say what the hell does she want you dont see it in the same terms of integrity and honesty its a harder sell
2224690 in this town women who dont just snap and say ok yes sir yes maam start to get a reputation for being difficult
2224691 with the 24 hour news cycle anything you say thats remotely off the cuff or interesting is going to get repeated and reported on
2224692 i think any celebrity now who really speaks his or her mind is going to be raked over the coals for it
2224693 in terms of being a role model for other women i think its important that people learn how to speak their mind after they assess the risks and rewards
2224694 who is not willing to submit to the hollywood spin machine
2224695 theres a very tenuous kind of connection between stars and the public and its very delicate in terms of how that contract is played out
2224696 stars have to be more than we are obviously but if they disconnect from us if we feel that our job is to laugh at them or to enjoy them rather than its their job to make us laugh at them to make us enjoy them they break the contract
2224697 the lally school opened up doors to new ideas and opportunities that had been out of my reach
2224698 the lally mba helps you understand how technological change creates opportunities in business by alerting you to those opportunities it prepares you to be an entrepreneur

2224705 were going to form the hub of how were going to support the new platform going forward
2224706 we can start focusing on supporting our existing platforms and our new platforms out of this new hub it also frees up some of our most talented people and our senior resources across our existing work and new work
2224707 its hard to tell at the moment its a five year journey
2224708 we already have some offshore work for our existing systems and we would expect our new systems will continue to have that mix of work
2224709 this is a really different type of technology and will require different skills and different access to different labour markets

2224716 the very people charged with meting out carefully measured punishments are themselves subject to imprecise sanctions that are either too lax according to some critics or too severe to be used except in the rarest occasions
2224717 how many people in america hold jobs where if you do them badly enough the punishment is you have to stop working and collect your pay
2224718 is the federal system well equipped to deal with incorrigible behavior by judges
2224719 no not where the behavior doesnt rise to the level of impeachment
2224720 the sec wanted to balance the need to send a message to citi and other banks while also trying to take into consideration its difficult financial condition
2224721 although it has strong defenses to these claims deloitte concluded that it was in the best interests of the firm and its clients to settle this matter now rather than face the burden expense and uncertainty of continued litigation
2224722 combatants shouldnt be criminally prosecuted for participating in combat otherwise were all criminals

2224730 the individuals willing to pay money to subscribe to this web site clearly have a very strong sexual interest in children not just a sexual interest but a violent sexual interest
2224731 they rise above the horror of the real life monsters somehow making these monsters so much worse makes me feel better and makes my life seem more bearable i may still be afraid of the monsters but at least in the stories they prey on someone else not me
2224732 if anyone would have read the story and acted upon it a little child could have suffered devastation that you would have had to live with for the rest of your life

2224746 he was a good man armand was a beautiful soul a beautiful beautiful man
2224747 there are many friends who have been affected my husband never would have hurt anyone he only wanted to help people
2224748 maybe texans should give up that right in exchange for the right to execute all foreigners
2224749 what a bloodthirsty gang we have posting to this board
2224750 as so many innocent fall victim to the death penalty those who defend it will have to offer a compelling argument why we should tolerate that loss of life when the process producing it supposedly reinforces the sanctity of life
2224751 scotlands fishing industry is to be congratulated on its success in achieving msc certification for scottish north sea herring and its work to harvest fish in a sustainable and responsible manner

2224774 it is still very early days of testing and no definitive test results are available yet
2224775 the ticketing authority will release the results of the tests at an appropriate time
2224776 the drop was largely due to due to increased competition and promotional activities for the olympic games we expect the margin to remain stable at this level in the current year
2224777 the olympics will have some negative impact on the pc sales not necessarily less than the earthquake since it will last a few weeks and will affect main cities such as beijing
2224778 even if the margin on the netbook is very low lenovo must do it otherwise it will lose market share
2224779 i like the history of living in it its on a fantastic street
2224780 youve worked so hard to launch and achieve the independence and now youre back there
2224781 generally parents are willing to give the children a good deal
2224782 kids are thrilled because they have the opportunity to own something they otherwise wouldnt
2224783 citibank was one of the largest firms in this business but certainly not the only firm
2224784 since the beginning of the auction rate securities crisis citi has worked diligently with issuers investors and regulatory authorities to obtain liquidity for holders of illiquid auction rate securities
2224785 we remain committed to continuing our work on initiatives that will secure the best and fastest route to providing liquidity to our clients

2224793 sump pumps wear out dry out overheat lose lubrication or blow a circuit if put on the same one as another major appliance
2224794 how nice is your basement what is six inches of water going to do to you
2224795 its really kind of a tale of two industries at present
2224796 value and convenience retailing is doing better than the rest of the industry
2224797 its very day to day and as a general rule theres no conviction from investors one way or the other
2224798 you cant even get an agreement as to whether were in a recession right now and the stock market reflects that uncertainty
2224799 if i were to go out and chase this customer i would change my advertising
2224800 i would try to convince these consumers if you want to get a deal were the one place to go
2224801 clear price leadership position continues to meet the needs of our customers in a difficult economy
2224802 youre looking at a few people who got in at the beginning of the year and made a lot of money
2224803 and the unfortunate part is that wall street distorts things
2224804 the program will come to a halt thats bad for everyone concerned including us
2224805 the amount of e mails i get goes up whenever theres a spate of advertising about fios
2224806 in suburban areas its relatively easier to install because youre not working on busy city streets

2224810 right up until yesterday morning we were still hopeful that we could craft a solution that would meet with the approval of the banks
2224811 however despite all our efforts we just werent able to bring it across the line i didnt expect to be told what i was told yesterday afternoon
2224812 once again i am so sorry that we werent able to nail the plan we announced in january time was against us despite everyones best efforts we just couldnt get enough of the turnaround happening fast enough
2224813 it appears the banks debt will not be paid from the sale of the assets
2224814 the banks will suffer a substantial deficiency and therefore theres no chance of creditors getting a dividend hence shareholders will not have any liklehood of a return
2224815 there are no plans for major structural changes to the business while the sale process is underway
2224816 i told my dad and my dad said there wasnt much we could do

2224820 the key to success in coaching is not the coach it is the person being coached
2224821 the key to success in leadership is not the leader it is the people he or she gets to lead
2224822 i cannot promise to do everything that you suggest i can promise to listen to your ideas think about them and do what i can i can not promise to always succeed i wont i can promise to try

2224824 how many minutes did you waste tody on the internet
2224825 brett we werent expecting you to change your mind but now that you have welcome back come on up it will be great to work with you again
2224826 look 17 years is probably enough you never want to overstay your welcome you want to go out at or near the top of your game and be remembered for that youth and hipness matter in this business and im not young and hip any more so this seems like a good plan that still keeps me here for five more years and after that i can slow down do some clubs do some specials do some volunteer work and enjoy my life and my family i dont need the money certainly
2224827 now as i suggested the right way to have done this would have been to have a couple of transition years in which both men played but the team was gradually reoriented to being built around favre to being built around rodgers

2224834 is strengthening our nations energy security and supporting americans farming communities
2224835 greatly disappointed with the epas inability to look past the good intentions of this policy to see the significant harm it is doing to farmers ranchers and american households for the epa to assert that this federal mandate is not affecting food prices not only goes against common sense but every americans grocery bill
2224836 america should be focusing on viable clean energy solutions like conservation solar and wind
2224837 instead the misguided corn ethanol mandate is forcing farmers to plow up marginal land and wildlife habitat while increasing global warming and dumping toxic fertilizers and pesticides into our precious water sources
2224838 so that is going to be a key element for the future
2224839 would have sabotaged the development and growth of new technologies and a cellulosic biofuels industry
2224840 the debt has increased our risk of being held hostage by foreign lenders
2224841 our situation is serious and it is deteriorating with the passage of time

2224850 you can start out with a 25 cent cpm and have it bumped up to a dollar because it becomes rich media so having that much functionality without the ad serving costs was pretty big
2224851 josh has exactly the right combination of skills and experience for inform he knows the media industry and he knows the role technology can play in helping transform traditional businesses he understands our offering and the challenges our clients are trying to meet
2224852 im excited to be part of a company that has been able to provide so much value both in increased user engagement and improved site monetization to such an impressive list of authoritative media clients the semantic web is becoming increasingly recognized as a critical component of a successful web strategy and inform is on the leading edge of the space

2224856 it is interesting to observe leaders in emerging technology firms during recessionary times our experience shows that a majority of our clients are taking steps to re energise and re focus their business in certain areas
2224857 technology firms of all sizes are focused on reducing their recession exposures and our experience reflects a growing trend of small emerging technology firms seeking assistance from their insurance and risk advisors to help them manage risks during the recession

2224865 about a year ago we became convinced that the rdf data model and linked data techniques offered the first pragmatic solution to the historical data silo problem of unconnected data
2224866 the only missing piece was how to bring context to that data and so we started the umbel project
2224867 the umbel project with its need to capture the open world aspects of the web has brought a fresh perspective and set of challenges to cyc
2224868 we are excited by the release and committed to supporting umbel as part of our overall web relevance strategy
2224869 we see umbel as a useful gateway to the more sophisticated reasoning and other tools surrounding cyc
2224870 the participation and responsiveness of cycorp and the cyc foundation have been absolutely essential to the quality of umbel
2224871 umbel is a major addition to the burgeoning linked data web
2224872 it provides a coherent data dictionary that meshes naturally with the dbpedia project openlink co founded nearly two years ago
2224873 this data dictionary orientation of umbel also increases the palatability of linked data to the closed world realm of enterprise data spaces reducing the pain associated with the timeless quest for data integration
2224874 distilling subject concepts from opencyc vol b1 overview and methodology
2224875 this is what being a true aggregator library and community is all about
2224876 when people think of a true 21st century library they think of all media all knowledge and ease of access in one convenient place this is what we are building at secondbrain not simply a lifestream or a broken collection of meaningless links but an actual next millennium library the largest one of its kind in the world
2224877 today were calling on industry higher education and people from around the world to get involved and share their ideas and expertise as we collectively explore and design future directions for the web
2224878 you dont have to be a software engineer to get involved and you dont have to program everyone is welcome to participate
2224879 our goal is to bring even more people to the table and provoke thought facilitate discussion and inspire future design directions for firefox the mozilla project and the web as a whole
2224880 with a problem like designing the browser of the future we werent even sure where to start
2224881 the evolution of the browser seemed to be intimately intertwined with the evolution of the web and to some extent the underlying internet itself plus we had to account for trends in general computing technologies smaller faster powerful more connected and ubiquitous devices enabling new kinds of interactions and applications
2224882 so my junior year of high school i attended a semester long program in leadville colorado its called high mountain institute rocky mountain semester this experience essentially changed my life in many ways and helped me look at the world differently rocky mountain semester gives junior students a chance to spend 4 5 months in the mountains of colorado canyons of utah and wyoming it combines rigorous academics with backpacking
2224883 how are they going to find a way to lose this one
2224884 we couldnt take incoming calls so we could not take any bookings the salon is dependent on calls coming through and clients being able to book appointments
2224885 we also couldnt accept credit cards and were having to turn clients away most of our clients would normally pay by card cash is a thing of the past
2224886 this is a particularly busy time for us with people on holiday we are lucky that we have a lot of loyal clients who we trust to come back with cash
2224887 my husband had been taken into hospital and i have a 90 year old mother in glasgow who i call at the same time every day so i had to keep in touch
2224888 many of my neighbours were cut off too but weve all been left in the dark over what has happened im hoping i will be reimbursed for my mobile phone bill
2224889 it was really annoying on wednesday we could phone in but we couldnt dial out then it died completely again all my neighbours were affected its never been down for such a long time
2224890 if incidents occur we have a clear process for quickly despatching highly qualified engineers on site due to the complexity of the fault it took us longer than expected to restore services
2224891 the percentage of internet users who use search engines on a typical day is just under one half 49
2224892 thus making it easy for a user to turn to the internet find answers to a question
2224893 it is a practised routine i must have issued many thousands of briefings over the years
2224894 didnt the knowledge that people routinely go to the far side of the lake make you complacent
2224895 i then wanted to get to the shore as quickly as possible my wife was screaming because she felt very unsafe
2224896 there is virtually no part of the prosecution case that has been left undamaged and there is compelling evidence to show that the appellant played no part in the robbery
2224897 only witness to the robbery who was able to give any description of any of the men
2224898 we do so recognising the tenacity with which this appellant has fought to overturn this conviction
2224899 it may be suggested in some way that this itself should cause us to doubt the safety of the conviction
2224900 who estimated that a good laugh produces an increase in heart rate that is equivalent to ten minutes on a rowing machine
2224901 a couple of hunters are out in the woods when one of them falls to the ground
2224902 just take it easy i can help first lets make sure hes dead
2224903 my wife is pregnant and her contractions are only two minutes apart
2224904 whenever i drink coffee i have this sharp excruciating pain
2224905 it seems that the local village hall committee has taken matters into their own hands and applied for planning permission to erect houses on the existing car park thereby closing what has become an established right of way and potentially causing major traffic problems on an adjoining service road
2224906 weve been in the process for about 11 years of trying to rebuild our village hall
2224907 its a big hall and a big project which will cost approximately 850 000
2224908 thats not really recursive gt its building an external variable
2224909 part of it is the way we see ourselves but its also how other people see us
2224910 historically weve been denied our manhood so we really want to cling to it as soon as boys are able to walk we call them little man anything that threatens that manhood we dont want
2224911 we know that the rate of suicide is going up in the black community
2224912 and studies show that one of the ways depression manifests itself is through aggression
2224913 if you feel like your life is not worth much then the lives of other people arent worth much either and you behave in a way thats not responsible
2224914 im not saying that depression robs you of discerning right and wrong
2224915 im saying if youre looking for causes dont overlook depression
2224916 im calling from company a and weve seen an improvement in feature b with companies like yours
2224917 its reaching a situation where the people of west dunbartonshire will be recognised in other areas because they glow in the dark owing to the number of these masts
2224918 the proliferation of masts is disgraceful we should be getting in touch with dog breeders to ask them to develop a dog not just to herd cows and sheep but to herd phone masts as well
2224919 were now into the 3g system and because the signal is very intense the signal area is reduced which will create even more masts
2224920 these are not just to facilitate verbal communication but are for music downloads and picture transfers they are not necessary
2224921 the health and safety executive is sitting on the fence its saying that it cant be proved that these masts are injurious to health but it cant be proved that theyre not
2224922 for planning authorities the grounds for refusal are very narrow these phone companies are pushing against an open door
2224923 the interests of new labour and big business have prevailed and it appears commercial interest has taken over
2224924 we dont want something like this here its right across from the five a side pitch theres already one at the back of the keep pub
2224925 from what weve heard its very hard to get planning permission for these stopped but we will certainly be putting in an objection
2224926 in december we began offering drm free audio downloads on the amazon mp3 digital music store which allows every track and album purchased to be playable on practically any digital music device including ipods extending this strategy warner music has announced a series of mp3 deals in recent months with partners who have agreed to support our product management strategy and product innovation initiatives including walmart napster and seven digital
2224927 overall total quarterly digital revenue grew 39 to 166 million or 20 of total revenue up from 119 million or 15 of total revenue in the prior year quarter approximately 65 of our total digital revenue was generated in the u s and 35 in the rest of the world online continues to be the primary growth driver of our digital business globally while mobile remains soft in the u s with flat ringtone sales
2224928 i think what we need to be very careful of is that the recorded music industry and the music publishing industry do not allow an ecosystem to occur where we are not properly compensated if i use the analogy of mtv 25 years ago or even apple five years ago those are two ecosystems that from whom people other then the recorded music have derived the majority of the value created in that ecosystem that i think is the state we are currently in with activision and harmonic where the amount being paid to the music industry even though their games are entirely dependent on the content we own and control is far too small and i think the industry as a whole needs to take a very different look at this business and participate more fully and in a much more partnership way with both our artists and with the games manufacturers than is currently the case and if that does not become the case as far as warner music is concerned we will not license to those games the actual royalty derived for the use of the song or the royalty derived from the download of the song remain in my estimation far below what their true value is
2224929 i don t think there is anything structural other than timing as a large part i guess i would say a couple of things one wireless is a more is a much broader model in europe for internet access rather than online itunes which has led the digital business in the u s was first introduced here several years before it was introduced in europe number one and number two is much more of an online business than a wireless business so you have a sort of structural issue which is much less online access in europe versus the u s and therefore less itunes buying because of the nature of the internet access model in europe a and b itunes introduction in europe is several years behind the introduction in the u s
2224930 in december we began offering drm free audio downloads on the amazon mp3
2224931 online continues to be the primary growth driver of our digital business globally while mobile remains soft in the u s with flat ringtone sales
2224932 we are growing the most where the pricepoint was created with regard to how much the consumer wants to spend we are flat in the area where our greedy asses set the pricepoint
2224933 i think what we need to be very careful of is that the recorded music industry and the music publishing industry do not allow an ecosystem to occur where we are not properly compensated
2224934 we could totally have bungled this up too had we been given the chance
2224935 and i think the industry as a whole needs to take a very different look at this business and participate more fully and in a much more partnership way with both our artists and with the games manufacturers than is currently the case
2224936 this is the chance i have been waiting for if i didnt think i could run near the sharp end i wouldnt be doing it but a limited budget always seemed to hold me back
2224937 i have watched mark over the past two years at the tt and could see he had what it takes but just didnt have the support needed to achieve the results he is capable of
2224938 hopefully now we can give mark this chance and both him and our company will become more prominent in 2009
2224939 now i have new machinery i am confident i can better my results
2224940 i would like to thank mr ismail for the much needed support he and the company are giving me
2224941 this is a huge blow especially as it will have a knock on effect on other funding
2224942 parents of children with special needs go through enough of a struggle getting services jigsaw is somewhere they can come and say they need help with their child and get it we are open to everyone
2224943 the cut would mean really drastic changes we have cut back enough and are not prepared to cut back any more
2224944 the service we provide helps alleviate some of the pressure on social work if we dont provide the service parents will expect the hours to be put in elsewhere and its going to come out of the same budget
2224945 we take them out into the community to take part in activities that other young people do its about giving them opportunity to socialise if this stops then they will miss out on that important social interaction
2224946 parents would be devastated without this service there is nothing for children in general and especially for children with special needs who are wheelchair bound and cannot speak
2224947 amber is mentally and physically disabled she cannot speak or walk she has got so much confidence from going to jigsaw when she leaves on the bus and when she comes home she is so happy this is breaking my heart
2224948 the group was not informed of the budget arrangements before the start of the financial year as it did not submit its proposals for 2008 09 until april
2224949 the council supports a range of voluntary groups and reviews the funding to the groups each year to ensure that the funds continue to be used to best effect this has meant some reduction in the funding to jigsaw in line with service priorities across the council area
2224950 i dont normally come that road but i was on my way home from the supermarket and decided to go down that way to see how they were getting on with the building of the new development in dumbarton
2224951 i couldnt believe it when i saw the roundabout its an absolute disaster the grass has never been cut this season and the weeds are full height the gravel is also covered with weeds
2224952 it used to be kept very tidy but now its just an eyesore and no one seems to be doing anything about it
2224953 you see men cutting the grass all the time and the rest seems to be kept tidy but not this the road up to it and the roundabout are a mess
2224954 all that money was spent on the sculpture and this was supposed to be the gateway to the national park its a disgrace
2224955 and im always proud to take any visitors up the a82 to show them the lochside but i wouldnt take anyone past stoneymollan right now id be too ashamed its a total embarrassment
2224956 west dunbartonshire used to be renowned for its beautiful roundabouts but people are talking about this one for all the wrong reasons
2224957 we have been in discussions with transport scotland about urgent maintenance needed for the roundabout as a result transport scotland has instructed amey highways to visit the site today with the intention of tidying the roundabout this week
2224958 transport scotland has also asked amey to consider improving the soft landscaping in the long run
2224959 the national park authority is keen to investigate further long term improvements to the roundabout to make stoneymollan a suitable gateway to the national park
2224960 if she appears to be gaunt its really just that shes muscular and ripped shes a powerhouse she has to keep up her rigorous touring schedule
2224961 just take a look at her shes doing it right
2224962 when asked about the drugs on tape he told police he had placed the farmfoods bag containing the amphetamine behind the tv unit in the living room and that he had been told it was half a kilo of amphetamine
2224963 he also told police he had been paid 50 to hold it until someone contacted him to uplift it
2224964 he told police he was a speed junkie and the other amount had been for his own use
2224965 he suffered a relapse and accrued debts to his drug supplier
2224966 on this particular date the dealer attended at mr turners house with a view to being paid the outstanding money mr turner advised he was not in a position to pay that outstanding debt
2224967 the supplier said he could pay off the debt and also be paid 50 if he took possession of these drugs and also delivered them
2224968 it was wrong to take possession of the drugs and he attributes the reason for having done as that he was suffering from drug addiction and not thinking clearly
2224969 i accept he has an extensive record there is one analogous previous conviction which dates back to 1997 and that was a class a drug matter
2224970 the nursery staff would like to thank beverly for kindly offering to contribute to this special day
2224971 because home workers telecommunication needs are not strictly personal nor precisely business based providers have a difficult time creating a product strategy for these consumers
2224972 workers in the corporate setting have been spoiled by access to blazing fast t 1 lines for quite some time and are in for a shock when they first try to get anything done over the web with services like comparatively pokey dsl
2224973 i have been impressed by the personal commitment of the trainees who had secured full time work
2224974 the single outcome agreement we have signed signals a new relationship between the government and west dunbartonshire council
2224975 we managed to get close enough to hold down the wire with a piece of wood but the only way i could then get her out was to grab one of her paws and pull her through the wire
2224976 i have seen gulls take ducklings before but never a kitten what makes this worse is that i was keeping an eye on the litter of kittens of which blackie was one i was waiting until the wee cats were a tiny bit older and weaned from the mother
2224977 at that point we would have removed them and rehomed them this is one of the ways we look after the cat population on the base we need the cats as theyre great wee hunters
2224978 weve had a pretty good weekend and as always its been a pleasure working with the guys from the team who did me proud
2224979 to finish just one second off the pace of the first three drivers in a car thats five years old is exceptional in our eyes
2224980 were really pleased with the performance weve shown again my best lap was actually only nine tenths of a second off the quickest done by fabrizio giovanardi thats a good feeling
2224981 we cant wait for knockhill its going to be huge for us and were going to be giving it our all to achieve our best results of the season
2224982 were planning to have plenty of guests there and hopefully well have some potential sponsors there too as were trying to secure further backing to help carry the team through into the 2009 championship
2224983 i think all of us think that we could make great parents but we could make better parents if we waited
2224984 you take out your emotions and your stresses on the ones you love the most i didnt mean to take it out on austin but he was there he was there to listen
2224985 if you are not sexually active i would stay abstinent and if you are not you have to use the proper birth control
2224986 if you do become pregnant you have to stay in school
2224987 just because someone has done something wrong doesnt mean that they get the death penalty
2224988 what steps the army will take to ensure this will not happen again
2224989 thats not what our countrys about theres a problem with the system in the army and we can blame the sergeant or the corporal at the greenspoint facility but it sounds like theyre also hearing it from nationally
2224990 we found a lot of subversive literature in urdu and arabic urging muslims to join a jihad we also found a diary with names and phone numbers of people from across the border
2224991 we established that the accused were active simi members as their bank accounts were receiving funds from the simi unit in delhi and bihar we showed simis links across the border and its activities inside the country we had shown how educated youngsters had been imparted training in making bombs we had solid evidence which would stand in any court and thats why most of the accused got convicted in the case
2224992 the outfit has been a big threat to our internal security at least thats what i found when i prepared the report
2224993 barangsiapa membaca pada pagi hari dan sore hari selama bulan rajab kalimat
2224994 ada lima malam yang mana allah taala tidak akan menolak doa yang dipanjatkan kepadanya di malam malam tersebut yaitu malam pertama di bulan rajab malam nisfu syaban malam jumat malam ied al fitri dan ied al adha
2224995 rajab adalah bulannya allah syaban adalah bulanku dan ramadhan adalah bulan ummatku
2224996 its exciting because weve found a compound in nature that may one day surpass a currently marketed drug or could become the structural template for rationally designed drugs with improved selectivity

2225007 the company also proposes a zune like feature that would allow iphone and ipod touch users to directly access media items stored on neighboring devices using peer to peer connectivity
2225008 in the peer to peer environment one mobile device can communicate with one or more other electronic devices whether mobile or stationary in the immediate vicinity data sharing can be performed when such communication is available
2225009 of wires which can flex up to 40 percent without putting any significant strain on the pixels the wires absorb the bulk of the stress
2225010 using simple mechanics principles the researchers have produced for the first time electronic devices on a hemispherical surface so that they can take images much like those captured by the human eye
2225011 researchers are testing the same design principles in a range of other applications including as a thin conformable monitor to detect electrical signals traveling across the undulating surface of the human brain
2225012 nearly any class of semiconductor electronic device for a range of functions such as sensing actuating and computing
2225013 we believe that some of the most compelling areas of future application involve the intimate conformal integration of electronics with the human body in ways that are inconceivable using established technologies
2225014 we are working actively with collaborators to explore possibilities in advanced health monitors prosthetic devices and therapeutic systems

2225025 i was taking the staff out for a treat there were seven of us we went for a meal and couple of drinks
2225026 we went to oceana and i have worked there myself six years ago as a doorman when it was ritzy
2225027 they just said we were not allowed in with visible tattoos we just went somewhere else i know not to kick up a fuss
2225028 there were ladies with us as well we didnt look like troublemakers
2225029 i kind of felt degraded i had my armani suit on and it was a hot night so i took my jacket off and a short sleeve shirt
2225030 i have got a full sleeve and there is nothing offensive on it its tasteful
2225031 for someone to turn around and say im not good enough its discriminatory are they going to turn someone away for being fat or having religious clothing
2225032 its unbelievable i have been in many times and my tattoos have been visible i have eaten there in the day its just not consistent
2225033 i think about 60 of the premier league players have half or full sleeves tattoos would they turn away david beckham or angelina jolie
2225034 within seven days the facebook page had got 2 500 members
2225035 we do not operate a specific rigid policy concerning customers with tattoos or any form of body art
2225036 any decision to refuse entry to a customer is reached on an individual basis and considers a variety of factors such as age sobriety and appearance
2225037 there was a rumour flying around this afternoon wednesday 6 august on a local radio station and ongoing claiming that two men were arrested today for the double murder of the mullanys after their girlfriends turned them in
2225038 for the record this is absolutely false no one is arrested or in custody for these murders or any other murder
2225039 this was a truly tragic case where two young animals suffered immensely for a long period of time yet the suffering was entirely preventable
2225040 i would urge anyone in a similar situation struggling to cope with an animal to seek help before things get completely out of hand as they did in this case
2225041 no one should ever be embarrassed about asking for help it is the right thing to do
2225042 there are numerous animal welfare charities that are on hand to give advice and support sitting back and allowing animals to suffer is simply not an option
2225043 similarly i would urge anyone who has suspicions of animals suffering silently in their area to please contact the rspca
2225044 the driver is a patient of ours and is unwell he was parking
2225045 i think he was coming in he was running into a disabled space and has gone forward over the pavement
2225046 those who were working the building heard the bang the doctor working in the room next door felt the bang
2225047 obviously the driver was very shaken he is okay the car was not that badly damaged either
2225048 its every practice managers nightmare from the clinical governance point of view its very worrying

2225061 el muchacho ha pasado por tiempos dif ciles en cuanto a los contactos desde espa a pero una vez conoci mi posici n se calm
2225062 los aficionados tienen que entender es muy dif cil para un joven tener la tentaci n de todo ese dinero
2225063 ahora podemos enterrar esto se acab y el muchacho es un jugador del manchester united y eso es lo m s importante
2225064 antes de que salgan los rumores diciendo que jugar contra mi voluntad quiero aclarar que quien diga eso est mintiendo
2225065 jugar para el manchester con toda mi alma y coraz n pelear y har honor a esa camiseta con el mismo compromiso y dedicaci n de siempre
2225066 yo fui el nico en expresar p blicamente mi deseo de ir al real madrid termin siendo de manera involuntaria el responsable de las malas relaciones entre ambos clubes
2225067 supe que real madrid estaba interesado en contratarme y que supuestamente hab an hecho una oferta muy grande a manchester united
2225068 i believe that man is about to learn tha the most practical life is the moral life and that the moral life is the only road to survival he is beginning to learn tah the will either share part of his material wealth or lose all of it that he will respect and learn to live with other political ideologies if he wants civilization to go on this is the kind of argument that mans actual experience equips him to understand and accept this is the low road to morality there is no other
2225069 people do the best with what they know how to do
2225070 the problem is that with all the great minds that focus on the issue none can figure out what the problem is
2225071 we dont know when we will know smart people are working on it
2225072 on both sides we have been unable to trace the cause
2225073 although we were not able to test these payloads in space nasa achieved success in these two low cost missions by rapidly pulling together expertise
2225074 its not just high property prices we will be dependent on loans and right now they are prohibitively expensive
2225075 i think everyone will now focus on property bought by actual users rather than speculators
2225076 before record breaking speed can be achieved on a sustainable basis
2225077 it is up to us to carry on the mission of the church
2225078 it acknowledges that god is in charge around here and when we dedicate a building we acknowledge the presence of god
2225079 crude prices have fallen more than 25us per barrel in three weeks yet motorists on the north coast have seen practically no fall in local petrol prices
2225080 this is exactly why the petrol commissioner was appointed and families on the north coast are today looking to pat walker to pull the oil companies into line
2225081 if the petrol commissioner does not have the powers he needs to deliver fairer prices for north coast families and i suspect he does not then he should call the assistant treasurer today and demand stronger powers
2225082 the department of state and regional developments export manager also offered the company expert advice on exporting its products
2225083 the love care and attention people get here they go out of their way

2225088 thats the way god made us we have to move on
2225089 as we leave the work of prayer for the work of charity in our world
2225090 i cant believe how many people come to see this
2225091 they came to my house singing political songs they stole everything in my house raped me and killed four people in my neighbours house
2225092 we are in a situation where the pain and the trauma is beyond comprehension i am here talking for women with wounded genital organs who cannot even sit on a chair to talk
2225093 the accounts of politically motivated gang rape severing of limbs and practices of sexual slavery are not individual offences these are crimes against humanity
2225094 we believe that the members of mugabes inner circle who turned the zanu pf youth militia into rapists and killers are responsible
2225095 cern lab set for beam milestone the most powerful physics experiment ever built the lhc will re create the conditions present in the universe just after the big bang

2225098 garrys life was taken so needlessly and you never get over that

2225100 theres nothing to look forward to personally i live from one day to the next
2225101 my life is very lonely a jigsaw piece is missing
2225102 when the first of august came last week it was a huge reality check i have been on automatic pilot
2225103 los van het feit dat iedereen er ook priv steeds vaker mee geconfronteerd wordt is het met name de diversiteit in bedrijven en personen waarmee ik dagelijks te maken heb wat mijn job zo interessant maakt
2225104 let us clearly remember that by the serious nature of our republican presidents illness the healing process will indeed be long
2225105 the condition of mwanawasa continues to improve the doctors treating mwanawasa are satisfied with the steady progress he is making in his recovery
2225106 you can have any color you want as long as it is black
2225107 that we experience during our parenting as we move our children through the phases of parenting
2225108 i do not think that this is the end of the farc i do not think that the farcs days are numbered
2225109 they have a fight that will last for a long time
2225110 if you hear shots in the night pow pow pow dont leave your hammock everything will be okay
2225111 the seizure of power by force is to be rejected
2225112 our original aims are still valid because he may be re elected in 2011
2225113 can you assert the contrary now nobody knows in a clear way what is going to happen and this is a source of great anxiety and uncertainty
2225114 we dont know exactly what they have in mind it has been their custom to manage this country in a secret way mimicking a gang more than a responsible government
2225115 i dont think that this young man from the popular point of view has any chance to rule egypt this is clear but from the authorities point of view the issue is different
2225116 we continue to be very concerned about finding a resolution in western sahara
2225117 finally an agreement had been reached to resolve a government in crisis
2225118 clubs are sympathetic to our cause and im grateful to the likes of norwich manager glenn roeder and bristol city boss gary johnson
2225119 ive said to the players that im not bothered about rotherham and bournemouth if we go about our jobs with the right attitude it is down to us
2225120 its still very hard to accept that gavins not here the plans are to make sure that this doesnt happen again
2225121 we are going down a few avenues at the moment with my lawyers its got to be started now with gavins death because its gone on too long
2225122 im really angry because hes lost his life for nothing theyve let him down theyve let me down theyve let his sister down all the family are devastated
2225123 the army does not allow or condone any form of physical activity to be used for disciplinary purposes

2225125 during 2007 08 nswfb firefighters responded to 4449 residential fires of which 2180 began in the kitchen
2225126 in the first two months of winter this year there have already been 378 kitchen fires
2225127 winter can be a particularly bad time for kitchen fires with the colder weather bringing with it increased cooking activities in the home
2225128 fires can start from causes as simple as burnt toast or pots of oil left on a hotplate
2225129 the majority of all kitchen fires begin from cooking being left unattended on the stove
2225130 the other most common causes included mechanical failure and appliances accidentally being turned on or not switched off at the power point more often than not these types of incidents are preventable
2225131 its in the interest of every household to take simple safety steps in the kitchen to help keep their families and home safe such as turning off hotplates rather than leaving cooking unattended and ensuring appliances are switched off after use
2225132 its wonderful how international events like the olympics and the paralympics can help motivate kids to get active and to have fun
2225133 part of the olympic spirit is about getting people together and participating in sports and recreational activities and thats what the aasc program has done for thousands of kids around australia
2225134 the olympic and paralympic games inspire kids of all backgrounds this gets kids watching thinking and talking about sport and motivates them to get out there and be active
2225135 nsw has joined progressive jurisdictions around the world in committing to placing cigarettes out of sight in retail outlets research has proven the power of display to initiate impulse buying and that is the reason why these displays have become so prominent
2225136 placing cigarettes out of sight will be a powerful disincentive to children and will also help smokers of all ages who are trying to quit
2225137 ama nsw also welcomes the ban on smoking in cars carrying children the confined space of a car means young lungs can inhale high concentrations of tobacco smoke
2225138 smoking remains the leading preventable cause of death and disease in australia and the harm caused by smoking far outweighs arguments against further restrictions on tobacco products
2225139 west wales is the first part of the country to go digital and wales will be the first country in the uk to complete the digital process
2225140 many many people across west wales have already gone digital
2225141 that leaves us with a small minority of people who may need help to go digital and were here to help them
2225142 the recent uncertainty in the debt markets has resulted in unexpected delays in our ability to secure the financing for the transaction
2225143 we are impressed by the results of our due diligence investigation of netmanage and their strong fourth quarter 2007 results we stand behind our offer and continue to be optimistic about obtaining financing for the acquisition of netmanage
2225144 the recent uncertainty in the debt markets has resulted in unexpected delays

2225155 i thought cerys had broken her arm she was very upset she screamed and then she went quiet she was shaking
2225156 but the lunchbox had protected her body by cushioning the force of the bricks and saved her from serious injury or even death
2225157 later i realised if i wasnt there god knows what would have happened
2225158 the child was carried into the play scheme by her mother staff provided the mother and the girl with support and advised her to take the girl to hospital the wall does not belong to the school but to a nearby house
2225159 our marriage was horrendous most of the time after we split he phoned me and said he wanted to do a deal with selling the business
2225160 he had been to see an accountant but the way he did it was all wrong i said it was about time we stopped arguing and started behaving like adults
2225161 that was when i met him in the pub and he showed me the rope
2225162 as we made our way back to our cars he opened the boot and said theres my rope thats what im going to kill myself with
2225163 i told him to grow up and give me the rope but he just laughed
2225164 he would say suicidal thoughts but i never actually believed that he would do anything it was always a cry for help with gerald thats why i find it hard to believe this time around
2225165 gerald created the debt because he always said if i left him he would leave me with nothing
2225166 uniting homeboys and homegirls from every walk of life together we can

2225171 i want to start a new quest for my site please take keen interest in with the charm
2225172 it shall be known that in 2008 the world will be blessed
2225173 its a light hearted ad that pokes fun at him
2225174 the antichrist isnt going to be an american so it cant possibly be obama the bible makes it clear he will be from an obscure place like romania
2225175 short of 666 they used every single symbol of the antichrist in this ad
2225176 there are way too many things to just be coincidence
2225177 the share of our take home pay we will be allowed to keep under an obama administration
2225178 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future
2225179 we thought lets try and start a movement where even while walking down the street people would hold up the o and you would know that they were for obama
2225180 o lord how long will this b sh go on
2225181 im a zero hes a zero wouldnt you like to be a zero too
2225182 obama see the sun really does rise and set in my
2225183 i see a blue moon risin i see trouble on the way
2225184 it might be time tone it down a few notches
2225185 darlington football club couldnt stand in tommys way this is a great opportunity for him we wish him well
2225186 super heavyweight david price is on good form at the moment but i certainly wouldnt have chosen for him to meet the russian world number one islam timurziev in his first fight
2225187 joeys fine but he wont be featuring in any games until we get him match fit
2225188 he came back in for training last wednesday as we flew out to mallorca but theres no way he can regain match fitness between now and the start of the season
2225189 theres no way it would be sensible to give him a game at the moment even though with the injuries weve got you would like to throw him in
2225190 hes a fairly naturally fit lad but hes four or five weeks away from a game and well have to monitor that because thats if he doesnt have any set backs so it will be a month into the season before joey is knocking on the firstteam squads door to either sit on the bench or play
2225191 joey has been working very hard on a fitness programme and he is just getting his head down which is what he has done ever since i came back into this club
2225192 his training and everything his attitude has been excellent while ive been at this club ive spoken to him and know he just wants to get back to playing football its as simple as that
2225193 we are forging a commercial tie up with the club
2225194 we are hoping to be a strategic partner of newcastle united in the far east
2225195 weve had some inquires from villa over the last few days
2225196 and theyve come up with an offer we think is acceptable to us sometimes an offer can be one that makes it very difficult to turn down
2225197 nothing has gone through yet so i dont want to talk too prematurely about anything but lukes down there having talks and i would imagine undergoing a medical and we wait to see what happens
2225198 until everythings sorted out i dont want to talk about luke in the past tense as hes still our player at this moment in time but its important that if he does move on were able to replace him very quickly
2225199 i know that come next saturday well have a strong team and strong squad you learn very quickly as a manager that you have to deal with these events calmly and quickly
2225200 it would be easy for people to get jittery at this time and to panic but im very pleased with where were at
2225201 recently we ran an ad about mr obamas campaign rhetoric being as shallow as paris hilton ms hilton took umbrage at this characterization and in retrospect we think she has a point our next ad will point out that mr obama is actually way shallower
2225202 a board game is basically a story that youre telling around the table together in this case its a murder mystery
2225203 so whats the pacing how nervous should you be how much time do people have because we know that people have less time now than they did before
2225204 it oddly took a very long time to get the proportions of the baseball bat right the handle versus the knob versus the thickness my engineer was ready to kill me because i kept sending him back to trim another millimeter off the barrel
2225205 i did something magnificent and mysterious and i got a why
2225206 and the beauty of it is that i dont have a why
2225207 each day is like a work of art to him
2225208 we cant permit people to endanger themselves and the public
2225209 i think objectively we can say that the chinese authorities have done everything that is feasible and humanly possible to solve the situation
2225210 i dont have many friends so its always been really important to me to have a girlfriend to be honest i wish life were more like the video games because then id always get the girl
2225211 i have completely made up my mind to try to stay away from anything like a boyfriend attachment
2225212 people dont have the management skills they dont have good land they dont have good markets to sell their products
2225213 well apply fungicides insecticides pesticides because beans are very delicate
2225214 not by their own farm but by off farm employment
2225215 we deeply believe that if we can get our farmers to connect to the market they will be capable of growth sustainable growth
2225216 they will be capable of not being farmers anymore but agricultural entrepreneurs
2225217 i dont think weve ever seen the kind of stress put on the industry and im including the time after 9 11
2225218 one day this last june the price of oil shot up 11 a barrel in about an hour and a half for us thats 80 million
2225219 the average fare has been up this summer as much as 15 percent year over year
2225220 the reason that airlines overbook flights is that people dont show up
2225221 if youre one minute late youre not only denied access to the plane but also denied boarding compensation
2225222 plenty of wiggle room for the airlines to cut fares compared to what weve seen in the summer
2225223 you should not be buying unless you know theres a sale
2225224 the most likely candidate to be bumped to not get on that flight but your baggage will
2225225 the average fare has been up this summer as much as 15 percent year over year
2225226 the reason that airlines overbook flights is that people dont show up
2225227 if youre one minute late youre not only denied access to the plane but also denied boarding compensation
2225228 plenty of wiggle room for the airlines to cut fares compared to what weve seen in the summer
2225229 you should not be buying unless you know theres a sale
2225230 the most likely candidate to be bumped to not get on that flight but your baggage will
2225231 we had a bit of a run at it last year but we couldnt quite make it
2225232 well have another shot at it this year as will a few other clubs but it will be difficult
2225233 i think a lot of clubs have made a bit of a statement with some of the signings the likes of tottenham and portsmouth have made some good additions
2225234 aston villa have such a young squad and theyll probably improve year on year
2225235 he has all the qualities needed to assist us next season
2225236 i have made no secret of my wish to add andy johnson to my squad at fulham and i am more than delighted that we have secured his services for the long term
2225237 there has been a lot of speculation regarding this transfer during the last week very little of which has had any foundation
2225238 i am just happy to be able to focus on the positive news that andy johnson is now a fulham player one who we have great hopes for
2225239 step up and do the right thing for their investors
2225240 this was not a mutual mistake by financial services companies this was a deliberate effort to ensnare consumers with great damage
2225241 its obvious in the case of ubs and we have internal documents that prove this that they were well aware of the problems in the marketplace that they manipulated them
2225242 investors have been locked in a nightmare with these securities
2225243 we think that the general market is being moved along by the surprising strength of the dollar which is exacerbating the slide in oil prices so all positive for stocks
2225244 and i think the trend in stocks is up i do feel that july 15 represented the bottom for stocks and we are going to move higher
2225245 the results havent been good but its all about expectations and they could have been much worse than what materialized
2225246 generally the banks that have done relatively well in maintaining profitability are not pure play investment banks
2225247 our conservative funding structure and our position as one of the worlds best capitalized banks remain competitive advantages
2225248 the key for fannie and freddie both and also for banks is do they have the capital to get through the next year or so
2225249 so if they can hold if they are not taken under by a wave of defaults now itll be a good business two years out it looks like they can but there are a lot of negatives out there too
2225250 the housing crisis that we all observe as we drive home every single day continues to strain our results and our capital
2225251 refugees people are calling us refugees i aint no refugee im an american citizen
2225252 you dont pause for dramatic effect have another even more dramatic pause to live like a refugee dont have to live like a refugee
2225253 a most refreshing change from the quotidian brie and chablis fondue one normally encounters at these affairs
2225254 an enchanting concoction id give it both thumbs up but theyre otherwise occupied at the moment
2225255 kinda places one on the horns of a dilemma dudnit
2225256 with the arrival of mark mccammon i couldnt guarantee delroy first team football
2225257 the housing market has returned to earth fast and hard
2225258 the results we have published today demonstrate progress in a number of important areas and it is all the more unsatisfactory therefore that they record a loss as a result of our credit market write downs
2225259 we are determined to ensure that the inherent strengths of the groups diverse business model are not obscured in this way again
2225260 it may have drawn a line under the big credit losses the capital raising is done and there are synergies to come through from abn but the underlying business is reflecting a tough market particularly in the united states
2225261 there are headwinds and theyre not abating at this point but we see business out there to be done with caution
2225262 thank you for having served bastards when even corporations conspire to victimize military families it is clear urgent executive branch action is needed
2225263 if the obama administration wants to make a real difference in the lives of military women he might consider attempting to do something about the pressing problem of conjugal unpleasantness
2225264 i ve spent 18 years following my husband and being told what to do without someone ever asking me how i feel about that
2225265 the concerns about a weakening economy always run to worries about the financials and then you add some negative news to them on their own and youve got what weve got today
2225266 other banks that have sponsored these programs could be under pressure to do something similar
2225267 sends a very compelling message that others should follow citigroups example and do the right thing
2225268 management either seems unaware or unwilling to admit the full level of the companys exposure to risky assets
2225269 things are still deteriorating for aigs assets so its really hard to call a bottom at this point
2225270 our second quarter results were adversely affected by the severe conditions in the housing and credit markets and a very difficult investment environment
2225271 these results do not reflect the earnings power and potential of aigs businesses and it is clear that we have a lot of work to do to restore aigs profitability to where it should be
2225272 citibank was one of the largest firms in this business but certainly not the only firm
2225273 since the beginning of the auction rate securities crisis citi has worked diligently with issuers investors and regulatory authorities to obtain liquidity for holders of illiquid auction rate securities
2225274 we remain committed to continuing our work on initiatives that will secure the best and fastest route to providing liquidity to our clients
2225275 at this point we believe that aig is too big and too complicated for anyone to fully understand and it should be broken up
2225276 we will reassess our views on aig when a strategic plan is unveiled or when the market environment improves
2225277 our goal is straightforward to define aigs vision and determine the optimal portfolio of businesses based on where our true competitive advantages lie
2225278 rebecca was only 24 with her whole life before her a life in which she planned so many things
2225279 the emptiness i have is unbearable becky meant the world to me
2225280 because some of the bargain airlines are charging for overweight luggage we obviously need to make sure that the scales are weighing accurately and that theyre reading correctly
2225281 we immediately put procedures in place where my engineers test these on a daily basis to make sure this cant happen again
2225282 then i will come back when they let me out of prison
2225283 on the sunday morning liam got in the front of the van and saw it on the sun visor
2225284 they put it in a container he got it to a friends house and took a picture of it
2225285 then they put it on the internet and identified it and they took it up to the butterfly park
2225286 it wont necessarily be fatal but it certainly is very painful everyones afraid of the black widow
2225287 i was actually reading a bedtime story to my children up in the bedroom and there was a terrific crash bang and all the lights went out
2225288 my wife who was downstairs doing some ironing said that thered been a big flash in the lounge
2225289 so we ran out and basically went into the car in case the house was on fire or whatever
2225290 explanation of what problems were identified and give the applicant a chance to respond to that
2225291 vendors need to name their products theres no question about that and theres unfortunately product specific taxonomy but broad terms like cloud computing those are canvasses that we should all be able to paint our piece of the mural on
2225292 the application was to protect the use of the term cloud computing as it relates specifically to our offering
2225293 at the time when we announced our solution it was not quite as pervasive a term we sought to protect our intellectual property and we certainly respect the intellectual property of other people and would not infringe on that of others
2225294 design of computer hardware for use in data centers and mega scale computing environments for others
2225295 consulting services for data centers and mega scale computing environments in the fields of design selection implementation customization and use of computer hardware and software systems for others
2225296 if you have a federal registration it gives you some legal presumptions and benefits you dont have otherwise
2225297 youre presumed the nationwide exclusive owner of the goods that you have marks registered for
2225298 mobile devices are expected to continue to become more powerful and communicate at higher speeds eventually giving people the power and functionality of a full desktop
2225299 besides increasing productivity such improvements are rapidly turning cell phones into extensive data reservoirs capable of holding a broad range of personal and organizational information
2225300 an increasing amount of mobile malware has been reported over the past several years which raises concerns for the future particularly when coupled with the recent trend towards establishing a more open system environment for cellular handheld devices
2225301 if citi is able to pull this off the other banks that have sponsored these programs could be under pressure to do something similar
2225302 this is not just a wall street issue this is a main street issue
2225303 we will be working with the other institutional players to bring justice to the situation
2225304 these were conservative investors thats why they bought these securities
2225305 today were facing a host of news reports which do not bode well for stocks prices aig is still in the eye of the storm and then you have wal mart and jobless claims which added to the lack of enthusiasm for stocks
2225306 puts pressure on other players like ubs merrill lynch to do the same thing
2225307 looking ahead based on the current prices for futures commodities the annual inflation rate is likely to remain well above a level consistent
2225308 mr trichet repeatedly stated that the ecb had expected a growth slowdown in the second quarter and that this was in part a correction to the strong growth in the first quarter
2225309 nevertheless the ecb also accepted that the recent slowdown partly reflects a weakening in gdp growth
2225310 companies are continuing to invest in technology to reduce costs and enhance their information technology infrastructures
2225311 our second quarter results were adversely affected by the severe conditions in the housing and credit markets and a very difficult investment environment
2225312 we have a lot of work to do to restore aigs profitability to where it should be
2225313 we are examining every business as well as the assumptions underlying how we do business in the markets where we have a presence
2225314 your avarice your arrogance and your hubris led to your demise
2225315 you could have operated in a legitimate fashion with ncfe but you chose not to
2225316 a religious system that promises happiness and nice things is difficult to reconcile with the faith whose founder had no place to lay his head urged his followers not to store up treasures on earth and called on them to deny themselves and take up a cross of suffering
2225317 my problem with the prosperity gospel movement is that it is too easy to morph into a justification for selfishness and elitism
2225318 nobody wants to be mother teresa but the least we can do is hold her up as an exemplar
2225319 what role does god or your faith play in helping you get through tough financial times
2225320 there is nothing surprising about the fact that nearly 4 out of 5 low income americans regard their faith as a comfort in hard economic times
2225321 i have not seen a scientific poll but observation tells me that people who have little materially seem to trust god more than those who have an abundance
2225322 apparently there are no atheists in foxholes or in recessions
2225323 trust god ask the hard budgetary questions of yourself and your family and make the tough decisions
2225324 one of my favourite clients has got a nice little home in palm beach a castle in england a rather stately home outside of chicago hes got a world class english furniture collection but he knows nothing about wine
2225325 so hell say scotty can you go get me about two thirds white and one third red and heres a six figure allotment to go do that
2225326 wine is the new must have thing of the ultra rich
2225327 nothing says im rich like pulling a 10 000 5 000 cork out of a bottle and in cultures like asia and russia that sort of behaviour is really a part of new wealth
2225328 i never imagined that the wine auction business would be this strong
2225329 when we first started off we had a business plan and within a few months we had to rip it up we were just so exceeding our numbers because of the huge interest there is in wine
2225330 before the first auction we were hoping we could make 500 000 or 1m at an auction
2225331 now weve auctions making 5m 6m 7m and were doing about 10 or 12 auctions a year
2225332 it was in the mid 1970s which was the last time the wine market actually crashed and i think for a lot of people who are very interested in the subject of investing in wine they have never seen that phenomenon
2225333 theres been a long long bull market if you will in wine since that time thats only accelerated in recent years
2225334 with art you can collect it and enjoy it at the same time
2225335 unless you are into the pleasures of simply looking at bottles the only way to enjoy a wine collection is to open the bottles and consume whats inside so you have just destroyed the value if you will of that particular piece of your collection
2225336 the expensive thing when you bought wine was not the liquid it was the bottle
2225337 and up to 1840 or 1850 no matter how expensive the wine was the bottle was always worth more
2225338 domaine de la roman e conti one of the best red burgundies if you can find a case for 2005 now apparently it will cost you 70 000 for that case
2225339 we will try and make sure that the market is a bit more fair than simply one person having complete control and using it as a commodity really as opposed to various bottles of slightly intoxicating fermented grape juice which is really what we are talking about in the end
2225340 brett we werent expecting you to change your mind but now that you have welcome back come on up it will be great to work with you again
2225341 look 17 years is probably enough you never want to overstay your welcome you want to go out at or near the top of your game and be remembered for that youth and hipness matter in this business and im not young and hip any more so this seems like a good plan that still keeps me here for five more years and after that i can slow down do some clubs do some specials do some volunteer work and enjoy my life and my family i dont need the money certainly
2225342 now as i suggested the right way to have done this would have been to have a couple of transition years in which both men played but the team was gradually reoriented to being built around favre to being built around rodgers
2225343 yeah programming is hard but it doesnt have to be as hard as it is
2225344 so we picked five or six really hot locations in the bronx and went to visit them and two turned out to be turf fields
2225345 i dont think anyone in our industry would suggest its a good idea to play on a surface thats that hot
2225346 just as coaches have to reschedule games due to rain when they play on grass fields
2225347 if theyre unsafe i want to know im mean im personally interested because i have permits for these fields
2225348 to give more representative data on exposures related to urban field use
2225349 we have two fields in construction where weve actually canceled the black crumb rubber and are actively looking for an alternative
2225350 theyre spongy and lightweight and that means the solar energy thats absorbed quickly gets converted to high temperatures
2225351 circumstantial evidence sure some of it is but it is compelling evidence
2225352 the idea that anyone could say they could convict someone with what they have is stunning
2225353 they have nothing there was not a single piece of evidence produced from all those search warrants and all those affidavits he was a weird bookish nerdy kind of man but he didnt do it he was an open caring honest man with a great sense of humor who was beloved by his friends and family
2225354 bin laden terrorists for sure have anthrax and sarin gas
2225355 we have this anthrax death to america death to israel
2225356 im a little dream self short and stout im the other half of bruce when he lets me out when i get all steamed up i dont pout i push bruce aside then im free to run about
2225357 the thinking now by the psychiatrist and counselor is that my symptoms may not be those of a depression or bipolar disorder they may be that of a paranoid personality disorder
2225358 had mental troubles but he always sought treatment for them he was aware of his mental state and he sought to correct it and took medication for it he never denied it
2225359 i like individual kappas enormously and love being around them i never choose an enemy but theyve been after me since the 1960s and really after me since the late 1970s at one time in my life i knew more about kkg than any non kappa that had ever lived
2225360 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
2225361 i was laying on my back and my mom put pillows all around me but i couldnt lay on my side because it would hurt my shoulders and my face
2225362 ointments really sit on the skin and occlude the skin
2225363 it doesnt allow the pores to breathe and it doesnt allow the heat to escape as well
2225364 the funny thing is what it did suggest to do fell right in line with my moms catch all remedy when we were growing up in texas she would always use a wet washcloth itll cure anything
2225365 i like to joke you could be having an appendicitis attack or passing a kidney stone and she would run for the wet washcloth
2225366 i dont think its the cure for everything but certainly for sunburn it feels good
2225367 they look very sickly theyre kinda shriveled theyre not operating normally they almost look as if theyre on the road to cell death
2225368 so your body attempts to repair these after a sunburn event and your body generally does a fairly good job of repairing these cells but the body isnt perfect
2225369 no one received material from that flask without going through dr ivins
2225370 we thoroughly investigated every other person who could have had access to the flask and we were able to rule out all but dr ivins
2225371 there are dozens if not hundreds of scientists contractors students professors who used that same anthrax the very anthrax that would have the same genetic component
2225372 it is reasonable to conclude that the federal eagle envelopes utilized in the attacks were purchased from a post office in maryland or virginia
2225373 post offices that service the entire width of the state of maryland and then the biggest post office in the state of virginia
2225374 dr ivins had not spent this many off hours in the lab at any time before or after this period
2225375 i got your e mail making me wonder if you thought that i was trying to get something from you by sending you care packages christmas or birthday gifts etc that had me rather worried so i decided to send you the things but from different places and with different names
2225376 where is a witness that can put him in new jersey
2225377 there is no motive that has been suggested to me that makes any sense
2225378 it is frightening to me as a citizen and certainly as a defense attorney for people to characterize citizens who have trouble or questions or disputes with members of congress as having a dark side
2225379 thats the only thing i can comment to that that does not prove a thing
2225380 based upon the totality of the evidence we had gathered against him
2225381 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
2225382 circumstantial evidence sure some of it is but its compelling evidence and our view is we are confident it would have helped us prove this case against dr ivins beyond a reasonable doubt
2225383 you took a pure culture sample can you take a smear sample
2225384 have you told us all you know about this are you hiding any evidence
2225385 have you told law enforcement the truth concerning your activities around this time
2225386 i think i better talk to you outside we need to go over this
2225387 yeah thats correct i had a post office box there and i had received this kind of information
2225388 this guy has done this this this and this and we need you to get up there and ask for a restraining order
2225389 how can they say that about our father what do they think we are
2225390 hey you guys can we please all gather around this camera right now and pray for it we need a miracle
2225391 bring the presence of god to the people of the world through entertainment
2225392 its not good manners to go in and try to crack into the press network here because it is so valuable to having the conference covered well
2225393 the press room is designed to be a safe harbor in a fairly stormy sea
2225394 on average our films have made 30 return on investment
2225395 we try to have each investor put in no less than 250 000 125 000
2225396 there are huge returns that are generated out of the blue
2225397 there are some films that cost very little that had enormous returns like the blair witch project
2225398 you can point to 15 or 20 over a 10 year period
2225399 but there are thousands of films released and the odds are that youre not going to do all that well
2225400 you want at least six to 10 films in your portfolio because you cannot predict what is going to be a hit
2225401 the eis offers the widest set of tax breaks in the uk at the moment
2225402 but these are not products for the man in the street
2225403 this is at the top end where people should be putting 5 000 of their 1m portfolio
2225404 at first glance panda internet security 2008 hardly looks different from last years model but there are some exciting additions
2225405 it now includes wi fi security and like bitdefender total security 2008 and
2225406 every time they do that they are showing an implicit trust in whoever wrote the application and most people dont know who that is
2225407 social networks really dont care if you get pawned or not
2225408 people know if they go on a computer and download a program they could get a virus they dont have the same view of how dangerous that can be on a social networking site
2225409 once the content is moved from their site they have no control over that
2225410 this suggests that the iphone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off
2225411 at the moment no apps have been blacklisted but by all appearances this had been added to disable applications that the user has already downloaded and paid for if apple so chooses to shut them down
2225412 every wanna be watergate journalist in the northern hemisphere e mails me with conspiracy theories
2225413 i cant believe theyre getting away with that crap up there
2225414 happy birthday or i miss you or i love you
2225415 the industry has rallied like weve never seen the industry rally before
2225416 the defcon badge hacking contest awards the top 3 most ingenious obscure mischievous obscene or technologically astounding badge modifications created over the weekend no longer just a boring piece of passive material the badge is now a full featured active electronic product and it exists for your hacking pleasure
2225417 i would ask anyone who recognises any of the men in these photographs to get in touch as soon as possible
2225418 forward looking framework for organizing and prioritizing government efforts to secure cyberspace
2225419 in the transition between the clinton and bush presidencies in late 2000 there was no group doing what were doing now trying to tee up cybersecurity as an agenda item
2225420 what were really trying to figure out is how to collaborate
2225421 thats something that the executive departments have set up were certainly not recommending to do away with those different partnerships because they belong to the different departments
2225422 it has to be elevated to the highest echelons of this government and internationally
2225423 were losing the war its essential thats the key theme of the recommendations that will come out
2225424 when you assume technical and non technical skills are in the same level of relevance for the quality of the production you dismissed all your value as technician
2225425 you know what anyone can pilot a jet it is quite easy what really matter in this business is the comfort of the passengers
2225426 when you assume technical and non technical skills are in the same level of relevance for the quality of the production you dismissed all your value as technician
2225427 we really were surprised at the level of trust we found we didnt think wed be as successful as we were
2225428 any one of these people would have happily clicked on a malware site or viewed our profile with a data stealing trojan application
2225429 for there are mystically in our faces certain characters which carry the motto of our souls wherein he that cannot read abc may read our natures
2225430 there are therefore provincial faces national lips and noses which testify not only to the nature of their countries but of those which have them elsewhere
2225431 they were extremely well organised they are very physically strong right up the middle and that is well complemented by their speed on the flanks
2225432 their target men of ciaran lyng and mattie forde tortured down throughout and the work of pj banville out the field was very impressive as well
2225433 you have lyng with his left foot coming in from the right side and mattie forde with his right foot coming in from the right
2225434 both are free takers and redmond barry at number 10 was also hugely impressive against down
2225435 i would also single out their midfield for attention because they controlled proceedings by and large for most of the game
2225436 bar the 25 minutes against dublin they basically havent been beaten this year
2225437 they played a sweeper and got a lot of people back behind the ball
2225438 they will be extremely difficult to break down and were not altogether too fond of leaving ourselves short of men at the back either
2225439 and hunt down the process managers the street right out of their offices
2225440 it is hard so you have to constantly pay a consultant
2225441 sometimes you cant model a process because the client hasnt got a process to model
2225442 bundled services with a common interchange within a managed environment
2225443 one of our boxes represents 10 lines of bpel which represents 100 lines of j2ee code
2225444 one line of java represents 10 java byte codes which represents 100 machine language instructions
2225445 when does my system become big enough thats its worth throwing this blob of infrastructure in the middle of it all that i need a scripting language interpreter and runtime that needs 1gb of ram all for itself
2225446 i mean violence to indigenous people but as everybody can see nearly all of it is by other indigenous people
2225447 it seemed to me that the truth is not getting out there about just how violent it is in aboriginal communities and how much that itself is a basic cause of whats going on everybody has heard about the 17 year difference in mortality
2225448 but when they think about this they think oh theres something wrong with their health situation it seems impossible to tell how much of the 17 year gap is due to something like kidney disease and how much is due to straight violence like murders
2225449 its going to be named as racist by some people in the aboriginal industry i agree its problematic to say in some sense that one community is worse than another but thats too bad they are
2225450 its amazing the number of stories in which supposed elders are perpetrating the violence people say when you have intervention in these communities the first thing youve got to do is consult with the elders to see whats going to work but in too many cases its the elders who are the perpetrators
2225451 theres a lot of statistics but its hard to say what they mean exactly there seems to be a low rate of recording murders out there theyre covered up as other things there isnt even a proper recording of which deaths are aboriginal and which arent in many cases its a terrible mess if you look at police websites theyre very politically correct about identifying what is indigenous and what isnt
2225452 injuries contribute 15 per cent to the health gap cardiovascular disease 23 per cent and diabetes 12 per cent
2225453 why is it that despite the wealth and freedom now enjoyed by most citizens of rich countries we do not appear to be the autonomous fulfilled individuals we were told our wealth and freedom would bring
2225454 a locus a metaphysical absolute that is the basis for all important moral judgments
2225455 establishing a fixed moral point allows me to develop an ethical position that repudiates moral relativism but avoids all theology in other words a post secular ethics
2225456 the entire thesis hangs on a single insight the simple but profound realisation common to so much philosophy and religious thought that each of us is united with all things an idea expressed most purely in the words of the hindu classics thou art that
2225457 in the view put forward here to find god you need only find yourself
2225458 we are not sure in what way we would like to use that amount
2225459 these revelations confirm that the 35 million toyota grant was all about a photo opportunity for the prime minister and senator carr
2225460 my tp ball allows golfers to connect with their number and make their golf ball an extension of themselves for example justin rose plays 99 because his wifes lucky number is 9 and hes hoping for twice the luck were inviting golfers to put their number on their ball and to share their story with us starting this fall on mytpball com
2225461 the number 1 because i play the number 1 brand of equipment in golf
2225462 its my lowest score ever and i shot it twice at the 1992 monte carlo open and the 1999 smurfit european open
2225463 my wifes lucky number is 9 so i figure that putting 99 on my ball will give me double the luck
2225464 good things seem to happen when i tee up a number 2 from now on 2s are all im playing
2225465 when i got off the hooters tour i had no money in my pocket i had to borrow money from a relative to enter a local tournament from there i won enough to continue my professional career
2225466 i wore number 11 on my jersey in every sport i played growing up basketball baseball and soccer
2225467 i wanted something different and theres something i like about seeing 00 on my ball
2225468 lost her religious faith and suffers from hemorrhoids because of the anxiety and trauma resulting from the incident
2225469 the above should be formatted like a quote this sentence itself also being a modified version of a quote
2225470 im glad i brought this course this monster to its knees
2225471 it wasnt easy way back when i started playing here
2225472 it hasnt got any easier its been lengthened a lot since we played the 2004 ryder cup here luckily im hitting it a long way and hopefully i can make a couple putts to combat this tough course
2225473 i had a good u s open a good british and a couple other good tournaments
2225474 ive done well here before so maybe the course owes me one
2225475 i set my goals to make that ryder cup team and blew right through that this summer
2225476 and now im trying to get refocused here and get re energized for september
2225477 the great the best players going to win this week nobody is going to be lucky enough to escape hitting poor shots and survive this golf course i never hit woods into par 3s like im doing out here its very long very demanding and very fair youve got to hit it straight bottom line
2225478 so i dont know i couldnt tell you this setup the usual setup for the pga championship is more like a tough u s tour event this year the last couple years its gotten more like a traditional u s open type test its nearly more u s open type than the u s open is at the moment if that makes any sense its actually like they switched the two of them around this year
2225479 obviously there are plenty of good european players around now and there are plenty of them capable of winning will i be ready i think i will be ready but unfortunately you cant be a hundred percent sure until you actually tee it up and play
2225480 im really looking forward to playing in one of the flagship events of the european seniors tour and it always adds something special when youre competing against friends at a great venue
2225481 we have mutually agreed to cancel the 2009 and 2010 ginn tribute events
2225482 the popularity and interest of the lpga is at an all time high thanks in part to sponsors like bobby ginn we also appreciate all of the fan support that the lpga received in charleston and from throughout south carolina and look forward to returning to the south carolina market in the future
2225483 the golf tournament business is primarily fueled by economic support
2225484 we did everything in our power to generate the sponsorship necessary to continue with the ginn tribute but given the current market and corresponding cuts in corporate spending it was an uphill battle
2225485 the las vegas name is very powerful and creating the las vegas golf hall of fame reflects the magnitude of what the recognition means to inductees in addition to capturing the vision that the committee has to promote honor and preserve the deep history and exciting future of golf in the las vegas area
2225486 the pga village in the bahamas is an example of the global growth of golf and will be a premiere destination for pga professionals and the golfing public
2225487 we are excited about the impact it will have on the bahamas as a tourist destination as well as the employment and golf opportunities it will create for the island
2225488 the value of the pga brand and our network of 28 000 men and women golf professionals now reaches beyond our borders and we are excited to promote the
2225489 we could not be more excited about partnering with the pga of america on this historic project the pga of america is undoubtedly one of the most recognizable and respected brands worldwide and we are thrilled to be partnering with them to build the first ever pga village outside of the united states
2225490 weve been blessed with an exceptional team that includes the very best in each of their respective businesses the pga of america rees jones and our soon to be announced world class hotel partner cat island is truly a special place and one that we feel will provide pga members and their guests with extraordinarily memorable experiences in one of the most beautiful places of the world
2225491 police call handlers have a vital role to play in ensuring all relevant information is recorded and disseminated to give officers attending scenes as many facts as possible to assist them
2225492 however there is no escaping the fact that some key information was missed
2225493 this was not due to some malicious or deliberate act rather it was due to simple human error a mistake there is no suggestion the outcome would have been any different
2225494 we do not have the gang culture that places like london have but it is still a problem last night alone there were three incidents in the area involving knives
2225495 people carry knives for lots of reasons they are often ill on drugs or are psychologically damaged in some way sometimes young people just think its cool
2225496 that is why we have been into pretty much every school in the northumbria force area and will be going in again
2225497 whether he gets enough work done to make the starting team thats debatable
2225498 but i have every confidence that he will be in the squad hopefully by the end of the week he will be able to train again
2225499 its not ruled out but well see how he goes when he comes back and keep the options open
2225500 unfortunately paul quinn got injured in a club game playing for errigal
2225501 first of all dumb ass n s that cant think past the club the block or fat booty b s do not watch this your brain will explode second self righteous hip hop nerds who expect to hear me go line for line in a metaphorical circus do not watch this you will be sorely disappointed
2225502 we put in a massive effort this year and fell short by a point in both games
2225503 there are things we can improve on and brian is the man who can help us do that
2225504 from the icy coastal waters of stonington to the pasture lands of old lyme
2225505 with tiger missing in action unknowns taking the lead a weather delay and mayors jail time dominating the news the first round was one of the most forgettable in major history
2225506 padraig harringtons successful defence of the open capped a riveting and at times tempestuous championship at royal birkdale all the talk in the build up was about the absence of tiger woods through injury and if i am honest he was
2225507 well that was fun wasnt it today it was all about the wind as the worlds finest golfers were blown off course by a howling gale that wreaked havoc at royal birkdale no one was able to shoot a round under
2225508 the fairways are narrow if you miss the semi rough by a foot you are worse off than if you miss by 20 yards
2225509 you have to reward the accurate players like they did at the us open
2225510 i had a shot on the fourth hit a driver and because the fairways are firming up ran through the fairway a foot into the rough and i couldnt even get a lob wedge to the green and i only had 95 yards to the front
2225511 it is a difficult course anyway with the greens and the pin positions to protect it
2225512 i am not sure you need rough as long as it is and you certainly dont need to sweep it back towards the tee the night before the tournament when we have played it as it is in the practice rounds
2225513 i cant recall it happening before and cant think of a reason why they would do it other than to irritate the players as that is all it does
2225514 i asked my partners if i was out of order and they said no if you are slightly off line you are crucified
2225515 they are sucking the fun out of the major championships when you set it up like that
2225516 i know exactly what hes going through at the moment
2225517 and its going to take him a while to get over that injury i guess his first tournament might be bay hill in march and then would try to get himself ready for the masters
2225518 the first couple of weeks when he comes back it will swell up and hell feel it and hell feel it for another six months
2225519 hes not going to be over his injury for another year after hes come back
2225520 there wasnt much going on it wasnt a busy street
2225521 padraig harringtons successful defence of the open capped a riveting and at times tempestuous championship at royal birkdale all the talk in the build up was about the absence of tiger woods through injury and if i am honest he was
2225522 well that was fun wasnt it today it was all about the wind as the worlds finest golfers were blown off course by a howling gale that wreaked havoc at royal birkdale no one was able to shoot a round under
2225523 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2225524 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2225525 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2225526 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2225527 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2225528 we chose bankrate com to provide a solution for this vital information because bankrate is known for providing clear objective and unbiased information on rates

2225593 in the fall of 2003 after the world learned there were no wmd as habbush had foretold the white house ordered the cia to carry out a deception
2225594 the mission was carried out the letter was created popped up in baghdad and roiled the global new cycles in december 2003 conning even venerable journalists with tom brokaw the mission is a statutory violation of the charter of cia and amendments added in 1991 prohibiting cia from conducting disinformation campaigns on u s soil

2225600 are they trying to say jesus is not allowed in their church
2225601 shaniqua dont live here no mo is shaniqua there hell no
2225602 the system is supposed to catch and report that sort of information
2225603 i had never heard of any of this before his previous supervisor had never heard of any of this before his current supervisor had never heard of any of this before
2225604 it surely seems as though ivins was a troubled man and something should have picked this up earlier he should have been rescreened and reevaluated in terms of his ability to have the access that he had
2225605 we kept thinking that as long as we paid him the rent we would be all right
2225606 this last landlord he didnt even seem like the type who would do that to somebody but what is the type
2225607 early on the focus was all on the homeowners problems
2225608 its only now that the renters dilemma is bubbling up to the top
2225609 whatever the proper resolution of the extraordinarily important questions presented the public interest clearly favors further consideration of issues before defendants are required to take actions that may forever alter the constitutional balance of separation of powers
2225610 the bush cheney administration continues to defy our validly issued congressional subpoenas for information relevant to the politicization of the department of justice by this white house
2225611 it was a sorry or sad thing to see innocent people killed
2225612 i personally present my apologies to them if anything i did has caused them pain
2225613 from numerous methodological flaws that were illuminated by the governments presentation and in many instances are obvious to anyone having basic familiarity with the case
2225614 through the olympics people feel they are experiencing their own success
2225615 im happy to be living in this era with such a big event taking place
2225616 i think it was most appropriate for judge giles to take action regarding defendant kilpatricks bond considering his most recent behavior
2225617 this was the most extreme option and were obviously going to appeal the trip to canada was taken on the basis that if the deal fell through a significant number of city employees would lose their jobs
2225618 the agency recognizes that a number of factors have contributed to high corn food and fuel prices as a nation
2225619 is strengthening our nations energy security and supporting americans farming communities
2225620 greatly disappointed with the epas inability to look past the good intentions of this policy to see the significant harm it is doing to farmers ranchers and american households for the epa to assert that this federal mandate is not affecting food prices not only goes against common sense but every americans grocery bill
2225621 america should be focusing on viable clean energy solutions like conservation solar and wind
2225622 instead the misguided corn ethanol mandate is forcing farmers to plow up marginal land and wildlife habitat while increasing global warming and dumping toxic fertilizers and pesticides into our precious water sources
2225623 so that is going to be a key element for the future
2225624 would have sabotaged the development and growth of new technologies and a cellulosic biofuels industry
2225625 i do not think that this is the end of the farc i do not think that the farcs days are numbered
2225626 they have a fight that will last for a long time
2225627 the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated
2225628 theres a catharsis everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good
2225629 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what we are looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country and i think that people who supported a whole range of different candidates during the primaries are going to come out of that convention feeling absolutely determined that we have to take the white house back
2225630 i spoke to senator clinton this week shes campaigning for me in nevada and florida she is very enthusiastic about the need for a unified party i think we are going to have a terrific convention as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics of the four days our staffs are in communication my staff with senator clintons staff but i dont anticipate any problems
2225631 if the party is speaking about unity they the clinton delegates believe the only way to unify the party is actually allowing them to vote
2225632 moving beyond the convention if they were not allowed to vote there would be a lot of resentment
2225633 i think the road is long before we reach that point
2225634 one hypothesis is that they mount an immune response that protected them
2225635 i dont know if all of this will work i have to say that i have to give you straight talk i do
2225636 i cant assure you that this train wreck isnt going to happen but i will do everything in my power to see that we avert it
2225637 my straight talk would be please dont let this foreign company ruin our part of the world
2225638 im personally calling on john mccain to send rick davis to germany to use his considerable clout with dhl to help save these 8 200 jobs in southwest ohio
2225639 come here to wilmington and come here to ohio and explain the reasons and rationale for their decision
2225640 we thought it was an issue that there were people giving to the campaign who had no intention of supporting or voting for john mccain
2225641 so we thought it was an appropriate measure at this point
2225642 reminding them of the campaign finance law and providing some information as to how to get a refund if thats what they desire
2225643 if it is not illegal for a foreign national to bundle checks it ought to be since its illegal for a foreign national to make contributions in the first place
2225644 he hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
2225645 they should strive to have their hearings completed and the findings made public prior to july 1964 when the presidential campaigns will begin to get hot he stated it would be unfair to present the findings after july
2225646 ford indicated he would keep me thoroughly advised as to the activities of the commission
2225647 he stated this would have to be done on a confidential basis however he thought it should be done
2225648 i referred to this weeks issue of newsweek magazine which contains a rather clear analysis of the report
2225649 i told congressman ford that newsweek was owned by the washington post and that apparently some one was trying to curry favor i told him we of course did not get along very well with either the washington post or newsweek he said that he was in the same boat that he liked neither one of these publications
2225650 theres a lot of clubs that have got resources much greater than ours and we have to go out and match them
2225651 we accept the challenge and well go for it as best we can
2225652 i think its fair to say weve over achieved in the last two or three seasons and well continue to endeavour to do so
2225653 following an attack iran could quickly rebuild its centrifuge program in small easily hidden facilities focused on making weapon grade uranium for nuclear weapons
2225654 without that knowledge an attack is unlikely to significantly delay irans mastery of enrichment with gas centrifuges

2225656 what we have now is people who know how to use weapons and who now want to play politics
2225657 there is no doubt the violence will increase in kirkuk if its case does not get solved
2225658 we found out that armed action will not get the united states out of iraq
2225659 after five years of directing painful blows to them they did not budge from a single meter in the country
2225660 entering the elections is to change the current reality in our area the domination of the sunni spectrum by the iraqi islamic party
2225661 his policies have weakened the federation and eroded the trust of the nation in national institutions
2225662 the coalition believes it has become imperative to move for impeachment
2225663 but there is no peace and democracy in burma and its impossible to go home
2225664 american people care deeply about the people of burma and we pray for the day in which the people will be free
2225665 the noble cause has many devoted champions and i happen to be married to one of them
2225666 twenty years have gone by everything is still the same or maybe worse in burma
2225667 we know that burma is a very rich country rich in natural resources and the junta uses those resources to prop themselves up for their own benefit not for the benefit of the people of burma
2225668 we oppose implementing the chinese communist system in our homeland of east turkestan because this system is based on atheism
2225669 we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
2225670 candor is the most effective where nations have built a relationship of respect and trust
2225671 this has got to be a historic moment father and son two presidents opening an embassy my dad was a fabulous president
2225672 the mist in the air that we see is not a feature of pollution primarily but a feature of evaporation and humidity
2225673 exaggeration of the problem that has been seen in the media
2225674 but i do not think it is necessary i would not wear one whether i was an athlete or not

2225678 we have to assume that the frequent flyer program what its details were was not designed to strengthen the comfort and resolve of the prisoner
2225679 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
2225680 days before the olympic games begin and as all eyes turn to china we appeal to the world to remember that millions of tibetans are crying out for human rights and freedom
2225681 whats the evidence that he did anything other than know how to make anthrax and have all kinds of it at his disposal
2225682 there are a lot of armchair detectives and instant experts out there formulating opinions not based on a full set of the facts the only airtight cases in life are on csi in prime time
2225683 but be sure of one thing you will never fill them
2225684 i have had to take the advice of the medical experts and they are obviously correct ive had a great career in racing
2225685 its the news i didnt want but i have always respected medical opinion these people know best and i will accept their decision 100
2225686 i will be giving up riding with a lump in my throat because it is a game i have loved all of my life
2225687 but i will still be involved in the game in many capacities after all racing has always been in my blood
2225688 his greatest attribute to us was that he wasnt just a jockey he was a team player as far as we were concerned and a great mate his input was enormous
2225689 he obviously was a very very good rider he was very strong and very good at presenting a horse at an obstacle but there was much more to it than that
2225690 weve had a long association but it was very easy as he was always 100 and the owners knew that
2225691 we all became friends and it was easy to work and when you think he rode 762 winners for us which is an awful lot for one yard thats amazing
2225692 he was the archetypal stable jockey and his commitment was 100 to us he was always fully behind this operation and he would like to stay on in some capacity but at the moment he cant ride at all anyway
2225693 but he could always be here as a guide and helper and a brain he has always had the ability to work things out and the homework he did was phenomenal
2225694 he will be very sadly missed over the last 12 or 14 years he been one of my best friends on and off the course
2225695 he was a brilliant jockey good lad and a brilliant talker its sad but obviously after he broke his neck for the second time it was pretty obvious he would not be riding again i think
2225696 we are happy to be held in high esteem and be the poster child for doing more with less
2225697 im supposed to give it to my mom but i think im going to give it to her

2225747 unfortunately during the past 3 years as mayor my eyes have been opened to the realities of politics and it is a very disappointing picture
2225748 i have also found that the overall atmosphere is incompatible with my understanding of the desires of the people of la plata
2225749 why wont you allow an up or down vote on lifting the congressional oil drilling ban
2225750 theres going to be a vote september 30th will not come and go without a vote on opening the outer continental shelf the message has been delivered the issue cant be ignored any longer
2225751 im not going to allow a vote on any measure that includes drilling
2225752 suppressing all attempts and letting the gop bludgeon the democrats with this issue all the way to november
2225753 i know our program manager is ranking captains on landing with less fuel i dont care to be ranked i think this is a safety problem and i believe fuel is your friend
2225754 looking back i would have liked more gas yesterday and i was already carrying tanker fuel if i wouldnt have had this extra there would have been real problems
2225755 far below my comfort zone and probably less than the minimum fuel required by the fars federal aviation regulations
2225756 our fuel situation had not become critical yet but had we had any delay i would have had to declare a fuel emergency
2225757 i am not sure if the flight plan as given to me by my company was a real flight plan or if they were just telling me it was so that i would continue to jfk thus saving them time and expense in the future if such a situation presents itself again i will divert to my initial destination regardless of what my company says i can do the safety of my crew far outweighs any financial burden to the company
2225758 this was probably the new fuel saving initiative by the company management to save money
2225759 north south operation is very unpredictable along the east coast i dont think this is a place where we should skimp on fuel
2225760 relaying my opinion on the reduced fuel load and my suggestion not to compromise fuel loads in and out of florida
2225761 because in an attempt to abide by the new fuel conservation procedures just adopted by the company not enough fuel was put on the aircraft to handle a simple delay in an effort to save money an aircraft had to divert the aircraft arrived at its destination two hours late finally the pilots had to get off their trip early because of fatigue and because they would have flown nine hours and 40 minutes if they had continued on
2225762 ten minutes of hold fuel remained unchanged because management is pressuring dispatch to fly with limited hold fuel to reduce costs
2225763 ten minutes of hold fuel into an airport with marginal conditions because the dispatcher does not want his her name on the fuel list for the week printed and hung by management contacted dispatcher and after captain requested it fuel was begrudgingly added to
2225764 a man with 10 wives would collapse and die but my own power is given by allah that is why i have been able to control 86 of them
2225765 i dont go looking for them they come to me i will consider the fact that god has asked me to do it and i will just marry them
2225766 i am now the happiest woman on earth when you marry a man with 86 wives you know he knows how to look after them
2225767 theres not a thing we can do to avoid the long lines on election day
2225768 certainly youve got an open seated presidential race with some very interesting candidates and youve got a lot of interest in the election for primarily that reason
2225769 we learned from that mistake and we proved that we learned from that mistake based on our performance in the last four elections
2225770 weve had 85 percent turnout in charles county before so its nothing new to us
2225771 we would love to see 100 percent turnout because whether we have a 2 percent turnout or we have a 100 percent turnout we do the same amount of work
2225772 i have no qualms about saying that well have them very shortly
2225773 weve had 85 percent turnout in charles county before so its nothing new to us
2225774 we would love to see 100 percent turnout because whether we have a 2 percent turnout or we have a 100 percent turnout we do the same amount of work
2225775 theres not a thing we can do to avoid the long lines on election day
2225776 certainly youve got an open seated presidential race with some very interesting candidates and youve got a lot of interest in the election for primarily that reason
2225777 we learned from that mistake and we proved that we learned from that mistake based on our performance in the last four elections
2225778 no qualms about saying that well have them very shortly
2225779 i knew i could call mccain the racist bastard he is in front of those bitter jesus worshipping gay hating gun toting hicks because theyre too stupid to understand what i was telling them just as i know you dont have the brains to figure out that i really did blow off the wounded troops at rammstein and landstuhl to play tourist in berlin and if any of you do and dont obsequiously accept and cheer every word i say anyway your names are going on my list
2225780 do i really look like a guy with a plan you know what i am i am a dog chasing cars i wouldnt know what to do with one if i caught it i just do things
2225781 introduce a little anarchy upset the established order and everything becomes chaos i am an agent of chaos oh and you know the thing about chaos its fear
2225782 you see their morals their code its a bad joke dropped at the first sign of trouble theyre only as good as the world allows them to be ill show you when the chips are down these civilized people theyll eat each other see im not a monster im just ahead of the curve
2225783 i cling to the promise of christ who assured his disciples that the gates of hell shall not prevail against us
2225784 imagine this dark world and the sort of hero it would need
2225785 this has been going on in comics most especially batman comics since the 1930s long before a war on terror etc
2225786 being able to pinpoint the exact location of any vehicle on our property has provided a tremendous boost to our effectiveness and to our ability to provide exceptional service to our customers and vendors
2225787 the vehicle location aspect of the service is impressive but the real gains in terms of improving our bottom line are coming from the labor tracking
2225788 other methods of providing vehicle location information such as rfid continue to be prohibitively expensive require enormous infrastructure investments and present logistical problems associated with handling the thousands of tags
2225789 besides those methods dont associate the drivers with the vehicles and improved driver productivity is at the core of the functionality and cost savings provided by auctiontrac in short labor tracking is the engine that allows auctiontrac to pay for itself

2225796 the magnesium chloride road ice chemicals that destroy trucks and trailers are now being prevented by our coating our patented product is applied by aerosol or brush preventing the natural corrosive reaction of dissimilar metals
2225797 i can only tell you this several years after the bridges were made the inspectors concluded that eck prevented corrosion
2225798 the world is full of dissimilar metal manufactured items from vehicles to home swing sets stainless hardware are used to assemble aluminum corrosion repair and replacement exceeds 350 dollars annually now a spray or a brush of our eck coating will help save money and extend the life of manufactured items

2225805 the cdc is committed to ensuring that its resources are going to the populations hardest hit by the epidemic
2225806 its often more politically viable to fund programs for women and children and youth
2225807 at a minimum we need to be matching percentages to where the epidemic is

2225809 i think theyll be more than good enough theyve lost some good players but the squad should be big and strong enough
2225810 nigel pearson can do it hell get those players sorted
2225811 the average woman would rather have beauty than brains because the average man can see better than he can think
2225812 everyone hears what you say friends listen to what you say best friends listen to what you dont say
2225813 auyuittuq means land that never melts but of course now its melting
2225814 the police and the government have yet to learn any lessons from this of a meaningful kind when it comes to the justice system
2225815 historically the justice system has discriminated against aboriginal people by providing legal sanction for their oppression this oppression of previous generations forced aboriginal people into their current state of social and economic distress now a seemingly neutral justice system discriminates against current generations of aboriginal people by applying laws which have an adverse impact on people of lower socio economic status this is no less racial discrimination it is merely laundered racial discrimination
2225816 i believe im on the side of compassion and on the side of the angels
2225817 there are already people saying injection sites a rent enough that true harm reduction is giving out heroin for free
2225818 they probably felt threatened by what we were going on about and we were very vocal about it and we wanted to see change maybe that was a bit upsetting to see women gather in that kind of strength and conviction
2225819 the videos will give a personal peak behind the scenes of the jonas brothers in real time as they travel and get ready for their shows in jones beach and madison square garden
2225820 our main goal is to get the most detailed images and remote sensing data ever of the geologically active features on enceladus
2225821 from this data we may learn more about how eruptions tectonics and seismic activity alter the moons surface
2225822 wed like to refine our numbers and see which fracture or stripe is hotter than the rest because these results can offer evidence one way or the other for the existence of liquid water as the engine that powers the plumes
2225823 knowing the sizes of the particles their rates and what else is mixed in these jets can tell us a lot about whats happening inside the little moon
2225824 its not just the massive growth thats significant but peoples awareness of it
2225825 implicit in a lot of work was looking at how public and private spaces interact
2225826 not just at a domestic level but at a civic level
2225827 the beaches hinterland rural landscape and beautiful bushland in southeast queensland combined with the climate provides a very strong and evocative base for architecture you deny these at your peril because then you create spaces that dont work they might be great visually but no one is going to enjoy being in them
2225828 architects like bud brannigan lindsay and kerry clare from architectus and arkhefield take the workmanlike prosaic approach
2225829 they are not afraid of artifice and will completely reshape the land to build a house their work is more theatrical they want to orchestrate the way people relate to the building
2225830 it was a trial run for the house with a single skin type of construction studs were put the width of the ply sheets so the ply sheets went to the outside with the weathering joints facing the elements its a traditional way of building in queensland under a decent roof overhang but i updated it with new materials
2225831 the materials and the construction techniques are the basic elements you work with to define the spaces in the building i dont impose an abstract idea on the job im not building houses that i think should look like a squashed scone or a melted ice cream
2225832 i used a lot of nautical imagery in the building
2225833 columns are like freestanding masts in the space and the trusses are tension trusses but recall the cable stays on a sailing ship
2225834 why have we got ourselves into a position where sensible and passive ways of occupant comfort have not only been ignored but they have almost been legislated against
2225835 every time i sat down to write i felt like i was going over old ground or the music wasnt doing it for me
2225836 i was thinking it really is easy at my age for the music industry to put you in a box and put the box in the warehouse tucked away behind the captain and tennille records
2225837 it does get annoying that people think not drowning waving was this ambient band when people who listened to the records or went to the shows know it wasnt that at all
2225838 hes my right hand man the one i turn to for an honest opinion the one who says that lyrics a shocker
2225839 its set at a funeral i went to in bougainville which gives the imagery of the crushed lime smeared across the face the chants the women singing about all the good attributes that the dead boy had
2225840 there are a lot of melanesian images in the song
2225841 theres a poster you see all around papua new guinea which translates as
2225842 all the ones going to hell are listening to traditional music chewing betel nut drinking beer and playing cards
2225843 its an offensive poster so theres a line about that too
2225844 having airi there on drums is fantastic because hes able to incorporate all those melanesian things i want to be an inclusive part of the record not sounding tacked on
2225845 i want to show its part of my life and what i do just as much as listening to the beatles the cure and the velvet underground influenced me too

2225847 bands can go through a lot of money very quickly overseas and not see any results we want to find a way to do it thats sustainable and long term rather than strip mining our whole careers
2225848 if you are doing anything thats remotely a niche you really need to find those niches overseas and if you go about it the right way those audiences are very loyal
2225849 you see how big the world of music really is and we learnt that we stack up really well with whats around we played with some great bands we dont feel we lose anything in comparison with them and were proud of that
2225850 i had been working on my album for months and after a short holiday i wrote another four songs which i think are four of the best ive ever written and they really lifted the album to the place i wanted it to go
2225851 the words are very important to me when i hear stuff thats just rhyme and cliches i just turn off
2225852 i love the way lyrics really enhance the mystery of a good song i was standing behind some schoolkids last week and they were talking about how boring poetry was i felt like a grumpy old woman i was thinking its such a beautiful thing look at the poetry in the music of bob dylan radiohead neil young paul kelly clare bowditch
2225853 it was a luxury to be able to work slowly the album was recorded over two years and that enabled it to grow we thought we had it finished a year ago but as our lives changed the music changed too
2225854 some bands like to write about cool things cars and dancing but we write about our lives the music has a depth now that we didnt have when we were 19
2225855 that was a nice little twist of fate i was working with someone who happened to be in the brisbane chorale and it developed from that
2225856 we were all in the room together when they sang it and our jaws dropped we were wetting ourselves trying not to look too ecstatic in front of 100 people
2225857 yes people know a great deal about me some would say the best of me from my books
2225858 yes one and the same i have an unwritten contract with my readers to tell the whole truth no matter how bad it makes me look
2225859 people relate to and respect emotional honesty and its rewarded it really is you dont end up feeling vulnerable in fact ive never felt more accepted
2225860 there is no doubt that what i had as a father was a sociopath
2225861 my sense of humour is really not much more than a defence mechanism
2225862 it is a reaction to catastrophic stress i knew some people would be disappointed in not having the funny augusten in this book that it would be a love it or hate it reaction but what has surprised me is the intense reader response
2225863 people have really been able to relate to this story either because their father had similar faults or as one reader told me simply to be thankful for the father they have
2225864 i thought i would feel this great big hole this belated grief instead all i felt was free it was then that i had a burning need to tell this story
2225865 its less about courage and more about the fact that i just dont give a f
2225866 we have been dealing with village roadshow professionally and its all progressing at this stage
2225867 there was a hell of a lot of people we never quote the figures no one will ever do that but over the two week holiday period we had the biggest week ever recorded here
2225868 i knew this was going to be one of the most seismic changes in our lives and that the soldiers were going to be the first and the hardest hit
2225869 thats the thing about the hours a director works anything that goes on off the set i wish i had the time to know about
2225870 she just stood out among all the girls her age because shes a beautiful woman she can play the girl that the guys are dreaming about while they are at war but theres something about the aussie women a toughness
2225871 abbie could also be one of the boys she could go out drinking with them in the movie she could race cars she could fix a flat she could take care of herself
2225872 we needed a guy who could play a true patriot somebody who when 9 11 happened was the all american boy enough and was naive enough that he would sign up
2225873 you had to believe that he would have that impulse i actually had soldiers come to the auditions and tell me whether they bought ryan as a soldier whether they would go to war with him
2225874 i did what i had to do for the time i had to do it
2225875 suddenly the all american boy who has always done what he considered right finds himself completely at odds with the system he believed in
2225876 when i saw the tree i just thought save my kids
2225877 the insulation started lifting off the roof and twirling in the air
2225878 it looked like the top part of a funnel in the clouds with a trail of debris behind it
2225879 im not standing here shouting about getting promoted or in the play offs but without a shadow of a doubt we will do better than last year
2225880 we have a fitness coach and things are far more professional
2225881 we have witnessed a frightening law enforcement culture in which the law is disregarded the rights of innocent occupants are ignored and the rights of innocent animals mean nothing
2225882 a shadow was cast over our good names we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
2225883 weve tried to establish a pattern of transparency and clarity about the way in which we do our work and im sure the chief will be cooperative and forthcoming in any investigation
2225884 if they deem it necessary to do that we welcome it
2225885 its kind of unique to see two atvs traveling along 301 in the middle of the night
2225886 at that time it was a traffic violation and the supervisor determined that it was appropriate to discontinue the chase
2225887 he was caught between two cars making it impossible for him to escape
2225888 he was just one of the nicest persons you could imagine dealing with
2225889 that guy was really interesting where was he all night
2225890 i came from california we had other seafood there sure but id never tried crab before
2225891 even the way we do sodas has changed a lot since i started
2225892 please dont ask me why the bear crossed the road
2225893 a package in line with the referees wishes was guaranteed however negotions broke down
2225894 withdrawing their services with immediate effect for an indefinite period
2225895 if the president and chief executive were involved in discussions at an earlier stage we probably wouldnt be here today
2225896 we have made progress im very optimistic and it would be my wish to get back on the pitch earlier next week
2225897 the balls in raymonds court and hes been saying that he can deliver it for us
2225898 this is a sad day for football i felt that the irish fa had provided a viable solution for matches to go ahead in the ifa premiership and ifa championship tomorrow and i extend my sincere apologies to all those affected by this late postponement of the league programme
2225899 we think this is one of the most important changes to the way were policing since perhaps the launch of radios because were going to be enabling our officers to have a complete mobile office while out on patrol
2225900 we will increase visibility and accessibility to the public and also cut down on bureaucracy
2225901 since we found it within four years its now spread the whole length of the soar
2225902 one single little leaf can by the end of the summer grow into 20 tonnes
2225903 the only way to deal with it now is to get people in with hands to pick every last piece
2225904 its a very slow job but its got to be done or else were going to lose the whole of the river
2225905 we estimate that on the river soar alone its going to cost us 50 000 this year just to deal with this floating pennywort and that will be every year
2225906 i havent toured since 1978 when i was still in my twenties
2225907 its a wonderful way to see the country there are so many places i havent been to before and i love david williamsons writing so i thought why not i mean in a few months time i may never want to do this again but i doubt it i think im going to have a really fabulous time
2225908 i had been asked on several occasions to tour even just interstate to melbourne but i always had to say no because i was a single mum but now shes launched and this offer came up and i thought well i dont have any excuses any more to say no
2225909 of course my daughter said its all right for me to leave home mum but its not all right for you to leave home and funnily enough thats what this plays about
2225910 i imagine many will find it strikingly familiar having made their own sea change to the sunshine state
2225911 david was talking about grey nomads and sea changers before the terms were coined this plays an oldie but a goodie
2225912 whats great is its actually telling a story of a middle aged couple its not all about young people
2225913 shes in her 50s and hes in his early 70s and they get together and fall in love hes a widower and shes a divorcee and just that process of coming together as one after so many years alone theyre happy
2225914 they discover the beauty of the place and its a new beginning
2225915 opens up creativity past one size fits all mass measurements and priestly definitions
2225916 internet curmudgeons argue that google et al are bringing society to ruin precisely because they rob the creative class of its financial support and exclusivity its pedestal
2225917 immediate and reliable communications between cars and between cars and roadside infrastructure
2225918 barring a physical disruption that may temporarily spike prices we judge that oil prices have peaked for the next few years
2225919 in our view the recent correction in oil prices was overdue and softness awaits in the next 12 months
2225920 saudi arabia again appears to be playing the role of swing supplier pumping 500 000 barrels per day more than three months ago
2225921 furthermore a tipping point appears to have been reached in demand in numerous asian markets
2225922 from a high near 130 000 contracts on the new york mercantile exchange long last year net length has declined and even gone into net short territory in recent weeks
2225923 whether due to the attention of regulators or because of a different read on fundamentals speculators have certainly changed their sentiment
2225924 we were halfway to great falls that was the frontier you had to go to arlington to find something to eat
2225925 you dont have to make an appointment to visit your neighbors
2225926 there are so many ways to get downtown from here
2225927 from the outside it looks like there are four different styles
2225928 wir sind damit ganz nah am wm ergebnis von 2006
2225929 ich wollte wirklich gehen und ich will es immer noch aber mein klub tut alles um das zu verhindern
2225930 aber aus der russischen liga herauszukommen ist nicht so einfach
2225931 man sagte etwas von 27 millionen das schreckt jeden ab
2225932 ich kann nur sagen wenn ich woanders hin wechseln w rde dann w rde ich weniger verdienen als in russland
2225933 aber aus der russischen liga herauszukommen ist nicht so einfach
2225934 zun chst einmal wollen wir alle dass er bei zenit bleibt aber nat rlich k nnte ein guter wechsel einen schritt nach vorne in seiner karriere bedeuten
2225935 die laufen immer alle nach vorne haben aber immer auch gleich wieder spielerinnen hinten es sind nur nie dieselben
2225936 wir haben gute einzelspieler funktionieren aber besonders gut als mannschaft das ist eine st rke die uns niemand nimmt
2225937 das wird zwar ein ganz harter brocken aber wenn wir schnell nach vorne spielen k nnten wir etwas unordnung in ihre reihen bringen
2225938 we played well against shamrock rovers in our last league game and felt we should have won but lost 1 0
2225939 we had been in good scoring form in the run up to that game so it was disappointing when we failed to hit the net and ended up on the wrong end of a defeat
2225940 we are looking to bounce back and the team are still confident thanks to a good performance at galway in the semi final of the league cup
2225941 its a credit to the squad that they bounced back and that city are in their fourth consecutive final in that competition the fans deserve it for their unwavering support
2225942 cobh may be at the wrong end of the table but we will give them every respect and are prepared for a tricky game on a tight pitch
2225943 the lads trained well this week and hopefully that effort will be rewarded with a good performance and a positive result
2225944 he was lying then but is he also lying now

2225946 the solution to this is to make encryption much more common so that its no longer so rare that it raises a flag
2225947 the only solution imho is either hidden volumes ala truecrypt or steganography

2225957 given that foreclosures take time and that additional pressure will be put on financially burdened homeowners as adjustable rate mortgages continue to reset in 2008 and 2009 it is reasonable to expect the number of applicants with foreclosures to continue to increase perhaps dramatically from current levels
2225958 foreclosures will remain at record highs the financial system will be under severe stress and the broader economy will sputter

2225963 during the great depression the government had neither the means nor the capability to serve as a backstop
2225964 the fed isnt the whole story but its a big part of it
2225965 it allowed these absolutely insane bubbles to happen the lesson is you cant let these bubbles continue unabated with no policy making
2225966 if its 2005 you cant look at a 40 year run of data and say it must be a law of nature that housing prices never fall
2225967 the fed deliberately and consciously refused to regulate the mortgage industry like it was supposed to have done im not a big fan of government regulation but sometimes the government can do something to help and in those cases it has to

2226014 call me stupid but i cant find the complete hardware schematics for the neo1973 where are they im not just looking for chip data sheets i am looking for the entire schematics of the phone
2226015 alas the powers that be are still reluctant to let us release the full schematics in fact some of the material there is under nda so we wont be able release that in any case for example gsm chipset details
2226016 the plan is currently to get permission to release the schematics for the debug board which after all is specifically designed to be extended by hardware savvy users and then work on doing the same with a simplified version of the neo1973 schematics
2226017 simplified could mean to just have a big white box for the gsm chipset showing only the signal and power inputs and outputs but not whats going on inside not that this would be overly exciting the details still have to be worked out but we keep on nagging
2226018 the schematics now document how the gps chip is wired in the system providing vital information for developers who want to leverage the gps functionality for new designs involving the openmoko phones

2226035 f r uns war die teilnahme am wettbewerb eine art marktforschung
2226036 yes my coach was kind enough to come and see me in lisbon a few days ago which i think is common knowledge it was a very honest conversation between two people that respect one other and that im sure share a mutual affection and friendship what we said to each other will remain private sir alex listened to me i listened to him and we established that the best for both sides would be for me to continue at old trafford so i can confirm that ill be playing for manchester united next season and before there are any rumours about me staying against my will i want to make one thing clear whoever says or writes anything to that effect is lying ill be playing at united with my heart and soul i will fight and honour the shirt with the same desire and dedication as i always have
2226037 i want to say that i was the one that was responsible for all this controversy it wasnt their fault because it was me that said publicly that i wanted to move to real madrid it was also me although wholly unintentionally that caused the friction between the two clubs
2226038 i knew that real madrid were interested in signing me and that they had allegedly made a very substantial offer to united for a while i wanted manchester to accept the offer and for me to move to madrid if i denied it i would be deceiving everyone including myself anyone who knows me knows that it would have to be something very important for me to admit such a thing if theres one thing ive never been nor do i ever want to be it is ungrateful manchester united from the glazer family the directors namely david gill to the coaches team mates and backroom staff is a club that will always be dear to my heart whatever happens in the future that will never change im very aware of what this club has done for me and ill be eternally grateful come what may but it was because of this because i knew this club was different and extraordinarily human that i hoped that my wishes and my reasons would be understood
2226039 after wed won the champions league i felt that in five years i had helped win everything there was to win wed won the premier league twice and id won a host of individual awards including the best goalscorer in the premier league champions league and in europe so i felt that maybe i needed a new challenge i never hid the fact that i wanted to play in spain at real madrid in particular and i thought this could be the right moment united and real are probably the two biggest clubs in the world and it would never be an easy decision to make apart from the challenge everyone realises that spanish and portuguese culture and lifestyle are more similar those were the reasons that made me consider the change
2226040 im aware that whatever the circumstances there will always be speculation about me
2226041 apart from the reasons ive just given i also have to recognise that my family would welcome the change the chance of being an hours flight from my mother and the rest of my family was very attractive even more so playing for a club like real madrid i know i have to deal with these circumstances even though its difficult sometimes but its harder to ask the same of the people i love the most the best proof of what ive just said is the fact that ive just made a major investment in a house in manchester even though i didnt have to i did it not just for my own comfort but also for those closest to me the people at united particularly the manager understood my reasons but we all eventually concluded that i should continue to wear that number 7 shirt its no sacrifice for me its a great honour i have important things to win in england i will give everything i have to united i want to defend the european cup and help united become world champions not forgetting the league and other cups
2226042 no to be honest its possible but i hope it doesnt happen i know im a good professional i know that no ones harder on me than myself and thats never going to change under any circumstances the high point of my career was winning the champions league no one will ever erase that from my memory in the same way that no one will ever erase the fact that i did it in a united shirt what i said publicly which was maybe a little naive i take total responsibility for people have to understand one thing at the age of 18 i arrived at a dream club like united it was a dream come true but even at that moment i was thinking about playing in england for some years and then going to play in spain even at that time i was thinking that way and i always gave 100 everything why lie im not going to be a hypocrite and say the opposite of what i think like some others do i said exactly what i thought i have a dream of playing at real and i thought it was time to move on people cant be upset about me fulfilling a childhood dream
2226043 im very aware of what this club has done for me ill be forever grateful united and its fans can be sure that ill never forget them no matter what happens theyre special and theyll always have a place here puts hand on heart in fact i confess that one of the reasons i had the courage to say what i did was the fact that united would be fairly compensated the figure mentioned which would be a world record would serve as some compensation for the debt of gratitude that i owe the club as least in material terms im going to say something here that ive never told anybody if we hadnt been european champions i probably wouldnt have even thought about going to madrid and there is something else that should be mentioned i never wanted to leave against uniteds will when they turned down the offer the people at united made it very clear how much they wanted me i didnt fully understand it at the time but now i can really appreciate it
2226044 that makes no sense nor do i believe thats what he meant as he himself has already stated my comment was about something else i was saying that players should be where they feel happy nothing more
2226045 believe me it makes me proud to know how much he thinks of me
2226046 at the time jorge mendes explained that united also wanted me and that sir alex ferguson had told him that he would be very careful with my playing career so i would play at least 50 of the games in the first season which is what happened this shows that i also chose united and that money wasnt the deciding factor alongside my agent mendes sir alex ferguson has been the most important person ive ever known in my career because of this because of the special relationship that exists between us i know that hell understand that there are times when a father has to worry only about whats best for his child
2226047 theres no point in making predictions its not worth speculating because nothing is set in stone and things change all the time in football today there are opportunities that no one knows if they will come round again in the future there are only two certainties ill be playing at united a club im proud to represent real madrid will continue to be a great club without me and i will continue to admire them as i have done since i was a boy im saying what i think and i hope that all the speculation will stop the press has written some terrible things about me and about this whole thing theyve invented a thousand and one things and thats one of the reasons why i decided to talk about this now you can be sure of one thing everything ive said comes from the bottom of my heart and is the only truth
2226048 im 100 professional and ive always given my heart and soul to this club i even played a major part of the season injured which was verified by my operation i played in excruciating pain while taking anti inflammatory medication every day and id do it again if necessary this club deserves it because the united staff and the fans are fantastic not forgetting the affection and respect i have for sir alex ferguson if one day i leave the club i want to do it knowing that i did everything i could to help the club win as much as possible if that happens ill leave with the feeling of having done my duty to the maximum

2226128 i putted good i chipped good i hit a lot of good shots into the greens and one under par on this course im thrilled with it
2226129 it felt like i played a lot better than 71
2226130 i really struggled on the greens and i had a number of putts that the hole lipped out on so it made me feel like i was putting a lot worse than i was maybe

2226138 taslima got in touch with the government in july saying that she wished to return the ministries of external affairs and home affairs said they did not have a problem they even said she could return to calcutta but that might create problems with the bengal government
2226139 now that the trust vote is over and the left has joined the opposition bandwagon the congress led upa government found no reason to hold back taslima especially since she is holding a valid visa
2226140 she still wants to go to calcutta although the centre is yet to write formally to the bengal government on the issue the state has already indicated that she is not welcome

2226366 it was the early days of empowerment of the hispanic community and she made it clear that she wanted to be part of that future
2226367 you get so used to it so you say ok ill figure out a way around it
2226368 i just am not the kind of person to see the wall
2226369 it may wax it may wane but we are bound pretty well by what happens in the trial court the way the case is submitted to the jury we are bound by the record and by the law and i really dont keep count
2226370 i decide each case based upon the record as its presented and the facts and the law
2226371 the first years of the republican supreme court were not as dramatically pro defendant as they are now
2226372 it was sort of gradual but it has definitely become more aggressively pro defendant
2226373 a whole new world in mandamus practice hinted by opinions in the last few years is here the courts heavy reliance on costs and delay to support its conclusion that the hospital has no adequate remedy by appeal marks a clear departure from the historical bounds of our mandamus jurisprudence
2226374 such cases should be the exception they may now have become the rule
2226375 they gave you the gas they gave you the airplane
2226376 they gave you the paycheck i mean you know what more could someone ask
2226377 i remember that everything that comes to us has a lot of emotional equity in it on both sides and i worry about it
2226378 and it ought to be a worrying process at that level it ought to be you ought to have time you dont want to rush things out
2226379 she clawed her way up in the legal profession to become judge and she has the respect of virtually everybody in the profession down here
2226380 she has not only the intellectual skills but also the gravitas to pull it off
2226381 those of us in the legal profession weve known for years whats going on
2226382 the truth is getting out in laymens terms by some of these articles that are being written and some of these editorials and i think thats going to affect the electorate
2226383 i would say that given the turnout and the enthusiasm in the democratic party this year which is unprecedented i think we can
2226384 it was nice to be able to make a contribution
2226385 the strength of our attack is that we have a number of bowlers who are capable of taking five wickets in an innings
2226386 i thought my rhythm was better than it has been recently
2226387 were playing the world champions at home and it is also a great occasion for them because they are celebrating mr mandelas birthday
2226388 they are a great team wherever you look in any position they have great strength it will be really hard for us but we will give everything for as long as we can
2226389 its going to be tough up front argentinas game is based on their forwards scrumming against argentina is the acid test and their kicking game is very good as well because of their soccer background
2226390 we respect them were going to have our hands full and we have to be prepared to take them on up front
2226391 for creating and implementing a sales and marketing scheme which significantly misstated the nature and stability of the auction rate market as a result thousands of investors were abandoned with illiquid investments
2226392 for the first time in history a crisis triggered by us housing finance problems is having global ramifications
2226393 financial crisis is heralded in fact defined by sharp discontinuities of asset prices
2226394 there is little doubt that the immediate cause of both the commodities price boom and the credit crisis has been low global interest rates
2226395 struck down by a sudden drying up of a food supply for which they have no responsibility

2226400 im not very good with things when it comes to law my husband took care of all that
2226401 the social security administrations responsibility for protecting benefits from legal process ends when the beneficiary is paid
2226402 its not a banks place to raise an exemption claim for a customer
2226403 i was on my knees it was like our last dollar i didnt even have money to buy gas to get home
2226404 committed to protecting the safety of our customers funds while complying with state and federal law
2226405 we are required to honor valid garnishment orders and are simply following the rules and regulations set forth in federal and state laws
2226406 funds defined as exempt or otherwise excluded under applicable law must not be restrained under this notice
2226407 are not in a position to determine the character of funds at any given point in the account
2226408 a positive role in the economy returning to creditors a portion of their investment which benefits consumers in the form of more credit and lower interest rates
2226409 it isnt the intention of debt buyers to garnish exempt funds
2226410 mrs rice said this caused her more stress than having her stroke
2226411 these people keep garnishing because they know many will just walk away especially these poor little old ladies who need their dollars when they get them
2226412 failed to provide sufficient proof that the funds withheld are exempt
2226413 we had no money for food for thanksgiving we had to eat what we could find
2226414 comply fully with all state and federal laws governing garnishments levies and legal process
2226415 we do what we can to ensure that our customers understand their rights but cannot act as their attorney or agent in applying for exemptions
2226416 just how much alleged thief raymond scott knows about rare first editions only time or perhaps a plea bargain will tell
2226417 thanks to a careful inventory of durham folio pages performed in 1905 a number of its identifying marks are already well known theres a patched hole in the colophon for instance theres on the outside of the book theres a specific annotation regarding troilus and cressida the durham thief faces a particularly nasty bit of bad luck though although reports indicate that a potentially telltale marked up endpaper is now missing in this copy its highly unlikely that a thief would have sliced out the title page with its iconic portrait of shakespeare
2226418 we have three million members we are the biggest political party in the world
2226419 the angolan people are conscious that we were more than 30 years in war and weve only had six years of peace but in six years of peace we have done many things
2226420 our people recognise this and more than that our people recognise that the mpla is the only party that can lead into the future
2226421 its true our economy is growing but its growing badly
2226422 more than 90 percent of the nations wealth is stolen by the state and is concentrated on less than 0 5 percent of the population of around 18 million
2226423 there are some local tensions but these are isolated and localised were not talking about organised intimidation campaigns
2226424 it is essential that we promote the central role of sport in modern society
2226425 everyday sport can deliver substantial social environmental and economic benefits by reducing obesity and cardiac disease and creating a healthy society the ioc wants governments to support elite sport and the olympic movement thats essential but we also want them to invest in public sports facilities
2226426 doping and particularly steroid abuse is a public health issue it is not simply a matter for elite sport it reaches down into amateur sports clubs universities and high schools and causes physical and psychological damage to the user this trickle down effect is what should worry everyone moreover steroid use and crime are inextricably linked many acts of violent crime in society are thought to be connected to steroid use
2226427 it is not by chance that i am using military terms to describe the settlement of the country
2226428 i really didnt think it was a career ending decision until they told me so last december
2226429 i thought what i was doing was right but it was a train wreck waiting to happen
2226430 it had no benefit for the refuge and no relationship to why the refuge was established
2226431 he said some other things which i wont go into but it was pretty ugly
2226432 i put a lot of time and a lot of thinking into working through this issue on the border fence
2226433 and i came to the right conclusion about it but nothing was done in the end because the waiver wiped everything out
2226434 fencing has a symbolic value and it has usefulness in some parts of the border and were going to use it where it is effective the idea that you are going to solve the problem simply by building a fence is undercut by the fact that yesterday we discovered a tunnel so the idea that fencing alone is a solution i think is overly simplistic
2226435 were asking you were inviting you to tell us how to run our organization
2226436 this is an invitation to be a little bit aggressive thinking as if you were owner and you were partners with cbp u s customs and border protection
2226437 they screwed up the virtual fence and 20 6 million was flushed down the toilet no problem
2226438 now theyve been given additional money to redo it its nothing more than political symbolism
2226439 the fence is not a deterrent for the high level organized criminal organizations operating on both sides of the border
2226440 guns one way dope the other way human smuggling stolen vehicles those activities are now organized and if you talk to border patrol agents who dont have to carry the party line theyll tell you its not the poor pelado coming across to wash dishes in some restaurant thats a threat its the cartels that control nuevo laredo and juarez in texas and naco nogales and agua prieta in my state
2226441 when i first filed this bill some of my colleagues thought it was a real pain in the ass
2226442 nobody thought the fence would be built then their communities started calling them
2226443 a lot of what we need to do as democrats in congress is not panic and stick our tails between our legs at the tactics that homeland security uses such as oh if youre not for waiving 36 laws building a fence and putting the safety of the nation above a species then you are obviously pro terrorist open borders and dont care about the security of our nation
2226444 its been a very convenient political hammer on both sides of the aisle
2226445 i think we can provide some real oversight over these agencies and at least minimize the damage and hold it until the new administration can come in and clean it up
2226446 thats the long term strategy for me holding the dogs at the gate until we can have a more rational look at border security and border policy because everything we are doing right now is in response to being perceived as a political advantage or disadvantage and so when you create policy that way like with the border fence it is doomed to failure those policies have no lasting strength to them
2226447 they squeezed port of entry funding better security and flow of traffic money slated for ports of entry to build it
2226448 there is a military mentality toward this now in the department of homeland security they use words like operational management operational control they didnt want to deal with the national environmental policy act because homeland security feels it is to some extent part of the defense department and that oversight should be minimal and secretive the national environmental policy act is an open and public process and in that culture they feel its their prerogative to be closed about it for security reasons
2226449 this administration has made sure their allies have found a way to make money out of it
2226450 many of them show interest but they always ask have any other republicans signed on to the bill no one wants to be the first republican to sign on
2226451 so the point quite honestly is to continue to move the issue you dont want it to disappear we want to put this in front of the american people and say ok the border fence is not going to solve the problem you perceive because a it is dividing communities and b its a waste of money and its affecting the environment and our constitutional principles such as private property and sovereign rights for native people
2226452 the border fence really threw the service for a loop
2226453 they wrote this policy about appropriate uses to protect the refuges as much as possible from political decisions
2226454 you hear about a wildlife refuge and the border fence on fox news and they always paint it as black and white
2226455 do you want to save an ocelot or have our border secure its a ridiculous question because we ought to be able to have both
2226456 the work of this congress will be seen as a watershed where we turned away from an outmoded depression era approach to financial regulation and adopted a framework that will position our financial services industry to be world leaders into the new century
2226457 my position with the campaign is i am the senators friend
2226458 it would be a mistake to call me an economic adviser
2226459 im so out of it i dont even know who jon stewart is
2226460 gramm has been a central player in two major economic crises the credit crisis and the incredibly high price of energy hes got his fingerprints all over legislative efforts that led to this
2226461 ive never seen any evidence that opening up competition among banks and insurance companies in any way contributed to this
2226462 youve got a lot of people trying to rewrite history youve got people with an ax to grind they always wanted more government regulation and when you have a problem they want the government to regulate more
2226463 not against government at all his career has been finding ways to make money for his friends its a predator relationship government is his food supply
2226464 gramm both looks like a snapping turtle and has the personality of one
2226465 didnt go to washington to be loved and was not disappointed
2226466 was the beneficiary of my help and recipient of my na ve faith his name was phil gramm
2226467 phil gramm promised me that if he were favored by a budget committee assignment he would make his arguments within the committee and then would close ranks and back whatever budget resolution the committee majority approved
2226468 it was strongly deregulatory and did not address safety and soundness
2226469 some people jokingly refer to it as the citigroup relief act
2226470 normally they would have had to spin off their insurance activities
2226471 aggressive swashbuckling high risk practices that might have been frowned upon in the banking industry but which were viewed as typical say on wall street
2226472 may have even set the stage for both the collapse and the subsequent rescue of bear stearns by the federal reserve
2226473 encouraged to push the envelope in terms of risk taking and were not entirely dissuaded from thinking that the public purse would be available if things went horribly wrong
2226474 were a key factor in encouraging lenders to feel they could make loans without knowing the risks or whether the loan would be paid back the commodity futures modernization act freed them of federal oversight
2226475 banks were doing these trades in direct violation of federal law
2226476 without phil gramm adding that 262 page bill onto an 11 000 page appropriations bill in 2000 it never would have seen the light of day
2226477 it was a lame duck congress racing off to christmas recess it was not an orderly process
2226478 unfairly increased the cost of energy in the united states
2226479 inserted at the last minute without any opportunity for debate into commodity legislation that was attached to an omnibus appropriations bill in the waning hours of the 106th congress
2226480 the loophole has helped foster the explosive growth of trading on unregulated electronic energy exchanges
2226481 it also rendered the u s energy markets more vulnerable to price manipulation and excessive speculation with resulting price distortions
2226482 i dont know what provision in the law hes talking about
2226483 all that unregulated electronic energy trading was made permissible by gramm
2226484 he called me up at my home to tell me i was wrong
2226485 i was sitting in my study preparing for classes he started arguing with me that i was wrong i said if you insist on believing that then you dont know what your own legislation did i had to terminate the call because he would have kept me on the phone forever
2226486 i wouldnt blame swaps for the problem you could make the argument that without them things would have been worse
2226487 look at the lessons of the subprime problem and learn what we can learn loan generators and how they are compensated what banks ought to be required to find to lend a variable rate
2226488 i am quite confident phil gramm didnt understand what his legislation did it was written by the banks and hedge funds
2226489 investment banks should either choose to be regulated as banks or should arrange to conduct their affairs to not require the stopgap support of the federal reserve
2226490 new government oversight of the arcane world of credit default swaps a business with a notional value and risk of 50 trillion
2226491 it was the interlocking relationships between thousands of investors and banks over credit default swaps that pushed the fed to help rescue bear stearns
2226492 as californians suffer the consequences of their own feckless policies political leaders in california blame the power companies deregulation and everyone but themselves the inevitable call is now being heard for a federal bailout i intend to do everything in my power to require those who valued environmental extremism and interstate protectionism more than common sense and market freedom to solve their electricity crisis without short circuiting taxpayers in other states
2226493 thats like claude rains in casablanca saying he was shocked shocked to find out gambling was occurring in his establishment
2226494 im carrying so much pork im beginning to get trichinosis
2226495 i know a political zealot when i see one i am one
2226496 gramm in many ways really built the republican party in this state he would actively recruit candidates to run he would go to a fundraiser for anybody who would ask he would do endorsements for people who were elected officials or who wanted to be elected officials from county commissioner to state rep to state senator
2226497 by being there to help them raise the money that spoke in volumes about credibility because you cant run an effective campaign without being able to do television advertising
2226498 proponents of the sale are already here visiting with folks to lay out their case
2226499 these projections assume that texas could match the per capita sales rates of lotteries in maryland georgia and virginia yet part of what drives higher sales in those states are games now prohibited in texas the ubs proposal also suggests the texas lottery could boost sales by moving into interactive television and the internet
2226500 i cant fathom where we would be had phil gramm led this country for eight years
2226501 the no complaining rule positive ways to deal with negativity at work
2226502 obviously in your mind one is permitted one attitude to this question and one only otherwise the ridicule comes out
2226503 kampung juga menjadi urat nadi dan jantung kota sebagian besar tenaga kerja dan kegiatan ekonomi kota didukung oleh kampung dan warganya
2226504 we believe that unison on ubuntu is a killer app for linux and a great option for any small or medium business it is more powerful and far more affordable than the microsoft alternative with the user friendliness and wide distribution of ubuntu we expect this partnership to further accelerate the growth of both linux in business it as well as unified communications
2226505 unison is a solution that makes unified communications simple and affordable on linux we are happy to partner with unison technologies and spread the word that linux offers a superior platform for business it now including unified communications
2226506 they reduce their it management and costs at the same time as boosting productivity by as much as 15 we expect to see a rapid adoption of unison as companies realize the enormous benefits they can gain with relatively little cost
2226507 we should not in the west concentrate only on negative things in china
2226508 there is no return possible because this country over the last year has been in the center of the attention
2226509 if your answer is that you want to sell comics for a living because you have have a passion for comics im unimpressed alcoholics have a passion for liquor but thats certainly not a good reason for them to be operating a liquor store in fact ive seen a large number of comics stores fail because the owners were so wrapped up in their love of comics that they forgot that they were running a business
2226510 the incumbent has openly admitted he doesnt read the bills so i dont understand how he knows what hes doing up there
2226511 craddick has been very good to me hes appointed me as the chairman of natural resources which is very good for this area
2226512 he tends to favor hardin county over newton county and orange county simply because there are more republicans there
2226513 theyre going to get nasty and make up lies and do all sorts of stuff
2226514 i think in a strange ironic way that says were making a difference
2226515 im going to say the same thing i said two years ago the numbers certainly do not favor garcia
2226516 this isnt a case of going through the revolving door
2226517 its a case of being stuck in the revolving door
2226518 like me hunter started as a democrat and like me hes always been a conservative
2226519 the role the government has in caring for our most vulnerable
2226520 a lifelong affinity for folks who work the land to provide us with food
2226521 i just dont think we should toll roads that have already been paid for with tax dollars
2226522 the last thing williamson county families need right now is another foot soldier for the out of touch extremists in the legislature
2226523 we need to get away from the cronyism and the bullying that has gone on for a while
2226524 i am a young man im going to do things a 50 year old man might not do it doesnt mean i dont have the qualifications the local knowledge the passion
2226525 im concerned about limiting freedom of speech and about the other candidate taking outside contributions
2226526 im not going to walk into this fight with one arm tied behind my back
2226527 my agenda is not a republican agenda or a democrat agenda its a house district 85 agenda
2226528 now its a state problem its a local government problem with regards to higher costs to health care higher costs to public education because of people who are here illegally
2226529 im a product of public education so ive seen it from many directions as a student as a school board member i have many family members who are teachers
2226530 people who came out to vote in the democratic presidential primary want change and have an interest in seeing our government on the state and the national level take a different course
2226531 zedler wants to take money out of public schools for private school vouchers
2226532 texas has the highest percentage of uninsured kids its absolutely unconscionable and yet the lege cut 200 000 kids off chip
2226533 i think its a little na ve to think that just democrats are going to turn out
2226534 there hasnt been a democratic challenger in mesquite for a long time
2226535 i do think it will be an expensive race and i am in the fundraising process right now
2226536 i dont want to speculate on whether republicans will come out to vote this election
2226537 but some republican voters have told me they were turned off by the negative attacks during the primary
2226538 people are experiencing a lot of foreclosures and rising utility rates and gas prices
2226539 they are feeling the pinch in their spending and having to make difficult choices
2226540 during the primary we had 15 000 voters more than double the republican primary voters in the district we had a stunning show of democratic activism
2226541 were all born the same way but were not equal everybody gets perks
2226542 a national political group suspected of voter fraud is currently working in your neighborhood trying to bring people to the polls on election day do not be a victim of voter fraud it could result in jail time for you
2226543 most significant accomplishment that is the kind of responsible government this district and our state deserve
2226544 frankly i thought they would run someone more moderate against me
2226545 i came here as a refugee and not having any money everything was dependent on public education
2226546 last cycle it was so incredibly difficult to get anyone interested
2226547 things come into focus when you are a first time parent
2226548 ive worked in district 144 for the past 14 years in the mortgage lending business with more than 2 000 families as theyve purchased homes
2226549 they are solid working class people who want to make sure their interests are looked out for and not the interests of austin
2226550 i spent five years walking door to door building a mortgage business
2226551 im no stranger to knocking on doors and shaking hands
2226552 what the republican party stands for limited growth of government and people who take responsibility for themselves
2226553 the cost of illegal immigration for the hospital district and school district and high increases in tax appraisals
2226554 i am raising small amounts from hundreds and hundreds of people in the district while he is raising large chunks of money out of district from special interest groups
2226555 i know it takes money to get the message out there but elections are won by votes not by money
2226556 it was portrayed as not a decent place to live and at below minimum standards and i dont agree with that
2226557 every tour since the fall of 2000 every major tour in the u s and other places in the world ive joined third day on their tour bus as what they call their road pastor
2226558 basically doing church on the road with them making sure that we pray together we read the bible together fellowship together just using the time wisely that we have when we travelling
2226559 you have a bunch of wires coming out of your shirt and pants
2226560 my whole dispute with them was when is he going to get psychiatric treatment
2226561 i think they had to get to the root of his problems like why was he so angry why was he so destructive i really think they needed to go in his head somehow and figure this out
2226562 you dont want to stick with our treatment plan pick him up
2226563 if a parent doesnt want the use of the skin shock and wants psychiatric treatment this isnt the right program for them
2226564 mommy you dont love me anymore because you let them hurt me so bad
2226565 he had so many medicines in him hed take a two hour nap in the morning hed take a two hour nap in the afternoon theyd have him in bed at eight oclock at night he was sleeping his life away
2226566 for him to have an electrode on and to receive a ged is to me a much more favorable way of dealing with this
2226567 hell automatically comply to whatever my signal command may be whether it is put on your seatbelt or hand me that apple or sit appropriately and eat your food
2226568 its made him a human being a civilized human being
2226569 i decided my mission was to start a utopian community
2226570 i would retreat to my own room and shed be trying to pull away and get into my room and id have to hold the door on one side to keep her from disturbing me
2226571 she would walk around with a toy broom and whack people over the head
2226572 instead of being an annoyance she became a charming addition to the house
2226573 its true that pinches were being used as an aversive
2226574 to grow his fingernails longer so he could give an effective pinch
2226575 violated the most basic codes and standards of decency and humane treatment
2226576 to give a spank or a muscle squeeze or a pinch you had to control the student physically and that could lead to a struggle
2226577 i thought his life was in the balance i couldnt find any medical solution he was vomiting losing weight he was down to 52 pounds i knew it was risky to use the shock in large numbers but if i persevered that day i thought maybe it would eventually work there was nothing else i could think of to do but by the time it went into the 3 000 or 4 000 range it became clear it wasnt working
2226578 as it turns out thats really not a wise approach
2226579 its sort of like operating a car and wearing out the brakes because you never really apply them strongly enough instead we set it at a certain level that was more or less going to be effective for most of our students
2226580 these people are so used to pain that they can adapt to almost any kind of aversive you give them
2226581 the treatment is so powerful its hard not to use if you have seen how effective it is
2226582 its brief its painful but there are no side effects its two seconds of discomfort
2226583 they havent seen children like this so they cannot imagine these are children for whom positive only procedures did not work drugs did not work and if it wasnt for this treatment some of these people would not be alive
2226584 the field has moved away from painful stimuli because of public outcry and because weve devised better techniques
2226585 there appears to be a mission of that program to use shock for problem behaviors it doesnt matter what that behavior is
2226586 he may have gotten his ph d at harvard but he didnt learn what hes doing at harvard whatever hes doing he decided to do on his own
2226587 hes a very smart man but hes an embarrassment to his profession
2226588 ive never been able to figure out if matt is a little off kilter and actually believes all this stuff or whether hes just a clever businessman
2226589 we had to wait until we were in brs to communicate with others
2226590 that was the only time you really laughed had fun hung around with your friends because usually you cant talk to them it was basically like we had to have enemies they didnt want us to be friendly with nobody
2226591 on paper it does look like theyre being educated because we have lesson plans
2226592 to self teach is not exciting why would the kids want to sit there and read a chapter on their own without any discussion
2226593 mark theres no stopping work work on your task please
2226594 attempt to be as discreet as possible and hold the transmitter out of view of the student
2226595 we hear the sound of a staffer picking up a sled
2226596 then we turn around and see the person jump out of their seat
2226597 but if its an antecedent for aggression it may have to be treated with an aversive
2226598 if we had only severely autistic students they couldnt talk to you and say gee this is really helping me
2226599 now for the first time we have students like katie who can tell you it helped them
2226600 it took me off all my medicine i was close to 200 pounds and im 160 now
2226601 i kind of felt like i was walking on eggshells i had to watch everything i said sometimes a curse word would just come out of my mouth automatically so being on the geds and knowing that swearing was a targeted behavior where i would receive a ged application it really got me to think twice before i said something disrespectful or something just plain out rude
2226602 well i have learned to control it but im not going to lie when im on the phone curse words come out
2226603 i hope youre not going to tell me youre aggressive
2226604 no no no the worst thing i do sometimes is me and my mom get into little arguments
2226605 they told her to step up to be searched she didnt want to step up to be searched so they gave her one
2226606 raquel you did a great job thank you for taking the time
2226607 some of the things she said are not true some of them are our students obviously have a tendency to lie about things
2226608 it would take five staff to restrain him because hes so wiry
2226609 a lot of aggression a lot of disruptive behavior whenever he was asked to do a task that he didnt feel like doing he would scream yell swear the stuff that would come out of his mouth you wouldnt believe very sexually inappropriate
2226610 the first time you give someone a ged is the worst one
2226611 you dont want to hurt somebody you want to help
2226612 hey did you see the red sox game last night
2226613 we dont want them discussing their social life or the ball games in front of the students or while theyre on duty
2226614 so well sometimes actually have one staffer deliberately start a social conversation with another and well see whether the other as he or she should will say i dont want to discuss that now
2226615 say you had a hospital that was the only hospital in the nation that had chemotherapy and they were treating people who had the common cold with it
2226616 i think the extreme to which they abuse their power has outweighed what good they do
2226617 we refused to meet with her unless the parents could be in the same room
2226618 she talked to the parents and they really gave it to her
2226619 i dont think it was a positive thing for her career

2226630 most of the time i get to fight the war and go home and see the wife and kids at night
2226631 it is quite different going from potentially shooting a missile then going to your kids soccer game
2226632 clear open military aggression from one osce country to another its neighbor unfortunately
2226633 there are two sides of conflict in this conflict south ossetia and georgia
2226634 this is not a military operation this is an anti criminal operation
2226635 if this is not war then i wonder what is

2226638 i remember reading a small business administration sba pamphlet 30 years ago which laid out the hard facts that 70 of new businesses started in america fail within three years and that 85 fail within five years for the specialized area of comics retailing those percentages were actually a bit optimistic very few of the stores that were opened from 1988 1999 are still in business and ill bet that 75 of those that are still open could be purchased for net asset value with no consideration given for the enterprise as an ongoing business
2226639 what most comics retailers never figure out until its too late is that they are losing money every day that they are open for business they accumulate lots of inventory and come to believe that owning lots of stuff is the same thing as making a profit well thats only true if you have a cost effective mechanism for turning your stuff into cash if you dont own such a mechanism youre not generating a profit youre simply adding to your storage cost burden eventually that burden combined with a lack of cash flow will kill your business
2226640 comics retailers are notorious for seldom liquidating slow product and as a result what you see in a store is not what their customers are seeking but rather what they got stuck with
2226641 do not go gentle into that good night rage rage against the dying of the light

2226648 and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2226649 i am disappointed and angry thousands of friends and supporters of senator edwards put their faith and confidence in him and he has let them down
2226650 young supporters who put their time and energy into his campaign with a newfound energy and idealism for politics have been betrayed by his actions but the issues we cared about and fought for poverty worker justice clean environment and healthcare for all are issues worth continuing to fight
2226651 people are human and they make mistakes i feel bad for his family and i feel bad for him im sure this is one of those times when being human catches up with you
2226652 the answer is not completely clear but evidence strongly suggests it probably came from humans
2226653 ought not be feeding the endless economic growth that threatens the biological systems on which human health depends

2226658 but the danger in africas impoverished countryside is that private companies with modern technologies will invest too little rather than too much
2226659 is a rich world argument that is hurting the poor
2226660 is that food crop production and export crop production have both faltered badly in africa in recent decades
2226661 we have not been able to find any evidence of harm
2226662 that is no justification to give them poison to give them food that is intrinsically dangerous to their health
2226663 m any international ngos do not take poverty and hunger as a starting point
2226664 many are in the business of exporting to africa visions of environmentalism anti corporate populism and organic food purity that exclude science and are a mismatch to africas needs
2226665 there is no direct relationship between the amount of food a country produces and the number of hungry people who live there
2226666 there should be no timetable for pulling out of iraq or afghanistan
2226667 when we legislate issues like school prayer and gay marriage we end up excluding people who would otherwise be republicans
2226668 i think we should apply that small government philosophy to social issues
2226669 you can give me a hair test right now because i dont use that stuff anymore
2226670 are you saying we should use marijuana instead of gasoline
2226671 were going to approve a piece of paper that no ones going to read for two years

2226673 somebody has to speak for the unborn in the democratic party
2226674 the problem isnt that conservative principles in recent years in washington d c have been tried and found wanting theyve been abandoned

2226687 it takes a pretty special game to carry such a lengthy title and be able to hold its head high amongst games with much shorter names
2226688 thankfully we dont have to worry about fitting this title on a package
2226689 the substantial weight of the evidence reflects that the employers information requests were both relevant and necessary for the employer to determine the identity of the labor organization with which it had an obligation to bargain
2226690 we have doubted for some time that local 715 continued to exist as a union and are pleased with this ruling
2226691 these employees have the same rights pay and benefits whether represented by a union or not
2226692 from all the indications at the moment they had an unlikely involvement but we dont want to draw that definite conclusion at the moment
2226693 random victim of identity theft at the hands of major drug traffickers
2226694 this crime was compounded by law enforcement when it illegally invaded the calvo home tied up the mayor and his mother in law and killed the family dogs
2226695 the calvo family is still waiting for an explanation from law enforcement as to how this could possibly have happened
2226696 i could not give joachim l w any guarantees that i would extend my career beyond this one year for which i have signed a contract with the vfb stuttgart therefore i offered l w and k pke my resignation i had a great run in the national team these last few years in england the national team had been my contact home more than any other event i will always remember the 2006 world cup
2226697 we had a very good discussion evaluating the situation we were on the exact same wavelength i thanked jens for his great career in our team fans will always remember his fantastic saves in our win over argentina at the 2006 fifa world cup he also played a pivotal role at the euro this year he has done so much for german football and i chose to consult him in most important matters
2226698 when i caught it it scared me it was very aggressive it snapped his jaw and snorted at me when i tried to get it it cut the hook in half leaving part of it in its mouth
2226699 ive never caught a fish like that in my life
2226700 ive got no doubt that he can handle it and im looking forward to see how he does
2226701 it is baseball but with a plastic bat and a ball with holes

2226704 i wasnt exactly sure what to say to you except to start with god i love our country and i love what we stand for and i love being with you
2226705 we urge the chinese to do what other countries have done to sanction to put a financial squeeze on the burmese generals
2226706 while these camps are supposed to be temporary camps in reality some people have been living here for over 20 years some were born in the camps and now they have their own children
2226707 they are entirely dependent on handouts which is not good socially or psychologically
2226708 it is a protracted emergency which is hard to keep in the news but there is human rights abuse going on virtually every day in eastern myanmar
2226709 the noble cause has many devoted champions and i happen to be married to one
2226710 bueno pero ha provocado muchos goles un jugador yo nunca he estado de acuerdo en darle cr dito nica y exclusivamente al jugador es m s yo creo que todas esas premiaciones que hay del goleador y no solo del goleador si no del mejor t cnico porque hay varias todas son individuales
2226711 yo pienso que simplemente se le debe dar al campe n porque el campe n es el equipo es en equipo es el trabajo es directiva cuerpo t cnico y jugadores lo dem s sale sobrando para mi se los digo en serio no creo en esos premios de l der goleador el campe n goleador no aqu en este equipo al que le toque meterla que bueno no solo de eso vive un jugador y menos premiarlos ni revisar desde cu ndo no mete goles si no ver cu ntos ha provocado es lo mismo para mi eso no cuenta
2226712 y kik n es un hombre que esta trabajando para el equipo y con el equipo entonces no me caus mucha sorpresa no sorpresa porque a este se or eriksson le gusta jugar por los lados tambi n le gusta tener extremos que por cierto ya les han nombrado de otra forma ni modo es problema de ustedes los medios medio por derecha medio por izquierda yo prefiero llamarle extremo por derecha y extremo por izquierda como siempre se les ha llamado pero es un extremo natural el kik n que as fue campe n con los pumas cuando hugo s nchez fue campe n dos veces aqu por las necesidades del equipo lo pusimos del lado izquierdo l kik n con su calidad profesional que tiene lo acept gustoso y nos ha dado resultados yo creo que las necesidades del equipo fue lo que priv en la conciencia del kik n y se merece el llamado a la selecci n
2226713 we urge restraint on all sides that violence would be curtailed and that direct dialogue could ensue in order to help resolve their differences
2226714 we continue to be candid about our belief that all people should have the freedom to say what they think and worship as they choose
2226715 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2226716 candor is most effective when nations have built a relationship of respect and trust
2226717 ive worked hard to build that respect and trust i appreciate the chinese leadership that have worked hard to build that respect and trust
2226718 we resolutely oppose any words or actions which interfere in the internal affairs of another country in the name of issues such as human rights and religion
2226719 youd have to ask quentin i know tim roth and i were attached to it for two or three years he told me what my characters name was and we talked a lot about it but seeing he has this deal with the weinstein company and now they seem to be going to the studios im not really sure im hopeful therell be a role in there for me somewhere
2226720 i wouldnt say its obviously not going to happen it wouldnt be my decision not to do it it would be johns who would most likely resist the doing of that of course forgetting that quentin turned his life around and changed the course of his career quentin at one time told me the vega brothers could never happen because it would have to be a prequel and john doesnt look the same anymore and neither do i
2226721 and said i know how we can make the vega brothers you guys will be the twin brothers of vincent and vic and youre both coming back to l a to avenge the deaths of your brothers youre both on a flight to los angeles and you dont know he even exists i thought that was a cool idea theres a lot more on how hed do that but i couldnt reveal that to you im all for it though id never say never
2226722 no matter how many no 12s get eliminated from my team i will still have a few more left go no 12
2226723 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2226724 candor is most effective where nations have built a relationship of respect and trust
2226725 ive worked hard to build that respect and trust i appreciate the chinese leadership that have worked hard to build that respect and trust
2226726 it is a commitment to strengthen that foundation for years to come
2226727 we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
2226728 chinese citizens have freedom of religion these are indisputable facts
2226729 weve had these back and forths with china for years
2226730 im not making any predictions about medal counts but i can tell you the u s athletes are ready to come and compete in the spirit of friendship
2226731 it is very disappointing here you have this designation as a monument and there has been less visible activity going on in the monument
2226732 it is wonderful that our nation has made a commitment and this administration deserves a lot of credit for designating the worlds largest marine reserve but there is a responsibility that goes along with that
2226733 unfortunately in recent years the u s has not made picking up trash in our most special places in the ocean a priority
2226734 decided to reduce its level of commitment to removing marine debris and only address new accumulations
2226735 the administration is not keeping pace and this is disappointing
2226736 additional cleanup and prevention resources are needed to protect this
2226737 its asking a lot for a monument proclamation to do that but you have to start some place
2226738 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
2226739 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
2226740 we resolutely oppose any words or actions which interfere in the internal affairs of another country in the name of issues such as human rights and religion
2226741 we are making clear to china that being a global economic leader carries with it the duty to act responsibly on matters from energy to the environment to development in places like africa
2226742 its only than shwe and a few other generals who want to isolate burma so i told him engagement was very important
2226743 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
2226744 ok what is really going on and how does this play out in the next year
2226745 a strong consensus on the need to examine how the instruments of communion will best work
2226746 the bible does not address the matter of appropriate behavior for those who are for whatever reason homosexual by instinct or nature
2226747 we wanted to show the bush legacy while hes still in office and look at his many disasters over the last several years
2226748 we thought what are his library and museum going to look like and how can we counter that this is a type of museum on wheels so more people can see it
2226749 were used to it but we are tired of it
2226750 it is to play in the premiership to play in the best league is everyones dream
2226751 i also need to think about my family i have to provide for them like all africans do when they make it
2226752 however i want to leave in good spirits with their blessing so hopefully they are talking and it will be fine i think
2226753 in an interview for broadcast tonight on nightline edwards told abc news correspondent bob woodruff he did have an affair with 44 year old rielle hunter but said that he did not love her
2226754 the mainstream medias reaction to the national enquirers reports on john edwards
2226755 edwards is no longer an elected official and he is not running for office now dont expect wall to wall coverage
2226756 of course i mean for a lot of americans including the family that i grew up with i mean its fundamental to how you judge people and human character whether you keep your word whether you keep what is your ultimate word which is that you love your spouse and youll stay with them i think the most important qualities in a president in todays world are trustworthiness sincerity honesty strength of leadership and and certainly that goes to a part of that
2226757 the slow adoption of vista among businesses and budget conscious cios coupled with the proven success of a new type of microsoft free pc in every region provides an extraordinary window of opportunity for linux
2226758 this specific occs linux desktop is far more profitable than microsoft preloads because it contains two free technologies the linux os and instead of ms windows and office
2226759 for most organizations the time is not yet right for linux on the desktop
2226760 but even there there are already some windows pcs and windows applications and linux has had better but still limited traction as a client platform
2226761 so they will either have to migrate those applications off windows at tremendous cost or pay to run them on windows further eradicating the value proposition
2226762 may not run on linux or which may require significant migration costs of their own
2226763 for a green field environment with no windows apps linux is a viable choice as is
2226764 anytime youre getting a whole different machine youre going to be more willing to try a new operating system
2226765 everybody else in the game is happy to see that microsoft isnt holding all the cards this time
2226766 they were afraid that linux was going to get a toehold
2226767 we believe our customers value windows because of its enhanced application and hardware compatibility security reliability and customer support
2226768 this oil mafia is taking the money out of my pocket to put it into footballers this mafia controls the whole world and manipulates the oil price i am not prepared to put up with it much longer
2226769 bobs road oh come on bobs road no thats close very close very close for me that is you see i bike a lot i bike thirty miles every weekend so bobs road isnt a huge distance for me i love biking
2226770 i am better than you and let me show you the proof by killing you with my bare hands
2226771 really do people actually get so addicted to video games that it actually turns into a health issue
2226772 what does linux need to do to compete more successfully on the desktop
2226773 will call of duty 4 a ps3 game work on the ps2
2226774 yes but you have to mod your ps2 1st you have go buy a ps3 then you pretend its the ps2 and batta bing itll work
2226775 weve always said that the olympics is one of the most powerful properties in all of television
2226776 while we are thrilled with this milestone we still expect to write more business as the games begin and great stories continue to evolve
2226777 olympics are far more than just a boost for nbc universal theyre also an unprecedented experiment with online content distribution bound to transform the way media companies distribute their content

2226790 we are pleased to welcome kevin everett as the grand marshal of the zippo 200
2226791 his story has inspired people all across the country especially those of us in this area who followed it so closely to have him here to start the race is a testament to his courage and determination and a real honor for us
2226792 this will be one of the big 12s better defenses
2226793 the talent is too plentiful to underachieve much like they did last year nebraska has been making strides since the embarrassment of two years ago big 12 opponents need to beware
2226794 the husker linebackers are considered the finest in the conference
2226795 linebacking is the strength of this defense led by two two year starters the secondary will be better establishing a defensive line will be key
2226796 in the north youll most likely see the nebraska cornhuskers emerge and meet up with south champ oklahoma in the big 12 championship game
2226797 nebraska proved to be difficult for other teams to figure out defensively expect more of the same this season the linebackers look to dominate the middle while the secondary should be a winner this could be one of nebraskas best the big 12 north looks like a shoe in the big 12 championship is a possibility as is a bcs bowl bid and victory
2226798 but crazy blog guy that was all kevin cosgroves fault we have a whole new start now
2226799 lets try not to suck and we can build from that

2226804 missouri has compiled the following records the last 5 years
2226805 and by the way i dont give a fuck if it was 40 or 43 or 50 if you want facts go to espn
2226806 if nu finishes with more than 4 wins you fail
2226807 was enough to show you what was an actual quote
2226808 if you hate it so much why dont you move
2226809 your team might be good now but wait until nu gets back on track
2226810 you have no new material and this blog is stale
2226811 your blog sucks but im going to come back over and over every single day

2226816 looking at the business offering one of the things we continue to look at on a regular basis is price
2226817 i guess the short answer is can we change the ui and apps and not just cost down
2226818 how do we tell consumers and tell our partners on the hardware side how it fits into the ecosystem

2226976 i think most readers would have settled for maybe a surprise pregnancy at the end or something to that effect if meyer really wanted a baby in this story but the fact that it swallowed the whole plot just plain sucks
2226977 i was extremely disappointed with the fourth book i want my money back
2226978 this creepy anti abortion allegory quickly gets literal as the half vampire fetus starts killing bella from the inside out even as it breaks her ribs and sucked the life from her she proclaims i wont kill him but does she have to face the consequences of this choice no because vampire magic suddenly allows mother and father to hear the fetuss thoughts and to discover that it already loves them

2227003 nearly all the republican senators endorsed bush because they knew mccain from serving with him in the senate they so disliked him that they wouldnt support him they have been on the hard end of his behavior

2227055 its amazing how fast commodities have become the last place people want to have their money
2227056 it looks like the bulls have run out of ammo

2227126 obviously the strategy is a little bit different here than it would be at some of the places but you approach it just as you would any other race you want to do as good as you can to get the best result that you can
2227127 its just been a lot of those things happen this year to kind of dampen a weekend or start a weekend and weve recovered from a few of them and a few of them we havent recovered from

2227142 it would almost require a completely separate effort to reach tween boys with a completely different name somehow associated with the disney property to reach these tween males

2227156 i havent faced anything like this to a certain degree i really dont know what im getting into im talking about it from a team standpoint what can i do in a short amount of time to get this team where it wants to go and get myself ready
2227157 its going to be a cram session but it will be fun
2227158 with free agents its a little bit different than with rookies
2227159 he has that wealth of experience and things to associate with what we do we may adjust some verbiage to fast track it as well
2227160 i really dont know these guys and they dont know me
2227161 i think when they get to know me theyll like me and theyll like the way i play and theyll figure out that ill do whatever it takes to win and its about the team
2227162 he just bounced through the locker room talking to everybody like a normal teammate like hes already been here
2227163 it was interesting for him to say lets have some fun
2227164 of all the things he could have said as a guy whos been in the league that long he talked about having fun
2227165 i recognized a guy who loved football i could hear the passion in his voice
2227166 i think my interest at first im sure as we all know was to stay within the division maybe that was a little bit of a vindictive nature or competitive nature or whatever i think in the end that was probably the wrong motive and i realized that was not going to happen there came a point when i realized my initial thoughts were not going to come true that i had to look elsewhere
2227167 im a little bit out of shape compared to all the other guys but i am so excited about this opportunity
2227168 ive never looked forward to doing a conditioning test as much as i have at this point hopefully the mad rush is over

2227175 competing in the olympic games has always been one of my dreams and i wish i would have been able to represent my country alongside my teammates
2227176 we thought he had a very good shot at a medal
2227177 we try to tell the team when we have these types of adversities we still have eight guys in there and were going to try to concentrate on what weve got
2227178 during a day at practice i landed short on the floor after that it was at the point where i couldnt tumble the way i wanted
2227179 this has an impact on my ability to contribute to the teams goals and i believe by continuing i would be putting myself at further risk its best for me to step down and have another athlete fill my position
2227180 you know what the great wall of china means thats what yao means in china
2227181 we have to make sure we play fast tempo because theyre big and we cant let them control the tempo of the game
2227182 the one thing about these games is that they are shorter than nba games
2227183 teams can get hot and stay hot and all of a sudden you find yourselves in a dogfight i think thats a danger you face
2227184 the biggest thing were going to have to control is the jitters its the first game its against china the home team so its a huge deal
2227185 thats who i wanted to meet she gives me hope
2227186 i was walking with lebron and kobe and told those guys who never went to college that this is like college
2227187 it made me miss college life not knowing who youre going to see the olympic village was crazy i loved it
2227188 to meet other athletes and show our respect that were not bigger than a lot of people think we are because we dont stay in the village the u s team is staying at a hotel people always say its a money thing we have more money than them its not about that its more of a security reason more of popularity reasons why we cant stay in the village but its great to over there to show our respects to some of the athletes it was an unbelievable experience for me
2227189 no i dont think anybody would be comfortable with that this is in many ways sad that this is where it came to
2227190 this is the national football league we understand that when we sign on yeah does that put us at risk but theres all kinds of risks in the nfl theres all kinds of risks in life you make the best decisions you can based on what you believe is in the best interests of the green bay packers
2227191 i knew it was going to be over the top but it was beyond what i imagined
2227192 it went from being something you think is going to be so so to you get this chill up the back of your spine at the end
2227193 if i had been watching on tv i probably would have turned it off and said can we get some actual sports on
2227194 i think the best part of the ceremony itself was when the guy was flying around and lighting the torch
2227195 when he was going around over the crowd it was awesome but the real best part was meeting all the other athletes and taking pictures with everybody
2227196 it was amazing to walk out and see the crowd the lighting of the torch was phenomenal it was all very loud and powerful
2227197 watching the opening ceremony is really touching my heart to see all parts of chinese culture represented
2227198 i feel that foreigners dont really understand china but now with the olympics of course they will

2227209 i was really impressed with him tonight because this place plays small and they have a lot of power

2227265 the code of conduct for doctors outlined in the hippocratic oath a vow commonly taken by modern doctors
2227266 the development of hippocratic medicine its aesculapian medicines naturalistic counterpart is considered a turning point in the history of the healing arts although as we have seen at about the same time naturalistic medical paradigms were developing in other ancient civilizations as well the importance of hippocratic medicine rests on the fact that it is the first comprehensive naturalistic medical system of the western world and therefore the source from which scientific medicine would eventually originate

2227344 i am happy with my choice though aberdeen is a great club to play for
2227345 i know the fans got disappointed a few times last season understandably but for the players it was an okay season
2227346 two semi finals playing some great games in europe against some of the biggest teams and we finished fourth in the league which was not too bad

2227351 while i havent closed the chapter on that there is a little bit of an emotional rollercoaster going on while i am disappointed that i didnt make the squad im still a part of the team as an alternate which is an honor but at the same time i feel as if i did my job

2227361 the important thing in the olympics is not to win but to take part just as in life the important thing is not the triumph but the struggle
2227362 probably the number one lesson that i learned out of all of this is that there is much more to being a great human being than getting in an olympic team or winning a war or having a high paying salary

2227454 gordon comes on occasion and oversees the menu and everything else is looked over by him too however we dont know when he might be here
2227455 dagenhams not the easiest game in the world ive been to watch them and the play quite direct
2227456 theyve got a big team and the ball is in the air an awful lot and it suits them there is nothing wrong with that as it suits the players theyve got
2227457 but id prefer to play against a footballing team and match up really like the way we want to play
2227458 reagans dixon roots ran through hollywood and a career as an actor as well as a union leader turned union foe a liberal turned conservative a divorced ladies man turned right wing family values guy
2227459 likewise bill clinton was an amalgam of social and cultural influences an authentic son of working class arkansas who saw himself like obama in brooks formula as a baby boom product of the american meritocracy

2227463 warren kinsellas new book is a must read for anyone interested in political campaigning in canada and not just political campaigning i wish id had the chance to read the war room before i became stephen harpers campaign manager it might have saved me from many mistakes and months of painful learning on the job
2227464 the war room is a rich detailed and substantive primer on how to run a winning war room warts pizza boxes smelly couches and all from a master war roomer
2227465 kinsella has crafted a handy little guide for politicos and non politicos alike just keep it away from the kids
2227466 i dont want to say hes a genius but theres valuable insights here
2227467 i just got one copy but i plan to get more
2227468 hes canadas james carville a must read if you really want to win you need this book
2227469 well i went to chung moo ro last week and it was okay it looks empty so no wait want to go in
2227470 we have a small squad and we had nine players missing for various reasons
2227471 we have players who want a game so we gave them a chance to enjoy themselves in front of a crowd
2227472 im not here to talk about specific players i dont think thats right
2227473 the smoke adds so much character to the meat since a big joint is on there for much longer
2227474 it keeps the coals from flaring up too much as the fat drips on them and makes it more of a roast with more of a smokey flavour
2227475 every barbecue recipe seems to involve a wet marinade with oil and it always catches fire when it drips on the coals
2227476 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2227477 we put in all that time and effort and poured our souls into this campaign its really unfortunate too that what he did now dilutes his credibility on the poverty issue where he really had the change to make a difference
2227478 but hes very good at compartmentalizing whether somethings going on in his family or on the staff hed be able to turn around go on stage and give a brilliant speech so maybe he just compartmentalized those emotions
2227479 she actually is okay im pretty impressed by how shes handling it and her health is stable

2227483 a great job online you do the best job all your writing is beautiful its where the old newspapers were
2227484 you could talk to the next ten fight gamers you meet and not get the same kind of unapologetic depth that you get when you get an eddie goldman

2227486 he got a lot of experience last season and this is the next part of his development
2227487 if he gets his head right he can go on and play at a higher level
2227488 hes a young kid whos got a second chance with us and hopefully he can kick start his career with barrow
2227489 hes at a great age and like six or seven of the other lads in this squad he can go on and have good football league careers
2227490 ive had about ten phone calls off different players already today
2227491 wed love to have a squad of 24 players but our budget doesnt allow us to do that if we bring two players in it will mean two players going out
2227492 its a massive game for us but oxford are one of the favourites theyre the full time team with the big crowds
2227493 i think they will feel the pressure more than us
2227494 we are part time so no one expects anything from us
2227495 our players have all got ears to hear whats been said and eyes to read whats in the newspapers
2227496 these lads dont need any extra motivation they are fighters and when they hear or read people saying they are no good its going to spur them on
2227497 a lot of these big time charlie teams who come down here to expect to roll us over are not going to get it easy at our place
2227498 oxford united will be the prime target and its a massive year for them
2227499 everyone wants to beat them oxford have got to get out of the division
2227500 ive managed to bring artur on loan today for a month so everything is up and ready for crawley away
2227501 i didnt enjoy telling josh this morning but i told him two weeks ago that id have a little look at him and see how it was
2227502 its a difficult one crawley away because josh let six in there it was my call i just had to make a decision thats what get paid for
2227503 whether its the right decision or the wrong decision only time will tell but josh has accepted it very well
2227504 were looking forward to torquay theyre one of the favourites one of the big boys in the league and if we can turn them over it will give everyone at the club a big boost
2227505 weve got a very difficult start once again weve got to prove that were capable of living with these supposed big teams
2227506 weve brought players into the football club who are very good on the ball so we can mix things up

2227511 are obamas eating habits a political liability the question may be trivial but at least its not offensive the only real objection you can make there is that chozicks litany of healthy foodstuffs favored by obama he snacks on met rx chocolate roasted peanut protein bars and drinks black forest berry honest tea a healthy organic brew echoes a similar litany from the day before by john mccains campaign manager rick davis only celebrities like barack obama demand met rx chocolate roasted peanut protein bars and bottles of a hard to find organic brew black forest berry honest tea
2227512 well it turns out that beanpole quote came from a sort of jokey anonymous reply to a message board topic the journal reporter herself created and was the only remotely quotable line in that thread
2227513 and i think our players like it we havent had trouble with the communication and thats something youre always concerned with for four practices and having a bunch of freshmen out there were able to run it pretty good so i like it i think it can help us
2227514 like i said when we first put it in i think the defense likes it because it forces them to play against it lynch said
2227515 because the good teams like illinois and oklahoma state that ran it against us last year did a good job and we couldnt simulate it in practice
2227516 when i got to lexington we had one guy that ran a 4 5 and you meaning the media expected me to win
2227517 lets get married so we can be together for more than 90 days at a time

2227528 i think wolves are a club where if you can get a couple of glamour players that will excite the crowd and give them heroes
2227529 wolves is a big club with a big crowd but i think mick mccarthy will want players that maybe he can develop
2227530 mick bought the kid stearman from leicester and i think he will go on looking for that kind of signing
2227531 but i think somewhere along the way ironically they need a paul ince type of player somebody of that kind of stature to keep them ticking over
2227532 its very ambitious the melodies are lennon and mccartney and the song structures are kind of all over the place its homage to all my indulgences
2227533 unmark as the data is binding from the datetextbox to the database but the problem is that the calendar is returning a string value and the datetextbox is define with datatime type so i get error while refreshing data
2227534 captain you look so young but it looks like you have been around so whats your story
2227535 it was in the second battle of fallujah i was leading my platoon down an alley when someone got behind us huddled behind a wall and began lobbing grenades at us i didnt quite run away fast enough from this particular one and took some shrapnel to my legs
2227536 weve got a fantastic chance of going up this season im really looking forward to it but its now up to the players to deliver
2227537 there was pressure last year when we were bottom of the league and therell be pressure this season to do well but id rather be in the position where everyones expecting us to do well
2227538 im looking forward to it its just a game of football and now we have nothing over our head now we know our penalty local amp nations
2227539 rotherhams got its club back and im going to make sure that we do our level best every game is going to be like a cup final
2227540 two months ago we were dead in the water as a football club there didnt seem to be any way forward no money in the kitty and there didnt seem to be anybody willing to come in
2227541 the smart money would have been on kp being the one day captain
2227542 that would let him ease in to test cricket but they have jumped straight in and its a panic selection
2227543 i personally dont think that michael vaughan should have let it go he said he couldnt sleep at night but weve all been in a situation where it is tough
2227544 maybe if michael had weathered the storm a little bit and got a decent result at the oval it might have changed his mind a little bit
2227545 i will be a big workload for kp but the powers that be have probably realised that he is the only man who could do this
2227546 with this acquisition we have extended our capacity to serve the department of homeland security and expanded our contract portfolio significantly
2227547 does this make you wonder if we are being listened to
2227548 i do have to say if i could make records more and do a movie a year that i love and not have to do the movie that i have to make money on id probably be happier
2227549 they used to shoot people for having this much fun
2227550 fortunately in the last few years ive overcome the whole for the most part actor thing because were pretty well respected in the whole americana music world now
2227551 i think one of the things with my solo records is sometimes they werent quite as cohesive up until maybe hobo and beautiful door because i would have like a rock song and then a country sounding song and then a blues song a bunch of different things
2227552 we come out first as the boxmasters with the whole mod suits and everything and play kind of loud hillbilly music
2227553 and then were off for about 20 minutes and everything changes the lighting and the stage set changes and then we come out and do the big rock show

2227568 i am still very keen to hear from anyone who may be able to assist me in identifying who may be responsible for leaving the baby in the nurses home all those years ago
2227569 i cannot exclude the possibility that the baby was left by a traumatised mother who simply could not cope and who intended the child to be discovered
2227570 i would appeal directly to the mother of the baby to contact me so that this matter can be resolved and so that the baby can have an identity
2227571 i would far rather the mother come forward voluntarily than be identified by dna technology further down the line

2227582 it doesnt really change my mind at all i still like penn state and im still with it
2227583 im going to have to have a serious talk with him im definitely not leaving it up to him we all need to sit down and talk about this because i just want the best for my son and i need to see what type of options he wants to have right now because penn state to me is not a good option
2227584 i kind of moved on from tech and uva when i broke my offers down to five schools
2227585 i thought portis had another good day thats two in a row so well see what happens
2227586 we tap on our glasses and call on them to get up
2227587 i thought he had the best day at quarterback friedgen said threw one interception for a touchdown but other than that
2227588 i actually told offensive coordinator james franklin to put josh against the first team defense and he did a pretty good job i thought he threw the ball well

2227600 shoppers have told us that they want organic produce but want to pay prices closer to the standard equivalent and this is what we have done
2227601 on top of shoppers tighter budgets most uk retailers have increased the price of organic produce as a result of last years poor harvest caused by flooding across the country
2227602 in fact last years organic harvest was the poorest in british farming history and many farmers are still counting the cost of a much lower yield
2227603 i think that was really a great launching pad for my career
2227604 the chance to get in front of those guys and play for 10 000 to 15 000 people every night was a huge deal for us

2227609 people just assumed there was something wrong like i must have gotten dropped for a reason
2227610 we were playing a show in portland ore just a little acoustic show and we went into hicktown and the place just went crazy we couldnt even hear ourselves for people singing to us and that was the first time when i got the feeling that we had a hit
2227611 the 70s had a whole bunch of bad clothes but my wardrobe was picked out for me from the good stuff i actually had to lose weight for the role so that i could have a skinnier more 70s physique ive been starving for a year
2227612 it was named sebastian and thats gotten out of control
2227613 the moment they called wrap on the last episode i shaved it off i feel like myself again i was at a restaurant the other day and a woman asked me if i was a porn star

2227615 im so glad so many people loved the show the way they did and they can still watch the dvds

2227750 republicans in congress have taken this stand on capitol hill and across the nation in town halls and coffee shops to protest the fact that congress took a five week paid vacation without ever taking a vote on giving the american people more access to american oil
2227751 we will stand our ground we will take our case to the american people and we will not relent until the speaker of the house calls congress back into session and allows a vote on a comprehensive energy bill that includes more drilling

2227763 their defense played very well and gave us big problems
2227764 its pretty physically tiring as well you have to make sure you dont spend too much energy off the court and try to save it all for the match
2227765 i know people expect more from me after the last five years but i can still save this season with this or the us open and right now the focus is on the olympics
2227766 to say this season has been bad because i didnt win that epic is a bit hard

2227772 i really like pierre dreossi the clubs everton general manager and i believe that is reciprocal
2227773 everton are offering me us 2 26 million a year rennes could never offer me that much
2227774 i owe everything to rennes my formative club but they must understand me in africa i have a family to feed and i am very ambitious
2227775 everton are a very established club in the premier league managed by david moyes a coach who puts trust in youngsters
2227776 i have spoken to him on the phone he wanted to invite me to visit the club i hadnt the time to do it
2227777 it annoys me when i hear the rennes directors say i am going to extend my contract i am not going to extend my contract
2227778 rennes must understand me there are things you cant turn down
2227779 i want the directors to come to an agreement i have confidence in that

2227788 but hanging out with him outside of circus hes really funny he told us a couple of really funny jokes they were a little bit inappropriate for younger kids he comes out a little bit more
2227789 theyre bringing not only their own culture but the experience that they have coaching
2227790 it doesnt translate into the choreography or the theme of the show but it translates into the tricks and acts themselves and the level of training
2227791 on a day to day basis it doesnt really affect you because you come in and everyone is either a coach of you or a fellow student

2227802 first the customer tells us it would be great if we could do this and we say maybe we can then we go back and brainstorm we strategize to come up with a way to solve that customers dilemma and we try to solve it in a way that will save the customer money and also be marketable for any other customer who has a similar need
2227803 were not a carrier or warehousing company we bring truly unbiased solutions to the table because we dont have to do business in only one segment of the industry we can find the customer the very best price in the field
2227804 there are a lot of people who call themselves logistics who are really resellers they have established a rate with a carrier or carriers and they are simply marking it up and reselling it so naturally they are biased toward one or more carriers thats not us
2227805 we wanted to build the infrastructure correctly to support growth
2227806 we wanted to build the service segments so that there were enough offerings to potential clients and we wanted to build the systems to support all that too
2227807 we can do the same thing successfully for the carrier that we do successfully for the shipper
2227808 because we take it personally it bothers me when a customer is not successful and i dont want that to change
2227809 and i want our staff to feel the same way and they do it bothers them if were not solving the problem so weve added people with expertise in various areas people who also are passionate about what they do
2227810 what we do serves people anywhere and thats going to take off
2227811 it will help our customers and us to have a local presence
2227812 and having offices in multiple time zones will allow us to extend the hours of service available to all of our customers
2227813 with us the customer is always in charge not us this is different from the other so called logistics providers
2227814 if the customer tells us not to use a certain carrier for whatever reason thats fine with us our unbiased approach and our leverage across all segments of the industry are what drive our growth in all areas
2227815 typically we can walk into anybodys organization sight unseen and save them 20 to 30 percent of their transportation costs thats not an indictment of their current situation they are working within their own four walls and they may have reduced their costs four to five percent and feel like they are doing well but because they dont see other industries they arent aware of other tools and other modes that might be available to them and often they simply dont have the leverage that we have
2227816 we can come in with the entire toolbox and help the customer decide which screwdriver to use or we can do a specific job with the right screwdriver or we can hand the customer the screwdriver and let them do the job themselves were always developing new tools for our toolbox and that is very exciting for us
2227817 the feedback that we have received to date is very positive
2227818 providers report that they find the imedconsent software to be both user friendly and intuitive
2227819 physicians are treating more and more patients with complicated skin infections in hospitals across the u s and the emergence of resistant pathogens has made the situation even more complex

2227824 there are so many athletes who want their pictures taken with me
2227825 i dont mind it but every day i cant escape it its not the ideal preparation for winning olympic gold
2227826 we dont intend to make a whole lot of friends here
2227827 the olympic spirit is beating people not living with them
2227828 its one of my dreams to do well at an olympic games
2227829 to win gold would mean as much as a wimbledon victory it would be right up there with my grand slam wins
2227830 carrying the flag was one of those things you can only dream about walking into the stadium and seeing all the swiss flags the athletes on one side and the fans on the other in a stadium as big as ive ever been in was unforgettable

2227832 to be with them there is a really marvellous feeling
2227833 and who can anyone blame roger for wanting to get away from the circus that surrounds him poor roger seems no matter what he says does he can t please the media these days
2227834 i think amdys future lies elsewhere but if he doesnt move before the end of the august transfer window well try and use amdy as best we can
2227835 i think the audience will really enjoy him letting loose like that
2227836 if you look at most of these r rated movies that found an audience its because they were really good
2227837 the r rating allows the filmmakers to truly realize their vision theres no way wedding crashers could have been wedding crashers if you inhibit what it was that owen wilson and vince vaughn were able to do in that movie

2227839 though we dont think this type of advertising is appropriate for college sports we have tried this once before in this country and it didnt work very well
2227840 beer promotion during college sports telecasts undermines the best interests of higher education and compromises the efforts of colleges and others to combat sometimes epidemic levels of alcohol problems on many campuses today
2227841 we find it puzzling that ncaa advertising rules prohibit ads for cigarettes other tobacco products organizations promoting gambling and alcoholic beverages yet continue to allow ads for beverages with alcohol content of 6 percent or less beer the top alcoholic drink of college students
2227842 given the devastating problems caused by underage and excessive drinking much of it in the form of beer this policy makes little sense and flouts the core values of sports and learning
2227843 i think weve taken a very sensible very rationale very conservative approach and weve asked that any company that advertises alcohol during our games continue to include the message drink responsibly on its ads
2227844 i think weve taken about as a conservative an approach as any sport in the country while not everyone agrees 100 percent i think we represent what is a good balance in that opinion
2227845 our bylaws lump together names images and likenesses and the names are being used now so well have to go back and look at this
2227846 we will need to go back and look at our options we certainly are not giving up our model of amateurism

2227849 i started running when i was about six years old by attending the local 5k fun runs on weekends
2227850 i always enjoyed it but never did it competitively until middle school at age 11 i just tried my luck at making the portland team during orientation week of freshman year and luckily conner let me join
2227851 because guam is a member of the international olympic committee and has never had an athlete in track and field meet the olympics b standard qualifications we are allowed to send one male and one female in the events from the 100 meter dash to the 1500
2227852 its something hes had on his agenda the last four years since arriving at portland but theres been a buzz on our team the whole year as soon as guys found out about the opportunity
2227853 dereks a quiet guy and doesnt like to draw attention to himself so one day were just walking to practice and he says coach i got the call the team was very excited for him
2227854 produce a better 800 time than 1500 time in these games
2227855 i know it sounds like a free and easy route to the olympics from an outsiders perspective but the track and field program on guam is still developing and learning
2227856 even when i found out i would represent the island i wanted to train even harder because if guam was going to send me i wanted to make sure i did the best i could to prepare myself for such a competition i expect to run my best and hopefully hit a personal best because of my unqualified status i need to focus on running my own race and not worry about those ahead of me
2227857 i think this is the ultimate athletic opportunity for him i told him youre gonna have every top athlete in the world next to you guam will have a very small contingent and were a small school one of the smallest in division i with about 3 000 students this is the ultimate little guy against the big boys story
2227858 i always wanted to wear the word guam across my chest in the olympics and now i am fulfilling a childhood dream
2227859 im still a little nervous knowing that everyone is going to be watching but im hoping to inspire the youth of guam to take up the sport so that a runner from guam may one day be at the olympics as a fully qualified athlete
2227860 being with tom for so long i had an idea what coach williams was going to be like he was exactly what i was used to i was very comfortable with his style of coaching and the way he said i would play a role on the team
2227861 ive always aspired to reach his accomplishments and i feel like im on my way to doing that
2227862 but hes got those olympic gold medals that he can wear proudly around his neck i havent done that yet so i look up to bart and remind myself that i still have that to accomplish
2227863 he comes to the gym and knows what he has to do as far as our team goes hes the hardest worker once you put in the time and effort like that good things will happen
2227864 a lot of guys say theyre going to treat it like any other competition
2227865 i think thats a mistake because you have to acknowledge that the olympics are enormous and then try to treat it like its just another day at the gym if you are in denial about how big the olympics are it can overwhelm you
2227866 i think jonathan is prepared because he has been through major competitions hes had rough days like he did at the world championships and then he came back in the finals and took fourth in the all around hes comfortable on that world stage now
2227867 being in college ive learned the most important thing to me is the team
2227868 after that anything as an individual would be a bonus if i were to stand on the podium with my teammates that would be so much more satisfying than to be on the podium by myself
2227869 i have been an individual all around champion ive got all american awards but most important to me are the three out of four team championships that ive walked away with all of that has played a huge part in me making the olympic games its been an incredible experience
2227870 i hadnt used facebook since i left college until you piers registered and now ive got lots of friend requests from people i dont know because im linked t

2227872 by raising interest rates to 4 25 percent the central banks have dealt a heavy blow to industry and the market is playing this now
2227873 the economic data for the euro zone is in free fall we have looked at it historically and it usually indicated that earnings expectations are between 40 and 60 percent too high for the coming year

2227882 for us the most important thing is that our client is properly represented and we understand that with time everything will be solved
2227883 we are as surprised as the rest of puerto rico is
2227884 we understand that everyone is presumed innocent and we will wait until the evidence is presented
2227885 its killing us because he gets a lot of open shots
2227886 if he makes just one or two more shots every night were probably winning some close games instead of losing them
2227887 we must all move ahead with what was decided and agreed i know that there are problems and difficulties but solutions should be found for this reason everyone came to solve the problem and to put a definitive end to the conflicts which have torn this area apart
2227888 it is in this direction that we have the responsibility especially monuc and the united nations in front of the international community to see how together we can accelerate the process
2227889 we decided from a brand profile point of view this was a good thing
2227890 the races will take place all over europe and hopefully the middle east and far east as well
2227891 secondly its a chance for us to earn revenue our fans will be able to go to the races and get behind our racing team as well as the football team

2227902 weve been grateful for the tremendous turnout at our most recent workshops which were held at two of the largest anime science fiction and entertainment industry events in north america and we look forward to the upcoming sessions at the 2008 new york anime festival

2227904 the content is just as interesting as the people while most of the insight presented here can probably be found in extras scattered about innumerable anime dvds a more concentrated source of information on the business and its practicalities will be hard to find in various segments interviewees talk about the technical details of actual voice acting performances what the audition process involves how one can break into the business the kind of commitment it takes to do work like this what is needed to be good at the job and the practical realities of being a voice actor
2227905 adventures in voice acting holds great appeal for two types of audiences in unique ways for fans of anime it gives fascinating insights and interviews with the voice actors behind many acclaimed series that have helped to define the anime genre in the western hemisphere for those aspiring to become voice actors adventures in voice acting provides valuable information and frank discussion on what its really like to do this work ultimately weve made this documentary as a testament to the talent and dedication of these fine actors

2227957 we have been saying for years that we have to not only preserve our current fleet of nuclear plants but enlarge it significantly
2227958 the cost of whatever we are going to do is going to be big
2227959 you still have to mine the uranium used in the reactors and mining is a dirty polluting process and you have to store the nuclear waste somewhere waste that can be around for centuries sitting in a storage facility somewhere susceptible to leaks
2227960 the proposed yucca mountain nuclear waste dump is never going to open
2227961 i have successfully fought against the proposal to store nuclear waste in nevada for over two decades because it threatened the health and safety of nevadans and people across our nation

2228006 while the economic environment remains turbulent and challenging i am proud of the progress the bank has made in terms of operating results this year our improvement in net income can be largely traced to our improvement in net interest margin as we have taken steps to effectively deploy the capital raised in our november 2007 stock offering our employees continuing focus on remarkable customer service is evident as our loan growth remains strong and we have begun to experience success in stabilizing our core deposit base
2228007 although i am disappointed with the market values of our investments in freddie mac and fannie mae securities as well as the reduced market values on our investments in pretsls i am extremely pleased with our core loan growth and our strong capital position which is reflected in the banks total risk based capital ratio of 27 81

2228020 mr rosen i suppose it is time that we made contact since i seem to be your favorite new obsession for such a heralded and busy journalist it is obvious that you have an abundance of free time in your daily schedule you have done an exemplary job of exposing the seedy underbelly of duplicitous small town weekly newspapers and the evil doers that run them you have indeed brought us to our knees
2228021 i sincerely apologize for my crimes against you and any perceived damage done to your person or your career accomplishments it was never my intention to cause you harm the article in question was included in other press materials i had received via e mail i used parts of the article as background and did so thinking it was cleared for such use but as you have so subtly pointed out i was mistaken
2228022 it must have taken years of seasoned investigative know how to push me off my lofty perch it takes a dogged intrepid journalist to expose the alleged wrongdoings of a 44 year old college dropout who drifted from one lousy media job to another for 20 years it takes courage to debase someone with a mouthful of cut rate dentures who up until 2007 lived in his parents home for seven years due to near fatal bouts of clinical depression it takes a journalist of a certain caliber to torpedo a pathetic hack who has barely squeezed out a living for nearly a decade at seven cents a word

2228041 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2228042 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2228043 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2228044 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2228057 no evidence of any intent to affect the outcome of any matches wagered upon
2228058 its pretty physically tiring as well you have to make sure you dont spend too much energy off the court and try to save it all for the match
2228059 i know people expect more from me after the last five years but i can still save this season with this or the us open and right now the focus is on the olympics
2228060 to say this season has been bad because i didnt win that epic is a bit hard
2228061 i want to the win the french open olympic games other grand slams and try to break records
2228062 its great to be part of the history books i really hope i can win gold here otherwise at wimbledon 2012
2228063 hes a dangerous player he hits the ball hard and serves well
2228064 ive known him since our junior days we go way back hes a good player so ill have to play well
2228065 this can be so much more than a vase of flowers
2228066 interesting designers use something a little different in their displays
2228067 theyre long lived bright and beautiful plus the oriental lilies have a wonderful fragrance other growers tell me that sunflowers are over but every year everyone loves sunflowers
2228068 its a hobby gone crazy i cant help myself when it comes to the flowers i dont grow vegetables anymore
2228069 i love it when people at my booth tell me that theyd love to buy my flowers today but cant because the ones they bought from me last week still look too darned good
2228070 think of it like putting together a painting youll need color texture and something for background you can grow for traditional or contemporary taste
2228071 our work is an avalanche at this time of year
2228072 weve planted every two weeks from may to july and now somethings always coming on
2228073 do what feels good to you in the hues you love
2228074 its against mexican federal law to fill containers not attached to the fuel system of a car or truck and travel across the international border
2228075 weve had a public campaign on both sides of the border to warn diesel buyers before they purchase fuel for auxiliary fuel tanks
2228076 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games tonight that dream comes true congratulations beijing
2228077 i now declare the 29th summer olympics in beijing open
2228078 for us he probably would play more at the two guard simply because thats a less crowded spot for us
2228079 the only two guards we have are kobe bryant and sasha vujacic even though his most natural position is point guard were a little crowded there
2228080 it might surprise strident abortion supports such as anne perrin to know that there are hudnreds of couples in south dakota who are waiting to adopt a child
2228081 el poder ejecutivo es el garante de la educaci n
2228082 nuevamente la justicia rechaz la acci n iniciada en contra del sutef porque el gremio no es el garante de la educaci n en la provincia pareciera que este tipo de cuestiones no son de inter s de la justicia
2228083 el poder ejecutivo provincial en car cter de garante de la educaci n deber arbitrar todos los medios necesarios para garantizar el derecho de la educaci n realizando las acciones que estime inmediatas
2228084 es una obviedad a la cual nos tiene acostumbrados la justicia
2228085 lo ins lito de este fallo es el punto 5 que dice que con relaci n a al actitud asumida por el defensor oficial guillermo gowland se efect a un severo llamado de atenci n en cuanto a su obrar poco diligente en orden a la digna oficina que tiene a su cargo y remite copia al colegio p blico de abogados de la ciudad
2228086 yo respeto las decisiones de la justicia pero con esta resoluci n me dan ganas de re rme
2228087 yo cumplo un mandato de una oficina de defensa de derechos para garantizar la educaci n de los ni os por eso meto denuncias en la justicia y hago todas las medidas concernientes a establecer la educaci n
2228088 para la jueza hoy estoy comprometiendo el inter s de los ni os con esta actitud es decir que yo tengo la culpa de todo lo que est pasando
2228089 yo no dependo del poder judicial esto fue creado por los legisladores pero en ning n momento dijeron de quien depende la oficina lamentablemente mi jefa es la ministra de desarrollo social a quien vi en dos oportunidades nada mas y jam s me dio directivas sobre el manejo de la oficina estoy m s solo que pinochet el d a del amigo
2228090 la jueza me atribuye una responsabilidad que me parece totalmente injusta la ley me dice que ante un conflicto tengo que tratar de resolverlo tengo una instancia de mediaci n administrativa
2228091 yo plantee una protecci n de derechos a mi entender las medidas de fuerza del sutef son ilegales y est n lesionando el derecho a la educaci n de los ni os yo no puedo entender que la justicia convalide a una persona que firm un pacto y no lo cumple y encima que se la agarren con la persona que quiere hacer cumplir esto
2228092 yo voy a seguir adelante a pesar de este palo que me com voy a seguir adelante defendiendo los derechos de los ni os pero lamentablemente no puedo hacer nada m s en este caso
2228093 i have it with me pretty much all the time
2228094 most of the stuff if it dont know who its from i dont open it i just delete it
2228095 the cnn one has fake e mail headers it looks like it came from cnn but the giveaway is you have to be a computer person you can go in and see where the e mail come from the address you can see its from a home computer
2228096 they want you to look at attachments so they want them to look as legitimate as possible to make it
2228097 we have seen instances where creators will make a virus and another person will make a virus thats better and theyll have a war between them and theres little messages hidden inside the virus

2228116 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2228117 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2228118 the additional cost of carrying unnecessary fuel adversely affects americans financial success
2228119 we didnt see any proposed changes we thought needed to be made
2228120 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
2228121 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
2228122 its a safety of flight issue and it needs to be treated as such
2228123 if dispatchers and pilots are saying the airlines are pressuring them and its having a chilling effect on the decisions they make every day in regard to the fuel loads and it looks its like eroding the authority of the pilot in command then that issue needs the attention of the government regulators who are there to oversee the system

2228135 the conservative government wants the senate to help it defeat a private members bill that would make contributions to registered education savings plans tax deductible
2228136 you dont see the other 17 presidential candidates dropping their maiden names
2228137 apart from a candidate dropping out and taking one for the team a merger is the dems only chance to avoid snatching defeat from the jaws of victory in the general election this fall
2228138 ottawa the harper government vowed thursday to kill legislation introduced by a liberal mp and quietly passed by the house of commons that would allow parents to contribute up to 5 000 a year to their childrens education and deduct it from their income tax
2228139 that leads in my case and i would think in other cases as well that people say well lets just not reinsulate the roof
2228140 we have no problem with the use of solar energy
2228141 marburg is already a leader when it comes to the use of solar energy but up until now theyve always tried to convince people rather than forcing them
2228142 its unfortunate that they decided to compel people because i think you breed opponents that way rather than friends of solar energy
2228143 we have a serious energy problem with the older homes
2228144 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
2228145 it does give off the appearance that the violence is linked to strategic moves by one or both sides to improve their positions
2228146 we urge restraint on all sides that violence would be curtailed and that direct dialogue could ensue in order to help resolve their differences
2228147 i am obligated to defend the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2228148 we will not allow the unpunished killing of our fellow citizens those who are guilty will suffer the punishment they deserve
2228149 hundreds of soldiers and dozens of armored vehicles including tanks
2228150 we dont know whether they are militias or regular russian forces
2228151 as they carry heavy equipment we think they must be regulars we dont know we just know they are coming to attack us
2228152 i am way too tired to go into that now
2228153 and the kicks they felt exactly the same from the outside as they had done for months on end
2228154 and then for the trouble hed caused us for all the stress and the grief and the uncooperatively not wanting to be conceived or born despite every effort on our parts

2228157 one of my requirements is that the name be recognisably common
2228158 i wish youd told me your baby naming policy years ago i could have gone off and married a whole different person
2228159 maybe your first wife would have been a very fertile woman you could have been a daddy by now
2228160 id prefer to take the rest of 2008 off being infertile lets pretend between now and new years eve that we can fall pregnant again any time we want ill plan on finishing this degree youll plan on continuing your job here well organise our holidays like people who arent thinking about treatment cycles well watch our son grow up as if nothing ever threatened to keep him from us and well come back to these confusing questions in 2009
2228161 thats so healthy and good for her enjoy your break
2228162 well with everything looking so good we can continue to monitor
2228163 but at this stage and with such a favourable looking cervix the potential benefits of a gel induction probably outweigh the potential risks

2228165 then i hope it goes very very well for you
2228166 in the six months after the of 1967 nearly 300 000 names left the detroit phone book this exodus to the suburbs was called white flight in the aftermath the large beautiful houses of palmer park sold at bargain basement prices and the citys schools funded by property taxes became peripheral victims detroits tax base was so eroded that the board of education found itself with a deficit of 7 million dollars

2228168 italy turin and the fiat group have lost a business figure who knew how to follow and develop the work of his grandfather pinin and his father sergio
2228169 i didnt see him i was going slowly and i really didnt see him
2228170 i am aware of the speculation of course it is good for my ego but not much else
2228171 i have said of course i will do whatever i can
2228172 we do not want any democrat either in the hall or in the stadium or at home walking away saying well you know im just not satisfied im not happy because i mean thats what im trying to avoid
2228173 we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified
2228174 people dont run for that office those that campaign for that office guess what they dont get it
2228175 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2228176 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2228177 i dont think too many people question that i think a lot of people question what happened this offseason
2228178 you see teams go out in free agency and spend on a lot of guys and everyone says oh theyre going to be great and go to the super bowl it takes chemistry and to me thats the most important thing you can have all the talent in the world but if the chemistry is not there it wont matter
2228179 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds
2228180 if you had picked a number higher you wouldve gotten more money on your metrocard
2228181 you win the super bowl and i promise you will get a key
2228182 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the new york jets and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2228183 he still has the utmost amount of respect from the guys in this locker room here and we wish him well wish him a good season and hope to see him in tampa
2228184 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2228185 it is good to have him here when you play with a legend you cant help but feed off of it i think hell fit right in with both the team and the city
2228186 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year
2228187 mr obama do you believe that john edwards ought to be condemned to hell for this egregious sin against humanity
2228188 yes i certainly do were transferring him to the republican party immediately
2228189 damn ive gone and contradicted myself again im going to have to completely restructure this whole argument we also have to pre wash everything at least once but you know they say first stage of labour lasts eight to twelve hours and is it just me or is that heaps of time to throw some stuff into an overnight bag and put on a couple of loads
2228190 and maybe arrange the nursery set up the bassinet put a few spare meals in the freezer that type of thing
2228191 it depends are you also going to be rewriting your essay still
2228192 ah i think ive worked it out do we own a copy of anything by kant
2228193 have you thought about this or that why not nine months is not much time
2228194 nature is such a bitch sometimes she couldnt think of a nicer way
2228195 it feels like a small creature moving around inside my abdomen
2228196 but not just any creature not for example like a large mouse with scratchy tickly nails or anything like that more like
2228197 does it feel just like an alien inside trying to get out
2228198 apparently not from what ive read although i do wish my instinct would kick in
2228199 all these other people are way organised you should see the spocks nursery with its ocean theme and its boat shaped bookshelf and its drawers upon drawers of thrice washed cloth nappies and infant clothing
2228200 so far zero although in my defence most of our nappies havent arrived yet
2228201 yes i do think you made a good choice when you decided against a legal career
2228202 are you going to poke fun or are you going to come and learn about the organisational intricacies of my changing system
2228203 if you think im cute you should see my aunt
2228204 i think the purpose of the class is to learn stuff rather than to show off your knowledge
2228205 in this picture its closed as it has been since it let through that tiny little sperm who swam up your reproductive tract and fused with the egg to make your baby
2228206 early signs might include nesting behaviour such as cleaning and tidying

2228228 youre so close you must be excited nervous impatient etc
2228229 its half full of frozen food and the other half is coming soon
2228230 then i had a sudden urge to stock up on toilet paper
2228231 well we do have a lot of guests arriving thats for sure and we dont want to run out of toilet paper
2228232 you dont seem pleased i thought youd be pleased about the beer
2228233 beer is pleasing im just not too keen on the picture im getting in my mind of my nearly nine month pregnant wife struggling uphill from the shops to our apartment with her little grocery cart chock full of beer whilst the neighbours stand around and tut and whisper behind their hands about how i probably beat you when im sober
2228234 nevertheless maybe you should leave the beer hoarding to me
2228235 from day one we said that we will only submit a planning application if we can design a wind turbine development that is appropriate for the location
2228236 the results of study work carried out so far continues to suggest that rushy mead is a good location to site wind turbines although we have found that the responsible maximum number of turbines should now be set at five rather than six
2228237 sir we are very happy to have had your business and this transaction has worked out very nicely but we are a little puzzled while you were away we checked you out and found that you are a multi millionaire what puzzles us is why would you bother to borrow 5 000

2228241 yeah saturday and sunday are days when there can be some tryouts
2228242 some guys who maybe dont perform very well in the game weve given them some time to show us that definitely could be a possibility
2228243 some guys theyre doing what they can in this format but now theyve got to go to the next level
2228244 im sorry youve reached a page that i cannot find

2228248 a big part of what appealed to me about britain was how tidy it was how orderly how civilised
2228249 id never been to a place that was so manicured and so loved
2228250 its just not the place that i fell in love with
2228251 its like background noise people have come to accept it
2228252 if you have one broken window it indicates that we dont care so you get a second broken window and a third broken window and it indicates that society doesnt care about the society we live in
2228253 if we are to overcome our failures and disappointments in life we must develop our own navigational system
2228254 do i accept this the circumstance is my fate or simply a temporary state if it is my fate then i am finished and i should give up
2228255 it is so easy to become engrossed in one circumstance and lose sight of the limitless power that lies within what we have been given
2228256 we will often misdiagnose the problem and feel defeated when we could actually prevail
2228257 now you must understand that positioning requires understanding where you are and measuring it against where you are going
2228258 if we are to overcome our failures and disappointments in life we must develop out own navigational system
2228259 i dont like me why would god even care to do anything through me
2228260 its been so painful watching you settle for less and less in your life working a job beneath your talents and capabilities accepting the roles that others assign to you giving up the creative pursuits that once fueled your ambition im the part of you that longs to be all that you were created to be the dreamer inside you who loves to look ahead and aim for the top instead of fighting to keep the fire inside you alive you let the embers die by becoming addicted to a life without dreams without hope you cant do on this way its killing you fight for the dreams that were once such a vital part of your life
2228261 look at your now i see you faking your interest distracted by what you need you stopped giving so you stopped getting back you cant sow indifference and get back affection forget about the relationships that went bad or had issues dont lose sight of the loving person you were meant to be you stopped loving the idea of love your authentic self is camouflaged by a self who has no feelings do you know that living inside of you is like being trapped by a mannequin
2228262 whatsoever he doeth shall prosper listen god cant bless what you wont do you havent been taught correctly prosperity doesnt come from giving an offering its good to be a giver but you must also be a thinker a planner and a worker
2228263 if you want to break through your addiction to mediocrity your recovery must be spiritual it doesnt necessarily involve going to church that is good but without a personal relationship with god churchgoing is empty focus on what your soul hungers and thirst for to relate to god god will guide you but only you can take the first step on the exciting journey known as the rest of your life arent you tired of the slop for which you have been settling you may have squandered your resources so far but god delights in providing his children with what they need when they rely on him its time its time
2228264 our investigation is progressing well and identified witnesses have now been interviewed
2228265 the actions of five thames valley police officers are currently under investigation
2228266 we are still awaiting the results of toxicology tests on the packages removed from mr ullahs body and the pathologists report confirming cause of death
2228267 however we are still keen to hear from anyone who was in the area of lee court sharrow vale on thursday 3 july at the time this incident occurred
2228268 if he could practice like that every day wed really have something
2228269 he picked wilson up as good as you pick a guy up
2228270 a couple of physical runs if we can get him to continue to grow and continue to be that guy well have a pretty special backfield
2228271 i can be a bruiser if i need to be
2228272 ill drop my shoulders if i need to if you get an opportunity to make a bigger play then why not
2228273 i am at a point where i am at peace with the decisions that i have made and i love where i am in life
2228274 a few days before the march i started getting phone calls
2228275 the harder calls were the ones saying the dog ate my homework and i cant make it on saturday to march
2228276 for a lot of people it was always going to be a tough call
2228277 it can affect your ordination it can affect your call to ministry i dont know of one person who signed without going through some kind of internal process they had to go through what the cost was to them professionally and personally
2228278 there will be discussions with people about why this was done without consultation with the church
2228279 my fear was it would affect my call to ministry
2228280 im female and im divorced and these are barriers even before they get to the 100 revs
2228281 in the end i just thought i cant sit on the fence i cant sit quietly i cant be in silence because im passionate about what i believe in
2228282 i might be looking for a job after this interview
2228283 but youve got to be prepared to take the flak
2228284 didnt want them to be hit with something they didnt know about
2228285 they were being paranoid we neither encouraged it nor discouraged it
2228286 its affected nobodys future and people signed it for very different reasons its very hard when you get blamed for something that people think you might do

2228502 its an absolute shock weve known that there have been redundancies pending for some time since the icelandic company that were due to buy them pulled out of the deal
2228503 this is payback time for the european currencies against the dollar
2228504 these currencies have to retreat to better reflect the sharp deterioration in economic fundamentals in the euro zone region this is not to say theres been an improvement in u s fundamentals
2228505 confirmed that the window of opportunity for further rate hikes has been slammed shut by the cold blast of negative data releases that swept through the euro zone in the last few weeks
2228506 climate change will have a significant impact on ducks in addition ducks need large expanses of grassland for successful nesting
2228507 some of the most promising land management practices for enhancing carbon accumulations in soils also improve the quantity and quality of waterfowl habitat
2228508 i think all the pre publicity the police have given us has probably worked in our favour
2228509 may be intending to disrupt the event or to attack people going to and from it
2228510 the economy is limping along and businesses are doing whatever they can to remain competitive
2228511 so we had fewer people working shorter hours and producing more
2228512 should schools give cash rewards to kids for getting good grades on standardized tests
2228513 people are now coming around to the fact that growth is slowing both in the u s and overseas so demand for commodities will decline

2228541 the program has been under wraps for six months but with the attention to mobile device security new mobile devices and considering how companies are trying to save money on lately we felt it was time to announce the initiative
2228542 companies need to ask will it be productive does it really add value to our bottom line

2228557 i just think its really a part of your life that you gotta keep to yourself
2228558 knowing that providing them false information was sufficient to suspend the abuse
2228559 i dont know where osama bin laden is you know i just dont spend that much time on him
2228560 corporate canada is beginning to think the worst and the result has been a summer crop of pink slips
2228561 to use a phrase ive heard here before those in glass houses shouldnt throw stones you know what i mean
2228562 people are now coming around to the fact that growth is slowing both in the u s and overseas so demand for commodities will decline
2228563 everybody is scrambling to get out of the ship before the guy next to them
2228564 its amazing how fast commodities have become the last place people want to have their money
2228565 it looks like the bulls have run out of ammo
2228566 with poor demand prospects ahead theres not a lot of reason to be buying commodities right now
2228567 i dont see them with their scorched fingers coming back into the market that money is gone for a while
2228568 but were not expecting that to happen for at least a few quarters
2228569 but the question is how intense is it and how long will it last
2228570 with respect to nuclear power obama again offers myriad qualifiers
2228571 one million 150 mile per gallon plug in hybrids on our roads within six years
2228572 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2228573 just want to personally say how sorry i am to have to do this
2228574 i never take postponing a show lightly and if there were any possible way i could pull this off i would this is a very frustrating and maddening situation for me and i appreciate your understanding ill make it up to you
2228575 didnt seem to fit the world that i thought stephenie meyer created
2228576 you see the punch coming that doesnt mean its not gonna hurt when it hits
2228577 theres no way to make everybody happy when i do one thing that a lot of people want theres always the opposite reaction
2228578 but how can you possibly meet up with the expectations that this book had
2228579 it just got so built up there is no book in the world that could stand up to that so i knew it was going to happen but at the same time it hurts
2228580 if they really love the characters then i would hope that this would make sense to them because these are the true characters
2228581 this is the story the way it was always meant to be
2228582 it doesnt always work out that way sometimes you make a decision about what you want and you pay for it and you suffer for it and it doesnt work out those types of stories always leave me horribly depressed im not going to live in a world for a year at a time where thats going to be the ending if people wanted a really depressing tragic ending i gave them a lot of hints that it wasnt going to be that way they really shouldnt have been surprised
2228583 i should have known that people would feel that way
2228584 the name has been real to me for so long now that ive forgotten how unusual it would sound to everyone else
2228585 ive read a lot of books that i didnt like very much and that thought never occurred to me because i had read them i hadnt heard of doing that before thats not fun to hear
2228586 i hope that if they really do enjoy the other books theyll realize that this is kind of where it was supposed to go
2228587 i personally would want to see our tragic history or the tragic elements of our history acknowledged
2228588 america is is no longer what it could be what it once was
2228589 victor what will happen when all these crazy people have to take over from us
2228590 craig is very doubtful for that double header he has an outside chance at best
2228591 he has gone almost a year without any competitive football which is very disappointing for us
2228592 hamstring injuries normally need about four to six weeks to recover so whether he plays for us in our world cup qualifiers is in the hands of west ham
2228593 its gutting for me not to be able to start the season especially as i have had a great pre season
2228594 i wanted to hit the ground running and make an immediate impact
2228595 i have probably had the best pre season ever and i think i have shown that i proved my point in that i totally recovered from my injury last year and have returned fitter and stronger like i said i would
2228596 but it wont affect me too much in terms of working through the rehabilitation for this injury and to get back better than before again
2228597 jef zegt altijd jij hebt mij op het juiste moment ontmoet ik was mijn wilde haren aan het verliezen alhoewel ik vond dat hij nog heel wild was in het begin maar dat trok mij wel aan bij het schrijven van dat boek want ik had geen echt plan vooropgesteld dat is zo vanzelf gegroeid vond ik dat ik ons persoonlijke leven niet kon weglaten uit dat boek al onze reizen alles wat we deden zit verweven ik weet bijvoorbeeld in ieder boek de fragmenten die ik bijna zelf tegen jef zeg of die hij mij vraagt om te doen dus dat zat er al allemaal in en vond ik het eerlijker om ons leven daarin te mengen ik heb het al een paar keer gezegd ik vind dat er ook eens een mooi verhaal mag zijn over twee mensen
2228598 i got my artist tay dizm and ive already got his single beam me up featuring me and rick ross ive also got young cash coming out right now jay lyriq ive got a lot of stuff coming on my nappy boy label
2228599 i just worked on ciaras album me and kanye did it again we did another hook like two days ago
2228600 i got two records with t pain that are retarded
2228601 if you wouldve come to my wedding you would have heard the records at my reception everybody was going crazy its this one record we got thats called talk that its phenomenal everybody is like you rapping like that i been doing that its nothing for me
2228602 that record i wont put on my lp cause its so much of a smash
2228603 its so phenomenal you would be like well why wouldnt you put it on your record if its so much of a smash because i would give it to my sister my sister needs that record more than i would need that my sister which is missy if missy had that record shes gone shes gone
2228604 i dont know in a way yes and in a way no
2228605 the last thing i want is someone to think oh they had to go back to puppets because that was the best album and theyre doing it because we want it if we start writing songs for our fans somethings gone wrong the fans may think they know best but hey im the armchair quarterback when im watching my team too at the end of the day we have to write it because we love it and its coming from our heart thats why people connect with it if you start doing it for the fans youve lost the plot
2228606 we recognize there was an essence there was a youth there was a something about that record and this is a perfect time for a record like this
2228607 because old school metal is huge and coming back and theres so many people wanting to play and get riffy again get solo i love that so with this record its like us starting over again
2228608 his mission statement was to get to the essence of metallica
2228609 what made sense to us was the hunger the quest to impress
2228610 he said youre going to write a set list your next album is a set list of your best songs and youre going to try and go get signed do a showcase and impress people and that was a great mission statement for us
2228611 its possible but we just go with our feelings every time
2228612 you cant go wrong if you go with your heart and thats pretty much it were very comfortable with our fanbase sorting itself out we dont have to make sure theyre happy because thats like trying to control the world you cant do it if people connect with what youre doing theyll be there if they dont like this record they might go away and thats ok that means theres a seat for someone else
2228613 we were looking at the past and seeing what worked for us and updating that sound
2228614 theres always been a melodic side to metallica a side that has been reflected in a desire to break free from any of those stereotypes and to just go where we could go musically and creatively
2228615 i think some of what weve done goes against a lot of the conservative elements in heavy metal and hard rock thinking and thats ok
2228616 its a little sexier than high school musical a little edgier
2228617 we deal with more adult issues its closer to home for maybe older groups of individuals like those beginning years of college
2228618 i play ally shepherd whos an aspiring singer songwriter shes just like your average 18 year old girl but she has a problem where she cant finish her songs and life isnt going well until she meets this janitor joey played by rob mayes whos able to finish her songs and inspires her to write more music
2228619 its about finding yourself and doing what you want to do and being true to yourself
2228620 and i think for a lot of people its difficult to do that
2228621 we found pictures that we really loved on the computer and then we put them on the shirts and then we started designing them
2228622 it was all worth it because we got to see the jonas brothers
2228623 it was horrible when we went to the train station there was rats outside the park people were shoving each other there were a lot of fights
2228624 we wanted to get the best seats and we wanted to have fun camping out
2228625 well we go to hear their new songs too which was amazing the jonas brothers are worth camping out for any day
2228626 they really put everything they can into their music and they really love their fans so they deserve it
2228627 theyre great inspirations to kids theyre a very wholesome band and they put everything they can into it
2228628 i would say its a lot like x men although theres some matrix as well
2228629 the pusher has the ability to alter your mind and change your thinking or certainly predict what youre about to do in the near future without you even knowing ahead of time
2228630 its kind of in the vein of that show heroes
2228631 its a group of individuals who have certain powers theyre either on the run or in hiding from this branch of the government called division that wants to capture these people and get their power for warfare
2228632 i play the character of a government agent who is the head of division
2228633 my character has powers also and is a pusher as well and so i hunt these people down and enhance their abilities to see the future whatever it is and i want to turn all of them into real soldiers
2228634 if god didnt mea ck theres a great dresden dolls song about that called good d
2228635 surprise n a it was bound to happen sooner or later
2228636 yeah i went green and 26s on the hybrid smoke so much green that i cant open up my eyelids

2228640 were in the works of doing a whole lot of very creative stuff
2228641 the whole album every song is a movie thats basically how it comes down i dont even have features on the album the first single is not even featuring chris brown and sean garrett its co starring chris brown and sean garrett thats what i have on this album its all stars basically its co starring people because its a movie every song is a movie creatively and conceptually i think people are definitely going to understand that this is something that was very creatively put together it took a minute but every song is very serious
2228642 that bloke from oasis said i couldnt play guitar somebody shoulda told him im a f in rock star
2228643 im like life aint fair chill baby girl my girl is here
2228644 getting the crowd excited for the second sequel to one of the cornerstones of his lauded catalog of classics rumors of the album began this january when but jays reps denied that the song was new
2228645 i walk into the dressing room and kanyes like lets do a record lets do this im like cmon man but you know i couldnt tell him no its his show that was the idea he wanted to perform a new record
2228646 we spoke about doing an album it just was premature

2228657 many young people in evangelical churches are experimenting with the wiccan religion citing an article in religion journal which said youth pastors in the southern baptist convention were worried about large numbers of evangelicals taking part in wicca a religion that involves nature worship stresses moral autonomy and includes remedies and spells
2228658 witchcraft is revolting against common views of god thats a huge part of the appeal especially for young people that you dont have to follow the herd
2228659 far from devil worship and harry potter young witches explain what theyre really about
2228660 more than three quarters of americas youth have engaged in at lease one type of psychic or witchcraft related activity beyond media exposure or horoscope usage

2228678 the message of the bible makes two great promises one youve already referred to it offers forgiveness of sins the other we havent discussed the hope of eternal life what do you believe about the afterlife what happens to a pagan after death
2228679 salvation is found in no one else for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved
2228680 i do believe that pagans are misunderstood we are your normal everyday people
2228681 well im sinful and bad what did you expect from me
2228682 how do you know whats true in the confusing buffet of beliefs that is paganism
2228683 mahud good point about seasons of spiritual dryness it seems so easy to be distracted from that which matters most dont you think the book of isaiah compares us to sheep whove gone astray we drift too easily chasing the sweet patch of grass in the next field thats why i value the guide i have in the bible how do you know whats true in the confusing buffet of beliefs that is paganism
2228684 i tend to view spirit as a substance from which deities and spirits are made
2228685 which naturally brings us to tolerance since spirit works hard to connect to people no matter who or what they worship or whether they worship it seems only natural that we should try to do the same
2228686 i dont think sin is just unkindness to people or animals but at core a rebellion or rejection of god and a determination to live our own way and under our own authority were created beings who rejected our creator this leads to being enslaved by our own fleshly appetites and hunger for self empowerment the antidote faith in jesus who paid for our sins and offers grace mercy and forgiveness

2228705 some students rarely get their book reports completed on time i am going to try using ssr as a specific time for them to read the required trade book for their report then there will be no excuses that there was no time to read
2228706 instead of trying to find ways to combat kids not reading could it be that the problem lies in forcing them to read a required teacher chosen trade book and then forcing them to write a required teacher forced book report that doesnt have a real purpose or meaning of its own

2228725 i have come to terms with a lot of different things that i had been holding onto for so long i was learning and working towards progressing all other parts of my thinking and how i approached life personally but i havent been including the realm of possibility for t 1 when i really started thinking about what i loved about t 1 so much a lot became very clear to me i didnt love the frames the most i didnt love the bars the most or the pegs being american made wasnt the best part of it and neither were the sprockets or grips t shirts werent the best part nor were the hats the best part of t 1 for me was just being a part of something that felt good to do it has been the efforts of so many good people involved coming together in one place and that place always felt good this year i want there to be no boundaries at all i want to help make good things happen for all of us
2228726 the one common denominator in all of my work is me so i thought that i would take a minute to tell you a little bit about my passion i need to make things things out of fiber glass clay metal paper no material is safe my other need is to get whatever i am working on out of the second dimension and into the third color form and texture are what make my heart sing

2228728 once again the oil companies and their friends are standing with senator mccain the candidate for president who is proposing to offer them a 4 billion tax cut it looks like gas station tv doesnt want the american people to know about senator obamas plan to offer working families a 1 000 energy rebate that would be funded by a tax on oil company profits the oil companies have taken sides in this race and they are standing with john mccain
2228729 the e mail chain provided by the obama campaign is 100 inaccurate gstv never viewed or approved the spot to air nor did gstv receive an insertion order or payment for a media buy
2228730 campaigns that contacted gas station tv did not receive approval to move forward with a media buy on our network gas station tv must approve any ads running on the network and no political ads were sent to gas station tv for review and approval no invoices indicating approval from gas station tv to run a political ad were developed and at no time were related financial transactions completed with gas station tv and its partners
2228731 its just best for our consumers and our advertisers to stay out of it

2228735 the proposed district expansion returned to the planning commission for further refinement would aim to give expanding art organizations more flexibility and allow artist live work spaces which perhaps would address the vacant storefronts along ocean avenue home to mostly resident serving businesses
2228736 congress this week passed a law to help curb piracy on college campuses the higher education opportunity act passed wednesday by the house and thursday by the senate promotes education legal alternatives and improved monitoring of campus networks if signed into law by president george w bush the bipartisan bill would require publicly funded universities and colleges to teach students and employees about illegal downloading distribution of copyrighted materials and related campus policies the bill also requires universities and colleges to create plans to prevent piracy by using technology and to present legal alternatives the bill would provide grants to support those efforts

2228738 det er noget af det vi har sukket efter et dagpengesystem som er ens for alle grupper er en rest fra industrisamfundet
2228739 one of the options does have us looking at a facility in terry county this is all very preliminary and there are steps that need to be taken but there is a facility that we have been looking at
2228740 we have a vacant building that was built especially for a correctional facility
2228741 wed be willing to put some money into that its a good facility
2228742 its generally accepted that the best way to have an effective rehabilitation and treatment program for incarcerated youth is to have parental and family involvement
2228743 we look at counties like in west texas where were getting a large number of kids from
2228744 and then we look to see what the workforce is like whether there would be a sufficient workforce in the area access to services and things of that nature we try to develop a capacity throughout the west texas region so we can keep kids closer to home
2228745 its not a region that sends us the most kids
2228746 in west texas as the price of oil has gone up its become more lucrative to work in the oilfield than to work as a juvenile correctional officer with tyc
2228747 there are a number of factors in play that we must deal with thats going to be an important part of locating any new facilites ensuring that we can attract and retain a workforce
2228748 when you have a faciltiy in a remote region you have a hard time populating that with staff
2228749 if we can get our centers not only closer to home but also in areas where there are more people it will be easier to recruit and retain staff
2228750 i think because we have two other correctional facilities here wed have local people who have experience in that field
2228751 has become important to the thinking of what is sometimes called the
2228752 the american flag means everything in my life everything that describes me coming from another country and going through all the stages that i have to become a u s citizen i dont even have the words to describe how happy i am
2228753 seeing my fellow americans coming behind me and supporting me will be a great honor the highest honor

2228756 a two bedroom renovated apartment in a hilltop town in cortona tuscany is on the market for 300 000
2228757 but those who dream of owning an italian farmhouse in tuscany will find the prices far from romantic in sought after parts of the region so called chiantishire for example and even in neighbouring umbria an average four bedroom stone farmhouse can cost about 1 2 million
2228758 thats no good for you to do that to your bladder
2228759 oh look we are about 10 minutes out of springfield on the right road

2228764 david wray has been the victim of a serious injustice
2228765 refuelling detracts from the racing by turning the grand prix into a series of low fuel sprints between pit stops
2228766 in the days when you carried your entire race fuel load on board the car there was a much bigger role for the driver in managing the tyres and brakes
2228767 you could decide to run non stop if you could make the tyres go the distance while someone else might pit twice
2228768 and because the cars weight changed so much more in the course of the race there were more fluctuations in performance and handling characteristics which in turn created more overtaking opportunities
2228769 these days in dry conditions you very rarely see anyone win from further back than the second row of the grid because race pace largely mirrors qualifying pace which is not surprising when the conditions are so similar
2228770 so if we need to spice up the racing in my view one of the best ways of doing that would be to ban refuelling
2228771 the fia could give every team a fixed and publicly known amount of fuel for the race distance and they would have a clear incentive to be as fuel efficient as possible

2228773 obamas tax policies would mirror those of the 90s a period of great economic growth and during which the budget deficit was erased
2228774 2 return the capital gains rate back to pre clinton levels of 28
2228775 3 increase the dividends rate back to at least clinton levels
2228776 4 increase the 12 4 payroll tax on all individuals that make over 250 000
2228777 americans will rue the day that they turned the american government over to these people
2228778 all his tax increases in combination will have an economic effect that will tend to discourage work growth and investment
2228779 the mere fact that gdp growth has a relationship with marginal tax rates does not mean one causes the other
2228780 and do you actually believe that top marginal rates of 50 60 and capital gains rates of 40 50 are the roadmap to a strong economy
2228781 it is a matter of fairness and i dont think anyones trying to set up a
2228782 the three major challenges i cite each of which could sink us remain unaddressed by obama
2228783 unaddressed when we both know he has indeed addressed them
2228784 that has the size capacity cost and power to leapfrog the commercially available plug in hybrids
2228785 unless they magnify their concerns with fear mongering and make a larger tax burden for them sound like a prescription for economic ruin
2228786 and bubba if they do put us in re education camps mitch johnson will be your cabin counselor
2228787 whats interesting is that you make no comment about what you think is fair or how progressive you think our system should become
2228788 you cant raise taxes to the extent they would need to be raised to solve the entitlements problem and to wage the war on terror effectively
2228789 roch since you seem to think that the to 5 of wage earners will sit back and shut up as long as it takes to blah blah blah

2228794 i was placed on the transfer list at grimsby after playing the whole season and i am happy to come to rotherham united where i will hopefully get a game for the first team
2228795 not good but not the end of the world either
2228796 the balance of power in the midfield battle has swung from one team to another all season and a lot can change over the remaining seven races
2228797 we have to recognise the fact that we havent scored points in the past two races which would suggest that our underlying pace has dropped off compared to a month or so ago
2228798 our performance has only slipped by maybe half a percent in effect weve stood still while the teams around us have taken a step forward whereas earlier in the season we were the ones stealing a march on the competition
2228799 but thats formula 1 its a constantly moving target and we need to be up to that challenge
2228800 we just have to try to understand why we have lost that fraction of relative pace and get back onto the more fruitful development path we were on a few weeks ago
2228801 all the teams are having to divide their resources between 2008 and 2009 work but certainly in our case development of the rb4 is continuing apace as we chase our goal of fourth in the constructors table

2228806 the idea in 2000 that the main threat to the us was a ballistic missile attack and not a low tech terror related attack was just plain stupid remember that the surge mccain likes to take credit for would not have happened had republicans not gotten thumped in the 2006 elections
2228807 obviously it was not ballistic missiles that posed the greatest threat at that time
2228808 remember bush sr felt strongly about getting full un approval for desert shield storm that provided a shared military amp economic burden and gave the operation a different perception around the world especially in the middle east

2228817 people are now coming around to the fact that growth is slowing both in the u s and overseas so demand for commodities will decline
2228818 everybody is scrambling to get out of the ship before the guy next to them
2228819 its amazing how fast commodities have become the last place people want to have their money
2228820 it looks like the bulls have run out of ammo
2228821 with poor demand prospects ahead theres not a lot of reason to be buying commodities right now
2228822 i dont see them with their scorched fingers coming back into the market that money is gone for a while
2228823 but were not expecting that to happen for at least a few quarters
2228824 but the question is how intense is it and how long will it last
2228825 people havent stopped multiplying so at some point youd expected prices to go up again
2228826 i agree with the governor that we need to address the ethanol mandate
2228827 i think that well address the issues of the election when the election comes im really putting my efforts on helping the candidates who are up in 2008 and i will be ready to go for 2010 when the time comes
2228828 im not going to make an announcement right now but im on the road
2228829 theres not anyone who could really make a case to me that this would be divisive for the republican party in a way that would make me step back

2228860 i want to prove to everybody that im still the best so i need a super performance to do that which means a podium or a win
2228861 and ill be trying to do it in the second part of the season
2228862 there was a bit of frustration when i saw that i wouldnt win races or get on the podium
2228863 but its still a challenge to beat our main opponents and thats the motivation to keep doing my best

2228872 i regret a little bit having lost time over these last few weeks looking for big ideas of how to adapt the car to my driving style

2228888 these are the first gdp figures to come out and they anticipate a general setback in europe
2228889 even if italy is suffering from a more unfavourable situation than germany or france we have every chance of seeing a contraction of about 0 3 percent or more in the whole of the eurozone
2228890 even the german gdp expected next week is likely to show a fall of 0 8 percent
2228891 indicate a continued weakening outlook for all the major seven economies
2228892 the latest data for non oecd member economies tentatively point to expansion in china and brazil and a downturn in russia
2228893 this slowdown can be explained mainly by a contraction of internal demand with consumption depressed and a fall of exports weighed down by an unduly strong euro
2228894 these factors can only contribute to a serious slowing in the eurozone as the president of the european central bank jean claude trichet recognised on thursday when speaking of very weak growth in coming quarters
2228895 we have gone from zero growth to an ever more real danger of economic recession

2228950 this album i attempted to step outside of myself or at least go back to a time in life where everything was different mentally and emotionally
2228951 i wanted to create a space where there were no boundaries no limits no walls aside from the ones i chose to create
2228952 with this album i wanted the listener to get a better idea of what its like to have no idea the booth became my safe haven i wanted to be able to showcase insanity but at the same time have people cater to it and the only place where thats possible is in the padded room
2228953 i have seizure i wasnt supposed to be driving and i never would have even known that i had hit that kid if it hadnt been mentioned to me and i would just like the family to know that i am very very sorry about what happened

2228959 in the final analysis brian said i made a commitment to the padres three years ago that i would like to fulfill
2228960 we thoroughly discussed and analyzed and projected the next two or three years of his career
2228961 and took in every consideration and he made the decision that he made he has never made a decision based on what was best for him money wise he took a deal from the padres that was 6 million to 9 million less than what he could have gotten elsewhere the money factor had very little to do with his decision
2228962 one thing i try to do is to keep it even keel good or bad
2228963 hes 21 years old and he pitched like a guy whos been around 10 12 years
2228964 he had some big outs he had to get against good hitters and he didnt get spooked
2228965 sometimes it puts pressure on me sometimes you get wins with your eyes closed and sometimes there are games like this
2228966 some days we score a lot of runs some days not
2228967 were definitely not going out there trying to lose or trying not to hit
2228968 i was kind of effectively wild they were chasing my fastball up so i kind of used that a lot
2228969 for me being most effective i need to be aggressive
2228970 youre going to have those days when you feel a little rusty and a little off
2228971 those are the days youve got to work the hardest to get outs any way you can
2228972 those are the ones i threw right down the middle
2228973 some guys got base hits on not so good pitches but if you could take two back those were two bad mistakes in key situations
2228974 raul hit that ball so hard it didnt have time to go foul
2228975 you really dont realize until you are going around the bases whats going on
2228976 split finger just trying to put him away and i just hung it up there
2228977 but theres not a guy i dont think i can get out it stinks right now it definitely does but the sun will come up tomorrow
2228978 the way rauls swinging it seems like the situations finding him
2228979 right now the big situations are finding raul and hes delivering
2228980 its just going to be sore but thats all right
2228981 all the more reason why chris can not find out about what happened
2228982 im alright i just have to finish these dishes and then i can take you home

2229018 steal by acquiring nady and marte for minor league outfielder jose tabata and three pitchers
2229019 are you at all concerned that youll be confronted by angry fans when youre walking around the streets of pittsburgh
2229020 when you trade the known for the unknown it always unsettles people he said
2229021 its always unnerving and its very easy to trash the unknown when you can look at xavier nady damaso marte and jason bay and see how theyre performing
2229022 i think people are starting to understand why we did what we did now
2229023 its good depth to put in your system said a national league general manager
2229024 but when youre trading three good players and two are signed through next year its not quite as much as i would have expected
2229025 player in either trade but his former boss understands how difficult that is shapiro clevelands gm picked up a big minor league bat before the deadline in milwaukees matt laporta but it took
2229026 its a combination of players that he received theyre not all going to turn out to be what you expect but thats why numbers are so important any rebuilding process based upon one or two guys is doomed to fail

2229028 he made a huge mistake and was extremely remorseful for it huntington said
2229029 hes still dealing with maturity issues as most 19 year olds are
2229030 we have to make good sound logical rational decisions based on substance and not perception
2229031 the day we start making decisions based on perception or short term performance spikes will be the day we begin to fail
2229032 weve just got to get some guys back who are on the dl and maybe if we can add here and there i think we certainly have a chance id like to be a part of it thats great
2229033 we were just really lucky that no one else had hired him he was the right guy at the right time we never had any doubts that hed be back
2229034 cito is going to have a big hand in what kind of staff we have here
2229035 its important that hes comfortable with the staff i think bringing gene tenace and nick leyva here was important to him at that time well see how it goes

2229050 i was really impressed with him tonight because this place plays small and they have a lot of power
2229051 javy was the no 2 guy for us the way he pitched last year and the expectations are going to get higher and higher from now on for everyone
2229052 he didnt give us pitches with a whole heck of a lot of the plate
2229053 mike is capable of doing that he bent but he didnt break

2229075 aunque la familia lesbiana es una realidad en m xico esa forma de configuraci n vincular aparece a n invisible y sin nombre a pesar de que seg n datos del centro de fertilidad humana en m xico las homosexuales femeninas representan ya entre 20 y 30 de las solteras que demandan este procedimiento para concebir un hijo
2229076 sabemos que muchas mujeres que se someten a inseminaci n dicen que son solteras cuando en realidad tienen una pareja afectiva femenina esto ltimo es as de ambiguo porque en nuestro pa s no existe regulaci n alguna respecto a los tratamientos de inseminaci n asistida espec ficamente en el caso de mujeres lesbianas adem s cuando una mujer lesbiana se convierte en madre por inseminaci n alternativa la madre biol gica es reconocida dentro del sistema legal con todos los derechos de la maternidad como madre soltera pero la pareja de la madre no tendr ning n derecho formal con respecto al hijo

2229088 u2s bono the edge is most influential guitarist since jimmy page
2229089 soy un provocador pero no en sentido peyorativo sino que trato de provocar reacciones en quienes leen mis libros hacerlos pensar
2229090 un amigo en cuernavaca se pas 10 a os juntando todo el material que aparec a en las revistas en los peri dicos sobre todos esos casos de los pederastas de los abusadores de mujeres de los curas que hac an negocios en sus iglesias
2229091 lleg un momento en que ya ten a tanto material que le dije por qu no haces un libro con todo eso y me respondi que no era capaz as que me pas tres cajas llenas de recortes con eso empec a dar forma al libro y me di cuenta de que era una cosa terrible la que podr a salir creo que es un libro terrible sobre todo para los cat licos que no est n enterados de lo que est pasando en su iglesia est n muy acostumbrados a ser pasivos porque as han sido toda la vida y no se enteran de las realidades
2229092 estoy pensando seriamente en inventar una religi n porque es un gran negocio
2229093 ya estuvo bien de que nos est n viendo la cara
2229094 el vaticano es una monarqu a absoluta casi como las de la edad media en las que la democracia no exist a nunca se ha sabido que en alguna iglesia un cat lico que est en desacuerdo levante la mano y le permitan hablar el papel de los cat licos siempre ha sido como el de cualquier monarqu a callar y obedecer espero que con este librito algunos se atrevan por fin a alzar la voz y decir a la iglesia en qu no est n de acuerdo
2229095 fue la impunidad con la que estaban y est n actuando quienes se dicen representantes de dios he seguido recolectando en los peri dicos lo que est pasando con los curas pederastas y ya tengo 15 nuevos nombres en el libro aparecen como 160
2229096 esto sigue por m s que el papa est haciendo declaraciones de que le da verg enza lo que est pasando no hace nada para cambiar las cosas mientras no se resuelvan asuntos como el celibato esto va a seguir porque son seres humanos finalmente
2229097 en m xico no tenemos esa cultura tenemos miedo todav a a los curas a la iglesia creen que denunciar a un sacerdote los va a mandar al infierno y como la gente todav a cree en esas tonter as del infierno y del cielo es f cil para la iglesia seguirse haciendo tonta y seguir en la impunidad
2229098 eso me da mucho coraje la iglesia deber a poner el ejemplo pero en cosas buenas no de este tipo de cosas si no saben aguantarse la riqu sima tentaci n de las mujeres pues que no se metan de curas o que el vaticano los deje casarse
2229099 este libro es tambi n un llamado a las jerarqu as si no cambian van a perder la clientela se les va a ir con otras franquicias
2229100 el gran problema que tenemos de salud y los gobernantes no se dan cuenta hacen la misma pol tica del avestruz
2229101 saben que lo que provoca obesidad es la comida chatarra y los refrescos pero en todas sus campa as no lo mencionan porque son las empresas que han financiado las campa as electorales
2229102 por eso nunca van a tocar a bimbo pepsi y coca cola eso es lo que est causando la obesidad
2229103 es el inicio de un nuevo cap tulo para el d lar para trichet y para otros bancos centrales porque ahora centrar n su atenci n en los riesgos del crecimiento
2229104 el abaratamiento de los precios de los combustibles est tras esta subida porque los bancos centrales han dejado de tener puestos sus ojos en la inflaci n
2229105 de stijgende rente zorgt voor druk op de waardering van de panden
2229106 maar wat positief is is dat wij geen afwaarderingen hebben gedaan zoals het er nu uitziet verwachten we dat we dit ook niet hoeven te doen
2229107 we verwachten dat we op operationeel gebied de huidige lijn de rest van het jaar kunnen voortzetten
2229108 wij geven aan de markt aan dat we willen groeien
2229109 wel zou het kunnen zijn dat we tijdelijk pas op de plaats moeten maken vanwege de omstandigheden we wachten eerst af hoe de vastgoedmarkt zich gaat ontwikkelen
2229110 de koers moet eerst aanzienlijk aantrekken willen we daartoe overgaan
2229111 dat zou zomaar kunnen gebeuren sommige bedrijven zijn nu spotgoedkoop
2229112 het feit dat we op twee continenten zitten europa en de verenigde staten en canada biedt meer mogelijkheden
2229113 es un grupo de veras de amigos tenemos una gran relaci n todos en serio se trabaja muy padre es una relaci n muy informal de una comunicaci n s per abierta yo creo que la lealtad al presidente la amistad que tenemos con l nos hace focalizar perfecto lo que tenemos que hacer
2229114 we think that weve come up with something thats going to separate it from other superhero movies
2229115 we want it to be something different and we think we have that its going to have a different tone than the dark knight but its not going to be tongue in cheek it will definitely be straight ahead
2229116 hes gone in a different direction than jack heath is the most murderous pyschopath youve ever seen on screen
2229117 i was waiting for batmans guests but the joker had taken over the elevator oh wait until you see them so id never seen any of it and the elevator door opened and they came out and i forgot every bloody line they frightened the bloody life out of me

2229123 manhattan needed to be more than a man when he grows to 200 feet and hes tromping through the jungles of vietnam youve got to buy that and believe it
2229124 the biggest problem with being against everything feminists stand for is that one of those things is womens worth and basic equality with men
2229125 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future
2229126 quien acude al mercado se da cuenta de la consistente alza de precios quienes perdieron su trabajo o reciben por l una miseria como sueldo saben que el pa s va mal
2229127 vamos por el camino correcto todas estas reformas que se han presentado en la administraci n actual est n poniendo a m xico en la ruta de ser un pa s que pueda acelerar su crecimiento producir m s y con ello dar a todos el objetivo que queremos una vida mejor a cada mexicana y a cada mexicano

2229130 capacitar a los adolescentes para el ingreso a su vida sexual
2229131 el ejercicio de una vida sexual plena con sexo placentero como una parte fundamental de su desarrollo como personas
2229132 las cifras del ejecutivo y de ese instituto comenzar n a cuadrar a partir del pr ximo informe
2229133 los mandarinazos que recibi el boquiflojo de fox por parte de ese hasta hoy digno instituto cada vez que en su entusiasmada desinformaci n habl de cifras sobre el empleo disminuci n de la pobreza crecimiento del pib y dem s etc teras ah estaban los datos del inegi para desmentirlo lo mismo le ha pasado al chaparrito que gobierna desde el senado perd n desde los pinos
2229134 salvo los apachitos estos otros s se quedaron y se quedaron y le entendieron
2229135 cree que apareciendo en la televisi n va a resolver los problemas pero se equivoca
2229136 lo que estamos viviendo es el resultado del agotamiento de un modelo econ mico que ha exprimido a los trabajadores y a toda la sociedad
2229137 la grave concentraci n de la riqueza origen de varios males sociales
2229138 los bajos salarios crean presi n social que se completa con cuerpos de seguridad corrompidos y polic as mal pagados
2229139 lo que estamos viviendo es el resultado del agotamiento de un modelo econ mico que ha exprimido a los trabajadores y a toda la sociedad que no brinda oportunidades de empleo de educaci n alimentaci n y de movilidad social
2229140 los ciudadanos no vamos a dejar que arruinen el ambiente la vida cotidiana y el tejido social
2229141 el verdadero crimen organizado est en el gobierno debido a que vivimos en un clima de impunidad
2229142 hay miedo intimidaci n apat a y hasta sensaci n de derrota por lo vivido en el 2006 hay gente que dice ya probamos todo y no hay nada que hacer ya sabemos que las elecciones son un fraude probamos la acci n directa y no sirvi para nada entonces hay un efecto psicol gico de da o sin embargo al mismo tiempo se est generando una movilizaci n inteligente novedosa e imperceptible
2229143 es invisible para los medios de comunicaci n porque no es nada espectacular ya que no se define por marchas sino que se concretiza en iniciativas para generar un nuevo tejido social
2229144 bote pronto y ahora lo que se busca es hacer un diagn stico a fondo para generar los consensos democr ticos de todas las colonias para organizar el trabajo y la lucha
2229145 la reforma que queremos es una que nos haga saber que quien tenga que cuidar nuestra seguridad lo haga porque no creo que el problema principal sea el marco legal lo que creo es que la polic a y el sistema de justicia no funcionan
2229146 la multitud de leyes frecuentemente presta excusas a los vicios
2229147 nos hemos mantenido en crecimiento tanto en generaci n de divisas como en internaci n de turistas del extranjero as como en inversi n directa tanto del empresariado mexicano como internacional arriba del 5 por ciento
2229148 son innecesarios pues hoy vemos el perjuicio que tiene stos se est n usando como instrumentos y herramientas para robar secuestrar detener y meter algunas armas y drogas lo que deslinda responsabilidades penales a algunas personas que conducen los autom viles

2229151 nuestra vida tiene un sentido ahora que la ciencia ha descubierto tanto sobre el ser humano y el universo es grande la tentaci n de querer determinar exactamente la identidad del ser humano para incorporarla al conocimiento que se pueda tener sobre l para no ceder a esta tentaci n se necesita la antropolog a la filosof a y tambi n la teolog a ya que stas permiten al ser humano mantener su propio misterio ninguna ciencia puede decir lo que es el ser humano de d nde viene y a d nde va
2229152 habr una nueva legislaci n habr reforma que fortalezca a pemex y le de viabilidad a futuro habr una nueva negociaci n para m xico
2229153 hay un compromiso de los partidos pol ticos que nos parece de lo m s relevante para el pa s de que en el pr ximo periodo de sesiones habr una reforma de pemex despu s de todo el debate que se ha llevado a cabo en el senado despu s de la discusi n de 162 expertos lo que queda claro es que pemex no puede seguir como est sino que tiene que reformarse en eso coinciden expertos y partidos pol ticos los que han presentado su iniciativa y los que han dicho la van a presentar
2229154 la realidad es que a mayor capacidad de inversi n en el sector de refinaci n en el pa s habr m s refiner as y por lo tanto mayores posibilidades para este estado
2229155 la necesidad de refiner as en m xico es actualmente de cuatro y se tendr a que construir adem s de recuperar el rezago una nueva cada cinco a os y esto le dar a amplia posibilidades a cualquier estado particularmente a los que tienen actividad petrolera como campeche
2229156 a los secuestradores hay que castigarlos con todo el rigor de la ley por el da o y el sufrimiento que causan no solo a las v ctimas y a sus familiares sino a la sociedad entonces la cadena perpetua nos parece necesaria para seguir avanzando en el combate a la delincuencia y banda de secuestradores

2229223 i think that all successful people are successful because they use their intuition
2229224 successful people tend to really get what intuition is because they use it all the time they make decisions that go against reason however theyre wildly successful time after time after time when you do that you know that that against reason when it goes right is your intuition
2229225 i am one of those people who believes that your gut instinct comes from somewhere
2229226 you get that feeling in the pit of your stomach its for a reason and we would probably all benefit if we trusted our guts a little more i know that there are moments where i wish i had trusted my gut in the past where i didnt and there are moments where ive had a feeling about something and gone for it and its worked out wonderfully

2229231 i mean he was just a great man just a great person to be around he lived a wonderful life

2229260 we need to be able to offer opportunities for quality theological training to pastors and lay people who cannot afford the time or money to go to a traditional university setting
2229261 in a changing world the university remains the cornerstone of education but at uc we saw a need to take some of our offerings into the wider community to provide learning situations for men and women who might not have the opportunity to study in a traditional campus setting but who still prefer a classroom learning experience rather than an online class
2229262 the majority of our team attended summer school and appear to have done an excellent job in preparing for the season

2229292 practice was pretty much business as usual i have a set program for the day which we worked through no problem the first session allowed us to do some fairly long runs on a single tyre so we could see how consistent i can be then this afternoon i wanted to get some new brake pads bedded in as knockhill is notoriously hard on the brakes once i was happy with them i used the remaining time to confirm my race set up before concentrating on posting some quicker laps at the end our set up for the rest of the weekend is looking good im really happy with the pirelli tyres and im enjoying riding the airwaves ducati 1098r
2229293 i used the session this morning to basically find my feet and gain a good level of understanding of how the airwaves ducati works around here in this afternoons practice i went for a long run of laps and still managed to improve upon my fastest time from this morning which im happy about i now just need to get my head down and work on reducing my lap times further for qualifying tomorrow

2229297 it would take a while to learn the whole track being as its quite lengthy i just did one lap around the whole track but its great you know id love to come race here
2229298 thats good though the more technical aspects you have in a racetrack the better if you can see every corner coming in then its pretty easy to learn but ive always liked the off camber the little bit of elevation and blind corners its great
2229299 its real impressive coming to a track in the u s that has a set up like this
2229300 as a facility racetrack garages paddock access for sure its top notch it seems like im kind of asking the question why dont we have a grand prix here it just seems like a natural fit if you ask me
2229301 for grand prix riders i would say use the long track 100 percent
2229302 if youre dealing with the best riders in the world why not make them work the hardest if theyre going to have to learn something you might as well have them learn all of it
2229303 when we see energy costs going up through the current year and year as much as 20 percent we think it makes fiscal sense for shareholders employees and communities we do business
2229304 we have been trying to implement green on a variety of different levels whether its cleaning up our neighborhoods and our vacant lots

2229310 they only seem to die when the altercation is with the cops
2229311 its never an altercation with their brother in law with their neighbor
2229312 you get to swim play tennis play basketball do a whole bunch of things
2229313 it is just a good opportunity for kids who have had a not so fortunate early start in their life

2229327 we just swapped my settings over to the b bike the team worked really hard to get things ready for me
2229328 i missed my exit out of the hairpin and i had a big wobble on the backstraight but i know we have a good set up for the race tomorrow
2229329 the tire spun up and i was thrown up in the air were lucky we got what we did but we have a great bike for the race i just wanted to be on the front row
2229330 i didnt think i could do it in one lap like that but i felt i pieced it together well my main goal in the races is to get a good start and try and hook onto those factory guys
2229331 i think this is great that we are continuing to shift the social norm away from tobacco tobacco is not safe in any amount and i think that as you see all these kids here today out most important resource in community is our children

2229337 peter was my best friend and he was really into cb i became involved too later when peter decided to take an amateur radio licensing class it was natural that id go along with my buddy and take the class too
2229338 and here we are years later both advanced class and both working at arrl hq in the same department
2229339 glenn was an enthusiastic arrl staff member and amateur radio operator
2229340 he would even stay after hours to assist me in the product review process and he made me feel at home when i first arrived at arrl hq in addition he got me involved with yccc and serious contesting glenn was a great guy
2229341 i always liked glenn and was happy to have him in the department his death was such a shock
2229342 sometimes i dont want my kids to be outside we just be in the house
2229343 what we do is we would put undercover officers in those areas they would be solicited by the prostitute and then make the arrest for prostitution
2229344 its not as much as it was i first moved here it was people up and down the street and stuff and now that the police are patrolling the area its more quiet
2229345 it usually slows down for a little while but then it will pick back up so we constantly watch that area and we stay in communication with the people in that area
2229346 the russians oppose his plans for georgia to join nato because they feel the americans and nato are encircling russia
2229347 it certainly looks like it is heading to a full scale confrontation between russia and georgia but this is no longer a regional dispute but is becoming a despite between east and west
2229348 nn3si ceased operating from the national museum of american history on july 31
2229349 as you may know nmah has been undergoing a renovation of the buildings infrastructure and interior for some time the renovation forced us to remove the information age exhibition the stations home since 1990 we placed the station in a temporary location for the duration of the renovation but it cannot remain there when we reopen to the public later this year the information age exhibit will not be reinstalled and since we have no other appropriate exhibition areas within the museum the station had to cease operations at nmah various alternate locations throughout the smithsonian have been considered but none are viable at this time
2229350 john johnston w3be nn3sis trustee assures me that a renewal of the license would not be an issue if we need one should a suitable exhibition area elsewhere in the smithsonian institution be found we will be able to reactivate the nn3si activity
2229351 as we approach our fifth national preparedness month i want to thank the hundreds of coalition members who are making a difference in their communities by helping raise the basic level of preparedness in our country
2229352 individual preparedness is the cornerstone of emergency preparedness experience shows that if americans take steps ahead of time they stand a much better chance of coming through an emergency unharmed and recovering more quickly
2229353 these steps include getting an emergency supply kit making a family emergency plan being informed about the different emergencies that may affect them as well as taking the necessary steps to get trained and become engaged in community preparedness and response efforts
2229354 an easy win the federal people are already doing all the hard work all you really have to do is sign up most clubs and ares groups are already doing activities which fit into their structure so why not get credit for your actions of course if you do something more with this opportunity so much the better but you have to sign your group in and no one can do that for you there are hundreds of ares groups and clubs in the country wouldnt it be fun to have even 70 percent of them sign up and get noticed

2229370 one of the fun parts is that we are going to have the men in one of the parlors having cigars and brandy after dinner and they are discussing something very exciting there is an election this year and there are two candidates vying heavily against each other they will be trying to decide who they are going to vote for sound familiar even back in 1852

2229384 based on the field observations it is a reasonable conclusion that the dspud effluent discharge was at least a major contributing factor to a reportedly rare highly unusual transient growth of filamentous green algae in the south yuba river in june 2008 in the reach from the dspud effluent discharge point downstream through the towle mountain estates area but not as far downstream as kingvale the filamentous biofilm tracks fairly well to the effluent discharge point
2229385 in his capacity as facilitator of that agreement the secretary general intends to send a senior official to lead his delegation at the transfer ceremony
2229386 culminating in the peaceful resolution of a potentially dangerous boundary dispute through respect for international law and good neighbourly cooperation it is an example that should serve as a model for the negotiated settlement of border disputes elsewhere
2229387 leaders should not start an operation without thinking it is not enough just to identify the desired end state
2229388 the unrest and violence following the fall of the saddam regime were recognised by british officers in mid 2003 as indicators of insurgent activity but it took longer for us commanders to accept this and to take suitable counter measures
2229389 dammit i said freedom and democracy everybody knows what im talking about and thats all i need to say i wowed them in lithuania and albania with those words
2229390 the first half of 2008 has been as difficult an operating environment as we have encountered for some time presenting both general and specific challenges to rbs
2229391 the results we have published today demonstrate progress in a number of important areas and it is all the more unsatisfactory therefore that they record a loss as a result of our credit market write downs
2229392 we are determined to ensure that the inherent strengths of the groups diverse business model are not obscured in this way again
2229393 banks will find themselves with a shared interest in broken down pools of defaulted mortgages and or other synthetic cdos which will not be worth the paper theyre written on
2229394 falling prices lie directly ahead for most foreign markets as u s investors are stuffed to the gills with stocks from far away place
2229395 as we go to press sentiment is still allowing for plenty of downside potential
2229396 weve been fortunate that our program continues to develop players to play beyond their collegiate careers
2229397 both brandon and taylor saw an opportunity to come to nebraska and potentially have an immediate impact we feel great that their talent and character match our programs philosophy and goals we are excited to have them be in our program this fall for the upcoming season
2229398 brandon comes from one of the best junior college programs in the country
2229399 he has a good power arm and throws in the upper 80s and lower 90s with a good breaking ball he only pitched full time for one year so he is still developing but has a good understanding of how to pitch
2229400 i think wed feel better if we could wrap this up for the family if nothing else
2229401 the parts at the scene match whats missing from the car very well
2229402 from the beginning i said something good will come from this deannas a strong lady she has a lot of faith and the familys very close shell make it
2229403 one thing the hair loss was the least of my worries when it happened it was not as traumatic as i thought it would be and it wont be the end of the world for anybody out there whos about to embark on this journey
2229404 that was tough yeah well for once he was taking care of me instead of me taking care of him hes been great through the whole thing hes been so supportive that just felt great
2229405 i think your relationship to your family your spiritual life that is so much more important than monetary things we dont feel any different or any better than anybody else we just feel really blessed
2229406 i dont want to bring no distractions to our team my number one goal coming here was not to speak on political issues it was to come win a gold medal
2229407 i said if i was asked the question then i would answer and id say that basic human rights should be protected thats how i feel its not going to go further than that its not going to go less than that
2229408 as a matter of fact i did the opposite i told them if your heart tells you say it say it we told our players no one has a muzzle some of us voiced our opinions my opinion was were here for the olympics were here for the sport there is a lot more we can accomplish by doing what we need to do
2229409 any of our players can speak about whatever they want to speak
2229410 but i think weve all taken the approach that were here for sport we want to make sure that were good ambassadors for our country and make sure that were representing our game here in the olympics
2229411 thats where well leave it were going to focus on what weve got to do weve got enough on our plate to bring back the gold medal so we let the people that know best about the situation handle that situation and us do what we do
2229412 we have empathy for whats happening be it in tibet or darfur and if our players are asked and their heart tells to say something thats up to them
2229413 i know people want quotes from some of these athletes on these issues but come aug 26 i dont think well be asking those same questions its kind of newsy now i dont have an issue with that at all
2229414 im not looking to be a gymnast but im looking to be more active in my life
2229415 what we did was make a separate incision at the pelvis scrape out bone from the inside of the pelvis and pack that into the spine where we wanted it to go
2229416 they genetically turn on the switches to make bone cells and eventually the bones fuse together
2229417 because you dont have to scrape out the bone and you dont have an extra incision the infection rate is a lot less
2229418 its just theres no way i could have gone without it
2229419 lea t hampton is going broke glam town 12m in the hole
2229420 everybody perceives east hampton to be the home of the rich and famous
2229421 when the summers over its just the same old town just like all these other towns
2229422 the disparity between rich and poor is probably unmatched anywhere in the world you have the heads of multinational corporations billionaires but of the year round population half the work force are undocumented immigrants living below the poverty level
2229423 i dont mind providing the programs but what the general public has to understand is that we dont manufacture money here
2229424 somebody was clearly not paying attention to the bottom line
2229425 we cannot run society for the privileged and allow a significant proportion of the population to be marginalized it impacts the quality of life for all of us if we have throwaway people a justice system which tolerates injustice is doomed to collapse i am truly ready for action
2229426 these kinds of activities with towns in our region embody the psu to serve mission not only for the benefit of the region but for the students to apply their academic knowledge in answering important questions for our region
2229427 there was need to understand whether people felt a connection to newfound lake and to the watershed and whether they would help support rules and regulations that would help guide everyone more appropriately
2229428 if you were here 10 years ago and fast forward to today youd see a difference especially on the hillsides
2229429 more development around the lake will come in time and if were not proactive in managing the natural resources of the land forest and water and providing for the folks that live here this place will change in a way that most people dont want to see i think

2229433 ah alice how are you i need to talk to you about demeter i am very upset alice
2229434 tell me why is that there are two categories for biodynamie farming and biodynamie grapes this is impossible in europe there is only one designation biodynamie and if you see biodynamie it is a natural wine but you are saying i cant trust demeter for wine in the united states ach alice this is a disaster
2229435 and what about this green merdre sustainable and salmon and organic grape and low carbon you mean to tell me this does not mean the wine is made naturally
2229436 no in fact it often just means conventional winemaking practice

2229442 the piperjet exhibited excellent control response around all three axes
2229443 the ergonomics and the basic operation of the side stick control were excellent with well balanced and harmonized control inputs required for the air speeds that we tested moreover the expected level of pitch trim change with power applications was minimal and easy to overcome

2229447 one of the reasons i wanted to stage this fight in cincinnati was because the midwest in general has been overlooked for boxing events
2229448 im just trying to give the crowd a good show i dont come to hold i dont come to run i come to fight im a fast quick fighter who hits and doesnt get hit i plan on being world champion so its important to show my championship heart

2229451 this is an extremely difficult time for all of us that knew and loved ryan and i would ask that we are given the time and space to grieve in private

2229459 the project management team is planning the relocation very carefully to keep everything within schedule
2229460 we will move back in again at the end of 2011 if everything goes according to schedule
2229461 people are struggling to pay their power bill and they end up with not enough money for food
2229462 during the winter more are needed generally but i would say the demand has increased around 50
2229463 it has been noticeable in some areas that those on lower working incomes are coming in for food whereas it used to be just people on benefits
2229464 they are tightening their budgets learning to cook cheaper food make the dollar go further cheese for example is simply no longer on the menu
2229465 we recently had an appeal and just about all the food banks reported record collections people are putting other people ahead of themselves we have got adequate stocks
2229466 the donations have remained reasonably steady but because of the increase in demand the cupboards here can at times look empty
2229467 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
2229468 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter we expect our fuel bill to top 3 billion this year the equivalent of more than 8 million every day
2229469 it was an amazing experience ive never seen so many youths unite in such a way ever before
2229470 it gave me an opportunity to deepen my faith and unite with other people that shared in the same faith world youth day gave people the chance to get involved with the church and make a difference
2229471 youths learnt how to have fun without alcohol and that life is better without the need for secular pressures
2229472 i even met people from places i have never even heard of
2229473 what level of fervor there is for that theres only one way to find out i guess wait until november fourth
2229474 we want to continue to offer all three flights during this time so we have done everything we can by partnering with both carriers westjet will be leasing a small aircraft and air canada added legs to pick up the slack as each plane will only be able to accommodate 37 seats as opposed to 136 passengers on the larger planes
2229475 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss it is the result of careful precautions
2229476 the undoubtedly very good first half result should not allow us to lose sight of the major challenges that lie ahead our company has the great opportunity to emerge relatively stronger from the increasingly difficult market and competition situation that we find ourselves in we have laid the foundations and will not jeopardize our future we have shown in the past that we are prepared for these kinds of situations and are capable of reacting to them our financial strength and operating adaptability will grant us the opportunity to remain profitable and strong and to continue to make our company more attractive for our shareholders customers and employees
2229477 we now accept that the story was untrue and that he is not suffering from any such condition said the london

2229480 the airline sector is in trouble losses this year could reach us 6 1 billion more than wiping out the us 5 6 billion that airlines made in 2007 falling demand and rising costs are re shaping the industry
2229481 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense
2229482 the constitution sets qualifications for the president and then the people decide who they think would be the better president i think we have two choices i think he obama should win and i think he will win
2229483 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
2229484 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
2229485 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
2229486 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
2229487 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
2229488 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about
2229489 most prophylactic preventive measures need to be given early after the injury

2229492 our partnership with brussels airlines is particularly good for the clients of both airline companies as our route networks essentially are complementary as opposed to overlapping airbaltic has an excellent range of products in terms of flights to cis countries baltic countries and regional centres in scandinavia while brussels airlines offers attractive destinations in africa

2229529 our guidance in terms of growth rate in our loans for 2008 was in a range of 20 25 i think were comfortable in giving the information that we plan on closing this year with a 25 growth rate
2229530 we cant assume well reach 25 every year we dont have a clue if in 2009 well have a 25 growth rate we dont know but i tell you that at a 25 growth rate we have the capital to support these increases

2229817 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2229818 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2229819 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2229820 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2229821 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
