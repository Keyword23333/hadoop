2720000 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2720001 tutto ci che devi sapere se vuoi sconfinare da queste parti
2720002 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2720003 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2720006 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2720007 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2720008 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2720017 of all tyrannies a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive it may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies the robber barons cruelty may sometimes sleep his cupidity may at some point be satiated but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience

2720082 she had the talent to be here but she had to go through the pain and sorrow of waiting four years there are u s junior champions who have the talent to be here but cant
2720083 it is nonsense whoever has the maturity and talent to compete at this level should be here
2720084 since they forced the age limit higher and higher there has been cheating
2720085 the fig is running away they set the limit but they dont want to enforce it
2720086 they had an athlete who looked too young we checked and found she had competed in a junior competition six months earlier at the age of 13 how had she aged three yeas in six months we had the document fig knows this goes on
2720087 they think we are stupid we are in gymnastics too we know what arrogance these people have thinking everyone in this arena is stupid these girls are half people you dont have to be a gymnastics coach to know what a kid looks like at 11 or 12 or 16 and 17 you have only to be a good mom or dad to know that

2720093 a point of pride and a personal branding advantage it encourages approachability
2720094 i fully expect our success story in china to continue because the visibility and excitement we will generate for our brands during the olympic games will create a halo effect sustaining the momentum of our group in this market well into the future

2720100 an early draft of the regulations found its way into public circulation before it had reached my review
2720101 it contained words that lead some to conclude my intent is to deal with the subject of contraceptives somehow defining them as abortion not true
2720102 why is secretary mike leavitt kowtowing to birth control companies and abortion activists
2720103 if he is seeking to protect conscience rights of those who want nothing to do with abortion he needs to recognize that contraceptives can cause abortions
2720104 the truth is that life begins at creation and anything that destroys that life is an abortion
2720105 we hope mr leavitt will have the courage to stand for truth against abortion advocates
2720106 based on his disregard and disrespect for human life we should question his insistence that hes a christian it is inconsistent with the biblical world view to think that not only is abortion okay but he goes so far as to support partial birth abortion
2720107 theres a problem in this hardcore left philosophy of barack obama that people keep dismissing
2720108 i think obamas social policies will destroy whats left of the black family socialism doesnt work it doesnt work for individuals it doesnt work for families and it doesnt work for our society our society cannot coexist with socialism
2720109 i would never support someone just because of their race and i certainly wouldnt support a hardcore leftwing liberal marxist as barack obama is
2720110 you cannot put the principles that we say we hold dear on the sidelines because race is now a factor
2720111 its the principles of america that have made america great not the ethnicity of the people that develop those principles and put them into law and establish this great nation
2720112 there are varieties of gifts but the same spirit and there are varieties of service but the same lord and there are varieties of working but it is the same god who inspires them all in every one to each is given the manifestation of the spirit for the common good
2720113 by the 6th grade i stopped doing ordinary things in front of people it had been ordinary to sing kids are singing all the time when they are little but then something happens
2720114 i believe this happens to most of us we are still singing but secretly and all alone
2720115 i also stopped dancing around or dancing in any way this wasnt a decision i couldnt dance in front of people if i wanted to my body just froze up my only feeling was embarrassment i quit my hula dancing lessons people always laugh when i tell them i took the hula very seriously as a child but i did i went to lessons twice a week for six years i danced to ancient hawaiian chants and songs every tuesday and thursday after school like it was the most ordinary thing in the world

2720117 musharraf should step down before the start of the impeachment proceedings because the country cannot afford confrontation any more
2720118 the president should avail the opportunity to make an honourable exit
2720119 it will be a historic motion it will have solid points against musharraf
2720120 the charge sheet will be solid and musharraf will not be able to fight it
2720121 musharraf still has time it will be in his own interest if he resigns
2720122 we have far beyond the two thirds majority he should realise this
2720123 this is the beginning of a new chapter for the dollar as trichet and other central banks are paying more attention to the downside risk to growth
2720124 the decline of oil prices is a significant driver behind this dollar rally because it enables other central banks to turn their eyes away from inflation and focus on growth
2720125 the most important aspect of the dramatic collapse in the euro dollar is the absence of confirmation from other markets
2720126 none of the typical drivers of the euro dollar in the past couple of years could have accounted for the magnitude of this move which leads one to conclude that this is a technical driven move from that point of view we do not think that this move is sustainable
2720127 hes going to have to learn to play in that environment he might as well go start right away and get into that atmosphere
2720128 we are still counting the dead and searching for the missing but we expect the toll to be bad especially at those villages that have been isolated after roads were washed away and communication lost

2720143 search for apples and they havent actually somehow scanned the images itself to illustrates danny sullivan
2720144 while progress has been made in automatic face detection in images finding other objects such as mountains or tea pots which are instantly recognizable to humans has lagged
2720145 we cast the image ranking problem into the task of identifying authority nodes on an inferred visual similarity graph and propose an algorithm to analyze the visual link structure that can be created among a group of images through an iterative procedure based on the pagerank computation a numerical weight is assigned to each image this measures its relative importance to the other images being considered
2720146 by treating images as web documents and their similarities as probabilistic visual hyperlinks we estimate the likelihood of images visited by a user traversing through these visual hyperlinks those with more estimated visits will be ranked higher than others
2720147 first by making the approach query dependent by selecting the initial set of images from search engine answers human knowledge in terms of linking relevant images to webpages is directly introduced into the system since the links on the pages are used by google for their current ranking second we implicitly rely on the intelligence of crowds the image similarity graph is generated based on the common features between images those images that capture the common themes from many of the other images are those that will have higher rank
2720148 it is a tight competition we have lost a couple perhaps in the past we have won early on and i think one year we had already won it before we went to south africa
2720149 its a new challenge there are new guys in our team and we have to help them through to make them realise this is not super 14 this is test match rugby and it is pressure cooker stuff and you have to try to really soak it up im enjoying that
2720150 it is a massive build up the week is so intense and the difference between that and the super 14 is that the whole country gets right behind them and that can be a bit intimidating
2720151 it is really hard to win in their backyard but we are going there to play well and hopefully come away with the win
2720152 we would like to highlight again the fact we support the territorial integrity of georgia and we call for an immediate ceasefire
2720153 we are going to discuss further with the local authorities to prepare for the arrival of the presidency of the european union bernard kouchner the french foreign minister will arrive tonight together with alexander stoop who is the president of the osce
2720154 under those aggravated circumstances the military commanders in the battlefield regrouped the troops and pulled them out from the city of tskhinvali
2720155 people are in a difficult situation especially old people children and women they have seen a lot of suffering i would like to draw your attention mr president to elements of genocide against south ossetian people

2720210 se castiga por igual un alijo de 50 kilos de droga que otro de 3 000
2720211 actualmente los alijos de cannabis cada vez son de m s toneladas
2720212 castiga por igual llevar 50 kilos que 3 000 por lo que a igualdad de riesgo de ser apresados los narcotraficantes tratan de meter la mayor cantidad de droga posible para sacar un beneficio mayor
2720213 en funci n de la pureza de la droga y el n mero de kilos del alijo
2720214 en francia reino unido alemania o italia casi duplican las penas que hay en espa a
2720215 la provincia andaluza m s cercana a marruecos el mayor productor mundial de cannabis y por c diz se introduce la mayor a de estas sustancias
2720216 el plan nacional sobre drogas dice que somos el pa s con mayor n mero de consumidores habituales de esta sustancia y si ha habido un aumento de demanda tambi n lo ha habido en la oferta
2720217 el trabajo de investigaci n realizado por el equipo de delincuencia organizada y antidroga edoa de la guardia civil
2720218 la escalada de violencia y la peligrosidad de los narcotraficantes
2720219 las bandas cada vez son m s violentas en este caso se resistieron con mucha dureza incluida una persecuci n muy peligrosa con algunos agentes atropellados
2720220 que se fuera despu s de pedir disculpas y expresar p blico arrepentimiento
2720221 el paquete de reformas incluye entre otras modificaciones a la ley general de salud y al impi adelant el presidente de la comisi n de salud de la c mara de diputados
2720222 estamos buscando que para el 2010 nada m s haya dos tipos de medicamentos los innovadores y no innovadores gen ricos intercambiables
2720223 si los laboratorios no quieren ser solidarios con el gobierno en esta propuesta dijo se buscar n las medidas legales que puedan aplicarse para disminuir el costo de las medicinas
2720224 esa es la prioridad si hay que modificar y tocar algunas leyes diferentes a las de salud estaremos como legisladores actuando en consecuencia
2720225 simplemente que con los datos que se tienen el mismo laboratorio con el mismo medicamento en dos pa ses diferentes fija precios absurdos
2720226 si esa actitud se sigue dando estaremos actuando en consecuencia si no es en un acuerdo en la mesa de negociaci n que se instal con la secretar a de salud la secretar a de econom a la c mara nacional de la industria farmac utica canifarma y las empresas farmac uticas entonces estaremos haciendo uso de las herramientas jur dicas
2720227 candados que impiden que en una situaci n en particular se pueda declarar una alerta para enfermedades como el sida para que m xico pueda hacer a un lado las patentes y se produzcan en nuestro pa s los medicamentos pues adem s hay la infraestructura necesaria para ello
2720228 es un asunto al que hay que entrarle con la disposici n de que el pa s no tenga que estar invirtiendo tantos recursos en los medicamentos y que ello se pueda reflejar en beneficio de la ciudadan a ya que la poblaci n paga altos costos en medicamentos de patente
2720229 nos queda claro que las empresas farmac utica no son hermanas de la caridad son negocios y su objetivo es la ganancia hacen un trabajo de investigaci n y en dos d as quieren obtener su inversi n
2720230 lo nico que ha cambiado es su presentaci n pero eso no implica que est n haciendo realmente su labor
2720231 despu s de la aprobaci n a la reforma en materia penal propuesta por el ejecutivo nacional oaxaca se encuentra en la mira por contar con un sistema de justicia de vanguardia y hoy magistrados y jueces de diversas partes del pa s visitan la regi n del istmo para observar la operatividad del sistema y recibir capacitaci n en este rubro
2720232 la justicia oral ofrece grandes ventajas asegura transparencia y una mayor garant a en la protecci n de los derechos del acusado adem s brinda igualdad de oportunidades a la parte acusadora a la defensora para que presenten el caso y se les escuche y que la sentencia sea certera
2720233 vamos a lograr eficiencia y rapidez en la resoluci n de los problemas pero sobre todo un combate abierto a la corrupci n
2720234 son m ltiples las irregularidades en cuanto a la aplicaci n de este sistema judicial en donde los juicios orales no son todo lo que se pensaba por lo que se necesita hacer un alto en el camino y dejando posiciones triunfalistas analizar a detalles en d nde est fracasando
2720235 los juicios orales constituyen una alternativa r pida barata y transparente para realizar un proceso penal pues s lo cinco por ciento de los delitos ocurridos ser an llevados a juicio con este sistema los delitos considerados menores podr an ser resueltos por otras v as
2720236 el juez decidir a qu casos merecen ir a juicio y cu les pueden ser solucionados v a la conciliaci n mediaci n o suspensi n de la acci n penal a cambio de ciertas condiciones
2720237 no quedar an dudas en torno a la forma en que realicen el proceso penal pues el sistema de audiencias que opera como su fundamento permite que durante el juicio est presente la parte que acusa
2720238 y poco a poco el efecto de demostraci n se vaya instrumentando paulatinamente hasta llegar hasta el primer partido judicial en la zona metropolitana de guadalajara
2720239 en tiempo el promedio de los casos en jalisco es de 185 d as con la justicia alternativa podr a ser de diez d as en promedio y en caso de llegar a un juicio oral s lo tomar a dos meses

2720241 un tiro en la sien al chofer la nena va a la deriva un auto detiene la inercia ellos la tienen rodeada su frente dio contra el cristal y le ha abierto una herida los vecinos se encierran con llave nadie ha visto nada y la mano que mat a su chofer ahora le opaca los gritos la nena es un uno con ceros a partir de hoy
2720242 un punto fundamental dentro de la capacitaci n de una nueva polic a tica y para la dignificaci n de estos cuerpos evidentemente se requiere de una coordinaci n de todos los niveles si se desea enfrentar realmente el problema para ello se necesita una pol tica de estado no solamente son los colores de los partidos sino decir cu les son las acciones de coordinaci n que se proponen puesto que al interior de las propias instituciones federales no se da esta coordinaci n mucho menos con los estados y los municipios los estados son verdaderos cotos de poder feudales que dominan la estad stica de la delincuencia en su propio beneficio
2720243 si no hay esa pol tica a ade vamos a reunirnos ciudadanos con acad micos con empresarios con todos y vamos a estructurarla aunque nos tardemos pero si nos seguimos tardando la situaci n que estamos sufriendo se ir agravando y torn ndose m s y m s violenta
2720244 inicialmente precis las grandes organizaciones focalizaban sus actividades delictivas en ciertos grupos econ micos o sociales en profesionistas en peque os o en grandes empresarios pero despu s del desmantelamiento de varios grupos delictivos aquellos otros elementos que los conformaban y que sin conocer perfectamente las estrategias que estos grandes delincuentes del secuestro desarrollaban para ser eficaces o eficientes en el secuestro empezaron a tratar por su cuenta de desarrollar este delito
2720245 y es as como en la gran mayor a de los secuestros que estallaron en forma alarmante en la ciudad de m xico el foco de atenci n para ser secuestrados fueron j venes de 16 a 25 a os primordialmente eso se derivaba de la facilidad que se ten a primero con un chico con el descuido que ten a en su seguridad personal segundo porque son demasiado ostentosos con algunos bienes de capital o de fortuna que facilitan la identificaci n de capacidad econ mica para el pago del rescate y tercero porque un chico de esa edad es muy dif cil que oponga resistencia o pueda generar alternativas para un escape
2720246 do you not know that you are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwells in you if anyone defiles the temple of god god will destroy him for the temple of god is holy which temple you are
2720247 let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness
2720248 and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with the spirit
2720249 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god
2720250 wine is a mocker strong drink is raging and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise
2720251 but im not hurt they beat me but i dont feel it when will i wake up so i can find another drink

2720253 the well dressed man told toms wife that he knew where her son lived what line of work he was in and how many children he had

2720259 its going to get hard if and when i have to leave
2720260 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
2720261 i think whats happening is that since the so called oil bubble has burst some it takes a little bit of pressure off of natural gas
2720262 that doesnt sound like much but it translates to tens of thousands of dollars across the stores each month
2720263 the commodity portion of the gas bill shouldnt increase from where it is
2720264 what you saw in the congress this week was the war dance of the handmaidens of the oil companies
2720265 we are spending all of this time on a parliamentary tactic when nothing less is at stake than the planet the air we breathe our children breathe
2720266 i saw an advertisement online for a charity auction in new york city
2720267 it was a fundraiser for the paley center for media which used to be the museum of television and radio i went on my own i didnt think i would end up with it but i was the highest bidder i paid in the low thousands for it there wasnt a lot of competition the other two bidders were on the phone and it took about 15 minutes
2720268 the sign is 900 pounds and is made out of wood and plastic
2720269 it came in two sections of 14 feet by 10 feet and it took six of us to unload it
2720270 when people are looking for the diner we just say turn right at the price is right sign
2720271 its unique and unusual and it fits in well im following in my dads footsteps by including unique items im taking baby steps this is my contribution so far everybodys happy this is a neat piece of american heritage and history and were thrilled to have it here this is something that would be seen at the smithsonian like fonzies jacket and the ruby slippers
2720272 people enjoy it every day people come in take pictures of it and talk about growing up with the show i can remember being home from school sick and watching the show at 11 in the morning it always made me feel better
2720273 is there something really important we need to talk about or you need me to do more important right now than sleep
2720274 nfs is getting pressure from clustered file systems like lustre and gpfs as well as custom file systems produced by web 2 0 service providers such as google gfs
2720275 i put 26 years in so i know what theyre going through
2720276 its good that people are coming back and recognizing and supporting the young people today people from the county should give them the recognition they deserve
2720277 i first heard about citizens for patriots when i was overseas
2720278 i talked back and forth with kids from head start and they sent stuff to us that i distributed to my soldiers they surprised me with a welcome home party in june and i wanted to do something to say thank you all the proceeds will go to citizens for patriots
2720279 i never knew a tractor could do that i learn something new here every year
2720280 weve also got health care representatives from the city and county and different emergency squads
2720281 the sheriffs department is here with the drug dogs to show people what we have here in the county theres a terrible drug problem in the county
2720282 theres a variety of food and the ice cream is delicious
2720283 we own a farm so i want to see the tractor safety demonstrations
2720284 having your voice listened to is a privilege not a right and its a privilege thats earned in proportion to the contribution level not volume level
2720285 as we age what we need to do to stay healthy begins to change these new easy to read checklists help americans age 50 and older realize the important steps they can take to stay healthy
2720286 equipping people with the tools and information to stay healthy is important for healthy aging we are eager to promote the use of these checklists through aging network community based partners that reach more than 10 4 million older people and their caregivers and deliver evidence based health promotion and disease prevention programs
2720287 if youd told me back in 1984 when i graduated from coshocton high school that some 20 years later id be heading up one of the largest radiation oncology departments in the country i would have said yeah i dont think thats going to happen
2720288 i actually have very fond memories of coshocton since i essentially spent all my childhood there
2720289 i went to lincoln elementary school and then coshocton middle school and high school growing up in coshocton i learned at a young age many important values such as hard work
2720290 but i would say that given my interest in the sciences and math that medicine became a very good fit for me
2720291 and my father was a very strong influence on both my brother and me as far as what a physician can do i think having a father who was a pediatrician in town we saw what was good and what was bad about medicine he had a pretty chaotic work schedule i remember he didnt take a lot of vacations and was on call 24 7 with his private practice
2720292 one of my vivid memories as a child is that the phone would ring at all hours
2720293 or he would go into the emergency room late at night as a result when we were kids my brother steve and i joked that if we ever became physicians we would never become pediatricians
2720294 my father is probably one of my biggest critics as far as my work schedule
2720295 the key advantage of gamma knife over traditional brain surgery is that theres no hospitalization no anesthesia and no surgical incision
2720296 this technology was actually developed in the early 1950s and the first machine was developed in 1968 cleveland clinic was the first in ohio to start a gamma knife program back in january 1997 and weve performed over 2 500 procedures since that time so we have by far probably the largest experience with this procedure in ohio
2720297 unfortunately the types of tumors i deal with generally have a poor prognosis
2720298 we are trying to prolong survival and maintain quality of life as well cancer is a tough disease but there is a lot of good research going on and hopefully in time well be able to conquer this disease places like cleveland clinic are at the forefront of trying to move things forward in that area the good news is that weve made some good progress with brain tumors we now have better imaging better ways of delivering radiation treatment and we also understand some of the biology of tumors
2720299 its a very dynamic place with a lot of growth and opportunities and for me thats been one of the exciting things about my job
2720300 when i grew up in coshocton there were roughly 12 000 people in the city i sometimes think of that i now work in a place that employs over three times that number i experienced my first culture change when i moved from coshocton to miami florida for college moving to cleveland was much easier for me since i could come home to coshocton on the weekends and see my parents more often
2720301 its interesting but since cleveland clinic is such a large place when patients find out im from a small town i can see them relax and ill see a little twinkle in their eye
2720302 they realize im not a big city doctor and that im actually a small town kid at heart
2720303 nach der vereinbarung m sste das land pro jahr selbst einen anteil von mindestens 29 millionen euro f r die betreuung von unter dreij hrigen kindern tragen tats chlich setzt die landesregierung aber nur rund zwei millionen euro ein
2720304 die landesregierung ordnet offenbar alles ihrer finanzpolitischen vorgabe unter bis 2010 einen ausgeglichenen haushalt hinzubekommen aber an dieser stelle darf man einfach nicht sparen den eigenen anspruch und die mit dem bund vereinbarten ziele erreicht man damit jedenfalls nicht
2720305 wir haben den gr ten nachholbedarf aber die cdu fdp landesregierung tut viel zu wenig
2720306 aber allein das kultusministerium hat 2007 in dem bereich kinderbetreuung einen viel gr eren betrag n mlich 8 3 millionen euro eingespart und in der so genannten globalen minderausgabe verbucht
2720307 statt das geld f r krippen und kindertagesst tten komplett auszugeben wurde damit teilweise der haushalt saniert
2720308 mit allen diplomatischen mitteln muss jetzt verhindert werden dass der s dkaukasus zu einem m rderischen schlachtfeld wird und in krieg und zerst rung versinkt

2720310 wenn die kriegerischen kampfhandlungen nicht umgehend von allen seiten eingestellt werden droht der konflikt um unabh ngigkeit auch die abtr nnige republik abchasien zu ergreifen neben der uno m ssen jetzt auch die staaten der nato ihren politischen beitrag leisten sie sollten sich allerdings daran erinnern wer den albanern im kosovo v lkerrechtswidrig das recht auf lostrennung zubilligt kann den osseten und abchasen nicht erkl ren weshalb sie dasselbe nicht haben sollen es war vorauszusehen dass die anerkennung der abtrennung des kosovo andere unabh ngigkeitsbestrebungen ermuntern wird ihre ziele ebenfalls ohne r cksicht auf das internationale recht zu verfolgen umso gr er ist die verpflichtung der nato staaten jetzt die streitenden parteien aus diesem krieg herauszuholen und an den verhandlungstisch zur ckzuf hren
2720311 die nato sollte die einbeziehung von georgien ad acta legen und ihre einkreisungsstrategie gegen ber russland einmotten ein partnerschaftliches verh ltnis sieht anders aus

2720354 cera in essi la gioia di incontrarsi e di scoprire insieme un mondo nuovo come non fare un confronto con i loro coetanei che in cerca di false evasioni consumano esperienze degradanti che sfociano non di rado in sconvolgenti tragedie
2720355 e questo un tipico prodotto dellattuale cosiddetta societ del benessere che per colmare un vuoto interiore e la noia che lo accompagna induce a tentare esperienze nuove pi emozionanti pi estreme anche le vacanze rischiano cos di dissiparsi in un vano inseguire miraggi di piacere ma in questo modo lo spirito non riposa il cuore non prova gioia e non trova pace anzi finisce per essere ancora pi stanco e triste di prima

2720367 the absence of our great poet mahmud darwish the love of palestine and the pioneer of the modern palestinian cultural project will leave a great void in our cultural political and national life
2720368 darwish is the essential breath of the palestinian people the eloquent witness of exile and belonging
2720369 before anything mahmud darwish was a great poet who possessed real poetic power
2720370 he quickly became the national palestinian poet the poet of the exile and of the refugees

2720380 i tried to potty train her she wouldnt train i tried to get her into schools no one would take her

2720556 i am a new vegan and have literally been attacked in all sorts of verbal arguments everything from no wonder you look sick which i dont to why dont you care about babies you have given me so much ammo so that i dont have to resort to arguments but i have a question it is overwhelming all of the information i have learned about animal suffering and the humans that suffer along that are involved in the killing and processing of animals how do you deal with that awareness i lived in misinformation for so long or maybe it was denial and now that i know i have a very hard time dealing with it i feel anxious or depressed and try to stretch myself to do every little thing i could possibly do to reduce my impact or tell someone about it
2720557 today i listened in incredible pain to your podcast on fishing bycatch as an avid scuba diver who has spent many hours underwater sharing the wonderful ocean with beautiful marine species i cannot tell you how excruciatingly depressing it was for me to hear you quote the agonising facts and figures on over fishing bycatch killings and atrocious effects that the fishing industry is having on the wonderful lives below the surface nothing on your podcast was new to me what really pained was to realise what little difference i as an individual and a few thousands like me can make to this dismal situation i truly feel that what i do what you do what many like us try to do has hardly any true effect on the atrocious actions that the fishing industry and governments carry though every day i feel like we are as small flea trying to shift an elephant how do you do it colleen where do you get the energy to continue fighting on every day dont you get depressed and feel like giving up because you feel that your efforts hardly make a difference i certainly feel like that i will of course continue with my efforts every single day but i have resigned myself to think that whatever i chose to do the world around me will continue to charge ahead with its destruction

2720645 hes going against some great competition on our offensive line and when you add in what weve got on the back end with smith mike mickens and underwood all getting their hands on balls with either break ups or interceptions its pretty clear that we have a very talented defense that said we still have a lot of work to do
2720646 i thought dustin bounced back after throwing an interception in the red zone and did a nice job of driving the team down the field

2720704 the national enquirer is not well regarded as a news source by the news media
2720705 we began pursuing the story soon after it first appeared but the standard for proof in this kind of intimate behavior is and should be very high
2720706 better to get it right even if we couldnt get it first

2720717 i knew things were happening i couldnt control and that were obviously not very good
2720718 it was a little bit hard to go out from there

2720737 has been far disproportionate from whatever threat russia was citing
2720738 to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2720739 there are already russian aircraft over georgia so the chances of direct engagement between russian and nato aircraft is very high
2720740 if you are in moscow and you are looking at the tools that the u s nato and the eu have what are they
2720741 nobody is going to send troops so you are going to get away with it

2720754 lenovos next challenges are expanding its market share through expanding its consumer portfolio and of course overseas acquisitions but that will be by chance

2720794 we recommend people say im sorry ill call the bank and then call the bank directly my best advice is to deal with local banks or businesses that other family and friends have had success with
2720795 they meet start chatting and then the person sends them flowers
2720796 weve seen a lot of elderly buy on the phone site unseen

2720803 dpc did not have evidence of what was purchased invoices provided by the employee detailed purchases made by the employee however they did not detail which patients received the items
2720804 supervisors were unaware of the purchases in addition some of the items were alcohol based which is contrary to dpc practice
2720805 tested documentation for 35 trips and found that for 29 of 35 trips 83 percent the number of trip attendees exceeded the maximum capacity of the requested vehicles vans seat a maximum of 15 people the number of attendees would range from 13 22 with documentation supporting the reservation of only one van while dpc believes that additional vehicles were used there is no documentation to support that claim
2720806 both the employee and the employees supervisor have discontinued their employment with dpc
2720807 this rings true of the need for protections at every level including financial protection and the need to build in a variety of in house levels of oversight
2720808 it clearly shows the whole place was at a level of dysfunction
2720809 something a lot of people dont realize and understand when were putting together evidence of white collar crime its very complicated and very difficult
2720810 even if you have sufficient evidence to put together its very challenging
2720811 pleased to learn that the allegations of fraud and abuse were not substantiated
2720812 the audit did reveal areas where the agency can strengthen our procedures to reduce the potential for employee over and underpayment
2720813 in those instances where employees were found to be overpaid we are currently recouping any excess or implementing payment plans in the instances where they were underpaid the requests for payment are in process
2720814 checks and reviews were added to the audit process to improve the audits of the accounts and reviews for propriety

2720823 i would firstly like to show my appreciation for the tremendous work put in by sean kelly in helping to establish the irish institute of sport he has been a key factor in the progress of the institute and it is in a much stronger position to help irelands elite athletes to compete at the highest level it seems likely however that sean kellys decision to stand down from the organisation may have been connected to the continuing ambiguity surrounding the future of the irish institute of sport and whether it is to be established on a statutory basis
2720824 at a time when attention is focused on the olympic games minster cullen needs to clearly state his intentions regarding the future of the irish sports council amendment bill and the long term basis of the irish institute of sport i asked minster cullen about this bill in d il ireann on may 13th i told the minister this issue had been around since 2001 and it needed to be resolved the minister agreed with this and stated that he wanted to make a decision on this issue as soon as possible now three months later there is still no decision forthcoming and partially as a result of this the irish institute of sport has lost its executive chairman

2720839 i appreciate the public demand to watch concerts in the big theater we plan to complete its restoration within two or three months but to do so we need cooperation between austrian and turkish authorities restoration of the ancient open air theater in ephesus is a genuinely big task both for archeologists and the restoration experts we need to strengthen the theater so that we do not have any problems in holding music concerts there i know that not only turks but also foreign tourists who visit ephesus want concerts to be held in ephesus i hope this will happen as soon as possible

2720853 it happens and everybody else is going to do it too so just have to go out there and deal with it
2720854 the truth is that i had no problems because i have already spoken to the club on several occasions there was good communication and i was under no pressure
2720855 he was a player himself and knows how footballers feel in moments like this and he knew it was a complicated situation
2720856 the coach has supported me since he took at the club and from the first day we have talked about the olympic games
2720857 i spoke to him a bit about beijing but he told me more about when he played and how great it was and that was why he understood my position and why i wanted to stay out here
2720858 he was fantastic with me and i am very grateful for that

2720874 we faced problems in jammu agitators threw stones on our vehicle at samba and kuthua we thought the worst might be waiting in the valley but we are surprised to see the hospitality and generosity of the people here

2720879 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2720880 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2720881 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2720882 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2720883 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2720884 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2720888 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2720889 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2720890 we just tried to get that last shot i was wide open it was actually a simple play
2720891 i think i can only answer that question after the next game

2720900 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2720901 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2720902 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2720903 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2720904 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country

2720906 it felt like someone had opened the door of a furnace behind you
2720907 weve got to get rid of these nuclear weapons before something terrible happens
2720908 both sides of the camp are talking about the need to reduce nuclear weapons
2720909 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man
2720910 it was most likely an indirect link to the olympic team the attack must have been an isolated incident
2720911 i believe that weve felt very safe and havent felt threatened at all
2720912 but we wont be hunkering down in our hotel room
2720913 in the past it was about being a proud sponsor of the olympics

2720919 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2720920 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2720921 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2720922 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2720923 now that we got the crap out of the way
2720924 the concept had been on the table for some years now all countries have finally agreed on the formation and implementation of the saarc food bank
2720925 properly realised it would serve as a milestone in strengthening the existing cooperation among the nations of south asia
2720926 this involves the construction of new food warehouses in member countries local procurement and the international purchase of extra food grains and developing an administrative system and a distribution network so it is likely that it will take some time before operationalising the saarc food bank

2721010 that makes it clear that the targets of the russian military were not only georgian economic objects but international objects on georgian territory
2721011 many investors are placing part of their hard earned money out of harms way into foreign banks that do not have exposure to the u s sub prime mortgage crises
2721012 indians dont speak english well they do not understand you they are an underdeveloped people they need to be socialised how much change you give me

2721015 the restaurant owner hisses at me as the nigerian talks for a moment on his phone
2721016 indians do not want to be friends they are underdeveloped its so hard to meet indian gays
2721017 i believe that the position of the international community supported by australia is that georgia is an independent state its territorial sovereignty should be respected and therefore all states should exercise restraint and that includes the russian federation
2721018 its important for the united nations security council to deal with this matter
2721019 its regrettable that in the session which has been held on georgia theyve been unable to reach an agreed resolution on action
2721020 but for our part in australia and i think in common voice with the rest of the international community we are calling upon all parties to exercise restraint and for the territorial integrity of the sovereign state to be respected
2721021 our troops are fighting still fighting they are not letting russian troops into the city of gori
2721022 that means that the russians despite an unprecedented amount of resources they brought with them have failed to defeat our troops
2721023 we deplore the dangerous and disproportionate actions by russian forces and we would be particularly troubled if these attacks are continuing now as the georgians are pulling back
2721024 very very concerned if in fact there is ground action inside of georgia proper that is outside of these areas of abkhazia and ossetia
2721025 bila kita hadkan pembelian tiket tentu ada orang marah dan kalau tidak dihadkan mungkin ada orang membeli sehingga 30 dan 40 tiket kalau seseorang itu telah membolot begitu banyak inilah yang menyebabkan wujudnya ulat tiket
2721026 pada masa ini kita sedang lihat sama ada perlu atau tidak langkah mengehadkan jumlah pembelian tiket ini jika hasilnya menunjukkan ia merupakan cara terbaik ia akan dilaksanakan pada musim perayaan ini hari raya aidilfitri
2721027 bagaimanapun kerajaan akan mencari jalan penyelesaian terbaik dalam menangani masalah kegiatan ulat tiket ini

2721040 21 is the fact based story about six mit students who were trained to become experts in card counting and subsequently took vegas casinos for millions in winnings it is inspired by the true story of five students who changed the game forever
2721041 there are a few more different uses for stone in a garden if you are into having nature at your door or having an ancient like appearance in your garden read on
2721042 i saw some of the editorials on the web and the shots were great classy and high fashion
2721043 there are so many reasons i wanted to buy it
2721044 mainly being a black woman its the rarity of something like this happening its significant and important a piece of history i wanted to own
2721045 it was one of our biggest magazine sellers ever we normally get about 20 and we placed five additional orders for 30 each time were ordering more today
2721046 we sold out our first shipment immediately we sold the second within two days we had 38 copies altogether weve been told we cant get any more but people are still asking
2721047 they were really really hard to find here in la because they sold out so fast
2721048 at borders on magnificent mile michigan avenue they said people were lined up outside the door on july 2 to get them
2721049 i thought the concept was great but i didnt want to just say that verbally i wanted to provide financial support as a business owner i know you have to support things you like with your money
2721050 as you know vogue has been criticized in the past for its infrequent use of black models both on the cover and inside maybe this is a declaration of a new day that will see more diversity in the magazine going forward
2721051 i actually contributed an essay to the now famed italian vogue issue in which i expressed ambivalence about what they were doing and i was happy that the editors there had no problem with it on the one hand its a beautiful issue on the other what happens next month but the mag has been quite successful at least in the states so perhaps other publications will take notice
2721052 were overwhelmingly white of thirty seven runway shows there 1 084 opportunities to send out a model and black models walked 14 times
2721053 whats really interesting is how many shows by big name italian designers had absolutely zero diversity
2721054 thats an interesting statistic milan has always had a dearth of black models
2721055 this last season prada infamously all white and very bland and considered the ringleader in the whiteout used the black british model jourdan dunn
2721056 the mix of models changes all the time so im wondering if that stat was based on the most recent shows
2721057 i think its fair to say theres a lack of representation on the runway in general but that statistic while its shocking is also extremely questionable
2721058 when you get into high fashion the assumption is that the majority of their target market cant afford to buy what theyre selling anyway so they can choose whoever they want to model
2721059 minimizing climate change induced migration and violent conflict in receiving areas requires an engineered economic slowdown in the developed countries and population stabilization and economic growth in developing countries financed by the developed countries

2721077 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2721078 my whole room lights up orange and i look out i live on the top floor so i had a perfect view and i just seen a huge ball of flame hundreds of metres in the sky big black pillars of smoke
2721079 we got freaked out my family woke up they thought it was a plane that went down
2721080 aniston is a regular at my restaurant and i have spoken to her about doing waheeda rehmans role in khamoshi now she wants me to give her the full script which were working on
2721081 for some reason khamoshi has stayed with me ive watched it repeatedly its a story that can never grow old
2721082 for example dhamendras role in the original of the nurses first patient was very sketchy in khamoshi his face wasnt even shown in any frame well flesh out that character in silence and offer it to a top hollywood actor
2721083 dalam hal ini kontrol informal dan formal tidak dapat dipandang sebagai dua hal yang sama sekali terpisah
2721084 toleransi terhadap keragaman perilaku bervariasi secara langsung dengan pembagian kerja distribution of labor di masyarakat
2721085 seorang laki laki yang hidup di pedesaan atau di kota kecil kemungkinan besar harus selalu berhati hati karena diawasi terus oleh masyarakatnya dan oleh karena itu berada di bawah pengaruh masyarakatnya seorang laki laki yang tinggal di kota besar hampir tidak terlihat invisible secara sosial terisolasi dari masyarakatnya dan oleh karena itu tidak dapat dikontrol oleh masyarakatnya ia mempunyai peluang yang lebih besar untuk melakukan tindak kejahatan
2721086 warga negara yang baik terhormat decent patuh kepada hukum law abiding dan kelas menengah
2721087 kontrol seperti itu mengurai dirinya resolves itself ke dalam bentuk bentuk seperti menahan restraints semua parasit sosial para pengambil keuntungan dalam kesempitan exploiters yang biasanya didefinisikan secara hukum pelaku pelaku kejahatan criminals dan semua orang yang tidak sempurna dan antisosial all other imperfectly socialized and antisocial persons yang perilakunya mengancam
2721088 setiap sistem produksi cenderung untuk menemukan hukuman yang berhubungan dengan hubungan produktifnya
2721089 situasi ini bisa timbul jika perilaku itu disengaja tapi tidak secara moral patut untuk dipersalahkan seperti di gugatan perdata untuk adanya kerusakan kerugian damages kecacatan mental dimana tindak kriminal criminal culpability disebarkan atau dinegasikan
2721090 merupakan salah satu dari bentuk bentuk utama dari kontrol sosial melalui hukum di masyarakat amerika
2721091 definisi ini mempunyai efek kombinasi untuk mengurangi irasionalitas terhadap perilaku tersebut dan memberi kontrol terhadap individu individu melalui cara cara yang lunak ostensibly benign dan bukan intervensi psikiatrik yang memaksa
2721092 ada beberapa mereka kriminologis positif yang memandang peningkatan tersebut sebagai pergeseran warisan beneficial shift dari penekanan tradisional tentang menghukum orang untuk merehabilitasi mereka penjelasan lain dari meningkatnya penggunaan komitmen sipil pergeseran dari hukum pidana bahwa komitmen sipil berfungsi sebagai ganti dari atau merupakan pelengkap dari hukum pidana untuk mengontrol secara sosial bentuk tingkah laku yang tidak diinginkan
2721093 yaitu perilaku yang merupakan kejahatan karena statuta tapi tidak ada konsensus apakah tindakan ini kejahatan atau tidak
2721094 yaitu jahat dari sananya dengan persetujuan publik tentang bahaya bahaya yang dilakukannya rich 1978 27 kejahatan tanpa korban juga dibedakan dari kejahatan kejahatan lainnya oleh elemen transaksi atau pertukaran konsensual
2721095 dapat didefinisikan kurang lebih sebagai suatu kejahatan yang dilakukan oleh seseorang yang terhormat dan berstatus tinggi sebagai bagian dari penghasilannya
2721096 kejahatan kerah putih mempunyai ancaman yang jauh lebih serius terhadap kebaikan well being dan integritas dari masyarakat kita dari tindak kejahatan yang lebih tradisional
2721097 kejahatan kerah putih mempengaruhi iklim moral keseluruhan dari masyarakat kita
2721098 mempunyai sejarah panjang untuk menerima orang orang pembangkan dissent dalam hal yang abstrak dan menghukumnya dalam hal yang konkret
2721099 dengan menjalankan pengaruh terhadap anggaran budget pemeriksaan beasiswa mahasiswa dan pengabdian pada masyarakat pemerintah dapat dalam beberapa tahun mengurangi jumlah total mahasiswa dengan maksud untuk mengurangi atau mengeliminasi mahasiswa yang bermasalah dan populasi sarjana yang menganggur yang telah dibawa ke dalam sistem dan disubsidi
2721100 suatu response menekan terhadap kekacauan sosial adalah cara yang termurah dan yang paling cepat ada untuk mengontrol masyarakat yang dipunyai oleh pemerintah
2721101 kepercayaan bahwa penegakan hukum lebih baik dicapai melalui pencegahan daripada penghukuman prosecution telah menyumbangkan kemunculan regulasi administratif sebagai alat utama dari kontrol pemerintah
2721102 fakta afirmasi melalui tindakan hukum dan pemerintahan menyatakan penghargaan publik terhadap satu rangkaian norma norma atau satu subkultur yang melengkapi subkultur yang lain ia mendemonstrasikan kultur mana yang mempunyai legitimasi dan dominasi publik dan mana yang tidak selain itu ia memperkuat status sosial dari kelompok kelompok yang membawa kultur yang direstui dan merendahkan status dari kelompok kelompok yang membawa kultur yang dipandang sebagai yang dihujat sebagai sempalan
2721103 paradigma yang paling cocok dengan fakta adalah yang mengenali peranan penting yang dimainkan oleh konflik sosial dalam pengembangan hukum
2721104 kebijakan luar negeri amerika terletak pada pinjaman dan pengeluaran pemerintah yang memerlukan persetujuan appropriations pada bantuan militer negosiasi perdagangan kontrol sumber daya yang memerlukan kemampuan legislasi pada adanya kesiapan angkatan bersenjata yang memerlukan legislasi dan apropriasi dan pada kemungkinan besar perang yang memerlukan kongres yang siap untuk menerima tanggung jawab dari perang dan di luar itu bahwa suatu bangsa siap menerima pengorbanan masa perang
2721105 hakim membuat hukum keluar dari yang telah mereka temukan dan hukum adalah keinginan dari keadilan untuk melakukan apa yang benar
2721106 ada peningkatan jumlah hakim yang mempunyai kepercayaan bahwa hukum dan pengadilan adalah alat yang cocok dan efektif untuk mengobati penyakit masyarakat yang bisa dibayangkan
2721107 merupakan fakta kehidupan bahwa di amerika serikat semua issue sosial dan politik cepat atau lambat akan menjadi judisial
2721108 teknik utama adalah membawa konflik ke dalam perhatian pengadilan dengan memberikan kasus kasus pengujian memberi informasi tambahan ke pengadilan melalui briefing
2721109 briefing amicus curiae melibatkan kelompok kepentingan dengan cara yang lebih biasa casual daripada pengujian kasus test cases hal tersebut mirip parallel dengan cara kaum lobbyist mendekati lembaga eksekutif dan judikatif karena mereka berpegang pada penggunaan informasi diharapkan dengan memberikan informasi pengadilan akan memberikan keputusan yang lebih berpihak kepada kepentingan dari kelompok kepentingan ini selain itu briefing amicus curiae adalah cara efektif untuk memperlihatkan dukungan kelompok tersebut kepada hal hal tertentu yang telah mencapai pengadilan melalui inisiatif pihak pihak lainnya
2721110 pemerintah umumnya pasif ia hanya menunggu issue untuk menarik perhatiannya
2721111 sebagai contoh suatu studi terhadap 90 hukum utama antara 1890 dan 1940 telah menyebabkan inisiatif utama terhadap kongres sekitar 40 persen kepada presiden 20 persen kepada kongres dan presiden 30 persen dan kelompok kepentingan 10 persen
2721112 1974 merangsang peninjauan kembali prosedur yang ada dalam domain ini
2721113 1976 mengundang serangkaian solusi khusus pada perumahan sekolah negeri dan dilemma transportasi ke dalam perhatian para pembuat hukum lawmakers
2721114 air dari atap yang bocor terus mengucur membasahinya dan ribuan tikus akan berlarian di atasnya
2721115 hubungan antara hukum protes dan perubahan sosial tidak satu arah tidak simetris dan tidak selalu dapat diduga
2721116 hukum pada umumnya dan pengadilan khususnya kurang bisa memulai atau kurang kapasitas untuk memulai perubahan sendiri
2721117 beberapa gerakan sosial besar atau perubahan besar telah terjadi tanpa kekacauan jika orang setuju menyebutnya protes atau pemogokan sipil tapi jika tidak setuju menyebutnya melawan hukum kekerasan atau lebih buruk lagi kekerasan khususnya adalah sebagai bagian penegakan hukum karena mencari perubahan dalam hukum
2721118 dari norma norma pola perilaku misalnya desegregasi sekolah atau tidak memisahkan lagi antara sekolah untuk murid kulit putih dengan sekolah untuk murid kulit berwarna
2721119 tetap ada 2 pendapat yang bertolak belakang tentang hubungan antara kaidah kaidah hukum legal precepts dan sikap sikap dan perilaku masyakarat menurut pendapat yang satu hukum ditentukan oleh perasaan keadilan sense of justice dan sentimen moral dari populasi dan legislasi hanya dapat mencapai hasil bila tetap berada dekat secara relatif dengan norma norma sosial yang berlaku prevailing social norms menurut pendapat yang lain hukum khususnya legislasi adalah wahana vehicle melalui mana evolusi sosial yang terprogram dapat dilakukan
2721120 mempunyai peranan yang jelas dan bukan pengertian yang meraba raba sebagai suatu instrumen yang mengatur set off memonitor atau meregulasi fakta atau kecepatan dari perubahan sosial
2721121 selama periode transisi dari kapitalisme ke sosialisme negara soviet telah menggunakan legislasi secara luas untuk mengarahkan masyarakat memulai dan mengembangkan bentuk bentuk sosial ekonomi menghapuskan setiap bentuk eksploitasi dan meregulasi berdasarkan tenaga kerja dan konsumsi dari produk produk tenaga kerja sosial products of social labour ia menggunakan legislasi untuk membuat dan meningkatkan lembaga lembaga sosialis demokratis untuk membuat hukum dan ketertiban yang keras firm law and order melindungi sistem sosial dan keamanan negara dan mengembangkan sosialisme
2721122 namun saat ini tempo dari perubahan sosial telah sedemikian cepat pada suatu titik dimana asumsi asumsi yang ada pada saat ini tidak akan sah lagi bahkan dalam beberapa tahun ke depan
2721123 perubahan telah menyapu melalui negara negara industri maju dengan gelombang gelombang dankecepatan yang amat sangat tinggi serta berdampak yang amat sangat tidak terduga
2721124 hubungan antar pribadi telah berubah institusi institusi sosial termasuk keluarga telah jauh berubah kontrol sosial yang sebelumnya kebanyakan informal telah menjadi formal birokrasi dalam organisasi skala besar telah menyebar ke sektor sektor public dan swasta dan risiko risiko yang dihadapi individu individu telah muncul termasuk risiko terganggunya mata penghasilan karena pengangguran karena kecelakaan kerja dan eksploitasi consumer dan sakit kronis dan cacat fisik telah menyertai semakin panjangnya kehidupan
2721125 yang paling jelas adalah kontribusi teknologi kepada perbaikan teknik hukum dengan memberikan instrumen yang harus digunakan dalam menerapkan hukum misalnya melalui sidik jari atau penguji kebohongan yang kedua yang tidak kurang signifikan adalah efek teknologi dalam proses formulasi dan penerapan hukum sebagai akibat dan perubahan perubahan yang diakibatkan oleh teknologi dalam iklim sosial dan intelektual dimana proses hukum dieksekusi misalnya dengar pendapat melalui televisi yang terakhir teknologi mempengaruhi substansi dari hukum dengan menghasilkan masalah baru dan persyaratan baru yang harus diurus oleh hukum
2721126 konversi romawi dari republik menjadi kekaisaran tidak dapat dilakukan kecuali melalui cara cara dekrit hukum eksplisit yang ditekankan oleh doktrin kedaulatan kekaisaran
2721127 hukum melalui respons legislatif dan administratif terhadap kondisi kondisi sosial dan ide ide baru selain melalui interpretasi kembali dari konstitusi statuta atau preseden secara meningkat tidak hanya mengartikulasikan mengambil peranan penting tetapi juga menentukan arah dari perubahan perubahan sosial besar
2721128 perubahan sosial yang dicoba melalui hukum adalah suatu jejak trait dasar dari dunia modern
2721129 penggunaan yang meningkat dari hukum sebagai alat dari tindakan sosial yang terorganisir yang ditujukan kepada pencapaian perubahan sosial kelihatannya merupakan salah satu ciri dari dunia modern
2721130 hukum memainkan peranan tak langsung dalam perubahan sosial dengan membentuk berbagai institusi sosial yang pada gilirannya mempunyai dampak langsung terhadap masyarakat
2721131 perbedaannya tidaklah absolut tapi relatif pada banyak kasus penekanannya lebih kepada dampak langsung dan kurang pada dampak tidak langsung terhadap perubahan sosial yang dalam kasus lainnya hal kebalikannya yang berlaku
2721132 hukum dapat mempengaruhi perilaku secara langsung hanya melalui proses pengenalan namun jika proses pengenalan ini sukses pada gilirannya akan memfasilitasi pelembagaan sikap atau kepercayaan
2721133 hukum tidak harus dilihat hanya beroperasi di satu dimensi dari keadaan namun dalam banyak dimensi dari masyarakat jika kita mengartikan legitimasi sebagai pola tujuan
2721134 norma berlaku pada kualitas dari yang normatif apa yang dilakukan oleh kebanyakan orang orang orang lainnya akan melakukannya juga
2721135 hukum mempunyai gigi gigi yang dapat menggigit jika diperlukan walaupun tidak perlu harus tajam
2721136 pemaksaan pemasungan kehidupan kebebasan nilai nilai ekonomis dan nilai nilai lainnya sebagai konsekuensi dari kondisi kondisi tertentu
2721137 hukum kurang lebih konsisten dengan aturan sosial yang ada yaitu tidak perlu tergantung kepada ancaman sanksi hukum untuk mengatur to induce perilaku
2721138 hukum atau statuta yang mencari perubahan sosial positif sebagian besar harus bergantung kepada pendidikan dan pembujukan persuasion dibandingkan dengan sanksi sanksi negatif agar pendekatan wortel dan pentungan the carrot and stick approach ini sukses yang terakhir yaitu pentungan harus mudah dilihat dan jarang digunakan
2721139 dewi keadilan yang ditutup matanya yang membawa timbangan untuk menimbang hal yang dipersengketakan dan sebuah pedang untuk menegakkan dekritnya
2721140 sistem hukum dirancang untuk menentukan mana dari klaim yang saling bertentangan terhadap kekayaan materi dan ruang hidup yang akan diakui dan diamankan dan mana yang harus ditolak
2721141 interest ekonomi adalah di antara faktor pengaruh yang paling kuat dalam penciptaan hukum
2721142 hukum menjamin tidak hanya interest ekonomi tetapi juga interest interest lainnya dari yang paling mendasar seperti perlindungan keamanan pribadi sampai barang yang paling ideal seperti kehormatan pribadi atau kehormatan dari kekuasaan yang tertinggi di atas semuanya itu hukum menjamin posisi politik kekhususan ecclesiastical keluarga dan posisi posisi lainnya dari otoritas begitu pula posisi kehormatan sosial social preeminence dan sejenisnya
2721143 hukum yang sedang dijalankan menstrukturkan hubungan kekuasaan atasan bawahan dalam suatu masyarakat yang memelihara status quo dan melindungi berbagai strata terhadap ancaman yang lainnya
2721144 bagi kelompok kepentingan politik perusahaan dan kelompok kepentingan yang lainnya dan oleh karena itu berfungsi untuk
2721145 hukum itu sendiri hanyalah salah satu dari komponen dari sejumlah besar instrumen kebijakan dan biasanya tidak dapat dan tidak digunakan oleh dirinya sendiri oleh karena itu memfokuskan perhatian terhadap hukum sebagai suatu alat untuk perubahan sosial adalah seperti kasus melihat di ujung terowongan yang panjang yang mempunyai kekurangan dalam perspektif minimum yang diperlukan untuk memberi arti dari fenomena yang diamati
2721146 keharusan untuk menggunakan hukum sebagai suatu instrumen kebijakan yang digabungkan dengan instrumen kebijakan sosial lainnya yang dipertimbangkan secara hati hati adalah cukup meyakinkan
2721147 di sini resistensi umumnya mempunyai alasan untuk mengklaim bahwa yang baru melanggar dan begitu mengobrak abrik prinsip atau resep moral yang dipandang penting untuk tetap hidupnya sistem sosial atau kemanusiaan pada umumnya
2721148 akhir akhir ini pro life kelompok yang tidak setuju dengan tindakan aborsi penerjemah
2721149 semua kekuatan yang berkontribusi terhadap stabilitas dalam personalitas atau di dalam sistem sosial dapat dianggap sebagai menghambat perubahan
2721150 adalah suatu arahan yang didasarkan kepada persetujuan dan pemuasan pihak pihak lainnya
2721151 stage yang mencakup arahan legalistik komitmen dipandang sebagai istilah istilah kontrak dan orang di dalam tahap ini akan menghindari
2721152 namun akan menjadi kebalikannya jika dipandang disetujui secara demokratis dan konsisten dengan prinsip prinsip individu tentang kesadaran jika tidak kemungkinan hukum akan lebih terbatas
2721153 di kebanyakan bagian dunia ini kita menemui budaya budaya yang mendukung kepercayaan bahwa orang tidak mempunyai sebab akibat dari masa depannya atau masa depan dari tanahnya tuhan bukan orang dapat meningkatkan nasib orang sulit untuk membujuk orang seperti ini untuk menggunakan pupuk atau untuk menyimpan benih terbaik untuk ditanam karena orang hanya bertanggung jawab untuk kinerja kerja saja dan adalah tanggung jawab tuhan the divine untuk suksesnya sebuah tindakan
2721154 sehingga mereka hampir seperti barang kolektif yang berhak akan menikmati keuntungannya namun hanya membutuhkan sedikit kontribusi terhadap retensi batasan pertumbuhannya

2721161 toen ik zo dichtbij was dat ik de begroeiing van de duinen al kon waarnemen zag ik nog steeds niet tegen die zanderige bollenvelden waarop bijna geen kleurrijke vlakken te bekennen waren omdat de bollen meer voor de consumptie hadden opgebracht dan ze ooit als bloem hadden kunnen opbrengen dat oranje pannendak van haar huis waarop het tegeltableau zat met huize lien erop als die roestige rails niet aan de andere kant van de berm hadden gelopen had ik kunnen denken dat ik me vergist had in de weg maar nu kreeg ik een wonderlijk gevoel maar ook angstaanjagend alsof er iets verschoven was in dat landschap ik gooide mijn fiets in het gras en over de tramrails die bovenop ook roestig waren omdat de tram er al meer dan een half jaar niet meer overheen gereden was liep ik ernaar toe alleen de fundamenten lagen er nog waar je duidelijk de indeling van het huis aan kon zien ik liep weer naar mijn fiets en reed naar het dichtstbijzijnde bollenbedrijf daar vertelden ze dat het huis en de schuren in november waren afgebroken omdat het het eerste huis achter de duinen was en de duitsers bang waren geweest voor een invasie van de geallieerden toen ze niet over de grote rivieren konden komen de bewoners waren naar brabant gegaan maar een adres wisten ze niet

2721403 thank you for your recent letter and chapters from your book first impressions it seems like a really original and interesting read

2721543 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2721544 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2721545 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2721546 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2721547 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2721548 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2721549 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2721550 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2721570 todays price actions in asian foreign exchange markets reflect the response to lower oil prices the us fed action and the firm us dollar tone
2721571 those who responded favorably to lower oil prices are the peso the rupee and the won while those who remain sensitized to the firm us dollar tone are the taiwan dollar the singapore dollar and the ringgit
2721572 the philippine central bank may have been somewhat belated in starting its hiking cycle but it is surely trying to make up for that fact with fairly aggressive rate hikes now
2721573 the spot dollar rupiah is still heavy and todays government bond auction will drag further rupiah inflows
2721574 the oil market right now is overwhelmingly preoccupied with poor u s oil demand
2721575 the market is choosing to ignore somewhat some of the supply side issues such as the pipeline fire
2721576 i think we need to drop another 30 or 40 cents a gallon 3 8 liters before we really see any change in driving habits
2721577 the inventory data again confirmed that product demand has been slow and backed up this bearish view of the u s market
2721578 it would be a mistake to think the infrastructure story will continue unabated without a cycle
2721579 for us there were a lot of changes we had to familiarize ourselves with the voting machines we had to know what it can do and what we can expect from it
2721580 you cant get rid of vote buying the intimidation you cant prevent them from approaching voters
2721581 in the final analysis the integrity of the elections depends on the board of election inspectors the voters and the politicians but they cant easily change the results on the election returns i would say that the space for cheating has narrowed
2721582 theres no way of tracing them unlike in the past
2721583 every election there is a deluge of complaints of alleged registered voters who are not able to vote for various reasons while some claims could be meritorious some could also be a ploy designed to discredit the election process
2721584 despite our best of efforts and support weightlifter monika devi will not be able to participate in the ongoing olympic games here with the lifting event at the games having already begun our persuasion with the organisers the international olympic committee and the international weightlifting federation has been of no avail

2721590 my overall goal coming into this was to sail conservatively and not take too many chances
2721591 this is a big event it is always on your mind when i go to bed i think about what i am going to do and then think about it in my sleep

2721638 the backstabbing and conflicting strategies that produced an epic meltdown
2721639 i cannot imagine american electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
2721640 the anger and toxic obsessions overwhelmed even the most reserved beltway wise men
2721641 h er advisers couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution s he never behaved like a chief executive and her own staff proved to be her achilles heel
2721642 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from any specific decision she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make
2721643 i dont mean to be an asshole but changes to important statements and other critical campaign communications simply have to go through howard

2721650 when the house is on fire its better to have a psychotic fireman than no fireman at all
2721651 the internal discord over whether to attack obama led some of her own staff to spin reporters to try to downplay the significance of her criticisms the result for clinton was the worst of both worlds the conflicting message exacerbated her reputation for negativity without affording her whatever benefits a sustained attack might have yielded
2721652 in the days leading up to ohio and texas the campaign kept arguing over whether to air the 3 a

2721679 this is a moment of decadence in online marketing and the next turn of the screw will root out this baroque extraneous set of contortions around conversation marketing should be dialogic true dat but the goal isnt
2721680 whats so powerful about going online you can talk back but it feels like what some marketers are taking away from this is that they should talk to us in conversational tones and should do product placement by getting the video podcasters we listen to to pitch to us in their own voices it feels like they still want to talk at us and still keep tight control of the message but just hide that theyre doing it
2721681 this lack of respect creates a huge opportunity for people who open minds their expectations of you are low if you take the time to find out what it is that the people on the project need from you or value from you and make that as large a part of your job as possible youll get more respect than you expect and you may find that people start referring to you as a different kind of pm one who has changed their opinion of what pms can do for a team and youll earn not only their respect but their trust and best work too
2721682 i see people vanish from here overnight as if theyve been disappeared into the gulag whats up with that

2721697 un alto porcentaje de adjudicatarios de viviendas protegidas no pueden hacer frente al pago de las mismas
2721698 las entidades financieras exigen garant as mucho mayores a todos incluidas las personas adjudicatarias de vpo que tienen m s dificultades para acceder y pagar una vivienda
2721699 los bancos y cajas no dan cr ditos a aquel que no cumplan una serie de condiciones que ahora son mucho m s exigentes
2721700 se est n haciendo promociones de vpo cuyos propietarios una vez adjudicadas se encuentran que no pueden pagarla por falta de una entidad que les preste el dinero
2721701 el gobierno y la junta vend a la vpo como la panacea pero los que compran una vpo tienen menor dinero y no pueden pagar una vivienda sin la ayuda de una entidad financiera y con el par n de la actividad que hay actualmente los bancos son m s estrictos a la hora de conceder pr stamos analizando con detalle el tiempo que el solicitante lleva empleado en su empresa
2721702 incluso se da el caso de que a un trabajador de una empresa que no sea solvente tampoco les aseguran el pr stamo
2721703 los promotores construyen vpo pero despu s no reciben el dinero del comprador por la operaci n y no consiguen venderlo por lo que deben esperar hasta que consigan financiaci n
2721704 pues los planes generales no est n siendo aprobados en los municipios andaluces y no hay suelo legalizado por lo que no se pueden empezar a construir las promociones

2721716 remember then dear friends that the punishment of the flock was borne by the shepherd that the flock died in the shepherd and that the flock now live because the shepherd lives that their life is consequently a new life that he will bring all his sheep that as yet are not called out of their death in sin even as he has been brought out of his own death that he will lead onward and upward those that are called even as he went onward and upward from the grave to the throne that he will preserve them all their journey through even as he was preserved by the blood of the everlasting covenant and that he will perfect them even as he is perfect even as the god of peace has glorified his son so also will he bring all his chosen to eternal glory with him
2721717 its good for the world to have girls playing softball and these women are going to show young girls how to win

2721725 my hunch is that it was some usable part of the domestic riches that went into the grave with this chap
2721726 one of the tempting and really exciting prospects is that the find might fulfill the theory that the sons of nobility may have been sent to rome or sent abroad to undertake military training or to complete their education
2721727 it was all part of the empire building process of that time to secure loyal high status client kings in the countries that were to become part of the roman empire

2721730 the process of learning of how to use english can be accelerated through tapping the students mental powers
2721731 our experiences tell us that environmental stress due to lack of water may lead to conflict and would be greater in poor nations
2721732 population growth will make the problem worse so will climate change as the global economy grows so will its thirst many more conflicts lie just over the horizon
2721733 the greatest challenge we face is to try and reduce the dependence on the import of grains whether by increasing local production or whether by making more efficient use of raw materials in feeding livestock
2721734 this must be done despite all limitations mainly the lack of water
2721735 if the desalination and recycling projects are implemented a lack of water is not expected in 2013
2721736 i dont even like to go there its a disaster
2721737 we just threw everything to the floor and hope that next year is better
2721738 the decision is really simple you choose the part of your fields that are hardest to get water to and you destroy them
2721739 the district administration is making all possible efforts to rescue the missing people
2721740 when the lorry was negotiating the flooded kondaveeti vagu flash floods washed the vehicle away
2721741 we were stuck as there was no public transport in the area since the last two days and had to take the lorry to reach home
2721742 the debt has increased our risk of being held hostage by foreign lenders
2721743 our situation is serious and it is deteriorating with the passage of time
2721744 the financial condition of the u s is worse than advertised
2721745 its inevitable there will be some tax increases on fat cats like myself
2721746 but any idea youre going to solve most of this problem with taxes is not realistic
2721747 arthur laffer said to me addison im not a debt guy
2721748 but that doesnt take into account everything thats coming down the pike
2721749 the president and mr putin were in animated conversation two seats in front of us and i imagine they had a few things on their agenda
2721750 our position like the americans is that its important for peace and stability to return to this part of georgia
2721751 ten people were rescued by the villagers it was difficult to guess how many people were travelling in the ill fated truck
2721752 in the 90s we played some festivals with some of the other new bands and i could see that these bands were being influenced by pearl jam and bands like that
2721753 those who have contact with chief robert pruett must beware anything is fair game if it promotes his political career he loves the camera and microphones
2721754 evidence that police obtained jm s confession in violation of his rights
2721755 its kind of disappointing when you talk it up and talk it up and then nothing happens
2721756 the houston area got most of the rain today two to four inches
2721757 with instability caused by the low pressure we could still see a 50 percent chance of rainfall throughout the day
2721758 since the children have flesh and blood he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death that is the devil and free those who all their lives are held in slavery by their fear of death
2721759 chris brauns has done a magnificent job in helping us understand the true nature of biblical forgiveness every christian will profit from reading and applying this book
2721760 the district administration has lifted curfew in border towns of kathua and poonch since 0600 hours today after four days of its imposition in view of betterment in law and order situation
2721761 curfew was reimposed in all these districts army also conducted flag marches in jammu and samba districts

2721763 the main reason why such forum should be allowed to be held is that it did not only invite the non muslims as speakers there were muslim speakers who were invited to air their views in the said forum these three speakers i believe were competent to defend the muslims interest in that forum when two out of the said three speakers pulled out from the forum at the eleventh hour the inescapable conclusion was that the muslim scholars were not ready to engage intellectually with other non muslim speakers in that forum the pulling out with respect was not the good option

2721765 the new turnberry horse trials has been moved in order to provide the best chance of a good days sport for british eventing members
2721766 following the disappointing eventing season last year when many events were cancelled or abandoned our objective this year was to obtain an earlier date on the british eventing calendar which hopefully will bring better weather
2721767 our new venue at turnberry offers good well draining ground more space and good dressage arenas a new cross country course with water splash and all parking is on hard standing
2721768 clydesdale bank are delighted to be the main sponsor of the 2008 turnberry horse trials
2721769 under the auspices of british eventing there will be a very high calibre field of horses and riders across a number of different classes
2721770 contributing to the day will be the magnificent back drop of turnberry which is sure to add a unique dimension to the event
2721771 we are delighted that the turnberry horse trials will be taking place here on the on 31 august 2008
2721772 this supports our objective of having a reputation not only as a world class golf resort but as a venue for a number of events linked to country pursuits like the horse trials
2721773 it also supports starwood hotels amp resorts desire to play an active part in community events taking place in and around our properties
2721774 if im not mistaken i think that they already indicated the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2721775 i understand that this is a difficult and painful time to them and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2721776 obviously it turns a defining element of his biography his reputation as a devoted family man upside down
2721777 but if he shows a continued commitment to his core issues and no additional facts emerge that contradict his story he could eventually join the disturbingly large club of public figures whove rebounded from similar events
2721778 the key this time is there are a fair number of battleground states that are becoming more diverse and maybe diverse enough to make a difference
2721779 the diversity used to be mainly in pretty safe states like texas california and new york
2721780 but is he generating enough enthusiasm to excite people who lack a formal education and are disproportionately young and not likely to vote
2721781 in many ways demographic differences are the raw material for party politics

2721786 it showed he was a hero it would bring tears to your eyes
2721787 thanks to my prisoner of war experience i had as they say in politics a good first story to sell
2721788 that was as true in 1982 as it was last summer
2721789 i knew i had a pretty good shot at it
2721790 my connections to national political figures including the reagans the money i believed i could raise much of which cindy and i would lend the campaign
2721791 i wish i could have had the luxury like you of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of arizona but i was doing other things as a matter of fact when i think about it now the place i lived longest in my life was hanoi
2721792 sir would it be fair to say you dont know how many officers you have working here
2721793 whether you work out here as police commander or not we have to get this force back up to speed because the insurgency is getting stronger in your district sir and your police force is getting smaller
2721794 we have to fix this now this is an emergency
2721795 my question to you sir is what is your plan to defend this district
2721796 im not very familiar with the villages or which villages are vulnerable and i dont have a plan but i think we should ambush the taliban
2721797 they destroyed this country theyre not afghan theyre pakistani no afghan would do that to his own country
2721798 id be talking to the doctors about the details of my condition in front of these strangers it was really personal stuff and it made me feel so uncomfortable but i still had to be chained to one of the guards
2721799 i never wanted to be treated differently to anyone else but i felt they were too harsh this was my first offence im not a persistent offender and they treated me like my crime had been far far worse

2721812 i just feel that the mayor came into office with a lot of promise a lot of potential some very unique gifts to help detroit be better
2721813 i think that what we have over the city now is this abyss of darkness that prevents us from moving forward and so i think the time has come for the mayor to resign
2721814 i believe that there comes a time when we as religious leaders have to speak with our prophetic voice even to powers that be and say what needs to be said
2721815 there is scarcely anything in the world that some man cannot make a little worse and sell a little more cheaply the person who buys on price alone is this mans lawful prey
2721816 we have to make sure we play fast tempo because theyre big and we cant let them control the tempo of the game
2721817 the one thing about these games is that they are shorter than nba games
2721818 teams can get hot and stay hot and all of a sudden you find yourselves in a dogfight i think thats a danger you face
2721819 the biggest thing were going to have to control is the jitters its the first game its against china the home team so its a huge deal
2721820 thats who i wanted to meet she gives me hope
2721821 i was walking with lebron and kobe and told those guys who never went to college that this is like college
2721822 it made me miss college life not knowing who youre going to see the olympic village was crazy i loved it
2721823 to meet other athletes and show our respect that were not bigger than a lot of people think we are because we dont stay in the village the u s team is staying at a hotel people always say its a money thing we have more money than them its not about that its more of a security reason more of popularity reasons why we cant stay in the village but its great to over there to show our respects to some of the athletes it was an unbelievable experience for me

2721988 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2721989 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2721990 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2721991 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings

2721996 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2721997 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2721998 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2721999 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2722000 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2722001 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2722002 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2722003 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2722004 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2722005 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2722006 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2722007 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

2722026 the noise was just unbearable it went from sounding like a drag queens party to a rock concert the music was just nonstop
2722027 i hope it serves as a reminder to others that we can take them to court and seize their belongings if they do not cease causing a nuisance to others
2722028 they took 500 to 600 worth of stuff i dont think they should be allowed to do it it isnt right he said
2722029 i didnt play the music that loudly and it wasnt just cher i used to play heavy metal as well
2722030 it was a wonderful kind of artistic event and the twin towers provided the stage
2722031 i knew the story like many people who live in the city just as an anecdote that you collect or absorb by living here almost like a folk memory
2722032 and the fact that his life well philippe would say it wasnt at stake but everyone else knows that it was
2722033 one of the things that struck me as i made man on wire was that we were sort of re creating a new york that i wished still existed
2722034 its all caught up in the destruction of the twin towers ultimately
2722035 and in fact the new york of 1974 and the world trade center walk is a world id much rather live in i guess theres nostalgia about that which maybe is a dangerous emotion but nostalgia also has a kind of ache to it
2722036 it does bring back and evoke this city that we are in danger of losing completely
2722037 i felt that the choice of not engaging with the destruction of those buildings was essential
2722038 because everybodys going to be engaged with it anyway its the big fact the big documentary fact if you like its the defining fact perhaps
2722039 and the idea for me making the film was to get people not beyond it how could you but at least to a point where you could enjoy the towers being built and you could enjoy this sort of fantasy thats being projected onto them by this obsessed frenchman
2722040 you see the buildings really almost exclusively through his eyes in the film and that then becomes a legitimate way of bringing them back to life i think youre seeing them through someone who knew them knew their secrets and their secret noises because he spent so much time there as they were being finished as they were being built
2722041 if you told it as it was with the people involved you couldnt do any better than that
2722042 its a struggle to be a filmmaker in the u s and ive just given up on it now
2722043 its almost perverse to keep pretending im an american filmmaker

2722046 hawaii is paradise but folks are going through trouble in paradise too
2722047 and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2722048 john edwards was a great champion of working people during the course of his campaign many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified at the convention and i wish them all well
2722049 this is your government this is the government of and by and for the people
2722050 this is a government of the single mom who like my mother when she was living here in honolulu who had to get food stamps sometimes but still was able to get me a good education and still was able to send me to college thats what this government is
2722051 this is the government that when my grandfather came back from world war ii gave him a g i bill so he could go to college gave him an federal housing administration loan so he could buy a house and gave him the kind of burial he deserves hes at punchbowl cemetery interred there
2722052 a government that stood by him his entire life because he had served his country in world war ii thats the government we deserve thats the government were fighting for
2722053 were anxious to hear obama solidify his positions and policies regarding energy exploration lower taxes better government and to understand what he really intends to do were he to be elected
2722054 she is somebody who helped raise me and shes the last person of the generation ahead of me whos still living so it means a lot to me to spend time with her

2722076 its about going forward and handling the situation the right way and handling it behind closed doors within the walls of the organization and doing it that way
2722077 its natural for people to be frustrated and thats the case
2722078 im sure a lot of people and a lot of fans feel the exact same way but the point now is that its said and done its all out in the open we know there are issues to be resolved but now going forward lets handle everything the correct way
2722079 lets go about this in a manner where it wont be a distraction
2722080 our position has been since the start of this that our conversations with kobe would remain private
2722081 from day 1 hes been misunderstood so hes going to say things and they are going to have more weight because of his greatness
2722082 you have to compare him to larry bird michael jordan magic johnson and isiah thomas guys like that who are driven to do whatever it takes to win thats one thing lakers coach phil jackson and jerry buss know if we get him out here on the court hes fighting
2722083 he might be the maddest guy out there and he might be mad all year long but hell play and they cant replace that he wants to make his team better but his hands are tied and hes half the reason that they are
2722084 if you look at their careers michaels had tremendous struggles early and then he had better teammates later in his career when they won championships
2722085 with kobe he had his best teammates early and now as he is getting older all he knows is winning now he doesnt make the playoffs three years ago and wins one game this year and hasnt won a playoff series
2722086 you know the level of frustration is going to come out
2722087 its so unfair for me to try to address that situation with the lakers without it being a distraction to what we are trying to accomplish with usa basketball
2722088 i think its time for me to start being more responsible in what i eat
2722089 i never thought that day would come im a pepperoni pizza eating bacon cheeseburger having guy but you also have to come to grips with reality
2722090 im not 21 anymore and im not digesting that stuff as fast as id like to so its time to be smart about it and watch what i eat
2722091 ive never had the opportunity to put on a usa uniform and to say im excited about it would be a huge understatement it feels like im a kid all over again
2722092 and my family and i have tried to do a lot of things for our troops and we kind of feel that this is our small way to represent our country defend our country by playing basketball
2722093 thats why im taking it so seriously in practice ive had kind of a scowl on my face like its the nba finals because its that important to me we want to try to represent our country the right way
2722094 what is going on with kobe and the lakers isnt even a conversation piece with us and shouldnt be
2722095 this is all about usa basketball thats where hes focused and hopefully thats the way itll play out
2722096 we sent somebody over to make sure he was here
2722097 its great to have him here hes as excited as a rookie theres a toughness and an edge to kobe when hes on the court and thats something we didnt have last year
2722098 seeing the level of joy that various countries had in beating us and giving us a hard time was very hard to swallow
2722099 that adds to the motivation were the united states we are going to come in and do what we do best its time to regain that edge
2722100 we love it the way he is meshing with the other guys here you never have to worry about what kobe is going to bring to the table
2722101 he adds another leader to our team and hes going to help a lot
2722102 its not about me competing with him its about us coming together to try to win a gold medal
2722103 in kobe we have a great player who wants to represent his country as much as anybody and hes never had a chance
2722104 hes like a little kid in his enthusiasm to play kobes presence here makes us more complete
2722105 ive gone into a usa basketball mode completely this is what i do it is just so much fun to do i want to do it all the time
2722106 you know maria i sometimes wonder whether well ever discover the meaning of it all working in a place like this

2722110 sometimes when two great teams play it comes down to who makes a huge shot

2722118 one of the reasons state representative ron burns has been such an effective legislator is that he has never lost touch with the citizens of the 77th district
2722119 by dedicating two hours on the third saturday of each month to meet with citizens at the giamatti little league center ron remains in close contact with the people he represents in addition to being there in person to help constituents who are having problems that need to be resolved at the state level conducting local office hours helps ron stay on top of the issues that are most important to them
2722120 if you choose me as your next state representative i will do everything i can to make sure my votes and actions at the general assembly accurately reflect your views and respond to the most critical needs of our district and our city as your voice at the state legislature holding regular monthly office hours is one of the best ways i can think of to learn what issues are most important to you and your family
2722121 as a working parent i understand that your family and job commitments could make it difficult for you to travel to hartford to meet with me and for that reason i will hold regular local office hours once a month in much the same way as ron has done
2722122 with gasoline prices still at more than 4 00 per gallon most middle class families are trying to limit their driving to trips that are absolutely necessary holding office hours in the district will mean you wont have to travel to hartford to meet with me and it will help you conserve gasoline and save a few dollars as well

2722146 the charge sheet will be solid and musharraf will not be able to fight it

2722230 este equipo se basa mucho en la defensa a to garc a reneses el seleccionador quiere que mantengamos una alta intensidad defensiva y ofensiva y eso es lo que hemos hecho en la segunda parte hemos podido correr y anotar con m s facilidad que en el primer tiempo hemos cogido una buena ventaja y hemos ganado a un equipo muy bueno pero es s lo un partido de grupo
2722231 no ha sido una victoria en un partido de cuartos que es cuando empieza lo verdaderamente importante
2722232 estoy muy feliz empezar as es muy importante el equipo griego es un rival muy dif cil y jugamos muy bien abrimos el marcador poco a poco grecia fall muchos tiros libres no s por qu pero si no los hubiera fallado creo que tambi n habr amos ganado aunque por menos diferencia

2722237 white northerners had a rather complacent and self satisfied attitude that anti black prejudice and anti black violence in particular was largely a southern problem and one of the really shocking things about the well publicized springfield race riot and its association with abraham lincoln was that the north had a race problem
2722238 they clearly wanted to mete out lethal justice there on the spot
2722239 went from one end to the other looting homes damaging homes and ultimately setting them on fire by the time they were through theyd displaced at least 40 families
2722240 largely working class rioters were expressing resentment over visible black success and influence in the community
2722241 from the perspective of many springfield residents who were white justice was not done in the end
2722242 liberals in the north were so outraged by the symbolism of this violence occurring in lincolns hometown that they got together called a series of meetings and announced their intent on lincolns birthday in 1909 to form a new organization whose prime initial goal would be to fight anti black violence

2722294 this one lingering issue the litvinenko affair is but a glaring illustration of the kinds of problems russia poses to the rest of europe it is therefore time for the eu to agree at least on principle to a common response to these shows of russian aggression the eus population is more than three times the size of russias its economy is 15 times larger but its biggest strength lies in interdependence solidarity and consensus when the next crisis comes all european states will need to be prepared
2722295 wind hier en wind daar wind weg het was lastig de tweede race we varen nu ook op een andere baan dan gisteren en we komen steeds meer windwakken tegen
2722296 we hadden verwacht dat de wind zou toenemen maar het werd minder en minder en er ontstonden grote windwakken op de baan veel drukverschillen
2722297 eerste race hebben ze netjes gevaren wel iets te terughoudend bij de start als we eerste plaatsen willen scoren moeten we scherper starten tweede race was moeilijk voor iedereen maar als de sterke teams zoals engeland frankrijk en nederland collectief achterin varen dan is er wat aan de hand er stonden grote drukverschillen op de baan we kennen het water hier goed maar het blijft heel gevaarlijk daarbuiten we wisten van te voren dat iedereen hier wisselende resultaten zou scoren dus we maken ons geen zorgen
2722298 we staan derde na twee dagen zeilen en onze dag moet nog komen
2722299 dit is niet goed waar dat aan ligt dat is een goede vraag ik weet het even niet en ga daar niet over speculeren ik vaar al vijftien jaar op hoog niveau en ik heb een behoorlijke ervaring opgebouwd ik doe ook niets anders omdat het nu de olympische spelen zijn maar ik weet niet precies waar het aan ligt ik heb wel eens vaker de eerste dag prut gevaren en daar ben ik ook destijds ook goed uitgekomen zoals bijvoorbeeld in cascais wk in 2007 maar dat is me nu niet gelukt we gaan een goede analyse hier op los laten en ik ga proberen morgen met een antwoord te komen
2722300 dit komt hard aan en hadden we allemaal niet verwacht we moeten een goede analyse maken van wat er exact gebeurd is

2722303 this deliberate strategy of aggression has grown into a full scale military intervention involving all regions of georgia

2722414 you go to school to learn how to think for yourselves and how to be problem solvers when you graduate and start your career you are going to be confronted with different kinds of problems on a daily basis with any luck your education will have taught you how to analyze the situation and to ask the right questions that will solve those problems if you do not know enough base knowledge or how to think you will never know what information you need in order to reach your desired outcome

2722421 there are a lot of big issues facing the country the two candidates are compelling figures and we have finite resources
2722422 fair game for journalism of this sort but this hasnt seemed to me to be a high priority for us at this moment
2722423 our interest in that story was not in his private romantic life
2722424 it was in his relationship with lobbyists plural and that story took many many weeks of intensive reporting effort
2722425 there was a tendency fair or not to dismiss what you read in the national enquirer
2722426 we run the risk of looking like were totally out of it
2722427 or were just like the rest of them we have no standards
2722428 in the middle of the diplomatic duel between great britain and the soviet union over the accused british engineers there appears from a british source a big scare story in the american press about famine in the soviet union with thousands already dead and millions menaced by death from starvation
2722429 any report of a famine is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda
2722430 it is quite possible that as many as ten million people may have died directly or indirectly from lack of food in the soviet union during the past year

2722443 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2722444 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2722445 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2722446 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2722447 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2722448 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2722449 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2722450 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2722451 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2722452 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2722453 this morning those line crews that were dedicated before for repairs are now disconnection crews
2722454 letzter versuch der besuch eines der wie schwammerln aus dem boden wachsenden in lokale
2722455 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2722456 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2722457 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2722458 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2722459 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2722460 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2722461 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2722462 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2722463 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2722464 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2722465 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2722466 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2722467 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2722468 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2722469 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2722470 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2722471 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2722472 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2722473 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2722474 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2722475 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2722476 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2722477 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2722478 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2722479 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2722480 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2722481 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2722482 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2722483 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2722484 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2722485 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2722486 who are open to doing something on the production side
2722487 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2722488 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2722489 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2722490 we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side
2722491 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2722492 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2722493 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2722494 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2722495 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2722496 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2722497 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2722498 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2722499 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2722500 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2722501 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2722502 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2722503 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2722504 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2722505 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2722506 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2722507 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2722508 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2722509 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2722510 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2722511 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

2722526 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2722527 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2722528 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2722529 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2722530 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2722531 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2722532 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2722533 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2722534 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2722535 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2722536 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2722537 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

2722546 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2722547 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

2722565 i would not vote for any funding of the war unless theres a withdrawal plan
2722566 we have a war for which we cannot find a winning strategy
2722567 its time we get the iraqis to stand up for themselves politically we need to refocus our efforts on afghanistan where the threat of terrorism is
2722568 what we need to do is more like energy independence
2722569 people say we need to drill more theyre not drilling places theyre allowed to drill now
2722570 many tax incentives provided to big oil companies could be used to provide the nucleus for research and development
2722571 if we increase taxes the economy is going to suffer
2722572 it will be a disaster to our 50 billion tourism industry not so much from an accidental oil spill which will happen but from the day to day trash
2722573 i dont see why all public buildings dont have solar power
2722574 but i learned long ago never to say never to anything
2722575 we have to leave the option open if we do drilling off the coast it has to be in the direction to reduce our dependence on oil royalties must be spent on developing alternative energy sources
2722576 if we ever did have a goal in iraq i feel we accomplished that goal in overthrowing saddam hussein
2722577 basically weve given them ample time to get their act together
2722578 any country relying on outside contractors is not going to get support of its people
2722579 get the contractors out theyre people who care almost nothing about the country and want to pull money out
2722580 its ludicrous that we had a tax cut at a time when we could least afford it
2722581 we need to roll back the tax cut for the wealthy and proceed with a tax cut for the middle class
2722582 what we need to do is to start rolling back the bush tax cut for the top 4 percent to 6 percent of americans
2722583 hi im calling on behalf of the florida republican party and john mccain the 27 year old said hunched over a stack of papers one night last week with a cell phone pressed to his cheek
2722584 currently in the race for president do you support john mccain barack obama or are you undecided john mccain okay
2722585 whatever theyre doing on the grass roots campaign clearly is not working said republican consultant doug mcalarney of tallahassee
2722586 its clear if they want to run a grass roots campaign they have to do something different
2722587 im not seeing the chain e mails or the kind of activity we saw four years ago from the bush campaign
2722588 in a volunteer driven movement like this our role in a lot of ways is customer service oriented
2722589 our challenge really is how to structure the campaign in a way to empower people who want to help obama but not get in their way
2722590 we need to expand the electorate because we know the election is going to be so close said hildebrand who is overseeing a nationwide field organization concentrated in florida and 21 other states
2722591 i will concede that they will probably have more paid staff and offices but what we ultimately have are people who are battle tested have been through this before
2722592 right at this very moment florida is exactly where we believe we need to be he said
2722593 there were a bunch of them that said weve been waiting
2722594 but i think were getting going at the normal time when we should be going and were on the right track weve had very few turn downs from prospective volunteers
2722595 we cant kill our volunteers now we have our national convention sept 4 and when we get back well go full boat
2722596 i only worked on the kerry campaign three months in 2004 but i can tell you it is night and day compared with the obama campaign
2722597 ive never seen anything like it before in campaigns or the private sector these guys are down to the most minute detail and they are not going to miss a single prospective voter
2722598 all thats coming and youre going to see the final 60 days as a sprint
2722599 it doesnt hurt that hes jewish either let me tell you
2722600 members of congress pay taxes in the states they represent
2722601 like many people who live in florida congressman wexler doesnt own property there so he doesnt pay property tax
2722602 i pay sales tax when im there whatever it is that im supposed to pay
2722603 after i was elected to congress in 1996 i decided to be the most involved energetic and passionate congressman i could be
2722604 i also decided to be the most involved energetic and passionate father i could be
2722605 i dont care what side of the street he lives on
2722606 im not breaking any laws with my current living situation but some of my constituents were concerned so im getting a place
2722607 i had no intention of blindly supporting gen petraeus because of his impressive uniform and his distinguished r sum
2722608 how i learned to survive and thrive in the contact sport of congress
2722609 robert was 1 and i carried him strapped to my back on the picket lines
2722610 he got his liberal politics real early and since he was about 5 he wanted to be a politician
2722611 how many 9 year olds knew that new york had 43 electoral votes
2722612 i was one of the first young aspiring jewish politicians to come along
2722613 my candidacy tugged at the emotions of the older jewish residents
2722614 for the first time in my political career i went negative
2722615 if you make a commitment to run a completely positive campaign you will lose every time
2722616 during a campaign youre not going to ask your opponent for a flattering picture to use
2722617 i enjoy cocaine because um because its a fun thing to do
2722618 he has on various important issues voted against the wishes of his constituents
2722619 you have to stand for something but you also have to be willing to negotiate and talk to people you dont agree with
2722620 you need to be willing to compromise and to understand that you dont have a monopoly on the truth
2722621 and in the congress ive been involved in drafting some 200 bills that became law
2722622 sometimes i stay a day or two and other times thanksgiving february break maybe four or five days

2722637 empty chair charlie is so out of touch with florida he does not even get why he is out of touch
2722638 in this time of economic uncertainty floridians want real leadership and concrete ideas on how to end the republican recession not photo ops and publicity stunts
2722639 at a minimum bush could tell floridians correctly that he was doing what he could recognizing that governors have a very small role in directing the states economy
2722640 charlies in a tougher spot because there is no discretionary money i think the real issue is not the listening tour but is it a hearing tour what is charlie learning from all this or is it just a series of nice photo ops and another attempt to impress the mccain people that he is vp stuff
2722641 the public has to believe the governor feels what they feel and cares what they care
2722642 when katrina is there youve got to be on the ground

2722648 you cant say were going to pass a law that is going to fix everything
2722649 symbolism matters a lot in politics its important that people know their elected officials are paying attention
2722650 were listening to as many people as we can to try to get more ideas about how we can help spur on floridas economy
2722651 were listening and learning from them and i think thats important to do everyday

2722669 and youre also seeing a lot of health issues from kids not building a fort out back or playing on the stoop and their neighborhood
2722670 i think its responding to a number of anxieties out there
2722671 the next generation is the one thats going to make or break us as a planet
2722672 not one person ive ever talked to doesnt think this is a good idea
2722673 this is really a product of thousands of educators pushing congress to get at it
2722674 youre sitting at a desk in rows youre engaging a couple of your senses if you go outside you engage all your senses
2722675 its so important to look at the education of the child in terms of the environment
2722676 weve got this growing crisis on our hands where weve got these kids magnetized to the computer
2722677 this idea is really catching fire all over the country we want our parks to be not just parks but learning laboratories for kids
2722678 kids are lacking the time outside kids come to summer camp and they get a little free time outside to play and they dont know how to do it anymore
2722679 our experiences tell us that environmental stress due to lack of water may lead to conflict and would be greater in poor nations
2722680 population growth will make the problem worse so will climate change as the global economy grows so will its thirst many more conflicts lie just over the horizon
2722681 the greatest challenge we face is to try and reduce the dependence on the import of grains whether by increasing local production or whether by making more efficient use of raw materials in feeding livestock
2722682 this must be done despite all limitations mainly the lack of water
2722683 if the desalination and recycling projects are implemented a lack of water is not expected in 2013
2722684 i dont even like to go there its a disaster
2722685 we just threw everything to the floor and hope that next year is better
2722686 the decision is really simple you choose the part of your fields that are hardest to get water to and you destroy them

2722706 the enslavement of woman lies simply in the fact that people desire and think it good to avail themselves of her as a tool of enjoyment well and they liberate woman give her all sorts of rights equal to man but continue to regard her as an instrument of enjoyment and so educate her in childhood and afterwards by public opinion and there she is still the same humiliated and depraved slave and the man still a depraved slave owner they emancipate women in universities and in law courts but continue to regard her as an object of enjoyment teach her as she is taught among us to regard herself as such and she will always remain an inferior being

2722709 on friday georgian forces shelled south ossetian population centers and launched a ground invasion deep into the territory by noon news reports announced that they had immobilized much of the opposition and had taken control of south ossetias capital tskhinvali the city came under attack by aircraft artillery and armor and south ossetia officials claimed that more than 1 000 people had been killed 1
2722710 plainly the offensive was a gamble because saakashvili should have had little doubt about moscows readiness to defend the separatists moreover nato officials had repeatedly warned the georgian government against launching any attempt to resolve the dispute through military means still he pressed forward
2722711 the thing is i havent been that pregnant while ive been working on house or mad men or big love
2722712 but big love were going to be filming for a while and im starting to get a little bigger now but all those polygamist women are pregnant all the time anyway
2722713 the words i spoke to you are spirit and life
2722714 i thought of a simple quick thing to do i pierced it with a rusty nail i hope jesuss tetanus shots are up to date and then i simply threw it in the trash followed by the classic decorative items of trash cans everywhere old coffee grounds and a banana peel my apologies to those who hoped for more but the worst i can do is show my unconcerned contempt
2722715 can anyone out there score me some consecrated communion wafers theres no way i can personally get them my local churches have stakes prepared for me im sure but if any of you would be willing to do what it takes to get me some or even one and mail it to me ill show you sacrilege gladly and with much fanfare i wont be tempted to hold it hostage but will instead treat it with profound disrespect and heinous cracker abuse all photographed and presented here on the web i shall do so joyfully and with laughter in my heart
2722716 reject satan and all his works and all his empty promises
2722717 all the outrages against the blessed sacrament around the world
2722718 ummm this is one of the pictures that me and laura tried to sell on the street

2722723 god is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him we all make a god out of what we take the most pleasure in christian hedonists want to make god their god by seeking after the greatest pleasure pleasure in him
2722724 there are not over a hundred people in the united states who hate the catholic church there are millions however who hate what they wrongly believe to be the catholic church which is of course quite a different thing
2722725 demand more than a polite relationship with jesus and his church
2722726 he is our lord and god what he deserves is our love a love that is expressed in our worship in our service to others and in our obedience to the church
2722727 the kind of radical love expressed in obedience an obedience that can make our hearts ache and bruise our vanity is the seed of renewal in every age of the church
2722728 i entered religious life because i wanted to be one of those seeds because i knew my own happiness depended on it i am sure you want to be those seeds of renewal too
2722729 everything the catholic church offers in the way of its sacramental rituals and moral and doctrinal teachings is an obstacle to having a relationship with god
2722730 getting women religious to follow the lead of progressive theologians in renewing themselves into virtual oblivion
2722731 many of the active remnant are among the most aggressively disaffected groups in the church and some publicly declare that the vocation of their community is to go out of business
2722732 the church belongs to christ the church is his spouse and we find his peace through love and obedience to his church which is finally not an institution or corporation or bureaucracy but our mother and teacher
2722733 a difficult crisis due to the aging of members a more or less accentuated fall in vocations and sometimes a spiritual and charismatic weariness
2722734 keeping the harmony with the magisterium which avoids creating confusion and bewilderment among the people of god
2722735 he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities
2722736 ought not christ to have suffered these things and so to enter into his glory
2722737 and embarked around oh i dont know and headed to our rooms to check out the view and the digs

2722752 ahora lo m s importante es resolver el problema de la financiaci n esa es la cuesti n que todos tengamos como objetivo que hemos de revisar y cambiar el modelo de financiaci n y que necesitamos mucho m s dinero m s recursos y en tercer lugar que el indicador m s importante el de referencia para esta revisi n del modelo financiaci n ha de ser el de la poblaci n real
2722753 el gobierno del se or zapatero ha venido a catalunya a buscar votos pero a la hora de la verdad ni en las cuestiones de infraestructuras ni en la cuesti n del agua ni ahora con la revisi n del modelo de financiaci n ha estado al lado de catalunya

2722755 we are not consciously thinking about it because its not happening now
2722756 but the minute you allow any kind of activity to occur it will just snowball
2722757 we are definitely leaving the century of oil behind and we are entering the century of water
2722758 the value globally of fresh potable water is expected to increase significantly during this century
2722759 the global water picture is grim and predicted to get grimmer
2722760 the great lakes are sitting on the saudi arabia of a basic commodity of life that is going to become more and more precious
2722761 we cannot take it for granted or it could slip away
2722762 the lake is clean and nice though the sand is hotter than a firecracker
2722763 id hate for that to happen weve had a great time
2722764 i remember my father used to say that if you leave man on earth long enough hell completely screw it up
2722765 now im 74 and im beginning to understand what he meant
2722766 when it happens we want to make sure our waters are protected and we have the fundamental last say in the use of our water
2722767 there are benefits and burdens to every part of the nation
2722768 when those southern and western states get all of our citizens who move i dont recall them standing up saying ohio you have benefited us so much were going to give you a percentage of their sales tax
2722769 our experiences tell us that environmental stress due to lack of water may lead to conflict and would be greater in poor nations
2722770 population growth will make the problem worse so will climate change as the global economy grows so will its thirst many more conflicts lie just over the horizon
2722771 the greatest challenge we face is to try and reduce the dependence on the import of grains whether by increasing local production or whether by making more efficient use of raw materials in feeding livestock
2722772 this must be done despite all limitations mainly the lack of water
2722773 if the desalination and recycling projects are implemented a lack of water is not expected in 2013
2722774 i dont even like to go there its a disaster
2722775 we just threw everything to the floor and hope that next year is better
2722776 the decision is really simple you choose the part of your fields that are hardest to get water to and you destroy them

2722806 is a ruby program that easily transfers directories between a local
2722807 is a ruby program that wraps s3 operations into a simple command line tool it is inspired by things like rsh3ll sh3ll etc but shares no code from them its meant as a companion utility to s3sync rb but could be used on its own directory and an s3 bucket prefix it behaves somewhat but not precisely like the rsync program
2722808 building on the java library provided by amazon the toolkit aims to simplify interaction with s3 while providing powerful additional features
2722809 is a graphical java application for viewing and managing the contents of an amazon s3 account
2722810 is a console text mode java application for synchronizing directories on a computer with an amazon s3 account
2722811 this firefox extension browser plugin provides an user friendly interface for amazons s3 simple storage service its interface is very much similar to the ftp interface that lists local folders in the left panel and s3 buckets files folders in the right panel files folders can be moved from the local computer to amazons storage space and vice versa

2722815 js3tream was written to provide easy streaming of data to and from amazons s3 data storage service js3tream is not a backup solution by itself but coupled with tar or zip js3tream provides a very powerfull backup solution think of js3tream as a bridge between amazons s3 and your backup software js3tream will read stdout from your tar utility and storge the stream on s3 then js3tream can read the stream back from s3 and pipe it to tar on stdin voila reliable tar archives to a reliable offsite data store
2722816 s3infidisk for ec2 lets you mount any number of file systems on your ec2 instances each file system is stored on s3 this essentially gives you an infinite storage disk for your ec2 instances s3infidisk for ec2 uses an advanced in memory and local disk based caching system that makes file access close to and in some cases better than normal file system access since your data resides on s3 the data is never lost and you can remount the file system on any running ec2 instance
2722817 a true distributed file system for ec2 backed on s3 s3dfs allows you to start any number of ec2 instances and have all of them share the same file system in the background s3dfs uses a transactional distributed cache to keep a consistent view of the file system across all instances
2722818 database of file hashes is stored inside s3 bucket so you can backup from multiple locations to the same destination folder
2722819 interarchy supports pretty much everything you can imagine long file names long urls long files automatic and manual mirroring dashboard widgets automator actions bonjour applescript including recording ftp sftp http webdav including idisk amazon s3 ping packet sniffing you name it interarchy can probably do it all with a user interface designed to keep you productive

2722892 both had suffered significant head injuries the two have not been formally identified however it is thought they were students
2722893 everyone agrees roadside litter is unsightly and clearing it up from the roadside takes up valuable resources that could be used elsewhere
2722894 we want everyone to help us keep englands roads clear by getting into the habit of keeping a bag in their vehicle to store their rubbish until they can find a bin for it
2722895 with rubbish theres no such place as away every piece of litter tossed onto the carriageway has to be picked up by someone
2722896 we caused lots of disruption and weve really highlighted the folly of going ahead with this new power station
2722897 the atmosphere in the camp is very celebratory but well only claim victory once we know weve definitely scuppered e ons plans to build a new coal fired power station at kingsnorth
2722898 at the moment i am not close to concluding any transfer deal because i am too busy here
2722899 maybe next week something can happen but for now we have to focus on the champions league and forget about transfers because it is a big target for us
2722900 i do not rule out anybody completely at the moment
2722901 if we were in advanced negotiations with anybody else i would say no so everything is possible right now
2722902 therefore the construction of a policy on national lines if it means a displacement of the islamic principle of solidarity is simply unthinkable to a muslim
2722903 seven debutants in a league game you are lucky if everything goes to plan they were a better team than us i am not taking that away from them and we did look a new team am aware that we need to gel pretty quickly you could see as a team they doncaster were more comfortable playing with each other than we were
2722904 we should be doing better of course we should be but we will get better its one game we have had weve got 45 left i guess if one of the chances we had early on had gone in may be it would have been different
2722905 it helps the championship its another win it ties the record for most wins in a season so its a fantastic day for us
2722906 to catch him castroneves on the last corner was pretty fantastic
2722907 ich kann mir nicht vorstellen dass jens in der nationalelf mit der niederlage im em finale aufh ren will es gibt die m glichkeit dass er zum abschied in einem freundschaftsspiel zum einsatz kommt

2722916 watches are so named as a reminder if you dont watch carefully what you do with your time it will slip away from you
2722917 new zealand will ban traditional light bulb sales from october 2009 to cut greenhouse gas emissions and save up to half a billion dollars in energy costs over 12 years
2722918 the energy saving potential is of the order of 6 of domestic sector electricity use or 2 of total electricity use
2722919 energy saving lamps contain a small amount of mercury which makes them operate much more efficiently than incandescent and halogen lamps
2722920 the amount is not large enough to pose a hazard to users
2722921 without the mercury the lamp would not produce visible light the average amount of mercury in a cfl is 5 mg with a range of 0 9 to 18 mg
2722922 mercury concentration in the study room air often exceeds the maine ambient air guideline maag of 300 nanograms per cubic meter ng m3 for some period of time with short excursions over 25 000 ng m3 sometimes over 50 000 ng m3 and possibly over 100 000 ng m3 from the breakage of a single compact fluorescent lamp
2722923 the amount inside an individual lamp is not large enough to pose a hazard to users
2722924 the maine ambient air guideline maag of 300 ng m3 is identical to the epa reference concentration rfc which is designed to protect against chronic exposure
2722925 a no effect level the level at which no adverse affects are observed was not identified in these studies
2722926 sensitive populations are of particular concern with mercury exposures for a number of reasons
2722927 neurotoxicants identified in adults may have different and more severe effects in developing organisms
2722928 elderly and unhealthy individuals may already be at comprised health and be more susceptible to mercury effects than a healthy individual for example mercury does kidney damage which could exacerbate an already existing kidney disease
2722929 it is well established that the developing organism may be much more sensitive than the adult to neurotoxic agents
2722930 for example methylmercury exposure can produce devastating effects in the fetus including cerebral palsy blindness deafness and even death while producing no or minimal effects in the mother
2722931 never wash clothing or other items that have come in direct contact with mercury in a washing machine because mercury may contaminate the machine and or pollute sewage clothing that has come into direct contact with mercury should be discarded
2722932 never walk around if your shoes might be contaminated with mercury contaminated clothing can also spread mercury around
2722933 the vacuum will put mercury into the air and increase exposure
2722934 this study identified several potential exposures from the breakage of a cfl the first is the air concentration from the initial break and cleanup the next is the source left in the flooring surface this ongoing emission affects both those using the surface in close contact and sometimes those more distant from the flooring especially when the floor is agitated the final piece is the emissions from the broken lamp debris once cleaned up the three different potential mercury exposures each impact guidance for appropriate handling of a broken cfl
2722935 although following the pre study cleanup guidance produces visibly clean flooring surfaces for both wood and carpets shag and short nap all types of flooring surfaces tested can retain mercury sources even when visibly clean
2722936 this mercury source in the carpeting has particular significance for children rolling around on a floor babies crawling or non mobile infants placed on the floor
2722937 cleaning up a broken cfl by vacuuming up the smaller debris particles in an un vented room can elevate mercury concentrations over the maag in the room and it can linger at these levels for hours vacuuming tends to mix the air within the room such that the one foot and five foot heights are similar immediately after vacuuming a vacuum can become contaminated by mercury such that it cannot be easily decontaminated vacuuming a carpet where a lamp has broken and been visibly cleaned up even weeks after the cleanup can elevate the mercury readings over the maag in an un vented room
2722938 if your fluorescent lamp breaks your greatest risk is being cut by broken glass as a precaution we advise you to wear gloves when handling the broken lamp and open doors and windows to ventilate the room put the broken pieces in a plastic bag then wrap with paper to prevent cuts wipe the area with a damp paper towel to pick up any smaller shards of glass powder or liquid dispose of the paper towels gloves and any cloths used to clean the area by placing in a plastic bag with your household rubbish
2722939 double re sealable polyethylene bags did not appear to retard the migration of mercury adequately to maintain room air concentrations below the maag the significance of this issue is that cleanup material may remain in the home for some period of time and or be transported inside a closed vehicle exposing occupants to avoidable mercury vapors when improperly contained
2722940 sealed inside two polyethylene plastic bags and then placed in a clean room
2722941 of the 12 different types of containers tested during the 23 different tests the plastic bag was found to be the worst choice for containing mercury emissions based upon this study the dep now suggests that a glass container with metal screw lid with a gum seal be used to contain debris
2722942 an important issue for which there are no data is the relative importance of a short spike in exposure versus a longer term lower exposure in producing toxicity
2722943 repeated exposures would presumably increase the probability of untoward consequences in addition the relative risk of various exposure metrics is unknown whether the greatest risk is posed by short term higher level peak exposures or by the total area under the curve including higher and lower exposures
2722944 mental arithmetic 2 digit search switching attention visual choice reaction time and finger tapping
2722945 mercury sources left in the carpets the mercury levels in the air that this can cause in certain circumstances and the potential to irreversibly contaminate the vacuum are all factors that point toward removal of the carpet section where the lamp has broken this is the easiest and surest means of eliminating the mercury source that remains in the carpet we realize this is unpleasant and could be the source of controversy however it seems the surest means of eliminating avoidable mercury exposure
2722946 removal of carpeting sections where breakage has occurred as a precaution in some situations particularly in homes with infants small children or pregnant women
2722947 in addition data from this study suggest that venting should continue for several hours after a lamp cleanup to be conservative
2722948 homeowners consider not utilizing fluorescent lamps in situations where they could easily be broken in bedrooms used by infants small children or pregnant women or over carpets in rooms frequented by infants small children or pregnant women
2722949 if clothing or bedding materials come in direct contact with broken glass or mercury containing powder from inside the bulb that may stick to the fabric the clothing or bedding should be thrown away
2722950 no a current generation cfl has probably got less than five milligrams or about the size of the end of a ballpoint pen the type of mercury in those lamps is in a semi solid state its quite soft and it doesnt exist as a vapour after the lamp is broken or when the lamp is cold
2722951 the mercury can only exist as a vapour after the lamp has been switched on and warms up
2722952 if the lamp is broken when its cold you can poke it around with a matchstick the mercury is in a solid globular form it only exists as a gas once the lamp is hot
2722953 weve been living with mercury in office lights for 50 years and theres no issue with it
2722954 and had no problems with them i have them in the childrens bedrooms as well
2722955 plucked out of thin air they dont know what that number really means the danger level might be ten times above that or it might be a tenth of it they just dont know
2722956 i dont know of any study anywhere that shows mercury vapour lights were dangerous the older office lamps had even higher concentrations but theres no evidence anywhere that i know of of people inhaling it and having any kind of problem no evidence
2722957 no look i accept parents might have a concern and thats their right
2722958 there are new generation high efficiency halogens you can get them from bunnings today which have been designed to replace ordinary incandescent bulbs for 3 69 and they last 2000 hours and they use 40 watts but are the same as a 75 watt incandescent
2722959 energy efficient light bulbs have a tiny amount of mercury in them
2722960 in fact most dental fillings have up to 100 times the mercury contained in ecobulbs the energy efficient light bulb brand that housing new zealand recommends
2722961 also mercury in ecobulbs is contained in an amalgam so even if the bulb breaks the mercury is likely to remain intact
2722962 energy mad suppliers of ecobulbs recommend the following disposal options
2722963 no our responsibility only kicks in when an appliance is plugged in
2722964 cfl bulbs damaged in transit or storage thats not our role you could try erma
2722965 they are not listed under the hazardous substances and noxious organisms act
2722966 no one has told us anything but now that youve put us on notice we are certainly going to have to address this
2722967 i went through every place upstairs and took out every bulb
2722968 ontarios electrical safety authority will issue a warning later this week to notify users of the unexpected way compact fluorescent light bulbs expire at the end of their long lifespan
2722969 ted olechna a provincial code engineer with the mississauga based authority said he plans to post the warning on its website the bulbs come to an end by charring around the base producing smoke and emitting a bad smell
2722970 that has scared some homeowners into calling fire departments he said but there have been no reports of fires resulting from fluorescent bulbs in ontario olechna said
2722971 the upcoming advisory will explain that this is the normal way for these energy efficient bulbs which can last up to 10 000 hours to die
2722972 there was no actual flame but it filled the globe sealed light fixture with very acrid smoke and then the smoke began to fill the hall we were moving about in the hall at that particular moment and discovered the problem almost immediately whether the bulb will actually flame if left in a socket i dont know it was powerful hot in that globe when i took it out and still actively belching smoke
2722973 to date three bulbs have failed and the last one overheated and burnt the plastic housing filling my bedroom with acrid smoke the bulb did not shut down and continued to smoke until i shut down power the model number of the bulbs failing is edxo 23 what really spooked me about this issue was this bulb was directly over my bed when i saw the plastic beginning to melt and start to bubble i turned off the power i dont know if the bulb would have begun dripping burning plastic or not but if it had then it would have fallen onto the bed blankets producing a possible fire hazard notice the bulb got hot enough to crack the glass near the melted area
2722974 thanks for the article just wanted to add that a luminus 23w 2923 l02 just started flickering and belching acrid smoke at me in the last half hour examining the bulb closer it was glowing orange around the base and sizzling i unplugged it before a fire could really take hold the glass was melted and black goo emerged from the base this cfl was purchased last year and i have about 8 of these in the house in various places now i am nervous i think the manufacturer is liable for selling a dangerous household item here i am a professional engineer and appreciate the effort you have made here to increase public awareness of an obviously serious consumer problem i am shocked no pun intended that this device has csa approval
2722975 my lamp burned out with a loud fizzle heard in the next room with the tv news turned on and i have significant hearing loss and terrible odor of burning plastic
2722976 my bedroom has outlets for 8 recessed 100w lamps across the ceiling
2722977 as they started burning out a few years ago i started replacing the traditional incandescent lamps with cfls now ive replaced two of the three new cfls within two years i still have three original incandescent lamps that are several years older that are still working on the same circuit
2722978 last 10 15 times longer than standard incandescent or halogen lamps
2722979 manufacturers have obligations under the cga independent of any warranty they may choose to give of relevance to your enquiry is the guarantee under the cga that goods must be of acceptable quality meaning they must be
2722980 the test is what a reasonable person would consider acceptable quality given the nature of the good the price paid any representations made on or about the good and all other relevant circumstances
2722981 frequent switching on and off will shorten the life of most cfls however as an adjunct to the incandescent phase out initiative the australian government will introduce meps for cfls that will include a basic standard for switching this standard requires over 1000 switching cycles per 6000 hours of lamp life
2722982 im not sure about how long cfl lifespan is either but i have observed the same phenomenon at my house i have noticed that the bulbs which are in a protected fixture such as an outdoor lamp last far longer than ones on my ceiling all my ceiling fixtures have one cfl and one incandescent bulb so the fixture lights quickly and invariably the cfl burns out faster
2722983 some whack out in less than a year amp others keep going take the burnt out ones amp break them in the parking lot of the store at which you bought them from amp then call the epa pay back is hell
2722984 it has been my experience that cfls fail prematurely due to heat build up
2722985 i noticed that i had a high failure rate in certain fixtures in my home but not others
2722986 the light of an ecobulb does decrease over its life
2722987 this rate of decrease is less than an ordinary bulb
2722988 the degradation of light output in an ordinary bulb is not so severe as for a cfl
2722989 the high harmonic currents inherent in nominal power factor bulbs pose a major primary risk to power distribution companies and system users in terms of a negative effect on power quality
2722990 aimed to estimate how many cfls per household would cause the thd limit of 5 to be reached the study results indicated that the thd reached 5 at a load of 14 lamps per household
2722991 a number much less than the proposed number of cfls would push the thd well above the 5 limit prescribed in the nz standard
2722992 the harmonic currents were so high that the lamps could only be run at 70 full power without overheating the transformer
2722993 power quality problems caused by cfls dispersed throughout residences will be more difficult to identity and tackle
2722994 and will raise a debate about who will pay for the expensive compensation equipment
2722995 there are concerns that the hpf bulb has a higher probability of failure than the npf bulb due to the increased number of electronic components in the ballast at the base exposed to heating effects
2722996 no conclusive evidence yet exists in the public domain that clearly illustrates the ageing effects of different types of electronic ballasts
2722997 there have been some documented cases of cfl use and related power quality implications
2722998 over the years the benmore transformers have been unreliable and problematic
2722999 the first thing the repair man asked him was if he had recently replaced any bulbs with a cfl bulb he told him that in the last week since it had gotten really cold he had received several calls that peoples furnaces were not working he had found in 6 cases that there was a new cfl bulb installed in the home that was the problem
2723000 cfls with electronic ballasts also interfere with wireless devices and in new zealand ripple control systems hot water harmonics may also interfere with or even damage other equipment especially electronic appliances
2723001 there have been cases of a cfl mimicking an infra red remote control and causing unwanted changes to other appliances such as changing channels on a television this is probably related to poor harmonic performance but is still under investigation
2723002 other light bulb manufacturers have attempted to develop high power factor cfls it is likely that they will eventually produce viable high power factor cfls to compete against the ecobulbtm however the ecobulbtm then has a 15 month first mover advantage
2723003 we note from the detailed study undertaken in maine of mercury vapour densities that the results are measured in nanograms m3
2723004 the guides referred to above include advisories from newmoa an organisation of which the state of maine is a member the usepa and the world health organisation we are therefore confident that based on literature available at present the operation of or even the very occasional breakage of a cfl will not expose the user to undue levels of mercury provided sensible precautions are taken with its disposal
2723005 who spent one hour or more in rooms or vehicles during periods in which those places were known to be contaminated
2723006 the school cafeteria contained mercury levels ranging from 5 280 ng m3 to 36 600 ng m3
2723007 approximately 15 school buses were also tested and or cleaned the familys mobile home and possessions were deemed unrecoverable ambient mercury was gt 50 000 ng m3 at outset of investigation and later reduced to 11 550 ng m3 and were removed and destroyed the family van 14 950 ng m3 reduced to 1 285 ng m3 and an additional vehicle gt 50 000 ng m3 reduced to 174 ng m3 were eventually cleaned and returned to the family however a third vehicle 41 275 ng m3 reduced to 36 610 ng m3 belonging to the family of a friend of the student was determined unrecoverable and removed by epa
2723008 blood concentrations were obtained for the student and seven family members who were living in the mobile home
2723009 several of the children living in the mobile home experienced itchy rashes and headaches in late 2003 one girl aged 13 years residing in the mobile home had experienced several months of illness consistent with mercury exposure e g unexplained tachycardia hypertension desquamation of soles and palms rashes diaphoresis muscle pain insomnia vomiting and behavioral and psychiatric changes she was hospitalized for approximately 30 days
2723010 inhalation of high levels of elemental mercury can cause permanent neurological damage and kidney impairment
2723011 children exposed to similar amounts of mercury vapor as adults may receive larger doses because of greater lung surface area relative to their body weight
2723012 children who inhale significant amounts of metallic mercury vapors may develop a disorder known as acrodynia or
2723013 the lcnz membership accounts for approximately 80 of the cfls imported into new zealand we are therefore confident that the majority of cfls entering the country are manufactured to specifications widely accepted as in accordance with good international practice in all respects including the maximum mercury content they would also be rohs compliant or of similar quality if imported from the us
2723014 our main view from the national party is why should it be a blanket ban we should encourage people to have them but not necessarily a blanket ban
2723015 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2723016 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

2723018 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2723019 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2723035 do not cut the head of religion except with the sword of religion
2723036 i am like a royal falcon for whom the wide arena of the world for all its breadth is too narrow for flight
2723037 my brothers open the eyes of perception and look in order to learn a lesson arise from the sleep of neglect know that the islamic people were the strongest in rank the most valuable in worth they were very high in intelligence comprehension and prudence they faced up to the most difficult things with respect to work and endeavor later this people sank into ease and laziness
2723038 you spend no thought on this question of great importance incumbent on every intelligent man which is what is the cause of poverty indigence helplessness and distress of the muslims
2723039 it was afghanis genius to be able to adapt islam to radically new needs and conditions and to introduce modern ideas without renouncing or breaking with those with a more traditional outlook
2723040 the practice of reinterpretation of koranic texts by modernist intellectuals became very popular
2723041 that the belief in an omniscient prime mover was a natural delusion that arose when man was in a primitive state of evolution mans intellection capacities progressed after that however until they reached the knowledge that all these beliefs are kinds of delusions and confused dreams originating from mans fear of death and his desire for immortality
2723042 there is evidence that jamal ad din saw himself as something of an islamic luther and was moved by a conviction that religious reform was the only way to introduce material reform and self strengthening into the islamic world
2723043 if thou wilt not arise to help this people and wilt not unite them in purpose and pluck them forth by the power of the holy law from the hands of this sinner verily the realms of islam will soon be under the control of foreigners
2723044 in the name of god the merciful the forgiving today the use of tonbaku and tobacco in any form is reckoned as war against the imam of the age
2723045 thus an alliance of ulama merchants modernizers and the city populace had for the first time in modern iranian history engaged in a coordinated movement that shook the foundations of the government and forced it to change course
2723046 science however beautiful it is does not completely satisfy humanity which thirsts for the ideal and which likes to exist in dark and distant regions which the philosophers and scholars can neither perceive nor explore

2723056 youd better have given me all your stuff or ill kill you
2723057 the relationship between our nations is constructive and cooperative and candid well continue to be candid about our mutual global responsibilities
2723058 candor is most effective where nations have built a relationship of respect and trust
2723059 the china relationship touchy as it always is reflects the incremental progress of hard work by both the bush and clinton administrations as well as by the hu jintao government itself
2723060 in effect both sides concur that good relations are too important to be trifled with or made a hash of
2723061 i am afraid that bushs china policy is driven by fear and timidity china has discovered that president bush can be pressured by threats of nuclear war on the taiwan issue
2723062 he does not want to believe that he is presiding over americas withdrawal from asia and that he is ceding asia to chinas dominion but that is in fact what hes doing
2723063 they agreed that the six party framework has been a very successful framework that we have had a good partnership in the six party process
2723064 we are still waiting for the north to give us a positive response on the verification protocol
2723065 the president stressed to president hu that it needs to be a robust verification protocol in order for us to move ahead
2723066 at this point i think it is reasonable to say that tomorrow probably will come and go without that happening
2723067 we are in discussions with the north we continue trying to work with them on this question on a robust verification regime
2723068 but we arent at the point where we are satisfied with what they have put on the table thus far
2723069 candor on these kinds of issues is part of the constructive and cooperative process between the united states and china
2723070 he sincerely believes that china will be a better place if theres more freedom of religion
2723071 and president hu seemed to indicate that the door is open on religious freedom in china and that in the future there will be more room for religious believers
2723072 laura and i just had the great joy and privilege of worshiping here in beijing china
2723073 it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2723074 i told him not to go because its during the olympic games and this period is sensitive
2723075 but he was determined to go because he said that church was where he was baptized so i went with him hoping to protect him
2723076 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion

2723130 five people have been injured in what appears to be a russian air raid
2723131 when you speak to people here they have no idea why this place would be targeted while there are military parts housed here it is not a military base some say that perhaps there may have been confusion on the russian side
2723132 our navy sailors have been assigned the task of preventing arms and other military supplies from reaching georgia by sea
2723133 these reports do not correspond with reality a coastal blockade would mean war with georgia we are not in a state of war with georgia

2723145 as of today most of the city tskhinvali is controlled by russian peacekeeping forces
2723146 military commanders have made their decision to pull back from tskhinvali this morning
2723147 we deplore the dangerous and disproportionate actions by russian forces and we would be particularly troubled if these attacks are continuing now as the georgians are pulling back
2723148 it is my dearest hope that military action will stop immediately and that they will abstain in the name of their common christian inheritance from further clashes and violence

2723167 what we must keep in mind is that to rob yeshua of his full deity divinity or his full humanity is to rob ourselves of our salvation
2723168 if we were to go to the mediterranean sea and fill a glass with sea water we can say that all the water in the glass is truly sea water yet nonetheless the water in that glass is truly water through and through
2723169 therefore the sages of blessed memory made it obligatory to rise and remain standing 15 in the presence of anyone who is engaged in fulfilling a commandment even if the latter is uncultured and illiterate when such a person performs a mitzvah such as bringing bikkurim the first fruits to the beit hamikdash one must rise before him this is because g d dwells and clothes himself in this mans soul at such time
2723170 he is either a liar a lunatic or l rd
2723171 moses tells the people of israel how he implored g d to allow him to enter the land of israel but g d refused instructing him instead to ascend a mountain and see the promised land
2723172 has there ever occurred this great thing or has the likes of it ever been heard did ever a people hear the voice of g d speaking out of the midst of the fire and live you were shown to know that g d is the g d there is none else beside him
2723173 hear o israel g d our g d g d is one
2723174 if you come in now what will people say that it was you who have caused the flock to be carried off
2723175 your greatness is that you have taken the 600 000 out of bondage but you have buried them in the desert and will bring into the land a different generation this being so people will think that the generation of the desert have no share in the world to come no better be beside them and you shall in the time to come enter with them
2723176 rabbi tafron he used to say you are not required to complete the task yet you are not free to withdraw from it
2723177 hmmm we see hear moshe is with yeshua at the mount of transfiguration he is dead and he is standing with yeshua in the promised land moshe along with miriam and aharon will enter the promised land physically on the day of the great resurrection jewish tradition states that when moshe aharon and miriam are resurrected on that great day they will finally get to lead the 1 st generation that died in the wilderness into the promised land sages say that moshes death was a prerequisite for entering the land
2723178 only guard yourself and guard your life diligently lest you forget the words your eyes have seen and lest they turn aside from your heart all the days of your life and you shall make them known to your children and your grandchildren

2723180 so how many commandments are christians still supposed to keep or we might ask how many of the 613 commandments can we still keep years ago chafetz chayim listed all the torah commandments which can still be observed today the chafetz chayim lists 77 positive commandments things we are still commanded to do 194 negative commandments prohibitions and 26 commandments which apply only in the that makes a total of 271 for people outside what happened to the other 316 commandments these are for the most part commandments which pertain to the tabernacle temple service and sacrifices which were administered by the levitical priesthood
2723181 i am the l rd thy g d which brought thee out of the land of egypt
2723182 there are three partners in man g d his father and his mother
2723183 i consider it though i had dwelt among them and they had honored me
2723184 but you may read the bible from genesis to revelation and you will not find a single line authorizing the sanctification of sunday the scriptures enforce the religious observance of saturday a day which we never sanctify
2723185 there was and is a commandment to keep holy the sabbath day but that sabbath day was not sunday
2723186 to me it seems unaccountable that jesus during the three years intercourse with his disciples often conversing with them upon the sabbath question never alluded to any transference of the day also that during forty days of his resurrection life no such thing was initiated
2723187 of course i quite well know that sunday did come into use in early christian history but what a pity it comes branded with the mark of paganism a christened with the name of the sun god adopted and sanctioned by the papal apostasy and bequeathed as a sacred legacy to protestantism
2723188 the festival of sunday like all other festivals was always only a human ordinance and it was far from the intentions of the apostles to establish a divine command in this respect far from them and from the early apostolic church to transfer the laws of sabbath to sunday
2723189 churches err in their teaching for scripture has in no way ordained the first day of the week in place of the sabbath there is simply no law in the new testament to that effect
2723190 the sabbath is a part of the decalogue the ten commandments this alone forever settles the question as to the perpetuity of the institution until therefore it can be shown that the whole moral law has been repealed the sabbath will stand the teaching of christ confirms the perpetuity of the sabbath
2723191 well jesus rose from the dead on sunday thats why we go to church on sunday and keep sunday instead of saturday to commemorate the resurrection
2723192 well doesnt it say in acts 20 7 that they met on the first day of the week
2723193 the four laws given to the goyim gentiles in acts 15 werent exhaustive or the only laws they were to keep
2723194 but you rinse it off and fry it up anyway in direct opposition to acts 15 if it was kosherly slaughtered they would be no blood in it so you dont even keep the four laws in acts 15
2723195 for most christians the commandments which they have a problem with are commandments which deal with the sabbath feasts dietary laws and miscellaneous things like tzitziyot fringes mezuzahs beards etc

2723224 it is entirely tolerable to the hebraic mind to accept a paradox to the non hebraic mind the paradox is seen as blatant contradiction and is summarily dismissed as nonsense

2723231 it doesnt matter if youre in beijing or toronto or london
2723232 things like this are going to happen and you just have to be careful
2723233 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2723234 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2723235 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion

2723238 in order to guarantee yourself a specified minimum future income regardless of market swings if your contract is annuitized election in grip ii is irrevocable and a fee of 45 of the income base will be charged on each contract anniversary or upon full withdrawal
2723239 the grip ii benefit does not provide a cash value guarantee nor is it a guarantee of any investment option grip ii can only be converted to a lifetime income stream upon annutization on any contract anniversary after your earliest election date
2723240 there are critics though and i am one of them that think perhaps investors are not quite getting what they expect for a start the holdings in the index funds are market capitalisation weighted this sounds sensible of course except when you consider just how much the biggest companies dominate the portfolio the top one hundred stocks in america representing just 3 of the number of stocks in the index funds actually account for over 60 of the funds invested in vanguards fund
2723241 when you get down to the genuinely small capitalisation stocks there is actually very little money invested in each stock which is why it probably isnt surprising that over long periods of time the wilshire 5000 index performs pretty much the same as the big capitalisation growth stock dominated s amp p500 index
2723242 the art of creating a good portfolio is not about owning everything in market weighted proportions as the total market index does but in having significant exposure to every asset class and rebalancing the portfolio at an appropriate frequency
2723243 so if you want to take advantage of the rebalancing effect you are going to need to have a much larger small cap value exposure in your portfolio than just a couple of percent
2723244 while s amp p 500 index and total market funds make for effective pieces on an investment pie they should only be slices not the whole pie they just dont provide sufficient diversification as stand alone vehicles

2723311 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates

2723325 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2723326 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2723327 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2723394 well i just think its a bad idea whats going to happen is theyre going to be over there for 10 15 maybe 20 years
2723395 explain to the mothers and fathers of american servicemen that may come home in body bags why their son or daughter have to give up their life
2723396 the president is once again releasing american military might on a foreign country with an ill defined objective and no exit strategy he has yet to tell the congress how much this operation will cost and he has not informed our nations armed forces about how long they will be away from home these strikes do not make for a sound foreign policy
2723397 if we are going to commit american troops we must be certain they have a clear mission an achievable goal and an exit strategy
2723398 i had doubts about the bombing campaign from the beginning i didnt think we had done enough in the diplomatic area
2723399 i cannot support a failed foreign policy history teaches us that it is often easier to make war than peace this administration is just learning that lesson right now the president began this mission with very vague objectives and lots of unanswered questions a month later these questions are still unanswered there are no clarified rules of engagement there is no timetable there is no legitimate definition of victory there is no contingency plan for mission creep there is no clear funding program there is no agenda to bolster our over extended military there is no explanation defining what vital national interests are at stake there was no strategic plan for war when the president started this thing and there still is no plan today
2723400 no goal no objective not until we have those things and a compelling case is made then i say back out of it because innocent people are going to die for nothing thats why im against it
2723401 i had doubts about the bombing campaign from the beginning i didnt think we had done enough in the diplomatic area

2723412 russland betrachtet immer noch benachbarte gebiete als seine einflussgebiete wobei gewinne f r den westen zwangsl ufig verluste f r russland bedeuten in diesem kontext mag das angebot der nato an die ukraine und georgien emp rend erscheinen
2723413 der georgische pr sident saakaschwili stemmt sich gegen die einsch chterungsversuche der russen und setzt auf die hilfe westlicher l nder doch er macht sich illusionen die nato wird kaum einen krieg gegen russland riskieren um georgien zu retten
2723414 zu lange haben die beteiligten akteure am pulverfass kaukasus gez ndelt
2723415 saakaschwili ist vielleicht ein hei sporn ein selbstm rder ist er nicht v lkerrechtlich hat er ohnehin alle argumente auf seiner seite der landstrich geh rt nun einmal zu georgien russland kann an einer weiteren eskalation des konflikts nicht gelegen sein vor allem dann nicht wenn es daf r von georgien und dem westen freie hand f r abchasien bekommt
2723416 kriege habe eine innere logik die sich selten nach der frage richtet was es zu gewinnen oder verlieren gibt oder ob der gewinn den blutzoll lohnt die konflikte um separatistische kaukasus republiken sind daf r ein beispiel lange zeit galt es im westen als ausgemacht dass moskau nicht an einer eskalation gelegen sein kann diese einsch tzung war offenbar falsch russische panzer sind auf dem weg tiflis hat die usa um hilfe gebeten nun findet sich washington in einer ungewohnten rolle es muss verhindern dass aus dem kampf um eine l cherlich kleine provinz ein stellvertreterkrieg zwischen ost und west wird
2723417 der georgische krieg ist gef hrlich weit ber die region hinaus wird er zum stellvertreterkonflikt zwischen ost und west bedeutet das eine globale konfrontation f r europa hat das erhebliche konsequenzen vor allem wirtschaftlicher art stichwort erd l und erdgas
2723418 die konflikte ob nun um berg karabach tschetschenien abchasien oder s dossetien wurden eingefroren aber nicht gel st zumindest im falle s dossetiens geht es der westlich orientierten zentralregierung in georgien die mit der versprochenen nato mitgliedschaft ber eine trumpfkarte verf gt auch um den machtkampf mit moskau
2723419 mit seiner entscheidung s dossetien zu befreien oder wie er sagte die verfassungsordnung wiederherzustellen hat der georgische pr sident einen riesigen fehler begangen wie fr her slobodan milosevic hat er nicht begriffen dass sein land nur zwischen dem abschied von den abtr nnigen republiken abchasien und s dossetien und dem zerfall des landes infolge blutiger konflikte w hlen kann wahrscheinlich hat georgiens pr sident listig darauf gesetzt dass am freitag als die olympischen spiele begannen russland neutral bleiben w rde das erwies sich als naiv

2723429 el partido andalucista en palabras de su candidato local est dispuesto a liderar dicho cambio entre otros motivos porque el alcalde el socialista joaqu n garc a s lo vende humo como lo hizo cuando prometi las ayudas por las heladas y hasta el d a de hoy no ha cumplido su promesa ni seguramente la cumplir pues los agricultores han tenido que ir a sus bancos habituales a refinanciar sus deudas para soportar las grandes perdidas causadas por las heladas cuando la junta de andaluc a y el estado pod an haber aportado dinero a fondo perdido pues la uni n europea permite que el estado miembro en casos excepcionales cuando esta en peligro el mantenimiento de las explotaciones inyecte dinero en el sector pero estos se ores solo se dedican a lanzar promesas al aire y ha hacerse la foto

2723431 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2723432 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2723433 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2723434 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

2723437 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2723438 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2723439 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2723440 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2723441 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2723442 the conditions were just so humid and so hot it was just a real war of attrition today
2723443 i was in doping control and they said hurry up because president bush is waiting for you

2723448 for any cultural practice the position of the outsider the misfit the daydreamer and even of failure are very important categories in the creation of a truly energetic and self critical social and intellectual space my anxiety is that in the last 20 years india typically for a globalising country hasnt theorized such a position

2723453 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2723454 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2723455 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2723456 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2723457 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2723458 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2723459 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2723460 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2723461 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2723462 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2723463 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2723464 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2723465 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2723466 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2723467 what were trying to do is focus in and find an appropriate location in the state of maine that will have minimal impact on the fisheries and the environment

2723473 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2723474 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2723475 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2723476 slept with too many women done too many drugs and been to too many parties
2723477 a number of members of the hollywood community including brad pitt ben affleck and matt damon offered to help raise funds for barack but it was with george that he struck up this amazing affinity
2723478 george has been giving him advice on things such as presentation public speaking and body language and he also emails him constantly about policy especially the middle east
2723479 george is pushing him to be more balanced on issues such as us relations with israel
2723480 george is pro palestinian and he is also urging barack to withdraw unconditionally from iraq if he wins
2723481 its a very risky relationship his hope of becoming americas first black president depends heavily on winning over conservative voters and it would be suicidal for him to be perceived as a tool of a hollywood leftie which is how they regard george
2723482 but they text and email each other almost every day and speak on the phone at least a couple of times a week often more
2723483 george is a master at crafting his own image and he is helping obama to hone his image both domestically and abroad
2723484 he told me he feels obama is a once in a lifetime leader he is doing everything he can behind the scenes to bolster support in hollywood not just with other celebrities but with the money men at the studios
2723485 he has tried to keep the true extent of their involvement out of the press because he is frightened of alienating voters
2723486 i know they have spoken i view it as a private conversation
2723487 da oggi il mondo sar un po meno capace di ridere
2723488 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2723489 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2723490 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2723491 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2723492 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2723493 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2723494 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

2723498 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2723499 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba

2723501 the client runs on windows xp and vista for now
2723502 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2723503 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2723504 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2723505 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2723506 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2723507 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2723508 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2723509 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2723510 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2723511 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2723512 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2723513 cuyahoga county employees working on political party business during normal business hours
2723514 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2723515 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2723516 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2723517 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2723518 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2723519 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2723520 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2723521 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2723522 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2723523 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2723524 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2723525 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

2723648 the chinese olympics are providing a powerful stimulus in the development of high end anti censorship technology that major media companies and individuals can use to sneak content through its great firewall
2723649 will the internet change china or will china change the internet events in beijing where the olympic games are getting under way leave little doubt its the latter more interesting though is that many asian governments may be following chinas lead it could be an ominous sign for asias economic outlook

2723662 we are more focused this time and are looking at gsm business more aggressively
2723663 though the company has done pretty well in the cdma business and among the top three handset players in this category it is seeing a better revenue inflow than the other business but there is a limit as the operators are more attracted towards the other
2723664 i have fought bigger stronger better and more accomplished wrestlers
2723665 we further reaffirm our commitment to ensuring that the law is applied fairly and justly to all persons irrespective of political affiliation to take all necessary measures within our power to eliminate all forms of political violence including by non state actors and to ensure the security of persons and property and provide support to victims of violence
2723666 but im happy with the race and the time so im feeling pretty good about that
2723667 our client continues to cooperate in any way he can
2723668 vlad you gotta explain to me again how that prime minister thing works me and chaney are going to be out of a job in janua caption contest
2723669 thanks for helping with deal with those pesky dems in atlanta
2723670 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2723671 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2723672 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2723673 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2723674 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2723675 complete genocide putin also said georgia had effectively lost the right to rule the breakaway province an indication moscow could be preparing to fulfill south ossetians wish to be absorbed into russia
2723676 ningu m consegue aprovar sem nosso apoio e tudo caminha para que seja assim na pr xima legislatura com isso o legislativo independente das principais for as pt e psdb
2723677 were not claiming that terrorists are able to do this to all passports today or that they will be able to do it tomorrow
2723678 but it does raise concerns over security that need to be addressed in a more public and open way
2723679 it is of deep concern that the technology underpinning a key part of the uks security can be compromised so easily
2723680 no one has yet been able to demonstrate that they are able to modify change or alter data within the chip if any data were to be changed modified or altered it would be immediately obvious to the electronic reader
2723681 the pkd ensures that e passports used at border control points are genuine and unaltered in effect it renders the passport fool proof however all states issuing e passports must join the pkd otherwise that assurance cannot be given
2723682 the navy was ordered not to allow supplies of weapons and military hardware into georgia by sea
2723683 in order to prevent the circumstances in which ukraine could be drawn into a military conflict ukraine reserves the right to bar ships which may take part in these actions from returning to the ukrainian territory until the conflict is solved
2723684 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2723685 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2723686 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2723687 what happened to your legs mummy theyve gone all black
2723688 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2723689 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2723690 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2723691 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2723692 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2723693 but from seeing it today the video was a little brighter than the real effect
2723694 but most viewers thought it was live shots and our work achieved its effect
2723695 ill probably vote for howard because everyone else i know is
2723696 im really happy with the way the howard government has managed the economy and its too much of a risk to go with kevin rudd who hasnt had any experience
2723697 as you know our relationship is constructive and its important and its also very candid and i thank you for that
2723698 wir hatten informationen in h lle und f lle wo die fl chtlinge waren aber es stellte sich immer heraus dass eines der drei l nder usa gro britannien oder frankreich die verhaftung blockierten
2723699 manchmal hat chirac pers nlich ein anderes mal clinton die verhaftung blockiert

2723702 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2723703 my whole room lights up orange and i look out i live on the top floor so i had a perfect view and i just seen a huge ball of flame hundreds of metres in the sky big black pillars of smoke
2723704 we got freaked out my family woke up they thought it was a plane that went down

2723707 s dan er det jo det er fair nok og det p virker mig ikke
2723708 weve pretty much given up on the idea of issuing any kind of statement at this point
2723709 and if you really cant stand to get down this way youre probably better off self employed
2723710 our teachers are not accorded due recognition and importance they deserve their salaries are insultingly low and with the high cost of living today it is no wonder that the best and brightest among them are now teaching abroad or worse have migrated to work as caregivers or domestic helpers
2723711 act upgrading the minimum salary grade level of public school teachers in the elementary and secondary levels from grade 10 to 15 at the house of representatives
2723712 the math makes sense at least on its face but it means that the century old vision of the mall as the center of civic life articulated in chicago architect daniel burnhams famous 1903 group plan for downtown is being abandoned by the present generation
2723713 in grant county een stadje in georgia ontstaat grote deining als een jonge ler ares wordt verkracht en vermoord het slachtoffer wordt gevonden door sara linton de plaatselijke kinderarts en lijkschouwer haar ex echtgenoot jeffrey tolliver hoofd van politie leidt de zaak de twee moeten ondanks hun verstoorde relatie samenwerken om het mysterie van de moord op te lossen en dan is er ook nog de zus van het slachtoffer lena die als rechercheur op eigen houtje naspeuringern verricht tijdens het onderzoek lopen de onderlinge spanningen steeds hoger op sara draagt een geheim uit het verleden met zich mee dat licht op de zaak zou kunnen werpen maar zwijgt als het graf intussen lijkt lena zich te vergalloperen aan het onderzoek dan dient het volgende slachtoffer zich aan

2723722 together we are saving jazz and blues one musician at a time
2723723 they were good solid results considering i had a few issues
2723724 he kind of thought hed push the issue and make life difficult for me
2723725 as soon as i get near anyone they seem to shout protest at me so i lost quite a bit of ground there too
2723726 its difficult because in my position i just want to stay out of trouble and it almost forces you to be too cautious as i ended up giving away quite a lot of distance
2723727 its hard though but its the nature of the olympic games and as i have learnt in the past you have to keep your nose clean and stay out of trouble
2723728 our processes as ever helped us stay in the race
2723729 the conditions of the day meant you had to be quite strong with your positioning
2723730 the wind gives opportunities and the strength of our team is to convert them into something
2723731 we were obviously pretty nervous before today being our first olympics
2723732 but we probably built it up in our heads to be more than it actually was it was still a sailing race and ben and i are normally pretty good at that
2723733 the drug issue in azerbaijan was complicated and for two months after the team was very disturbed about it
2723734 the team even discussed whether it was wise for us to come to beijing and i had to play a strong role in calming their emotions
2723735 its in the past and i hope that some time soon we will have the team fully recovered from this issue
2723736 but i have been especially impressed this week with the comfortable candour with which muslims and christians have clearly stated their own doctrines to one another
2723737 it has been good to sit together and build new friendships
2723738 in this dialogue we are not discussing doctrines or creeds
2723739 we are just trying to find common ground for religions to work together as intended by god
2723740 just as we promise to seek to move beyond the stereotyping of muslims found in the media can i ask you my muslim friends to get to know us beyond what is reported in the newspapers and television programs
2723741 the uacs goal in this project is to raise awareness because most people have no idea what sharia law is
2723742 we are confident people will see the billboard and learn on their own what sharia law is and come to their own conclusions at the very least we hope our billboard will spark public debate on this overlooked issue
2723743 under sharia law if you are accused of stealing a hand and foot from opposite sides are amputated if you are caught having an affair the woman is stoned to death and the man is given 80 lashes if you change religions you can be charged under apostasy laws and given the death sentence by a legal sharia court if you want to marry a nine year old child sharia law condones pedophilia because mohammad married aisha at six and consummated the marriage at age nine i find these and many more practices of sharia law despicable and hateful
2723744 englands archbishop of canterbury recommended adopting tenets of the islamic religious code
2723745 if a person condones the horrors of sharia law enforcement then living under our u s constitution and bill of rights is not possible
2723746 discussing everything you will never hear from the mainstream press
2723747 sharia is the glue that holds an islamic society together
2723748 the harsh punishments associated with sharia law in all facets of day to day life create a never ending atmosphere of abject fear for those living under sharia law
2723749 for those people calling me hateful then they would have to condone child marriages amputations for stealing and death for apostates to name only a few punishments attached to sharia law if my critics condone this type of activity under any circumstances then it is they who are hateful towards anyone who is non muslim and should look into their own mirror before crying hate speech

2723762 people cant see their neighbors because of these walls the walls have disrupted this city
2723763 what happened in the life of this woman that she ended up in this adulteress relationship
2723764 teacher this woman has been caught in the act of adultery 5 now in the law moses commanded us to stone such women so what do you say
2723765 furthermore i find everyone in this room guilty of for allowing this situation to happen then he fined everyone a dollar
2723766 woe to you teachers of the law and pharisees you hypocrites you are like whitewashed tombs which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead mens bones and everything unclean
2723767 let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her
2723768 neither do i condemn you go and from now on sin no more

2723780 but her entry was delayed and technical regulations dont allow her to be included now
2723781 i agree the olympics has got sentimental value but there are many major championships coming in the next two years
2723782 this is one of the worst moments of my career
2723783 i wasnt on fire i was just three for three on three pointers
2723784 it was actually a simple shot its very special to beat argentina in our first game
2723785 this was definitely an important game for us we are just a small country
2723786 having guts and fire is important but you have to use your head you need to have your body warm and your head cold we had the guts we pushed them we shouted at them at the end we even hit them a little but they wouldnt be beaten
2723787 the first game of an olympics is always the most difficult

2723791 for example the wind industry it was nothing in the 1970s today one third of all terrestrial wind turbines in the world come from denmark
2723792 it was very exciting sitting there this morning watching michael phelps set a world record was special to me because it made me realize how many people are inspired by him
2723793 now im in the position to have that opportunity to go out there and get a medal for my country today was hopefully the first step towards that
2723794 its about as humid as ive ever played in and i live in florida
2723795 its going to be a grind by the end of the week whoever is left standing is going to have to be someone thats in great shape physically
2723796 i was in the ready room i didnt feel so good i got these cold chills
2723797 afterwards i looked up and saw president bush giving me the thumbs up and holding up the american flag that was pretty cool
2723798 i was very nervous today as its been very difficult for my people
2723799 it was nice of natalia to come up to me afterwards and give me an embrace

2723805 the exploitation is almost limitless google has to fix it
2723806 it turns out a lot of people who develop these things arent good at security
2723807 weve been telling google about these vulnerabilities for years and they have not made corrective actions
2723808 they chose to open the doors and insomuch put a lot of consumers at risk
2723809 there can be no assurance that impairment charges will not be required in the future and any such amounts may be material

2723811 yahoo understands the trust of our users is our greatest asset so we strive to create the most trusted compelling online experience
2723812 yahoo strongly believes that consumers want choice when customizing their online experience and they have also demonstrated a strong preference for advertising that is more personally relevant to them
2723813 however we understand that there are some users who prefer not to receive customized advertising and this opt out will offer them even greater choice
2723814 they just put it up no less than an hour ago
2723815 i think we were all about like lets get this started
2723816 i was pretty relaxed right about before the swim even then i stayed pretty relaxed ill be better tomorrow and the day after so its good to just get that first swim out of the way

2723818 he promised hed get rid of all the bugs within 15 days or bring back the old typesetting system
2723819 it was a huge job remembering where all of the characters were stored
2723820 a lot of people were poisoned by fumes or by absorbing toxins through their skin
2723821 we were covered with ink it coated our hands our clothes our faces so at the end of every shift we looked like bao gong
2723822 because of the complexity of the process chinas printing industry lagged behind the rest of the world for some time
2723823 the new generation of pressmen had to keep up constantly with the latest printing and computer technologies and they had to learn english because many of the computers were imported
2723824 the technology was like a huge motor that sped up newspaper production
2723825 these technologies make it possible for us later scholars who havent been brought up with a classical chinese education to read and understand classical chinese texts
2723826 because we are less dependent on existing commentaries and can easily search through large pools of information we can study topics traditional scholarship might have missed
2723827 we know one thing theyre not going to start the game without us and we wanted to have a moment of silence where we could gather our thoughts it was a moment of silence to honor the bachmans hughs family its tough to change but we wanted to do it
2723828 ive played 15 years im married two kids i feel like im pretty much prepared for anything but nothing can prepare you for something like this
2723829 were playing a volleyball game out there nothing compares to the loss that happened to our team usa volleyball our whole delegation obviously we all came here to do this its very hard to continue on
2723830 nor would it be easy with him but i know hes supporting us
2723831 she said unfortunately bad things happen in fort wayne ind where were from every day but we still go to coney island downtown we still go get gas we still go to wal mart
2723832 we cant live in fear or anger about what happened all you can do is send your prayers and sympathies to the family and try to continue what hugh would want us to do and thats try to win a gold medal
2723833 we know one thing theyre not going to start the game without us and we wanted to have a moment of silence where we could gather our thoughts it was a moment of silence to honor the bachmans hughs family its tough to change but we wanted to do it

2723839 it was really hard to see what happened with sam
2723840 we were all actually getting teary and we had to tell each other to calm down
2723841 i heard sams ankle pop and kept telling myself i didnt hear that i didnt hear that but i heard that the whole team was kind of emotional

2723843 according to a study by merrilee zetaruk of the pan am sports medical center in canada based on data collected largely from the 1990s the number of injuries in competitive womens gymnastics were as high as 200 per 100 gymnasts per year
2723844 they just put it up no less than an hour ago
2723845 i think what bernie mac did that few if any have been able to do was become a success here in chicago
2723846 most of our homegrown talent has to go to l a or new york to become famous but bernie he was selling out the chicago theater before he went out to new york thats next to impossible
2723847 whats interesting about bernies career is that he wasnt a mainstream comic at first his act was very edgy and very raw
2723848 bernie would talk about things that other black comics wouldnt talk about like skin color and how being a very dark skinned black man like him made his life very different from other peoples
2723849 he didnt so much cross over as people crossed over to him
2723850 you got to come with a little extra to satisfy them
2723851 when i started in comedy in the clubs in 1977 blacks couldnt do certain clubs not because they were segregated they just didnt want to put the black comics out there
2723852 if you let people put tags on you youll never be able to remove them
2723853 youve got to make people respect you respect is bigger than dollars and cents
2723854 the general market is being moved along by the surprising strength of the dollar which is exacerbating the slide in oil prices so all positive for stocks
2723855 i do feel that july 15 represented the bottom for stocks and we are going to move higher
2723856 it seems that weve got a lot of selling based on the stronger dollar
2723857 energy demand destruction and the dollar return have formed a quiet alliance to bring the oil market down and today the louder of the two is the dollar
2723858 theres going to be more speculation of ecb rate cuts later this year
2723859 we want to find out whether theres a role for messaging in the browser
2723860 the initial prototype is a primitive implementation with many bugs and subsequent versions will include changes that break functionality and delete all your messages making you start over from scratch
2723861 extensions are a great way to prototype functionality in firefox
2723862 but i want to stress that this is a labs experiment and doesnt mean were adding this in firefox
2723863 the reason why were conducting this experiment with snowl is because we dont know if messaging should be in the browser but we want to find out that and a lot of other things
2723864 we want to gather as much feedback as possible then make the decision to continue if it seems promising and adds significant value to the browser
2723865 those are the questions we need to address but its still a successful experiment even if something doesnt make it into the browser
2723866 jesus is instructed to watch israels house and not leave the place while the master goes away on a tour to collect clothes to be dyed but no sooner has israel left the house than jesus runs out with the boys
2723867 the most amazing part of the story of the nine year old jesus playing a form of cricket with the boys at the sea shore is that he would go on playing the game on water over the sea waves
2723868 he jesus would take the boys to the seashore and carrying the playing ball and the club he would go over the waves of the sea as though he was playing on a frozen surface hitting the playing ball
2723869 i really wanted to make a record that had different kinds of musical textures to it
2723870 yeah a little bit im very open to many different kinds of music from classical jazz and fusion and stuff like that i really wanted to make a record that had different kinds of musical textures to it i didnt want it to sound just one way from beginning to end this record definitely has a lot of hills and valleys to it as far as the momentum goes and i think its a very diverse record to be honest with you out of the different musical textures going on jazz just happens to be one of the small little things that fits in there on cashmere shiv
2723871 i guess maybe its because ive been doing that for so long with nevermore and stuff and i guess century media was kind of pushing me towards having a couple of guest vocalists on the record i really wanted to make an all instrumental record just me and my guitar and drums and it was a personal decision really it didnt have anything to do with me hating vocalists or anything
2723872 i really wanted to make a record that had different kinds of musical textures to it
2723873 not like they stole it but like barts song is on tv

2723894 google have launched mapmaker a kind of faux openstreetmap where they own all the data and youre only allowed to map in certain freedom of speech zones like knol the mooted wikipedia killer google refuse to acknowledge existing communities trample on their hard work and lack the mindset to engage with an open project the fundamental reasons for openstreetmap remain intact and if anything are now stronger at first glance it sounds like openstreetmap until you realise that google own that data you give them theres no community and you are unlikely to see use of the data in creative productive or unexpected ways the terms of use are hilarious the bottom line seems to be that google ends up owning excusively the entire aggregate work but it is your fault if anything goes wrong if you contribute to google mapmaker you are contributing to one single map view that looks how google wants it to look if you contribute to openstreetmap you are contributing to a myriad of possibilities most not even thought of yet the cycle map is a good example

2724046 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2724047 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2724048 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2724049 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2724050 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2724096 for well over a decade now the whole power of myth has captivated my imagination as a way to tap into the power of language itself
2724097 are part of a truly mythic reality which is rooted in the human imagination and expressed in the parables of the poet storyteller
2724098 perhaps clich is best viewed as a pause for recapitulation and evaluation transitional in prevosts development as a writer
2724099 like all of prevosts earlier works clich retains a strong sense of its specifically mythic north american origins a sociopolitical subtext that runs along just below the surface of the narrative
2724100 the clich is the otherwise silent voice of millions who seek originality but whose very pursuit circumvents any such reality

2724127 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about

2724137 at least eight in ten americans believe the nation is on the wrong track the republican president is historically unpopular from stunning democratic gains in party registration to the high levels of economic anxiety obama should have a healthy lead by almost every measure yet in poll after poll obama conspicuously fails to cross the 50 percent threshold
2724138 my campaign has uncovered evidence that my opponent jim martin did not want senator barack obama to be president of the united states and that jim martin voted against barack obama in the february 2008 presidential primary election in georgia
2724139 what will happen at the convention in respect to my putting my name into nomination a roll call vote and the usual kind of process that occurs at conventions i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified

2724141 obama gaggled with reporters on his plane between minneapolis and chicago when asked about reports of angry hillary supporters obama said were not talking to those people and were talking to directly to the clinton campaign people and it has gone seamlessly
2724142 mr mccain has beat mr obamas channel for seven straight days and 11 of the past 14 days in a signal he intends to compete for the youtube vote
2724143 that not only in that mccain ad were there two underdressed blondes mixed with the black guy in the ad but there are also images of the leaning tower of pisa the washington monument and the victory column in berlin as bob herbert put it
2724144 comparing the democratic presidential hopeful to celebrities britney spears and paris hilton
2724145 to a certain extent the ads are having some effect but you cant be thrown off your game plan by a momentary dip in polls

2724154 the republican also has pulled ahead on the issue of balancing the federal budget
2724155 in contrast if anything pews respondents said they want to hear more not less about the republican candidate just 26 in the poll said they had heard too much about mccain while a larger number 38 reported that they had heard too little about the putative republican candidate
2724156 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified

2724164 stephanopoulos a gentleman named william ayers he was part of the weather underground in the 1970s they bombed the pentagon the capitol and other buildings hes never apologized for that can you explain your relationship to him for the voters and explain to democrats why it wont be a problem
2724165 in may when a mccain adviser proposed a series of pre convention appearances at town hall meetings obama said i think thats a great idea obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
2724166 there is an image right there in that very beginning of the leaning tower of pisa and there is an image of the washington monument

2724168 will not run ads that are damaging to oil companies
2724169 there may be no corporation in america that has attacked the rights of workers and undercut the living standards of americans more than wal mart

2724171 what we need today is an economic surge to keep jobs here at home and create new ones we need to reduce the tax burden on businesses that choose to make their home in the united states of america we need to open new markets to u s products and we need to reduce the cost of healthcare and we need to end the out of control spending in washington that is putting our debt on the backs of our children
2724172 indicates his party is seriously considering another shutdown threat to force a vote on offshore oil drilling in september
2724173 the precise maneuvering of a shutdown threat is complicated but it revolves around the fact that key government spending bills expire when the fiscal year ends september 30 and congress must vote next month to keep the government operating
2724174 are democrats really prepared to close the government in order to stop drilling because i think the country will find that to be a suicidal strategy
2724175 i think the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
2724176 in the western world journalists can mostly say what they want as long as they agree with the positions of their publishers

2724242 online bingo is booming everywhere but its a mistake to link it to traditional bingo because thats a completely different proposition
2724243 our online customers women are young above average income and typical internet consumers land based bingo is about elderly people smoking and aggressive slot machines
2724244 people are cutting back on leisure but they are staying home and spending only in the low tens of pounds a month with the chance of winning some extra cash
2724245 the beauty of it is there are very low costs and a huge number of players so despite low margins it is very profitable
2724246 but you can make a noise without being shushed by the old ladies play in your pyjamas and start a game at any time of day
2724247 there are so many free bonuses and prizes i feel sorry for land based bingo because its really suffering but online has so much more to offer
2724248 when online bingo was invented land based bingo feared the competition
2724249 now they have realised there is only a 10 percent crossover of their players
2724250 people will start to value recognised online brands and recession might not be a bad thing as the me too brands wont stay the course
2724251 spending on a game is very low compared with other internet gambling but our customers feed into other areas of our business
2724252 declara isidro uno de los miembros del grupo que trabaja con electrodom sticos y patina desde los doce a os
2724253 por una parte dicen fomentar el ahorro de energ a el respeto al medio ambiente y que la gente haga ejercicio y luego prohiben una actividad que precisamente re ne esas tres caracter sticas como forma de ocio y tambi n de desplazamiento
2724254 estamos de acuerdo en que se prohiba el abuso las molestias a los peatones o el deterioro de mobiliario urbano pero no el uso racional y civilizado del pat n
2724255 tambi n nos parece bien que se delimiten unos espacios y horarios para patinar pero no que se nos criminalice adem s de momento las instalaciones para practicar el patinaje son escasas y peque as
2724256 no tiene nada que ver una modalidad con otra responden a esp ritus muy diferentes pero a veces la gente los confunde
2724257 venimos aqu hace mucho tiempo y nunca hemos tenido ning n problema los ni os se acercan a mirar y algunos se inician con nosotros
2724258 adem s de hacer ejercicio a un m dico precio el patinaje es para nosotros
2724259 there will be no losses for fruit growers in kashmir
2724260 dont go by the other road it is not right
2724261 we will have to see how to deal with the land issue we will definitely make efforts that it is resolved in a manner which does not hurt the sentiments of the people of jammu as well as the people of kashmir
2724262 i hope mr musharraf will resign voluntarily for the complete restoration of the constitution survival of the nation and strengthening of democracy
2724263 he is left with two options either to face the impeachment motion like a man or resign and go home quietly

2724265 sometimes you ask me mommy for something and i say no well sometimes we ask god for something and god says no
2724266 i sent you two boats and a helicopter what more did you want
2724267 youve got to have some hidden sin youre not confessing thats why god hasnt healed you yet
2724268 why doesnt he heal her when ive prayed and trusted
2724269 master who did this sin this man or his parents that he was born blind
2724270 neither has this man sinned nor his parents but that the works of god should be made manifest in him
2724271 for by grace you are saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god has before ordained that we should walk in them
2724272 faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things unseen
2724273 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god and are called according to his purpose
2724274 implies that the organization has had one or more regattas in the past and will continue to have them in the future
2724275 should be tolled until service of a copy of this order
2724276 we are delighted with this result we can now continue with our vision of a multi challenger event the courts decision validates our actions and enables us to put the americas cup back on the water
2724277 we must now evaluate whether adjustments have to be made due to the time consumed by its the ggyc improper litigation initiatives
2724278 racing against the boys is exciting but in a separate event you have a better overview who your opponents are now and for the future
2724279 we havent been sailing much the last few months we just had our exams and we will set our minds to sailing the next few years 2012 thats the plan i just finished my second year of university and have one more year to go but ill catch up with that later
2724280 of course we were kind of nervous before the start we motivated each other lets go for it one more time cut the crap and be serious this is our big chance
2724281 it has been a very good event with strong and fair play battles finally our opponents and ourselves are happy for each other to be on the podium together we all know that we will meet again next month at the junior europeans its not over after that because we will be training with the israelis during the winter and form a group of young ambitious sailors to make each other better we are the young ones with ambitions for 2012
2724282 es sein allein der leichtsinn des kl gers wenn er f r eine sache die er nur anhand eines internet fotos und der d rftigen beschreibung des verk ufers auf ihren wert berpr fen kann ohne vereinbarung eines r ckgaberechts eur 2 247 00 bietet vor solchen risikogesch ften kann ihn das zivilrecht nicht sch tzen
2724283 i always imagine your whole garden to look so beautiful as every photo i have seen is always so full of colour and gorgeous plants
2724284 it doesnt matter what the economists say all the people i chat with at the grocery store the gas station shopping for school clothes all are feeling very depressed because of the beating their budgets are taking
2724285 the price of food is going through the roof the only thing that is staying the same is my salary
2724286 a serious cash flow issue gas food utilities are at an all time high with no dramatic increase in our pay scale we limit our dining out to one night per week and grocery shopping has been limited to needed items
2724287 for a long time in robotics there was this focus on a smart machine an android that would make you breakfast and go out and buy your shopping but thats extremely challenging its going to be far easier for us to engineer little simple things and rely on them to organise themselves
2724288 you might have some complex robot that is sent to mars has a technical problem and then the mission is basically over with swarm robots even if a percentage of them fails theyll still be able to achieve their goal
2724289 if you design software with typical engineering tools like if this and that then do this its like playing a chess game by calculating all the possible never get there
2724290 when it comes to name calling for being ginger or for the way you talk then thats simple bullying and unfortunately i think bullying is a very english characteristic
2724291 it worries me to think how seven year olds running around a playground could get bullied just for the colour of their hair it never bothered me as a kid but when you look at it its very sinister and sad
2724292 its like racism not the same but the principle is similar it has become acceptable to mock people for the colour of their hair or the way they talk and it saddens me that this gets perpetuated from generation to generation
2724293 i couldnt believe it its not as if hes got crazy patterns in his hair or anything
2724294 but for some reason the deputy head thinks a bit of spiky hair is extreme and doesnt conform to the school rules
2724295 you may also need to reconsider amies blonde streak in her hair
2724296 as you know we have a policy of not allowing extreme haircuts
2724297 i think they are nit picking a bit ive seen some of the haircuts at the school and loads of them are far more extreme than a bit of spiky hair
2724298 and amies hair well its just a tiny little streak of bleached hair
2724299 we are aware of this issue and are supporting the family to see a resolution
2724300 on my first modelling job i had no idea i just turned up stumbled and laughed i walked off the end of the runway
2724301 five days in a hotel one outfit and one 50 metre walk down a runway
2724302 but i suppose its better than doing anything proper i mean all this money for five minutes work
2724303 i cut it short when i moved into wellington though i was scared id get beaten up
2724304 some agents want me to cut my hair i probably will but definitely not all of it
2724305 i bond with other redheads at parties here i love it
2724306 one black guy i was speaking with about racism even admitted to me that he would rather be black than be ginger
2724307 kelsey got called names all the time it wasnt just the girls it was the boys she was bubbly but she thought she was ugly

2724309 i think it would be very wrong of me to conclude she took her own life she may have intended to do that but there is a chance she did not

2724312 everything from avenue road going west is being looked at in terms of potentially eliminating parking reducing lanes and dealing with bias
2724313 and theres good councilor support for bike lanes along bloor street
2724314 then its going to be upsetting for a lot of people that are working on projects like a bike lane across bloor street
2724315 there are public meetings every time a street is reconstructed
2724316 i dont think the problem is the process i think its the lack of organization on our part as cyclists
2724317 its directly related to the reluctance of the canadian government to protect copyright
2724318 if people had to pay to download an mp3 versus buying a cd they would buy a cd because mp3s sound like crap
2724319 there are a lot of young people out there who have never even heard a cd
2724320 and to me thats really dangerous for the entire music industry because the music industry is driven by people who get an incredible buzz off of music
2724321 whereas independent record stores we exist because we love music
2724322 weve never made very much money what we get is a buzz from working with music all day long
2724323 the effect of mp3 technology i think will kill peoples passion for music
2724324 just because it sounds so bad that they wont be able to get the buzz that people get with a full cd or a piece of vinyl
2724325 and of course the world web of information radio television telephones the internet means not only that we can affect lives everwhere but we can learn about life anywhere too

2724350 the fragile families and child wellbeing study is following a cohort of nearly 5 000 children born in large u s cities between 1998 and 2000 roughly three quarters of whom were born to unmarried parents
2724351 more engaged more co operative and shared more responsibility than their biological counterparts did
2724352 there is no reason why stepfathers cannot make incredibly good parents and they may be more attentive
2724353 but i think you have to look at it case by case
2724354 stepfathers have to work harder to fit in and to have a useful productive role
2724355 our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal
2724356 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies

2724364 that cannot wait until next month basically everyone is scrambling around looking for capacity in vietnam and bangladesh
2724365 this is actually going to start hitting business pretty severely
2724366 other countries saw their stock markets go up before the olympics they all made something out of it so i do not understand why we did not
2724367 most of us are just affected negatively by the olympics the businesses that can make money out of it are very few

2724409 water which never struck old red as much of a drink also fails to impress as a playing surface
2724410 sie war mit jemandem zusammen der sie nicht gut behandelt hat
2724411 it made me feel really insecure and question who i was
2724412 i think bullying is a strong word all types of bullying affects each person in totally different ways
2724413 i was never physically bullied but verbally bullied by other kids at school
2724414 bullies feel like they want to cut them down because that makes them feel better about themselves
2724415 a lot of the times people are bullied because they dare to be different its like the tall poppy syndrome
2724416 bullies are often people who feel a little bit inadequate thats a big contributor to bullying
2724417 natalie is a great example of someone who wasnt going to let that get them down
2724418 quite often bullying has the opposite effect and victims end up with an ill show you attitude i think its something that anybody can overcome
2724419 anything to try and cut the cost of running your car is worth it
2724420 ive got a 1936 armstrong siddeley in the garage that im going to try next
2724421 vintage whisky seems to work best on older cars i put nothing but the best in mine
2724422 if our idea can be refined properly we could have everyone here running cars on it
2724423 i must admit i had my doubts but it actually works
2724424 were experimenting at the moment its far from perfected but were working on it
2724425 we know whisky makes cars go the question now is will we be allowed to distil our own and instead of drinking it just pour it into our vehicles
2724426 its all about cost but with the way things are going whisky may end up being cheaper than petrol
2724427 islay gives a lot to the exchequer every year and we get very little back in return surely the chancellor could grant us some leeway to develop whisky fuel
2724428 it is not as refined as petrol and diesel but it will work
2724429 id describe marlon as an extremely attractive pain in the a
2724430 the thing that makes me sad is that he didnt stay in theatre or rather he didnt return to theatre
2724431 i think that the entertainment world is the most difficult and its hard to understand how you can stay in it physically mentally emotionally
2724432 im up till four in the morning sometimes thinking what are they going to say about my performance when people say they dont read their reviews i say bull course you do
2724433 i know how rough this business is im sad a lot of the youngsters in la at the moment are not up to it this idea so many have that the first step to fame and fortune is rehab it makes me very sad
2724434 there was a time four years ago when i thought i was going to stop acting
2724435 i had no passion any more i felt no desire and then i thought ok the only way i can get through this is to focus on taking care of my kids
2724436 i didnt work during that time i dont know why i found myself there but moments like that are important theyre necessary

2724439 so community colleges are accessible theyre available theyre affordable and their curriculums dont get stuck in other words if theres a need for a certain kind of worker i presume your curriculums evolved over time
2724440 let me put it to you bluntly in a changing world we want more people to have control over your own life
2724441 es besteht bei den gasunternehmen der dringende verdacht dass es sich um eine missbr uchliche ausnutzung der marktstellung handelt

2724456 everywhere we go everyone sings youre not famous anymore it just shows other teams havent forgotten about us
2724457 it stems from jealousy of the great 1970s side more recently the jealousy comes from how devilishly attractive leeds fans are
2724458 people make quick judgments they look at leeds and think they are arrogant and big headed

2724461 from day wear to evening wear its a modern way to update your look
2724462 especially in summer with nice tanned legs its a quirky take on a boyish look
2724463 i admire anybody game enough to try and pull it off but it has to be done well
2724464 i wore a loose fitting t shirt it was very hot in london and its no secret i dont like wearing bras
2724465 my boob fell out twice and people on the blogs are saying it was a publicity stunt
2724466 can i just say i have been keeping myself very much to myself recently ive been gardening decorating my new flat and looking after my grieving grandfather
2724467 if i wanted publicity id be accepting invitations not to mention money for turning up to glamorous events
2724468 they already call me paris hilton now i want to be her everything lips breasts and the rest im just enhancing the existing likeness
2724469 a wish to look like somebody else and make it happen can be seen as a mental disorder
2724470 i thoroughly enjoyed my fish and chips served by the half naked man
2724471 the care of our clients is our number one priority and fundamental to this is giving them choices and respecting their wishes as adults
2724472 while it may have been a bit risque the wish was carried out with the utmost respect for all those involved and taken in the good humoured way it was intended by residents and staff present at the time
2724473 its a miracle were both alive and dont even have broken bones
2724474 when i got up a man near enough rugby tackled me and told me i shouldnt move he then hugged me to keep me warm while other people put coats around me im so grateful to everyone who came to our help
2724475 for a long time in robotics there was this focus on a smart machine an android that would make you breakfast and go out and buy your shopping but thats extremely challenging its going to be far easier for us to engineer little simple things and rely on them to organise themselves
2724476 you might have some complex robot that is sent to mars has a technical problem and then the mission is basically over with swarm robots even if a percentage of them fails theyll still be able to achieve their goal
2724477 if you design software with typical engineering tools like if this and that then do this its like playing a chess game by calculating all the possible never get there

2724484 the new players have come in and all done well
2724485 it is always good to have a few new faces in the group and hopefully we have made them feel welcome also sometimes you only need a few changes to make a big difference and hopefully the players who have been signed will help us achieve that
2724486 we already had a really strong team and now we have added to what we had so that can only be a good thing
2724487 there has been a lot of comment regarding our position with regards to gareth barry
2724488 this is not about questioning the managers judgment or the ability of a particular player the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so
2724489 it is obviously the selling clubs prerogative to put whatever price they want on the player but on this occasion liverpool think the price quoted is too high
2724490 robbie is one of those players who can come in straight away and hit the ground running
2724491 he has played all his career in the premier league with a one year spell in italy so he doesnt need to take any time to settle in
2724492 he can make an impact from the first whistle there is no getting used to the speed of the game or anything like that
2724493 all he has to do is get to know the boys and tune in to their games where they like to make runs where they are going to want him to run to and so on
2724494 he will give the manager plenty of options in the striking positions he can play straight through the middle as a partner for shoulder to shoulder
2724495 or you can withdraw him slightly from fernando and play him in the hole between the strikers and midfield
2724496 he will be effective in either role you only have to look at how he fitted and moulded his game around dimitar berbatov at tottenham to see the potential that he and torres have as a pairing
2724497 berbatov scored a lot of goals from direct final passes from keane or from his movement and ability to create space
2724498 and when keane gets into position himself in front of goal he can finish as well as anyone
2724499 torres is maybe just a step above berbatov because he is a lot younger so you have to be licking your lips at the prospect of them being unleashed on the premier league
2724500 real madrid did make a bid for cristiano i think it was by fax but the decision on what we would do was taken at the end of last season when they first started with their nonsense
2724501 we had dialogue with our owners but when cristiano stated at the end of last season that he would decide his future in the next few days the club decided he would not be sold there has never been any change we havent had any other dialogue with real madrid will there be a chance for things to heal no chance
2724502 a knighthood is an honour only given during someones lifetime
2724503 unlike bravery awards and medals they have never been granted posthumously in practical terms it would also be impossible to decide which of thousands of figures in our countrys history who were not knighted during their lifetimes should retrospectively deserve such recognition
2724504 the facts are that bob should have been knighted when he was alive
2724505 he was the greatest manager this country has ever produced and maybe if he had managed a club further down the east lancashire road he would have got the knighthood he deserved
2724506 it was a lovely touch the letter was very personal and a great deal of thought had gone into its contents he included my wife sandra young frank and the family in general whats more he meant every word of it and that means a great deal to me but thats sir alex for you its probably a side you dont see too much but one everyone in football knows about
2724507 publicly you see the ruthlessly driven side of a man that wants to win at all costs and thats what makes him such a successful manager probably one of the best in the history of the game
2724508 he hates losing but as i have always said show me a good loser and ill show you a loser but in truth you couldnt meet a more caring and compassionate man he has time for everyone let me tell you if a lower league manager calls him he will always call them back if someone is in trouble he is the first on the phone trying to help and if someone passes away in the football community he will think nothing of getting in his car and driving to the other side of the country to attend the funeral
2724509 he did have the right hump with me when i was at west ham and they failed to beat us and lost the title to blackburn in 95
2724510 electrochemical capacitor dlc consulting amp contract research amp development testing
2724511 hes a very nice fellow he seems to want to answer questions to the best of his ability hes not strongly technical he talks big words but he doesnt understand the science of what hes talking about really
2724512 we knew alonso was a very good player and as a result he had a good price on his head we had offers but they were not enough so we decided he needed to stay with us
2724513 for me it is not a problem if he stays or not he can stay we always have felt he is a good player
2724514 we are only talking about a very very good price he is a good player if he is not going to bring a good price then it is very simple easy to understand
2724515 i heard the crowd obviously we know now as we knew before that he could stay with us
2724516 it is not positive that we may not have the players we want here before the champions league game but the transfer window closes at the end of august we will try to do our best to bring in the players to improve us by then
2724517 i try to do the best for my club with the possibilities that you have i have done this every since i have been here and i am trying to do the same for this coming season
2724518 i do not feel any more pressure every season is the same we have a good squad better than before but we can improve a little bit more
2724519 more or less the side that played against lazio will be the one that plays in the champions league on wednesday in belgium
2724520 most of the senior players were involved this will be the side that plays against standard liege
2724521 the situation has been very difficult for us we have had a lot of players returning to training late after international games in the summer and now we have players at the olympics
2724522 it has given me a chance to see the young players during pre season and i am sure that the future of the club is guaranteed
2724523 i believe we are ready for the champions league tie the experienced players are ready but we know that we have quality from the young players
2724524 i have not decided whether any more will go out on loan it depends on whether we sell anyone else if we do not bring anyone else in maybe we do not need to add anyone or loan any of the youngsters
2724525 we have a good player alonso and we have another good player coming in soon
2724526 we can improve the squad so we will try to do that we will bring in one more player if we can
2724527 who comes in it could be another left sided player rather than a central midfielder

2724529 he is english and he can three different positions but i am talking about someone who can play on the left
2724530 taka prelomnica je bil tudi sprejem amandmajev k slovenski ustavi septembra leta 1989 takrat smo ob silnem odporu v vsej biv i jugoslaviji v ustavo zapisali pravico do samoodlo be vklju no z odcepitvijo sklenili smo da lahko le mi v slovenski skup ini odlo amo o razglasitvi izrednih razmer s katerimi nam je grozil beograd
2724531 zato ne smemo dovoliti da se zaradi zavedanja o tem da so bili na napa ni strani sedaj krivda za njihovo odlo itev eli naprtiti uporu in nob e saj ni lo za upor zoper okupatorja lo vam je le za revolucijo in nasilni prevzem oblasti
2724532 nous sommes arriv s la conclusion quil tait tr s difficile voire impossible de trouver un terrain commun pour une d claration
2724533 il est clair que le conflit s tend pr sent dautres r gions de g orgie en particulier labkhazie
2724534 sengagent ne pas recourir la force et se retirent doss tie du sud
2724535 le cessez le feu nest pas une solution cette aventure a chou et la seule solution est de revenir au statu quo ante
2724536 la russie pour sa part ne retirera pas ses forces

2724540 il ne faut pas c der la provocation et il faut revenir sur ses positions ant rieures
2724541 il faut quil y ait un r glement international sans doute avec lonu avec la participation de lunion europ enne qui est pr sente qui peut la fois d livrer des secours et puis peut tre garantir la paix
2724542 et puis nous verrons sil est possible quil y ait un conseil avec les chefs detat parce que a aurait une signification politique majeure que les 27 pays de lue se mettent daccord pour intervenir tr s directement
2724543 tous les pays europ ens sont daccord pour condamner cette guerre avec des nuances
2724544 ca ne va pas tre la position de leurope ca ne sert rien dinjurier les gens
2724545 in fact ive almost had to be reined in but always in the back of all our minds has been that you dont want to be pushing further than your body tells you to
2724546 ive had to go steadily but this last week ive been running more and more quickly and continuing to progress manchester united is what were aiming for
2724547 they are the champions of england and europe and in my view the best team in europe
2724548 but the first game of a new season could be just the time to play them when they might not be firing on all cylinders
2724549 we have good relations with european countries with the european union but i do not accept integration into the union for the mediterranean
2724550 i do not agree to cutting up africa for hypothetical prospects with europe

2724560 i told him not to go because its during the olympic games and this period is sensitive
2724561 but he was determined to go because he said that church was where he was baptized so i went with him hoping to protect him
2724562 no no im not talking about that we came here to play theres no need to mix politics and sport
2724563 he would say things you wanted to say but he would say them without malice
2724564 if you said these things youd be mad but don would say them without malice and it was great

2724573 not only dont i have to wear makeup because they cover everything but the other poker players wont see my expressions
2724574 you realize this is the first weekend ive been in vegas as a single guy
2724575 we have only 3 more shows to shoot and thats it for ever i only know theres going to be a few funerals but the endings are all so secret i can only hope i dont get whacked
2724576 im having too much fun i dont want to leave
2724577 im well but can you imagine my first weekend out of rehab and im in vegas with its highballs and hookers
2724578 weve filmed in 7 cities during this current tour i do the interviews and weve got some really touching stories from her fans i truly believe shes the best entertainer of all time in your internet terms way beyond dialup and broadband and satellite shes right up there at the very top im such a fan i had to warn her when she came to my house in miami that i had posters of her up on the entryway wall
2724579 were here to raise more money than kevin federline thinks hell get from britney
2724580 if the federal government actually gets the mexican border wall built who do you think theyll hire to do it and if the river in between is stocked with crocodiles itll only be 5 minutes before theres a sale on wallets and handbags

2724583 i think it is dangerous to confuse the idea of democracy with elections just because you have elections doesnt mean youre a democratic country
2724584 the bible contains six admonishments to homosexuals and 362 admonishments to heterosexuals that doesnt mean that god doesnt love heterosexuals its just that they need more supervision

2724586 wilmington plays a direct game and had a lot of very similar well struck shots tonight they were in a must win match and as a result they gave us a real battle
2724587 it was good to be back and because i still have a lot of friends in the area i wanted to be able to contribute i feel we showed a lot of character as a team tonight getting out of there with a draw and now we can focus on the post season
2724588 a draw is not an option so every score is critical of course we will need our defense to continue to be strong and even more so but it is paramount that we find a way to get the ball in the net at the other end of the pitch
2724589 praying only for knowledge of his will for us and the power to carry that out
2724590 holy shit maybe i should jump onto the bandwagon of the other side
2724591 all the parties concerned need to cease military action and get back into talks immediately and sort this out through dialogue and negotiation rather than through force of arms
2724592 some people here want to learn english to become olympics volunteers others for a hobby i wanted both
2724593 when i was young i realized english is the international language and wanted to serve the people from all over the world during the beijing 2008 games
2724594 after beijing won its olympics bid in 2001 i knew many would come and need help in 2008 so i thought maybe i can help them and show them the way
2724595 also in 2001 my grandson was 5 and coming home from school and trying to speak english words so if i learned english i could also speak to him in this language
2724596 oh you should get butter chicken white people love butter chicken
2724597 at base this dispute is about the western tradition of freedom of expression versus a fundamentalist orientation in which ones god cannot be criticized mocked or displayed in a manner unbecoming to devout adherents however offended some muslims christians jews or others may feel on occasion the proper response to verbal and visual hurt is to boycott or to debate but never to ban prosecute and gag ill side with the longstanding western tradition

2724599 this is bitter sweet news for me we are sad to see mark go but i couldnt be more thrilled for the opportunities that have opened up for him in the last year
2724600 as a director who got her start in arts administration i recognize the momentum of a directing career on the rise and i cannot wait to have him back at the magic as a visiting artist
2724601 marks contributions to the magic are too many to count
2724602 he has been a tireless champion for playwrights at the magic and i am especially thankful for his leadership during the transition last season we are very grateful to have him for another month at the magic to help launch this new chapter under lorettas leadership
2724603 i am incredibly excited to take on the challenge of a freelance career and to increase my responsibilities with the nnpn
2724604 with the offers that have been coming in this past summer from around the country it became very clear that a full time job as an arts administrator was going to be impossible to fulfill i would like to extend my sincere thanks to the magic theatre board and staff for their support and camaraderie over the last six years
2724605 come on scott your turn go get some drinks and a few burgers

2724613 it appears at this stage that the victim has no links to gang activity and that he was an innocent bystander caught up in the line of fire and was not the intended target
2724614 the victim was walking down walworth road with family members as they entered costcutter two black men forced their way into the shop behind them as if they were trying to get away from something

2724616 they really love barack obama in germany hes like a rock star over there impressive until you realise that david hasselhoff is also like a rock star over there
2724617 we had a hard time convincing people that obama is funny for a long time our audiences seemed unsure whether to laugh at him the first black president is not a gag but thats changing because hes doing more stuff thats easy to mock and people are more familiar with him
2724618 its not always pretty but we have the aussie spirit and a lot of heart
2724619 we believed korea was a real threat going into the game so to come out and beat them is really a feather in our cap
2724620 i believe that the position of the international community supported by australia is that georgia is an independent state its territorial sovereignty should be respected and therefore all states should exercise restraint and that includes the russian federation
2724621 its important for the united nations security council to deal with this matter
2724622 its regrettable that in the session which has been held on georgia theyve been unable to reach an agreed resolution on action
2724623 but for our part in australia and i think in common voice with the rest of the international community we are calling upon all parties to exercise restraint and for the territorial integrity of the sovereign state to be respected
2724624 our troops are fighting still fighting they are not letting russian troops into the city of gori
2724625 that means that the russians despite an unprecedented amount of resources they brought with them have failed to defeat our troops
2724626 we deplore the dangerous and disproportionate actions by russian forces and we would be particularly troubled if these attacks are continuing now as the georgians are pulling back
2724627 very very concerned if in fact there is ground action inside of georgia proper that is outside of these areas of abkhazia and ossetia

2724629 it doesnt matter what the economists say all the people i chat with at the grocery store the gas station shopping for school clothes all are feeling very depressed because of the beating their budgets are taking
2724630 the price of food is going through the roof the only thing that is staying the same is my salary
2724631 a serious cash flow issue gas food utilities are at an all time high with no dramatic increase in our pay scale we limit our dining out to one night per week and grocery shopping has been limited to needed items
2724632 as soon as a durable peace takes hold we need to move forward with dialogue and peaceful negotiations
2724633 this reminds me all too much of other recent conflicts that have torn our continent apart particularly in the balkans
2724634 an immediate cessation of hostilities the full respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia
2724635 if one of the protagonists which appears to be the case commits to a ceasefire the other one must do the same
2724636 russia doubtless feels isolated even encircled given the transformation of its immediate environment
2724637 that is no reason we have told it russia so and we say so again not to respect the independence of its neighbours
2724638 that said i remain convinced that the european union needs to find a new language a new mode of cooperation in its relations with moscow
2724639 the strategic nature of this region is a secret for no one
2724640 its not like nathan bedford forrest was inviting jews over to celebrate seder

2724643 i dont really feel anything about it i think about it and i hope its successful and its really possible i think they are really good people at the helm

2724673 i was doing my best to keep johnny benson back there and held him off for a while as soon as he cleared bodine he ran right up there once benson got air on the nose that was it i held him off for a while but he got under me and that was it

2724687 we have managed to push liberalisation and deregulation ahead along with our partners in aregnat
2724688 we jointly led and concluded new codes of practice for consumer protection and regional price benchmarking for telecommunications services and how this stacks up against other countries in europe
2724689 we agreed roaming regulations that aimed to reduce international roaming charges among arab countries which went to the arab council of ict ministers last month and these were supported
2724690 and we also developed guidelines for licensing regime allowing licensee to provide any services at present each country has a different licensing regime it will help regional operators to see a common set of rights and obligations around the region
2724691 we will see radical change both across the region and here in bahrain in the next few years
2724692 telecommunications monopolies are being broken across the region and liberalisation is giving customers more choice new services and lower costs
2724693 liberalisation has a major impact on the growth of the economy because telecommunications is an artery an electronic highway for business just like roads and shipping
2724694 bahrain is still seen as the most advanced in the region when it comes to liberalisation as we have no barriers to entry for fixed line services
2724695 if anyone wants to set up a business in the industry then we review it technically and see that it is commercially sound and then we recommend the granting of a licence
2724696 some other countries authorities take the decision on when to issue licences with the regulator dictating the pace rather than the market that is not the case here

2724862 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2724863 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2724864 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2724865 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2724866 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2724867 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2724868 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2724869 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2724913 i was with this girl the other night and from the way she was responding to my skillful caresses you would have sworn that she was conscious from the top of her head to the tag on her toes
2724914 id love to slit my corsets and watch her spread to death
2724915 i think people should be free to engage in any sexual practices they choose they should draw the line at goats though
2724916 my love life is terrible the last time i was inside a woman was when i visited the statue of liberty
2724917 i blame my mother for my poor sex life all she told me was the man goes on top and the woman underneath for three years my husband and i slept on bunk beds
2724918 i believe that sex is a beautiful thing between two people between five its fantastic
2724919 a womans mind is cleaner than a mans thats because she changes it more often
2724920 my mom was a ventriloquist and she always was throwing her voice for ten years i thought the dog was telling me to kill my father

2724925 i couldnt ask for a better first game so im excited
2724926 it was cool seeing the fans seeing my family the place was packed all the way up to the top
2724927 i think on the defensive end i worked hard and got in front on the press but i wasnt aggressive enough offensively i need to be more aggressive in the next game
2724928 candace is such a dominant player so versatile this is her first game and she is only going to get better
2724929 she played a great game tonight but i expect her to get even better as we get into the tournament
2724930 one of the advantages of coming off the bench is that you get a feeling for what is needed
2724931 what i saw was a need to be a little more aggressive and apply a bit more pressure on the ball when i came in i just tried to get all over the point guard i feel that our defense which forced 27 turnovers kind of opened things up for our offense
2724932 i thought candace came off the bench and did a great job and catch came off the bench and did a great job
2724933 once we got the wheels going a little bit it started to work for us
2724934 at that point in the game i just felt like it was best for me to lay it up and get two points
2724935 it was cool just being out on the court and representing your country
2724936 we waited so long to be here its a great feeling
2724937 it was great for them to come and show their support

2724963 in the early months the presidium members would meet in a small room in the justus lipsius building some fifteen minute walk from the european parliament attendance was limited to the thirteen members the secretary general sir john kerr his deputy and the press officer sir john kerr a former permanent secretary of the british foreign office conducted the proceedings inside the presidium and in the plenary sessions of the convention with deft diplomatic skill as might be expected from someone who john major called machiavelli in his autobiography the best description of his talents i heard was when kerr comes up to you and asks for the time you wonder why me and why now on several occasions we would retreat to the val duchess a small palace used by the belgian foreign minister it was at one of the dinners at val duchess that the skeleton of the draft constitution was given to members of the presidium in sealed brown envelopes the weekend before the public presentation we were not allowed to take the documents away with us just precisely who drafted the skeleton and when is still unclear to me but i gather much of the work was done by valery giscard destaing and sir john kerr over the summer there was little time for informed discussion and even less scope for changes to be made

2724987 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
2724988 the number of victims with women children and elderly people among them can be counted in hundreds and even thousands
2724989 civilians including women children and elderly people are dying in south ossetia in addition to that georgia conducts ethnic scouring in south ossetian villages the situation in south ossetia continues to worsen every hour georgia uses military hardware and heavy arms against people they shell residential quarters of tskhinvali the capital and other settlements they bomb the humanitarian convoys the number of refugees continues to rise the people try to save their lives the lives of their children and relatives a humanitarian catastrophe is gathering pace
2724990 the georgian administration has found the use to its arms which they have been purchasing during the recent several years
2724991 the fact that georgian peacemakers in the structure of joint peacemaking forces opened fire on their russian comrades from one and the same contingent speaks for itself i think
2724992 now it is clear to us why georgia never accepted russias offer to sign a legally binding document not to use force for the regulation of the south ossetian conflict
2724993 not so long ago before the military actions in south ossetia georgias president saakashvili said that there was no point in such a document because georgia would not use force against its people as he said it just so happens that it is using it
2724994 we have repeatedly warned that the international community should not turn a blind eye on massive purchases of offensive arms in which the georgian administration has been involved during the recent two years

2725095 i wasnt comfortable after the first 200 after seeing everybody so close together
2725096 thats usually not how it as after the first 200 i think it made my breaststroke a lot stronger and at that point it was all adrenaline
2725097 i knew i had to go out fast in order to be in the race
2725098 if i was like a couple tenths slower on the back stroke i think i wouldve had a better shot i think that backstroke kind of took a lot out of me i did my best and i cant ask for anything else

2725123 il peggior modo di sentire la mancanza di qualcuno sedersi accanto e sapere che non sar mai tuo

2725171 that any participation of kenteris and thanou at any further edition of the olympic games shall be subject to a new procedure in front of the ioc
2725172 when thanou handed over her accreditation she was no more an olympic athlete
2725173 we said at the time that we would review the eligibility of thanou for beijing so if the greek olympic committee enters thanou in beijing we will study the eligibility we have the right to do that

2725183 from here on every match is like a final as for my game i did not feel uncomfortable at any point of my game the crowd is great you hardly see so many people cheering badminton players and the atmosphere is electric
2725184 its going to be tough against her no question about that
2725185 but i can assure you that i would put my 100 percent tomorrow
2725186 i had not played her earlier so i did not go all out right from the start i needed time to pick her weak points
2725187 dit is een van de slechtste momenten uit mijn carri re
2725188 coming off the last wall i was excited im kind of emotional now i got through the first event im really happy
2725189 gt indymac bank seized by feds one of largest bank collapses in american history with video
2725190 i won the bronze in atlanta in singles and i now i want a double
2725191 the defeat in athens still hurts it rankles me that we lost it when we were just two match points away from a win and a medal i want to right the wrong here
2725192 we will prepare a comprehensive and solid chargesheet that musharraf will not be able to fight it it is very necessary that he resigns himself otherwise the impeachment will start

2725194 we had already completed the numbers game before launching such a vital move
2725195 i started this season much to simons chagrin as the word nerd and im absolutely at a loss for words

2725197 britney wants to get back to work people close to britney know that larry is the best person for her hes the man who can get her back on the right track career wise
2725198 there is no doubt that two keys to this election are how many white and latino votes will obama lose because of his race than a white democrat would have won and how much will african american turnout grow given the opportunity to elect our nations first black president
2725199 i like boys a lot im boy crazy that hasnt changed since i was very young
2725200 im a lot of woman in a lot of ways
2725201 he is indeed successful who purifies it and he is indeed a failure who stunts it
2725202 verily allah does not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves
2725203 i am as my servant thinks i am i am with him when he makes mention of me if he makes mention of me to himself i make mention of him to myself and if he makes mention of me in an assembly i make mention of him in an assembly even better than that and if he takes one step towards me i take ten steps towards him and if he comes walking to me i go running towards him
2725204 ive been told the club want me but then when i went to talk about a contract they arent interested so ive been left confused
2725205 i spoke to fulham about an extended contract and they werent willing to give me one until i came closer to the end of my current deal
2725206 ive got two years left and i felt it was a normal time to start talking about a new one
2725207 the thing with whitney is shes actually very smart and a really talented worker
2725208 she had to do a very simple task come backstage at the show and get tickets for her editor
2725209 if shes an intern shes not going to sit in the front row i dont care that shes on mtv she can stand in the back as an intern
2725210 i mean i wouldnt hire her but she could grow everyone makes mistakes their first time
2725211 kalau dunia mau menarik pelajaran dari yang saya lakukan ini maka takkan pernah ada perang
2725212 tidak semestinya kita membungkuk terlalu rendah untuk melancarkan perang terhadap perang antarsesama
2725213 selama kita senantiasa bertukar peluk dan cium saya melakukannya dengan banyak teman saya punya banyak teman di seluruh dunia dan akan selalu melakukannya tak boleh ada kebencian di antara atlet dan semua orang
2725214 di dunia olahraga kita akan selalu menjadi teman dan takkan ada yang mempengaruhi pertemanan kami sekalipun menembak adalah event yang menakutkan
2725215 kami memang berkawan kami pernah cukup lama menembak bersama dia pernah menembak untuk uni soviet kami sungguh sungguh berteman dan tak mau mencampuradukkannya dengan politik olahraga bukanlah politik
2725216 i never used cocaine until after i met whitney before then i had experimented with other drugs but marijuana was my drug of choice
2725217 bobby brown the truth the whole truth and nothing but
2725218 at one point in my life i used drugs uncontrollably i was using everything i could get my hands on from cocaine to heroin weed and cooked cocaine
2725219 i am guilty of sleeping with other women women are always throwing themselves at you im only human so i would make the mistake and bite the hook sometimes i let the testosterone take over
2725220 yes ive spent several nights at her house but she was only good for what her nickname stood for
2725221 i figured just eating well would help me lose five pounds or so but its so hard to eat well because i love so many unhealthy foods i just cant stop eating junk its awful
2725222 simpson was admitted to cedars sinai medical center on friday for a
2725223 we have a few injuries and were looking at a few targets were hoping to get something sorted this week
2725224 the situation is that spurs are interested but the deal has not been done if the deal does not feel right then it will not be done
2725225 hes not with us at the moment but i dont want to go into details if something happens in that respect youll be the first to know
2725226 i dont like talking about any prospective business that is being done whether or not it is likely or not until it is actually done
2725227 once deals are concluded if they are to be finalised then ill discuss them
2725228 the situation is that spurs are interested but the deal has not been done if the deal does not feel right then it will not be done
2725229 hes not with us at the moment but i dont want to go into details if something happens in that respect youll be the first to know
2725230 i dont like talking about any prospective business that is being done whether or not it is likely or not until it is actually done
2725231 once deals are concluded if they are to be finalised then ill discuss them
2725232 we certainly wont be looking to re invent the wheel because you only have to look at the success of the team over the last six years
2725233 if i came in with loads of fresh plans that would be casting aspersions on what went on before and i dont think there was much wrong
2725234 the difference between provincial rugby and international rugby is that the fish are the same size but the sea is bigger and it is up to me to learn how to swim in that sea
2725235 that is the size of the challenge so i will be nervous about this job but at the same time i cant wait
2725236 id be like a player going out onto the field
2725237 es hat in letzter zeit einfach zu viele entt uschungen gegeben als dass kate und gerry jedes mal ihre gef hle auf einzelne angaben konzentrieren k nnen
2725238 wenn sie auf jede angebliche sichtung von madeleine reagieren w rden w ren sie st ndig irgendwo in der welt unterwegs wir warten jeweils ab bis es konkretere angaben gibt ehe wir entscheiden etwas zu unternehmen
2725239 one could detect flirting between hunter and edwards including blatant shots of his crotch and rear end
2725240 rumors began spreading from north carolina where young continued to live with his wife and three children that mrs young was non too pleased that her husband had to fall on the sword moreover she was talking about her displeasure to her friends in the local hair salon
2725241 planes should always be punctual the workload should always be easy the bank overdraft should be comfortable
2725242 i am highly intelligent i ve got two degrees and i cant believe people get better jobs and make more money
2725243 on a quest to elevate doodling to the status of an art form that it deserves notebook pages sticky notes scraps of paper these treasures end up in garbage and vanish from the face of the earth forever trashcan art salvage enjoy
2725244 and hes still pedaling folks look at that man pedal
2725245 the sun is still shining the plants continue to grow
2725246 i asked her for water but she gave me gasoline
2725247 resistir ante las fuerzas enemigas con todos los medios posibles
2725248 no debemos permitir que el enemigo ocupe nuestra tierra y no deber amos dejar que se repitan los acontecimientos de 1921 cuando el ej rcito rojo invadi georgia
2725249 es geht nicht mehr nur um georgien es geht um amerika und seine werte wir sind ein freiheit liebendes land das derzeit angegriffen wird
2725250 das projekt sei zu wenig innovativ und die musik unterscheide sich zu wenig von derjenigen anderer bigbands
2725251 im really glad its getting warm and not cold an ice age would be really bad
2725252 species cant adapt or keep up in an evolutionary sense because everything is happening so fast
2725253 the changes are all happening faster than the models had predicted
2725254 we are not consciously thinking about it because its not happening now
2725255 but the minute you allow any kind of activity to occur it will just snowball
2725256 we are definitely leaving the century of oil behind and we are entering the century of water
2725257 the value globally of fresh potable water is expected to increase significantly during this century
2725258 the global water picture is grim and predicted to get grimmer
2725259 the great lakes are sitting on the saudi arabia of a basic commodity of life that is going to become more and more precious
2725260 we cannot take it for granted or it could slip away
2725261 the lake is clean and nice though the sand is hotter than a firecracker
2725262 id hate for that to happen weve had a great time
2725263 i remember my father used to say that if you leave man on earth long enough hell completely screw it up
2725264 now im 74 and im beginning to understand what he meant
2725265 when it happens we want to make sure our waters are protected and we have the fundamental last say in the use of our water
2725266 there are benefits and burdens to every part of the nation
2725267 when those southern and western states get all of our citizens who move i dont recall them standing up saying ohio you have benefited us so much were going to give you a percentage of their sales tax
2725268 beijing has invested more effort and more resources into the environment than any other olympic host city before and i think the diversity of measures here that have been taken have been very impressive
2725269 in the areas of particle matter water resources management water quality there is significant room for further development and finally the question is will beijing continue to invest in its public transport infrastructure and i think that will be a big test for the long term impact of the games
2725270 our experiences tell us that environmental stress due to lack of water may lead to conflict and would be greater in poor nations
2725271 population growth will make the problem worse so will climate change as the global economy grows so will its thirst many more conflicts lie just over the horizon
2725272 the greatest challenge we face is to try and reduce the dependence on the import of grains whether by increasing local production or whether by making more efficient use of raw materials in feeding livestock
2725273 this must be done despite all limitations mainly the lack of water
2725274 if the desalination and recycling projects are implemented a lack of water is not expected in 2013
2725275 i dont even like to go there its a disaster
2725276 we just threw everything to the floor and hope that next year is better
2725277 the decision is really simple you choose the part of your fields that are hardest to get water to and you destroy them
2725278 strong supporters of an emissions trading scheme because they stand to gain from trading permits and creating complex derivative markets
2725279 the european union spent five years just designing its scheme and its in the middle of seven years of phased transitions to iron out structural problems they dont actually switch to unconditional trading of permits until 2020
2725280 simply to tax the few places upstream the oil the gas the coal that puts on the price on carbon then works through the economy rather than a more complicated scheme where you monitor what thousands or even tens of thousands of individual enterprises are doing
2725281 governments prefer to hide behind markets with all their costly excesses
2725282 even if you were the worst carbon emitter in the world if you wrote a huge check you could claim to be carbon neutral
2725283 for us the implication is that the state is moving right up toward the limit for pm 10 so how much more development is going to be permissible in this area
2725284 if theres an issue on these things they deq will review it
2725285 people are not accepting of current gasoline prices and that is a huge political force nobody can ignore
2725286 but at same time there are many other terribly important things that factor into our lives we cant solve one problem without addressing all the other problems
2725287 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2725288 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2725289 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2725290 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2725291 they have not been here for long and they just kept themselves to themselves
2725292 are democrats really prepared to close the government in order to stop drilling
2725293 i think the american people would find that a suicidal strategy
2725294 so republicans are going to tell seniors youre being squeezed by high gas prices and high grocery prices and now were going to cut off your social security checks
2725295 said jennifer crider a spokeswoman for the democratic congressional campaign committee the house democrats campaign arm
2725296 as far as im concerned those bans end sept 30 and if they end on sept 30 fuel prices will head back down on oct 1
2725297 i want to see the most forward looking energy policy for alternatives
2725298 if in order to get that you have to compromise and have the states sign off on whether they want drilling or not maybe thats the price we are going to pay to get it but to have an up or down vote on drilling where does that leave us it leaves us in the same place republicans have put us in after eight years of their policies
2725299 moments after retiring to a small suburban home raising three sons and enjoying a distinguished career as a trial lawyer local resident fred havemeyer was mortified to learn that
2725300 but her entry was delayed and technical regulations dont allow her to be included now
2725301 i agree the olympics has got sentimental value but there are many major championships coming in the next two years
2725302 we are taking this sighting seriously in the sense that all information that is relevant is taken seriously we do not have it confirmed yet
2725303 at the moment kate and gerrys private investigators are liaising with the belgian authorities i am still waiting to hear from the investigators
2725304 our stance would not change with sanctions or the threat of sanctions
2725305 it is important that our country is ready to insist on its rights under any conditions
2725306 my views developed in the course of time but i have always believed in what i did and never acted against it
2725307 the soviet government had let the genie out of the bottle and however hard they tried later they couldnt put it back in
2725308 russia can neither be grasped by the mind nor measured by any common yardstick no attitude to her other than one of blind faith is admissible
2725309 broke russias back the red terror unleashed by its leaders their willingness to drown russia in blood is the first and foremost proof of it
2725310 the bitter russian experience which i have been studying and describing all my life will be for us a lesson that keeps us from new disastrous breakdowns
2725311 we havent fully recovered from a natural disaster and now were again being battered by a man made calamity
2725312 all peaceful avenues have been exhausted to resolve the conflict
2725313 we are now compelled to resort to the application of proportionate and justifiable force so that peace and order may be restored in north cotabato
2725314 organising something on the scale of the lambeth conference will inevitably result in a small deficit sometimes
2725315 the archbishops council met last week to propose a solution
2725316 nos hemos planteado conseguir que los juegos de madrid sean los juegos de las personas tanto de los deportistas como de los ciudadanos

2725331 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2725332 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2725333 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2725334 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2725335 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2725336 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country
2725337 als fu g nger oder radler hast du keine chance mehr

2725339 a call to action saving lives through nuclear weapons control and disarmament
2725340 it felt like someone had opened the door of a furnace behind you
2725341 weve got to get rid of these nuclear weapons before something terrible happens
2725342 both sides of the camp are talking about the need to reduce nuclear weapons
2725343 one of my men was killed on the spot when the taleban attacked us while four went missing the rest of us laid down our arms and were captured
2725344 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2725345 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2725346 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2725347 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2725348 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2725349 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2725350 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c

2725455 istilahnya kopi tempur siap tempur di pasar dengan mengandalkan cita rasanya yang khas harus merasakan kalau datang ke tempur

2725463 you still dont have the kinds of credit information in turkey that you have in the states
2725464 so youre not going to be able to ratchet down the level of bad credit like you can here
2725465 with a global downturn there could be trouble ahead for credit card customers
2725466 the more you try to pay it back the bigger the amount grows

2725479 with the samsung dtb h260f you can view hdtv sdtv and listen to dolby digital 2 0 stereo or dolby digital 5 1 surround audio through your audio system samsung solves output worries with a wide selection of output options including 1080i 720p or 480p i dtv formats and connection options including hdmi 1 component 1 composite 1 audio right left dolby digital optical
2725480 can i connect my dtv set top receiver to my cable tv service
2725481 cable tv systems use a different method for transmitting digital tv programs that is currently incompatible with broadcast dtv set top receivers
2725482 yeah you can hook it up to the composite output but youll never get it to work
2725483 okay im calling about a dtb h260f set top hd tuner which i have connected to my tv via the composite video connection the unit powers up but theres no image on the tv just a black screen but lets get something out of the way here at the beginning and maybe this will take care of all the other problems let me ask it says in the owners manual that you only get the on screen menu with the hdmi or component video connection is that correct
2725484 it says that in a lot of places for example at the bottom of page 21 the onscreen menu is supported only when the component or hdmi jacks on the rear of your set top box are properly connected in other words will this unit put out a signal from the composite video connection if you just power it up and connect it or is the on screen menu required for set up and without setup you cant use the tuner
2725485 you have to have an hdmi or a component connection on your tv do you have one of those
2725486 the composite video output is only for recording to a dvd recorder
2725487 so this unit is basically incompatible with my tv or any tv without component or hdmi inputs
2725488 it would have been nice to have that on the box
2725489 uh yeah thank you for calling samsung customer care you have yourself a nice day

2725568 i think it is a privilege to work in this industry
2725569 where else can you go to work and have so much fun
2725570 but it has been a busy one this is probably our best year for our company yet
2725571 we have a lot of colleges and universities in pittsburgh
2725572 we might not be coming across a ton of macs right now but were steadily seeing more and we needed to be proactive
2725573 its not like we get a mac and say oh well guess we cant do anything with this one
2725574 we will get into the computer it just might take us longer id like to see us be more efficient about it every time we get a mac we have to go looking for help
2725575 its easier to articulate something if youve actually used it
2725576 if a defense attorney brings a mac computer into court and tells me to go to the my documents folder and i cant do it what does that make me look like as an investigator its important to stay on top of all technology especially if its becoming more popular and mac computers are
2725577 jury has never found a defendant not guilty by reason of insanity in a contested case there have been times when defendants have been found not guilty by reason of insanity but that is usually by agreement with the prosecutors
2725578 our stance would not change with sanctions or the threat of sanctions
2725579 it is important that our country is ready to insist on its rights under any conditions
2725580 see it but dont leave me there i want to come home with you

2725585 ensure that there is a calculation and analysis of the need to provide flexible fossil fuelled back up capacity for the increased level of intermittent renewable e g marine and wind generation estimates suggest that this back up capability could amount to over 90 per cent of this intermittent capacity itself overall then that could require an increase in the uks installed generating capacity from todays 76gw to more than 120gw by 2020
2725586 we are still counting the dead and searching for the missing but we expect the toll to be bad especially at those villages that have been isolated after roads were washed away and communication lost
2725587 rescue work is facing many obstacles as all national and provincial roads to the affected districts are either under water or completely washed away
2725588 it took me a few seconds to register that we might have an opportunity here
2725589 from there it just happened it started in the store and ended outside everything else was a blur
2725590 you know it just happened theres no big thing about it
2725591 we see us getting closer and closer to the mark of the beast
2725592 go and pour out the bowls of the wrath of god on the earth
2725593 i cant do that how can i possibly ask someone to do something that i cant do myself theyve already given me permission to cut off the bar code which i did but theyre saying that i have to enforce the students to wear their cards which have bar codes
2725594 right now i have three or four people who have requested it for religious reasons
2725595 i think what they told me was it had to do with the mark of the beast
2725596 the only reason were trying it is these peoples religious beliefs and they dont want their pictures stored
2725597 getting closer and closer to the mark of the beast
2725598 they havent defined what the limits will be on the real id
2725599 at this point i think it is reasonable to say that tomorrow probably will come and go without that happening
2725600 we are in discussions with the north we continue trying to work with them on this question on a robust verification regime
2725601 but we arent at the point where we are satisfied with what they have put on the table thus far
2725602 unfortunately when we arrived on the scene there was nothing we could do

2725604 kilometres of fun spectacular limestone landscape pancake layered rocks mountain views and acres of beautiful scenery
2725605 navigating rutted tracks in and out of valleys will be part of your challenge and tour
2725606 you will be driving your quad bike amongst the famous waitomo landscape of rocky outcrops and through huge natural limestone tunnels

2725609 iraqis are combating terrorism with one hand and building a democratic state with the other and this is not an easy job
2725610 we have carried messages to all the countries we visited that iraq is in need of reconstruction in all fields including railways oil electricity bridges and housing
2725611 there can be no dialogue with the georgian leadership they are criminals
2725612 the charge sheet will be solid and musharraf will not be able to fight it
2725613 musharraf still has time it will be in his own interest if he resigns
2725614 we have far beyond the two thirds majority he should realise this
2725615 they have to concentrate on competition but its very tough
2725616 we know it is the olympic games and all of us sportsmen want everything to be normal
2725617 here in a sporting context and theyve confirmed their participation very much in the light of respect friendship athlete to athlete we have no reason to have any concerns on that
2725618 when the war is in your country at such a time it is very difficult for them for all of us
2725619 we are trying to say hey lets have a truce for at least the olympic games so we bring some peace to the world even for two weeks the timing couldnt be worse war is not great at any time but to have it on the first day of the olympic competition was pretty bad timing
2725620 i see all the nations get together i am very upset about it i wish everybody would be at peace especially during the olympics
2725621 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2725622 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2725623 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2725624 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2725625 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2725626 complete genocide putin also said georgia had effectively lost the right to rule the breakaway province an indication moscow could be preparing to fulfill south ossetians wish to be absorbed into russia

2725630 when hugh and elisabeth got married it was two great families coming together elisabeth was always at practice with us and her parents were always around its a shame to happen to anyone but to have it happen to todd he was such a great guy its a tragedy
2725631 i talked with my wife for an hour saturday because she had not left the states to come here and we talked about whether she should come
2725632 and shes a lot stronger than i am so she got on the plane you have to live your life you cant live your life in fear or anger you just send your prayers to the families and try to do what you set out to do and thats win the gold medal
2725633 yesterday at this time we were given horrific news about someone that we love and care about whose family was attacked
2725634 our knee jerk reactions were like any human beings would be we were upset we were angry we wanted to talk to our friends and family who are here or back home and figure out how we felt about everything
2725635 we had a team meeting as a male sport mens volleyball we tend to hide our feelings a lot but it definitely was a time where guys let out their feelings about the situation how we felt about hugh not being on the bench it was a time just for guys to open up and get their feelings off their chest and hopefully refocus on what we came here to do
2725636 id rather be sitting on the bench telling him what i think we should be doing and him telling me i dont think so rather than sitting where i am now
2725637 we knew they werent going to start the match without us
2725638 they dont have their coach on the court we talked to them and said we were sorry about what happened it breaks down your heart but they played well
2725639 i feel as a guy whos played 15 years and been married 11 and has two kids that im pretty much prepared for anything but nothing can prepare you for something like this
2725640 he just came to be in his incredible and vast glory and power
2725641 estava bem dif cil velejar com o vento mudando muito cometemos alguns erros e perdemos posi es mas velejamos bem em algumas situa es e nos recuperamos quando a coisa ficou feia ent o estar em sexto lugar bom

2725653 even tried to see if i could swing a tramp steamer but evidently they dont take passengers any longer
2725654 this is a little misleading there are plenty of opportunities to ride as a passenger on cargo ships
2725655 if they are deadlocked on the first ballot the delegates will be released from their pledges on later votes
2725656 the hillary camp really believes they can convince everybody that she is the best candidate to face mccain and she is
2725657 shell win those states shell win arkansas she will win florida thats the election
2725658 i have carried the states that a democrat must carry in order to win in november if you look at the electoral map anything is possible but it is more likely that the coalition i have put together is the winning coalition
2725659 we think we are in a strong position to make the affirmative argument why we are the best nominee going forward
2725660 the people who are more likely to be swing voters are the people who sen obama has had great difficulty with white blue collar voters non college educated voters who move from one side of the aisle to the other

2725685 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2725686 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2725687 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2725693 we will have to seek how to deal with the amarnath land issue we will definitely make efforts that it is resolved in a manner in which it does not hurt the sentiments of people of jammu as well as people of kashmir
2725694 will be held with whosoever it is necessary whether in jammu or kashmir
2725695 we will compensate the near and dear ones of those who have been killed those who have suffered grievous injuries will also be compensated
2725696 the prime minister has also said that it should continue as in the past
2725697 there should be no communalisation of the situation there have been some incidents but we will tackle
2725698 is done in a manner that it does not hurt sentiments
2725699 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2725700 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2725701 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2725702 es besteht bei den gasunternehmen der dringende verdacht dass es sich um eine missbr uchliche ausnutzung der marktstellung handelt
2725703 es wird bis ende des jahres dauern bis wir erste entscheidungen in einzelnen f lle bekanntgeben
2725704 missbr uche in der preisfindung werden identifiziert und so weit wie m glich abgebaut
2725705 ein missbr uchliches verhalten ist im stromsektor wesentlich schwerer nachzuweisen als im gassektor

2725710 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2725711 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2725712 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2725713 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2725714 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2725715 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2725716 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2725717 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2725718 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2725719 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2725720 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2725721 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2725722 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2725723 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2725724 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

2725733 the change is in the students who they are how they look and their backgrounds
2725734 they need opportunities for interactions both inside and outside of classrooms as long as students interact across groups both in classes and in situations of living working studying and socializing they can learn something different something more than what they would learn on a campus without those racial and ethnic differences

2725799 fans had heard he was going to watch former doctor who star catherine so they turned up in force complete with props
2725800 he was very charming and friendly with them during the interval but he was rightly disgusted when they disrupted her performance by singing the shows music and waving their sonic screwdrivers
2725801 catherine is a pro so she ignored them but david knew the only way to stop them was by getting up and leaving
2725802 as of today most of the city tskhinvali is controlled by russian peacekeeping forces
2725803 military commanders have made their decision to pull back from tskhinvali this morning
2725804 we deplore the dangerous and disproportionate actions by russian forces and we would be particularly troubled if these attacks are continuing now as the georgians are pulling back
2725805 it is my dearest hope that military action will stop immediately and that they will abstain in the name of their common christian inheritance from further clashes and violence
2725806 the georgian tanks fired at everything they saw including women and children

2725822 weve decided to do a five part mini series one big story that will run during one week
2725823 i wanted to make a really big noise about the show
2725824 torchwood really represents the essence of the channel its sexy action packed and a little bit subversive
2725825 so rumor has it that the bbc was unhappy and russell had to rush to write her out of series 3
2725826 personally id be very happy if they didnt add any more principle characters between jack ianto and gwen there are plenty of possible stories to tell for a season thats only having a five episode run

2725833 i wanted to go 4 03 i didnt know if i would
2725834 to be honest i didnt really feel that great and then going into the ready room i started getting chills up my body right then and there i was starting to get more and more excited i mean i was pretty emotional after that race and im pretty excited to have that first one under my belt
2725835 i wasnt comfortable after the first 200 after seeing everybody so close together
2725836 thats usually not how it as after the first 200 i think it made my breaststroke a lot stronger and at that point it was all adrenaline
2725837 i knew i had to go out fast in order to be in the race
2725838 if i was like a couple tenths slower on the back stroke i think i wouldve had a better shot i think that backstroke kind of took a lot out of me i did my best and i cant ask for anything else
2725839 i saw him after the race and he nodded and waved the american flag
2725840 its a pretty special feeling i waved and nodded my head back
2725841 at the moment i am not close to concluding any transfer deal
2725842 maybe next week something can happen but for now we have to focus on the champions league and forget about transfers because it is a big target for us
2725843 i do not rule out anybody completely at the moment
2725844 if we were in advanced negotiations with anybody else i would say no so everything is possible right now

2725857 as the resplendent olympic flame lit up the night over the birds nest the world not only saw a modern china that embraces a 5000 year old ancient history but a fully confident strong and wise china
2725858 this rare night in beijing will become an important page in the history of world civilisation
2725859 the beijing olympic games is a new starting point for human civilisation to move toward the future now the expectation is for a more open china to make greater contributions to humanity
2725860 the pride of beijing is that we have fulfilled the commitments made to the international community for a successful beijing games we are also proud of beijing because beijing has not let down the expectations of 1 3 billion chinese
2725861 the 100 year olympic dream is the dream of a strong china and as the dream of a strong nation is realised so is the dream of the olympics
2725862 after the build up i was a bit disappointed it lacked heart and soul and was a bit too robotic
2725863 the olympics is about participation the money spent on such extravagant ceremonies could be used to support countries that cant afford to send athletes to the games
2725864 it should be used for something that will have permanent value rather than just shooting it up into the sky
2725865 wow these songs you posted here are just amazing thanks for the friend request thanks very much if you ever want me to mix or master something for you just ask my rates are stupidly low sometimes
2725866 sure i can put it out digitally download only but i am not really focusing on my label and i am planning no cd releases
2725867 i would love to do this work for you but this is not something i do for free and i get the impression that you are seeking a label who will support the project financially i cannot do that so if you are looking to hire someone to mix and master your release id be really into chatting about that but if you are seeking a label i cannot help you i do release stuff ive been hired to work on when i really dig the results and the working relationship has been mutually satisfying obviously i cannot even discuss such a deal until the work is done as it would be absurd for me to agree to release something i have not heard i would never talk about releasing something i havent even heard hope you understand so if you seek a label you must seek elsewhere im not signing artists right now and will not likely be doing so unless i can secure funding for my label and if you were thinking i would mix without asking for payment im sorry if i misled you it was not my intention i am always available to artists whose music i like but i never work for free everything on my label is owned by the artist themselves and i was paid for any work i did on the recordings
2725868 but i never work for free everything on my label is owned by the artist themselves and i was paid for any work i did on the recordings

2726031 we have to be happy to come back from being three goals down against one of the best teams in the world
2726032 this is a recurring theme with us we take a 3 4 goal lead then ease up before breaking the opponent
2726033 but its quite something we could bring this back for a tie and i think well grow stronger by each game
2726034 i think the main thing was defensively we played pretty well
2726035 we had a couple of lapses where we kind of let them get back into the game but we had four quarters of good defences and thats what its going to take to beat some of these better teams
2726036 everywhere we go everyone sings youre not famous anymore it just shows other teams havent forgotten about us
2726037 it stems from jealousy of the great 1970s side more recently the jealousy comes from how devilishly attractive leeds fans are

2726046 crime generally has got to be taken seriously not only in antigua and barbuda but in the caribbean because we do have a challenge in the caribbean as it relates to criminal activity
2726047 as leaders and as people we have to zero in on it in a real way and to find ways and means of combating it this region comparatively speaking has always been considered a very peaceful and safe region of the world we do not want anything to develop which would change that outlook on the part of the international community so it behooves all of us to be able to work at the regional level and domestically to deal with this situation

2726090 i think bullying is a strong word all types of bullying affects each person in totally different ways
2726091 i was never physically bullied but verbally bullied by other kids at school
2726092 bullies feel like they want to cut them down because that makes them feel better about themselves
2726093 a lot of the times people are bullied because they dare to be different its like the tall poppy syndrome
2726094 bullies are often people who feel a little bit inadequate thats a big contributor to bullying
2726095 natalie is a great example of someone who wasnt going to let that get them down
2726096 there was a time four years ago when i thought i was going to stop acting

2726107 would be a timely shot in the arm for the scots economy
2726108 to be positive and seize the opportunities when they appear
2726109 scotlands future significantly depends on developments such as this and it should be warmly welcomed by politicians and the general public as well as the business community
2726110 right now no one should need any more convincing of the overwhelming economic case

2726142 why did you doubt my love why did you doubt my mercy
2726143 the director really gave us the go ahead to become very creative in this
2726144 the eye patches took me four 12 hour days it was a huge prep for me
2726145 in the wizard of oz the computers wound up removing dorothys slippers from the shot entirely because they sparkled and were different on every frame we wound up having to put them back into the shot
2726146 it was half satisfying and there was a bit of sorrow because it wasnt the winning goal
2726147 i think this result is great for our first time at the olympics
2726148 be prepared for him to score a lot of goals against every team
2726149 we started strong and finished strong and thats what matters
2726150 in any sport thats going to be hard hopefully this is the start of a lot more to come
2726151 its been four years and weve had four coaches and money issues
2726152 but this is the closest team ive ever been a part of and it showed at times out there
2726153 fuck off everyone im an indonesian and my business is way more important than anybody elses
2726154 you know youve been in indonesia too long if it has become exciting to see if you can get on the lift elevator before anybody else can get off
2726155 transitions of authority mark the end of a challenging and successful mission
2726156 its also a time to reflect on the gravity and breadth of your units impact on our success in iraq for the incoming unit its an official assumption of a vital mission and an important mental shift from a mindset of preparation to one of execution
2726157 we are critical in assisting our fighting forces as they reposition themselves to the battlefield
2726158 we also are setting the condition for iraqis to better themselves by training the iraqis how to build and sustain supplies so they can support their military logistical forces better in the future
2726159 the troops of 3rd squad are well versed in different specialties which works as an advantage if anything goes wrong
2726160 these guys have done on the fly this and on the fly that everybody knows something about something
2726161 when i volunteered for something for an infantry brigade combat team as a chemical or communications sergeant i though id end up in a tactical operations center

2726166 the indian blind cricket team like the mainstream one is always falling just short of winning the world cup also we need to see more people from this state participating at the international level
2726167 all of us here at cricinfo make a livelihood out of the game so we thought it was time to give something back what better way to do that than supporting and encouraging a disadvantaged but equally important faction of society who show genuine interest in the game
2726168 we cant play after 6 in the evening because it gets too dark for even the partially sighted to see and we generally coordinate on the field through the sounds of the keeper and bowler
2726169 cricket makes sense for blind people because we get to meet people interact with them which develops our speaking skills and most importantly it builds the posture
2726170 the association of cricket for blind in india is the organization that looks after all the funding accomodation and travel arrangements for us when we go for the world cups but bcci is unwilling to support or even recognize the establishment even the world blind cricket council is recognized by icc
2726171 we can only hope that of the 100 odd boys we would have trained by the time all four camps are complete we would have found some more budding talent which would finally be able to bring the world cup to india

2726173 government should place few if any restrictions on scientific research and development
2726174 arctic deer live on islands in canadas arctic region they search for food by moving over ice from island to island during the course of a year their habitat is limited to areas warm enough to sustain the plants on which they feed and cold enough at least some of the year for the ice to cover the sea separating the islands allowing the deer to travel over it unfortunately according to reports from local hunters the deer populations are declining since these reports coincide with recent global warming trends that have caused the sea ice to melt we can conclude that the decline in arctic deer populations is the result of deer being unable to follow their age old migration patterns across the frozen sea

2726179 as we wrap up another adventure filled year and turn our attentions to all those year end activities and festivities that can be so all encompassing in many ways i think its also important to once again take a moment to remind ourselves that we should be very grateful that we have all been exceedingly fortunate to be a part of a
2726180 this is not the end it is not even the beginning of the end but it is perhaps the end of the beginning
2726181 kindly stop attempting to open nightclubs away from the main strip area with the same business model as those on the strip area you cant compete the overall market that keeps tao body english pure and the others open wont be coming down your way

2726183 my one regret in life is that i missed out on seeing him before his death
2726184 it was quite a good performance by the lads and with the result going in our favour its a great way to start
2726185 as the pre season has gone on i think we have played better but we didnt play really well today
2726186 in the first 15 minutes we didnt get out of our half but the pleasing thing was that the back four looked solid and they headed everything
2726187 we could have cleared our lines better but as the game went on we got more into it

2726189 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2726190 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2726191 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2726192 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2726193 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2726194 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2726195 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2726196 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2726197 tengo las mejores sensaciones me siento orgulloso y muy contento de poder participar en la liga de campeones juegue o no desde el primer d a el t cnico nos ha inculcado que el partido contra el wisla es una final el trabajo de la pretemporada ha sido bueno y esperamos llegar en las mejores condiciones

2726204 where is your back yard we have been lookin g for thirty seven years for a storage site for nuclear waste we give you the rights to use the very sustantialradioactive energy in the waste for the nexet 300 000 years but let us know right away we have already loaded 675 amtrak cars to bring to your place and we have a bunch of us cities to pass through before the media gets wind of the transfer
2726205 the demand for green collar jobs is really exploding especially as the cost of energy continues to climb
2726206 students need to start thinking about developing skills that will give them an edge for these types of careers that did not even exist until recently
2726207 anything to try and cut the cost of running your car is worth it

2726209 vintage whisky seems to work best on older cars i put nothing but the best in mine
2726210 we are known as whisky island with seven working distilleries
2726211 if our idea can be refined properly we could have everyone here running cars on it
2726212 i must admit i had my doubts but it actually works
2726213 were experimenting at the moment its far from perfected but were working on it
2726214 we know whisky makes cars go the question now is will we be allowed to distil our own and instead of drinking it just pour it into our vehicles
2726215 its all about cost but with the way things are going whisky may end up being cheaper than petrol
2726216 islay gives a lot to the exchequer every year and we get very little back in return surely the chancellor could grant us some leeway to develop whisky fuel
2726217 its a miracle were both alive and dont even have broken bones
2726218 when i got up a man near enough rugby tackled me and told me i shouldnt move he then hugged me to keep me warm while other people put coats around me im so grateful to everyone who came to our help

2726228 ive overcome this big step of getting into the ring for the first time and hopefully ill continue to improve im in a tough draw but ive got to stick to it and hopefully get through
2726229 we are optimistic the donkeys will be back on the beach before too long we are inviting people to contact us to take over the contract to run the donkey rides which are part of the beach scene
2726230 the donkeys are very important to the town they have been a part of margate and a feature on the beach since before the war and its sad they are not there
2726231 i used to be what they call a donkey girl between 1966 and 1967 i was 13 at the time and earning half a crown a day walking the donkeys up and down the beach for the visitors
2726232 they were run then by a man known as donkey brown he had 20 odd donkeys at the time which was pretty much the heyday for them
2726233 more recently we had just two donkeys on the beach and now they are gone too
2726234 its very sad but we are determined to see them back again the donkeys that worked the beach most recently are now living out their lives in a grassy field somewhere
2726235 weve already had interest in the prospect of bringing the donkeys back to our beaches from summer 2009 which is excellent news

2726243 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future
2726244 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2726245 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2726246 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2726247 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2726248 we dont have any simulator with that kind of possibility for learning a circuit
2726249 in my case its only the videos some pictures i can use i had a friend at that race the recent f3 and gt meeting who did one lap with a normal road car with a video camera in the front just to know the circuit
2726250 for sure until you run with an f1 car there its not very useful anything you do because you will change completely your opinion and your feelings
2726251 we will need to maximise the friday practice when we arrive there because it will be the only way to improve
2726252 the circuit seems very very well prepared theres obviously some work to do before f1 arrives but its not like a normal street track
2726253 its something more it seems wide it seems like an american type of street circuit
2726254 i think it will be a nice and interesting grand prix not only the race but also the atmosphere will be quite different
2726255 i like to discover new tracks since i was a child driving in a kart i always learned quickly to drive on unknown tracks
2726256 ive had a look at some onboard footage of the track and will be working with the team over the break to prepare for the event
2726257 from the footage the track looks amazing i love street circuits but this circuit looks extremely fast and unforgiving in some places
2726258 as a driver its always fun to come to a new circuit i really enjoy driving at new places and feel confident i can pick up new circuits quickly
2726259 youve got another two loads of laundry to do stuff to write and the lawn aint going to mow itself
2726260 i think the basic idea was that we all know what a weather map means for understanding weather we all know what a traffic congestion map looks like so it just struck us why isnt there something in the area of safety
2726261 i think there is citizen appetite for this kind of information

2726266 last year in new jersey 12 bikers bicyclists were killed in motor vehicle crashes so far this year and were at the middle of the summer july 15 we have already lost 11 bicyclists in almost every case the bicycle was doing something that put them at significant risk
2726267 its not their right to assault a cyclist or to run a cyclist off the road because they get impatient
2726268 its just a bike ride but the cops are treating it like a war
2726269 but apparently there is an element there that doesnt necessarily want to work with us
2726270 we look at them as just a bunch of radical bikers
2726271 where once the cyclists were courteous observers of the rules of the road the newcomers transformed rides into disruptive often dangerous events
2726272 look im not excusing what that cop did because it was wrong
2726273 the problem with these guys is that they provoke you
2726274 theres something about being in the car that is kind of anonymous its a veil to hide behind and people seem to like to get their aggression out on cyclists

2726283 are democrats really prepared to close the government in order to stop drilling
2726284 i think the american people would find that a suicidal strategy
2726285 so republicans are going to tell seniors youre being squeezed by high gas prices and high grocery prices and now were going to cut off your social security checks
2726286 said jennifer crider a spokeswoman for the democratic congressional campaign committee the house democrats campaign arm
2726287 as far as im concerned those bans end sept 30 and if they end on sept 30 fuel prices will head back down on oct 1
2726288 i want to see the most forward looking energy policy for alternatives
2726289 if in order to get that you have to compromise and have the states sign off on whether they want drilling or not maybe thats the price we are going to pay to get it but to have an up or down vote on drilling where does that leave us it leaves us in the same place republicans have put us in after eight years of their policies

2726296 this was not disconnected from the rest of his career
2726297 from the new yorker to shrek the art of william steig
2726298 steig loved children he loved to write he loved to draw
2726299 he said the secret to his success was that he never really grew up
2726300 because he didnt like to draw the same characters multiple times he liked to draw something then move on
2726301 shrek is an anti hero and steig always said the perfect hero is a flawed hero
2726302 wrote notes to the producers which i put in the museum show sharing ideas he had for the script

2726312 two members of the commission brought up the fact that they still were not convinced that the president had been shot from the sixth floor window of the texas book depository
2726313 these members failed to understand the trajectory of the slugs that killed the president he stated he felt this point would be discussed further but of course would represent no problem
2726314 the proper question for catholics to ask is not can i vote for him
2726315 what is a proportionate reason when it comes to the abortion issue
2726316 its the kind of reason we will be able to explain with a clean heart to the victims of abortion when we meet them face to face in the next life which we most certainly will if were confident that these victims will accept our motives as something more than an alibi then we can proceed
2726317 when you look at his opposition to the born alive infants protection act in illinois and the partial birth abortion ban which many mass attending catholics view as bans on infanticide obamas more extreme than any other democratic presidential candidate
2726318 i spend a lot of time with catholic intellectuals and no matter how liberal they are and inclined to support democrats they speak with vehemence about the exclusion of caseys father from the 1992 convention
2726319 they dont accept any of the explanations i think it would be a dramatic act of historical rectification that would resonate with catholics
2726320 why shouldnt i vote for the candidate who feels more passionately and speaks more credibly about economic fairness for the average family who will be a true steward of the environment and who will treat the immigrant family with respect
2726321 by asking the iraqis to take responsibility for their future and to invest in their own country
2726322 let me be clear we are well over five years into a war in a country that had nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks
2726323 now think for a moment about what we could have done with the hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars that weve spent in iraq we could have made historic investments in alternative energy to create millions of american jobs we could have headed off 4 a gallon gas
2726324 tax cut after tax cut for the wealthiest americans who dont need them and didnt even ask for them

2726329 i dont have to worry about listening to beatnik poetry or some political ideology that makes me want to vomit
2726330 the first test for vice president is could he be president and rob portman passes that test with flying colors
2726331 he is very strong on domestic issues due to his experience and the different positions hes held and it certainly would help in ohio having an ohio vice president on the ticket
2726332 he went off and voted with minority leader harry reid on the democratic substitute and i wrote him the now famous letter
2726333 i would like to apologize to you for assuming that your private assurances to me regarding your desire to cooperate in our efforts to negotiate bipartisan lobbying reform legislation were sincere
2726334 that was one incident where he thought i had undercut him i had a completely different view of it
2726335 we had to take tough votes sometimes against the majority of our own party in order to preserve the coalition
2726336 when colleagues disagree on an issue the notion that its cause for attack is mistaken i felt very strongly that the guest worker program was not in the best interests of the country i voted against it he voted for it i respect senator mccains right to take positions different than mine what i dont do is abuse his integrity for doing so
2726337 we can disagree on issues without trying to tear down the other persons reputation or attack his character
2726338 this is a person who has engaged and energized millions of americans who had never been engaged in the political process
2726339 senator mccain continues to be stubbornly committed to the bush administration position of an indefinite military presence in iraq despite the fact that the iraqi government is calling for a timeline despite the fact that the iraqis are sitting on tens of billions in oil surplus while our economy is struggling at home despite the impact on our troops and despite the deteriorating situation in afghanistan
2726340 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure

2726356 the all party meet recently convened by the prime minister manmohan singh is an insult to the majority hindu community of the country as the resolution had no mention of the giving back of the land
2726357 the agitation is not restricted to jammu alone the nation would come to standstill on august 13
2726358 the delegation is bound to be a failure with parties like pdp nc and samajwadi party on board do you think that with anti hindu parties like cpi and cpi m one can have a solution to the amarnath issue
2726359 sixty six years back on august 9 1942 mahatma gandhi gave the slogan of
2726360 do or die which served as an ultimatum to the british to quit india today the time has come to give another call of do or die to maintain the integrity of the nation
2726361 as shyama prasad mukherjee had said about j amp k in 1950s there cannot be do vidhan two laws do pradhan two prime ministers and do nishan two emblems similarly we have to remind the government that there could not be two sets of rules in one country the allocation of land to the shrine board was withdrawn under pressure of subversive elements this has to be countered tooth and nail
2726362 the composition of all party delegation sent by the centre gives the game away it has on board people like leaders of national conference nc and peoples democratic party pdp who are responsible for the crisis
2726363 had mukherjee not made the sacrifice one would not have been able to fly the tricolour there in j amp k this mufti mohammad sayeed who became the chief minister would not have become the chief minister
2726364 this is a question of nations integrity and stability this is not jammus struggle it is whole indias struggle
2726365 today terrorism is the biggest threat in the country and it is growing rapidly our land is being snatched from us and destroyed after abolishing pota the government has remained a mute spectator to acts of terror
2726366 simi was behind the recent bomb blasts in jaipur bangalore and ahmedabad but the tribunal lifted the ban from the terrorist organisation because the government did not give proofs to the tribunal justice geeta mittal said that those evidences should be presented by the government was not placed before the tribunal

2726402 i wanted to go 4 03 i didnt know if i would
2726403 to be honest i didnt really feel that great and then going into the ready room i started getting chills up my body right then and there i was starting to get more and more excited i mean i was pretty emotional after that race and im pretty excited to have that first one under my belt
2726404 i wasnt comfortable after the first 200 after seeing everybody so close together
2726405 thats usually not how it as after the first 200 i think it made my breaststroke a lot stronger and at that point it was all adrenaline
2726406 i knew i had to go out fast in order to be in the race
2726407 if i was like a couple tenths slower on the back stroke i think i wouldve had a better shot i think that backstroke kind of took a lot out of me i did my best and i cant ask for anything else

2726425 esto es una total irresponsabilidad por parte de la gobernadora quien en su momento nos dijo que la situaci n se iba a solucionar y evidentemente nos dieron cualquier cosa nada real diciendo que deb amos presentarnos en una fecha pero ya se venci por ejemplo nos ten amos que presentar algunos en econom a y all no saben nada o en obras p blicas donde tampoco saben nada en el tribunal de cuentas tampoco as que da la sensaci n que est n complotados para no pagar evidentemente
2726426 la gobernadora tuvo la posibilidad de arreglar nuestro inconveniente pero ya se vencieron los plazos para que nos den una respuesta y algunos con los que se hab an comprometido p blicamente y por escrito en pagarles algo fueron a ver si pod an cobrar y no cobraron absolutamente nada
2726427 a mi me dieron una documentaci n que dec a que estaba parel d a 4 que fue el lunes pasado estaba la promesa de pago y resulta que fui para all y desconocen el papel desconocen la firma de quien firm y nadie se hizo cargo de nada
2726428 solo tenemos promesas y nada m s esto es un manoseo y una falta de respeto hacia los trabajadores independientes

2726446 it was absolutely a huge explosion actually a number of explosions
2726447 it woke me up around 4 am and heard large explosions that continued for about 40 minutes
2726448 it hit the post hit the goalie and i dont think it would have gone in
2726449 i think the goalie was getting back so i tapped it in from three yards it was the goal of the season

2726455 but most of those competitions are mainly for the doubles

2726463 i urge the russian federation georgia and the separatist south ossetian and abkhaz administrations to immediately enter into a cease fire in order to stop hostilities
2726464 the use of violence contradicts the principles of the council of europe and violates commitments to peaceful settlement of conflicts which are fundamental for achieving the aims of the organisation
2726465 the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia must be respected and all actors on the ground have an obligation to respect the principles of distinction and proportionality as laid down by international law
2726466 i deeply deplore the military action taken by the russian federation towards georgia
2726467 the international community should adequately assess the events in south ossetia and i am of the opinion that this calls for a coordinated and operative action at all formats those of eu nato edso and un applying all the opportunities of the governmental and non governmental sector for the facilitation and stabilizing of the dialogue i have instructed the nato permanent representative of latvia to address the secretary general with a request to summon in the nearest future the session of the nato permanent council in order to assess the impact of this conflict upon the alliance and upon the security interests of its member countries in response to the repeated appeals by the georgian side to revert to negotiations in order to reduce the tension and to resolve the conflict i am calling upon the russian side to cease all military action which could even more destabilise the situation in the region
2726468 the russian offensive against and in georgia is an act of aggression that is incompatible with international law and fundamental principles of security and cooperation in europe
2726469 we and russia will have to live with the consequences of russias use of force for a long time to come
2726470 the justification given by russia is that it is protecting russian nationals but the obligation to protect people irrespective of their nationality lies with the state in which those individuals are located
2726471 attempts to apply such a doctrine have plunged europe into war in the past and that is why it is so important that this doctrine is emphatically dismissed the same doctrine can be equally dangerous in other situations
2726472 we did not accept military intervention by milosevics serbia in other former yugoslav states on the grounds of protecting serbian passport holders
2726473 this is already the fourth visit you pay to our country which has made you the u s president paying the most visits to china in the presidential terms
2726474 this has fully demonstrated the great importance mr president has attached to the development of sino u s relations
2726475 no matter what kind of changes take place in the cross strait relations our stance of adhering to the one china principle and opposing taiwan independence secessionist activities will never change and cannot be changed
2726476 i would like to express my heartfelt sympathy to you and the family of the victims over this unfortunate incident
2726477 we started investigation on this case immediately and will handle it seriously in accordance with law we will keep contact with the u s side and inform you of the new developments
2726478 nella vita ci sar sempre un bast che ti far soffrire ma sar lunica persona che riuscirai ad amare veramente
2726479 all attacks by the russian military including against civilian establishments have to stop immediately the russian federation must withdraw all its military forces from georgia without delay
2726480 only ending of the hostilities can create suitable conditions for peace negotiations
2726481 all members of the un sc with the russian federation as a notable exception called for an immediate end to the hostilities
2726482 russia has shown with its actions again that it is not suitable as a peacekeeper in this region
2726483 it is ridiculous to ask us to do this because georgia will never use force against its own people as simple as that
2726484 het gaat erom sponsoring te vertalen in strategische marketing en uiteindelijk in een meetbaar effect op de omzet

2726489 trinity was an innocent and random victim of identity theft apparently so were four or five other county residents whose names and addresses were stolen and used as addresses on drug packages
2726490 however trinity and our family have not been treated as victims of a crime instead our home was invaded our two beloved labrador retrievers are dead my mother in law and i were tied up for nearly two hours
2726491 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
2726492 we could have gotten the mayor to put the dogs away and consent to a search
2726493 i would have let them stay in a yard by themselves with those dogs
2726494 it really upsets me to think that i dont feel safe in my home if they were to shoot our dog amber i would be outraged
2726495 he was hunted down and shot in the back while he fled
2726496 they didnt deserve to die they dont deserve to be blamed for their deaths
2726497 all i could see was the blood and the tissue of the dogs
2726498 this has happened before and without oversight it will happen again
2726499 with declining business and consumer confidence having a material effect on our economy growth rates are becoming dangerously shallow and our economy needs every boost it can get at the moment

2726501 would be a timely shot in the arm for the scots economy
2726502 to be positive and seize the opportunities when they appear
2726503 scotlands future significantly depends on developments such as this and it should be warmly welcomed by politicians and the general public as well as the business community
2726504 right now no one should need any more convincing of the overwhelming economic case
2726505 you would be a beautiful lady if you didnt follow in your past and acting like a slut whore and think you are gods gift to all men grow up and act like a mother and not like a bitch female dog in heat but you got it in ur blood because so was ur real mother a whore

2726531 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2726532 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2726533 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2726534 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office
2726535 cant drive our suvs heat our homes or eat what we want
2726536 americans will have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation

2726538 i think this might hurt chinas image in the world but i dont think itll disturb the olympics per se
2726539 to tell you the truth this is really a shock because theres so much security here
2726540 there are guards everywhere and cameras so im not sure how something like this could happen
2726541 row is not between jammu hindus and kashmiri muslims as branded by some section of the media but rather a fight of nationalist forces against separatist elements
2726542 you can see hindus sikhs and even muslims out on roads to support the movement
2726543 this public outcry is to throw out each and every separatist out of this country so that people of jammu and kashmir and rest of india could shun fear forever and live in peace and tranquillity

2726573 what obama voted for was a budget resolution that would have allowed most of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire in particular the resolution would allow the 25 percent tax bracket to return to its pre 2001 level of 28 percent that bracket kicks in at 32 550 for an individual or 65 100 for a married couple but as those of you who have filled out a 1040 know thats not actually how income taxes work we dont pay taxes on our total earnings we pay them based on our taxable income the urban brookings tax policy centers eric toder told factcheck org that people with taxable income of 32 000 would have a total income greater than that in 2008 anyone filing taxes with single status would be entitled to a standard deduction of 5 450 as well as a personal exemption of 3 500 so to have a taxable income high enough to reach the 25 percent bracket an individual would need to earn at least 41 500 in total income while a married couple would need a combined income of at least 83 000
2726574 certainly obamas votes indicate a willingness to raise taxes and obama has not been shy about saying explicitly that he will raise some taxes
2726575 campaign aides to senator obama today called the charge that he voted for tax hikes on people making only 32 000 a year quote bogus they circulated an analysis stating that the resolution that obama had voted for would not have increase taxes on single taxpayer making less than 41 500 a year in total income
2726576 vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year
2726577 factcheck org a nonpartisan web site said the vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year the 32 000 figure it said was the amount of taxable income those people had
2726578 would have allowed tax rates to return to pre 2001 levels meaning that an individual with taxable income of about 32 000 would have faced a tax increase
2726579 at issue is obamas vote on a non binding budget resolution in march that called for president bushs tax cuts to expire such a step would have allowed tax rates to return to pre 2001 levels meaning that an individual with taxable income of about 32 000 would have faced a tax increase taxable income is whats left after taxpayers account for deductions
2726580 the senate voted to stand up for working families in illinois and throughout the nation
2726581 today the senate voted to stand up for working families in illinois and throughout the nation by rejecting the failed policies of the bush administration and moving our country back on track to fiscal discipline our country needs change and this budget is an important step in the right direction i commend house and senate leaders for working together to move this legislation through congress

2726585 obama statement on the senates passage of the fy 2009 budget
2726586 obamas transformation if you go by his campaign so far would mean higher income taxes higher social security taxes higher investment taxes higher corporate taxes massive new domestic spending and a healthcare plan that perhaps could be the next step to a full scale single payer system is that what most americans want someone who will fulfill a democratic policy wish list
2726587 obamas proposal would impose social security taxes on income above 250 000 per year he would continue to exempt income between 102 000 and 250 000 from social security taxes
2726588 i would roll back the bush tax cuts for those making over 250 000
2726589 are frequently subject to the highest individual income tax rates
2726590 changes in the individual income tax affect most businesses in the united states that is because taxes on business earnings are often paid through the individual income tax when passed through to business owners the business income from sole proprietorships farm proprietorships partnerships s corporations etc is all taxed at the owners individual income tax rates this year 34 million business owners are expected to receive this type of income and pay tax on this income through the individual income tax these businesses are typically small and often entrepreneurial in nature and a source of innovation and risk taking in the economy moreover these business owners are frequently subject to the highest individual income tax rates
2726591 sen obama wants to raise the long term capital gains rate for families making more than 250 000 to around 20 percent or somewhat higher but not above the 28 percent level it reached during the reagan presidency an obama economic adviser says the same rate would apply to most dividend income for these investors
2726592 individual income and tax data by state and size of adjusted gross income tax year 2006
2726593 what we ought to tax is dirty energy like coal and to a lesser extent natural gas
2726594 and i found this fascinating maria that on the issue of taxes he looked to insulate himself by saying that if in fact economic conditions justify the fact that it might harm the economy he might be willing to hold off some of his tax increases when he takes office in january lets take a listen to barack obama
2726595 some of those you could possibly defer but i think the basic principle of restoring fairness to our economy and encouraging bottom up economic growth is important so heres what we know we know that over the last decade or so that more than half of the economic growth has been captured by the top one percent of u s citizens that means the other 99 percent have seen their effective incomes go down that is not a recipe for long term economic growth
2726596 even though senator obamas plan eliminates individual income taxes for seniors with incomes less than 50 000 his plan would raise taxes for almost 10 million senior households over a third of the total not shown in table on average seniors would face a tax increase of about 2 percent of income

2726598 rely most on the stable flow of income that dividends provide
2726599 most debate over whether to extend the reduced rates on dividends and capital gains has focused on the tax benefits of these cuts to high income taxpayers what has been largely ignored is the impact these tax policies have on corporations decisions on how best to distribute their income to shareholders including senior citizens who rely most on the stable flow of income that dividends provide a recent tax foundation analysis illustrated that a large number of those benefiting from dividends are seniors and those on the verge of retirement see www taxfoundation org a further analysis of these seniors earning dividends reveals that lower income seniors who file tax returns depend more heavily on dividend income than high income seniors

2726632 a community based popularity website with an emphasis on technology
2726633 i wondered if it could really be true and if so how without being accused of spamming i began to add friends based on the articles i read however my email inbox became a minefield of shouts requesting that i digg my new found friends submissions

2726642 das spiel hat gezeigt wie ausgeglichen wir besetzt sind wir waren sehr konzentriert und haben unser spiel durchgezogen
2726643 es hat spa gemacht wir wollten in der ersten viertelstunde das spiel entscheiden um sp ter nicht in schwierigkeiten zu kommen

2726651 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2726652 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2726653 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2726654 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2726655 it has warmed my heart to read your well thought out and written articles
2726656 as i was telling you today people have short memories
2726657 please stop providing a forum for that crackpot bill post his schtick is so tired
2726658 i spent 16 months and several thousand dollars researching the topic of my book deceit beach
2726659 if government itself wont keep its promises then we have come to a pretty sorry state
2726660 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2726661 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2726662 the government of sudan informed unamid of those who were responsible for the attacks and asked it unamid whether it would accept it sudan to participate in hunting for the perpetrators and get back the equipment and arms taken
2726663 the sudanese government does not go ahead and investigate the suspects since they have a lead
2726664 the government of sudan is absolutely handicapped the mandate of unamid does not give a green light to sudan to carry out any activity in an area that is controlled by unamid the un has put tight restrictions on us
2726665 a tough day really because we were looking good when i jumped in the car i think something may have been starting to happen turning right the car was quite loose through the carousel and the kink very loose there turning left the car was actually quite good we had a great pit stop strategy and i think we had a faster car than david brabham but then the left rear suspension broke and that was it its a shame for everybody luis did a fantastic job at the beginning of my stint i actually thought i had a puncture or something because the car was acting quite weird but with the suspension breaking maybe it sort of explains the situation where i was struggling when i jumped in the car something was starting to break it is just one of those days i think today could have been another podium finish and a potential win but we will just have to wait for mosport
2726666 its a sad day for us we had a great weekend until the last 30 minutes the car was fantastic for me on my first two stints adrian did a great job qualifying yesterday and was driving the car very well in the race unfortunately the suspension gave up when we were looking pretty good for our first win it is really disappointing for all the team but we have to keep digging
2726667 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2726668 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2726669 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2726670 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2726671 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2726672 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2726673 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2726674 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2726675 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2726676 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2726677 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2726678 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2726679 a number of people have started to leave but a number of people will stay on to make sure the site is in a perfect condition when we leave
2726680 at 2 4pm we will have a main camp meeting about where we go from here in the context of kingsnorth people are really keen to come and keep the campaign going
2726681 we take this really seriously we are not going to just abandon a field to the rubbish
2726682 following the airstrikes tskhuinvali is virtually obliterated in these conditions our forces have relocated and assumed new positions
2726683 well there are just so many avenues to take with the company and i hope i can learn from your experience and skills that will propel me into a higher management position in five years
2726684 it seems like he was in a psychology class and not in a law course
2726685 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2726686 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2726687 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2726688 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2726689 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2726690 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2726691 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2726692 who are open to doing something on the production side
2726693 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2726694 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2726695 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2726696 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2726697 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2726698 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2726699 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2726700 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2726701 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2726702 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2726703 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2726704 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2726705 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2726706 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2726707 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2726708 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2726709 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2726710 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2726711 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2726712 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2726713 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2726714 nu even naar china want daar is eh ja ook weer
2726715 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2726716 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2726717 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2726718 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2726719 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2726720 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2726721 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2726722 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2726723 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2726724 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2726725 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2726726 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2726727 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2726728 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2726729 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2726730 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

2726735 all quotes attributed to me on imao are made up including this one
2726736 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and he did despair for in his omniscience he did know that his creations had but three fifths of the splendor of that which would be imao
2726737 that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through jesus christ
2726738 but and if that servant say in his heart my lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens and to eat and drink and to be drunken the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him and at an hour when he is not aware and will cut him in sunder and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers
2726739 and i saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he doth judge and make war
2726740 blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years
2726741 and when the thousand years are expired satan shall be loosed out of his prison and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth gog and magog to gather them together to battle the number of whom is as the sand of the sea
2726742 nevertheless we according to his promise look for a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness
2726743 and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful
2726744 and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the begining and the end i will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely
2726745 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2726746 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2726747 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2726748 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2726749 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2726750 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2726751 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2726752 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2726753 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2726754 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2726755 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2726756 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2726757 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2726758 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2726759 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2726760 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2726761 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2726762 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2726763 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2726764 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

2726770 but what things were gain to me those i counted but loss for christ yea doubtless and i count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that i may win christ

2726772 brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus
2726773 let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded god shall reveal even this unto you
2726774 for many walk of whom i have told you often and now tell you even weeping that they are the enemies of the cross of christ whose end is destruction whose god is there belly and whose glory is in their shame who mind earthly things

2726796 its about justin and he couldnt be in a better situation right now he loves it here and you can just see hes joking around with the guys he fits in and thats the bottom line
2726797 i think it will be the same old traditional ohio state football
2726798 sometimes it could be very subtle changes and sometimes it could be major changes were looking at a lot of different things
2726799 we really have high expectations for what he can contribute
2726800 its really fun because i get to move around and not just play one position
2726801 its fun catching the ball out of the backfield and having space to move with it
2726802 if i were a defensive coach i would like to see beanie at a split back and not running downhill at me
2726803 every time hes not in the i id be happy if i was a defensive coach so i dont want to make the defensive coaches happy
2726804 before we can put him on the field hes got to prove that hes not going to fumble the ball or not going to make an errant pass or something so well see how things work out
2726805 its a challenge and a responsibility weve got to take
2726806 different defenses are built on different types of personnel but this is how i want to play if i can
2726807 sometimes you dont have the ability to do that personnel wise but if i had my preference this is what i would want to do
2726808 by the middle of the season he was playing like a veteran
2726809 someones going to be tired someones going to have a little more energy than the other guy so we have to push each other every day that were out there
2726810 when you have guys who are willing to discipline each other without taking it personally thats when you have great teams
2726811 then with the athletic ability and just their knowledge as young as they are they have great knowledge of the game theres no way we cant be one of the best secondaries in the league i truly believe that
2726812 beijing has invested more effort and more resources into the environment than any other olympic host city before and i think the diversity of measures here that have been taken have been very impressive
2726813 in the areas of particle matter water resources management water quality there is significant room for further development and finally the question is will beijing continue to invest in its public transport infrastructure and i think that will be a big test for the long term impact of the games
2726814 even if you were the worst carbon emitter in the world if you wrote a huge check you could claim to be carbon neutral
2726815 im really glad its getting warm and not cold an ice age would be really bad
2726816 species cant adapt or keep up in an evolutionary sense because everything is happening so fast
2726817 the changes are all happening faster than the models had predicted
2726818 for us the implication is that the state is moving right up toward the limit for pm 10 so how much more development is going to be permissible in this area
2726819 if theres an issue on these things they deq will review it
2726820 people are not accepting of current gasoline prices and that is a huge political force nobody can ignore
2726821 but at same time there are many other terribly important things that factor into our lives we cant solve one problem without addressing all the other problems
2726822 are democrats really prepared to close the government in order to stop drilling
2726823 i think the american people would find that a suicidal strategy
2726824 so republicans are going to tell seniors youre being squeezed by high gas prices and high grocery prices and now were going to cut off your social security checks
2726825 said jennifer crider a spokeswoman for the democratic congressional campaign committee the house democrats campaign arm
2726826 as far as im concerned those bans end sept 30 and if they end on sept 30 fuel prices will head back down on oct 1
2726827 i want to see the most forward looking energy policy for alternatives
2726828 if in order to get that you have to compromise and have the states sign off on whether they want drilling or not maybe thats the price we are going to pay to get it but to have an up or down vote on drilling where does that leave us it leaves us in the same place republicans have put us in after eight years of their policies
2726829 the terror that is being inflicted in india is not islamic terror but wahhabi terror
2726830 wahhabis should explain as to why almost all the terrorists are invariably their followers
2726831 terror outfits seem to draw their raw material from these groups
2726832 these second generation muslims some of them of course not all of them feel alienated from a pristine culture of their grandfathers they dont care about how one lives in a moroccan village they feel so alienated by the modern western culture and by not reverting but by joining a neofundamentalist movement which tells them dont care about society any kind of society dont care about culture dont care about politics just try to be a good muslim and to recreate the true muslim community they feel at home they would say this is an identity for me
2726833 the wahhabis are conducting an aggressive campaign of mobilisation for a particular brand of islam with the other sects in a permanent defensive posture theirs is a violent interpretation of jihad and has the enormous potential to create and sustain mobilisation and recruiting base of extremist movements in india
2726834 from just 28 websites eight years ago there are over 1 000 websites dedicated to spreading wahhabi ideology
2726835 most barelvi sunni mosques are in a dilapidated condition so the hardliners donate money for repairs appoint their own priest and slowly begin to take over
2726836 how can an ideology or a seminary be held responsible for the violent behaviour of a few
2726837 what they are doing for hindus we are doing for muslims in order to bring them to the right path whats wrong with it
2726838 which would hand over indian coasts to bigger players and multinationals
2726839 these are posturings they use to make inroads into a secular society they are yet to publicly question maududis idea of a religious state in india they raise anti fascist campaigns but fail to explain why their founder emphasises mullah hegemony similar to aryan hegemony
2726840 strong supporters of an emissions trading scheme because they stand to gain from trading permits and creating complex derivative markets
2726841 the european union spent five years just designing its scheme and its in the middle of seven years of phased transitions to iron out structural problems they dont actually switch to unconditional trading of permits until 2020
2726842 simply to tax the few places upstream the oil the gas the coal that puts on the price on carbon then works through the economy rather than a more complicated scheme where you monitor what thousands or even tens of thousands of individual enterprises are doing
2726843 governments prefer to hide behind markets with all their costly excesses
2726844 no way how would i be able to move in that let alone
2726845 but one of my fellow brides pointed out that well thatll be perfect its being hard to move in would make it all the more hilarious that i was tearing across the stage in it
2726846 im going to explore the body of an old man is there an old man in the audience okay come here now i need a place to enter the ear okay
2726847 hai ragione mi sto comportanto come una merda smetto subito da ora ti amo
2726848 yes you can see how teens dress and act out in rage and violence towards society
2726849 for the men and women of reverend wrights generation the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away nor has the anger and bitterness of those years obama march 18 2008
2726850 fight on ther feet and not live on their knees
2726851 wir m ssen lehrern daher mehr gehalt und bessere karrierechancen bieten

2726853 its a very physically demanding circuit because its so twisty with a lot of directional changes youre busy throughout the lap and so is the car the track is basically the complete opposite of a circuit like le mans the nature of the layout will also play into the hands of the quickest lmp2 cars theyre quite a bit lighter and thats a massive advantage at the nurburgring because raw power is less important than somewhere like spa the porsche spyders in particular will be mixing it with the lmp1 cars
2726854 i love it roxie when are we going to do it again
2726855 tomorrow when my mommy goes to the mask shop to get my new mask
2726856 but how are you going to get your nanny out of the house so you can come over to mine
2726857 ill just tell her that i accidently broke my mask while playing and that i need a new one
2726858 even if it is my nana wont know the difference besides shes just watching me till my parents get back home and she knows that what i say goes so she wont be questioning me all that much
2726859 dont worry theyll be back from the golden city any day now they probably just got lost in the hallway prison or something like that
2726860 what will you do if they never come back though
2726861 shes calling me to come home for dinner now what time as i supposed to be at your house again
2726862 around ten should work my mom is planning on leaving at about a quarter till then so that she can hopefully get there before the city decides to change again too much be careful on your way home
2726863 angel you have to get up and put on your extra mask until i get back from getting you a new one i dont want to be the one responsible for leaving you by yourself and the shadow queen getting you just because you wouldnt get up
2726864 angel you know better i have to leave in a half hour so that i can get to the shop in time now get up by yourself and start eating your breakfast before i have to force you out of that bed and force you to eat as well
2726865 because you know how that particular mask shop runs the earlier you get there the better the masks you can get the later you get there the worse you get
2726866 goodness girl what do you do in your sleep purposely tie knots in your hair
2726867 i move around a lot in my sleep my bed is very uncomfortable i think that this cloud is going to start storming soon so ill need a new one here shortly before the place floods again
2726868 ill see what i can do about that while im out you know if you werent so negative while you slept that wouldnt happen so often why cant you dream normal happy thoughts like most girls your age
2726869 usually they dream of marrying a prince or of eating sweets sometimes they dream of an evil witch or other creature but then their true love comes to save them making everything right again and peaceful by the end of their dream they only find out that their love was a prince
2726870 ow hey what are you doing back there are you crazy my brain would like to stay inside of my head you know
2726871 i know that dear im just putting it back into a pony tail before i put it in the bun
2726872 we need a new breakfast plate now as well i just broke this one too
2726873 child do you do this stuff just to give me more work to do around here i still havent had a chance to finish cleaning out the basement since the last time the city shifted and knocked over the bookshelves down there and made them a mess
2726874 remember to put on your spare mask before too much longer and dont leave the house
2726875 always gets the back and never the front i swear
2726876 im right here i was in the kitchen getting a few things moved so that we can get to the jar better are you ready

2726879 about as much as your nana tells you to stop breaking things come on we have to hurry and stay focused
2726880 dont give me that look i know how you can be sometimes
2726881 why is it every part of your house is short and small but the kitchen
2726882 it makes no sense unless your mom just does it to try and keep you away from the good stuff oooo caffeine
2726883 angel stay focused were almost there its just a little furth ahhhh
2726884 i cant move my arm and it really hurts to move my hand as well see watch ow ow ow

2726886 i need you to send out someone imme now my friend got hurt during the city shift just a moment ago and needs to be treated quickly she says that she cant mover her arm and that it hurts to move her hand at all
2726887 we will have someone there in just a moment please move your friend as close to the door as possible so that she can get brought here in a quick manner
2726888 simeon you get up here right now young man you have to get ready for your swimming lesson
2726889 but but you cant you know i dont like swimming
2726890 ive already told you theres no choice in the matter now come along you have to get into your swimming suit
2726891 now you go in there and meet your new swimming instructor hell get you into your gear and youll have the best time in the water
2726892 you realize that im not going anywhere near that water right
2726893 oh yes you are youre going into the water and youre going to learn how to swim water cant hurt you if you know how to keep afloat you know
2726894 now prince simeon youre acting like a child and if youre going to act like a child im going to treat you like a child
2726895 simeon you are going to learn how to swim and you are going to like it
2726896 well well what are you doing in my laundry arent you supposed to be having your swimming lessons
2726897 i was hiding from my nanna and the instructor theyre trying to force me to swim against my will youve got to help me please
2726898 dont worry you can stay here but if they find you i cant do anything about it
2726899 a male chambermaid will kill assumptions about me sleeping with other woman as i wait for my bride to be
2726900 it was all a lie he never loved you only used you for a source of pleasure after all you were always in his room
2726901 i was never going to kill you i wanted to run away with you love
2726902 angel im curious about something where do you see yourself when you get older and become an adult like whom do you see yourself with in the future and how do you see yourself then
2726903 what on melarad are you talking about and where did that kind of thing come from
2726904 well i was just thinking really what well be like in the future will we still be best friends and talk to each other or will be enemies who want to just kill each other but will be unable to because of how close we were to each other once before in the past will we just move away and forget about each other and live happy lives with a husband in a different house in a different place or will we still live near each other if not together by ourselves and die as old single women
2726905 yea yea im fine just i dont know shocked i guess i mean ive never really thought about it the future seems so far away that i never think of it coming and there are so many things that could happen between now and then that could change that i dont really think anything could be set in stone i mean i could give you one answer now then something could happen five minutes later and what i just told you could be completely different because of what just happened in five minutes time
2726906 oh angel youre always like that okay lets say that everything was indeed set in stone and that what you thought now could never change how would you answer those things now
2726907 i know i know but for once just once try to pretend that it is possible surely you can do that right
2726908 i suppose i would see us i would see us still together or at least in contact we would still live near each other no we would just live in the same city but no where near each other well maybe a little closer to each other than we are now but not direct neighbors that would just create too much tension between our families that we would have wait how far into the future are we looking at here
2726909 youre impossible angel i dont know lets go simple and say ten years so you when youre twenty four and me when im twenty three
2726910 oh goodness then roxie well still be close as ever but well be out partying all the time getting drunk and loosing our minds
2726911 come on and be serious you know that i would at least be the responsible one at a party youre such a lush and have one of the biggest caffeine loves that i know if we were to go to a real party you would be a complete total mess and i would have to be the one cleaning up the mess that you made
2726912 fine fine in ten years we wont be out partying all the time wasting our lives like a pair of crazy beings instead it will just be me who is doing that
2726913 fine fine okay lets see we would have families you would be married to another witch no a a a demon that saw the error in their ways just for you and you would have a wonderful little family of one no two kids a boy and a girl both just as beautiful looking and acting as their mother and father the war between the shadow lands and the golden city would also be over at this point mind you ummm you would also have a house full of pets no just a few and one adult dragon well no a baby dragon that somehow manages to stay a baby all the time you go with it for fear an adult would burn everything to a crisp yea that sounds about right thats our future the end
2726914 its wonderful to know that you have such a marvelous picture of my future life but what about yours
2726915 youre so complicated sometimes angel who will you be with will you even be with someone what do you think the being youre with will be like how many children will you have is there a certain kind of house you see yourself in pets that kind of stuff like what you said for me
2726916 i know how about i ask you questions and you just go into more detail that way
2726917 what would you do if i never did marry or what if i did indeed marry but it wasnt a guy
2726918 well then we just wont say husband significant other what about that being will they be tall and strong weak and need someone to depend on talented and be able to do anything and everything will they cater to your every need and want as well as worship the ground that you walk on will they flirt with other people just to tease you tell you jokes just to make you laugh never be around and always off doing other things
2726919 i cant tell you what they will be but i can tell you what they wont be they wont be a flirt like that prince of the golden city ive been hearing rumors about him apparently he flirts with every girl he comes by and has been for the past year if i ever meet a man like that hell wish he had never met me
2726920 i cant stand men like that they act like us women can be wooed and then tossed aside like a piece of trash and if a prince is acting that way just think of how everyone else will start to act all men will turn out like that including the ones that are already married and then the women of melarad will get the idea that if men can do it why cant they all of the sudden you poke your head out the window and you see everyone all over the place with someone new every second of the day including the ones that are married and swore under the oath that must not be broken that they would never leave the one that they love and just think roxie if everything thinks that oath can be broken theyll start breaking other oaths the world will never be the same if that happens i say that we act now while we are still young and can we should start protesting now to keep the oath alive and end men like that prince starting tomorrow we go to the streets and protest this i say we should throw the prince off of the throne and see how he acts once he can no longer just ask for any old woman he wants and then toss her back outside into the world and act like he never met her
2726921 hey that project doesnt count we were told that we could either research the origins of chickens or of roosters its not my fault that roosters put me to sleep rather than woke me up like they are supposed to
2726922 i dont even know why i bother when it comes to you and speaking of school we are not going to research the way a tree works for the next project we will never be able to make our speech long enough
2726923 i dont know about that angel you have a habit of going on and on even if you do get off topic a lot of the time somehow you always manage to link back to what you were talking about originally but thats fine so you would rather research what effects a persons dreams
2726924 of course i have to figure it out so i can get rid of these nightmares they just keep getting worse and keep going into more detail have i told you what they have been about the past month at least
2726925 i had no idea that you were having such dreams angel we really should get right on top of researching that whole dream thing
2726926 omg a grant award from the national endowment for the humanities
2726927 that day that you always remember that you the prince
2726928 perfect at parties at the office or even on some sad lonely friday night

2726936 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2726937 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

2726944 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2726945 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2726946 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2726947 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2726949 in the past month i have been in so much pain and i havent been able to practise for 10 days
2726950 i havent even hit a ball since arriving in beijing
2726951 it was very exciting sitting there this morning watching michael phelps set a world record was special to me because it made me realize how many people are inspired by him
2726952 now im in the position to have that opportunity to go out there and get a medal for my country today was hopefully the first step towards that
2726953 were being driven away the place was in flames and we couldnt stay
2726954 this reminds me all too much of other recent conflicts that have torn our continent apart particularly in the balkans
2726955 we have left practically all of south ossetia as an expression of goodwill and our willingness to stop military confrontation
2726956 we have asked united states secretary of state condoleezza rice to mediate with the russians to transmit them our message
2726957 there is no mehdi army here there is only the iraqi army
2726958 there is only one language the language of the law
2726959 theres a period of restructuring going on theyre kind of seeing whos around whats left what kind of capabilities they have
2726960 its keeping out elements that people dont want around anymore
2726961 no one wants to live in a prison but right now this is useful for us
2726962 people cant see their neighbors because of these walls the walls have disrupted this city
2726963 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2726964 no way it says right here that you can use it as a laundry detergent
2726965 once upon a time a greenyogini and her beau moved during the week between christmas and new years
2726966 a number of people have started to leave but a number of people will stay on to make sure the site is in a perfect condition when we leave
2726967 at 2 4pm we will have a main camp meeting about where we go from here in the context of kingsnorth people are really keen to come and keep the campaign going
2726968 we take this really seriously we are not going to just abandon a field to the rubbish

2726971 its not like other shows where its like they have to do the walk of shame out
2726972 its very actually breezy if you will but usually for the most part they will leave within one to two days of being eliminated from the show
2726973 thats something you understand when youre voted off that ends for you and it goes on for the others and you just make room and its completely understandable
2726974 we make room for the other people because they have to focus on the competition then
2726975 i feel a stress lifted off my shoulders the experience was great and i wouldnt wish it away but there is a lot of stress that comes with it we dont mind leaving at all because it makes room for the others to pursue the dream
2726976 i still keep in touch with a lot of the various cast members that have been on the show
2726977 im always interested to see whats going on in their careers and what i can do to help what insight production co ltd can do what ctv can do because the whole point of the show is to get as many people out there doing what they want to do which is to make music
2726978 the egyptian government imposed a new measure which increases the extent of censorship on internet users and violates their right to privacy
2726979 their names email and phone numbers before they use the internet
2726980 this severely abusive procedure proves that the security policies aim to impose constraints and censorship on internet users
2726981 punched the woman who then plunged a pen into his shoulder
2726982 there are a lot of guys kovalev obviously that guy is so skilled its unbelievable
2726983 one of the guys even though he was traded is cristobal huet he was just a terrific guy and a very positive influence on carey
2726984 at that point you dont know whether to laugh or cry because all of a sudden carey is stuck in that spot but thats the type of situation that carey likes its what he wants
2726985 ive only met bob a couple of times bob is pretty straight faced pretty quiet you dont get too much out of bob in terms of small talk or information
2726986 we talk from time to time about different things were about the same age so we kind of understand each other
2726987 i think getting georges laraque was a good thing and i think tanguay could be a real asset for the hockey team after re signing ryan obyrne and jaroslav halak along with kovalev theyre a pretty solid bunch

2726993 una transformaci n hist rica y he tenido la suerte de vivirla con la convicci n de que era esencial construir una rtve p blica para los ciudadanos del siglo xxi con el compromiso de la independencia profesional y period stica con una programaci n de servicio p blico y rentable desde el punto de vista social junto a una gesti n econ mica que no supusiera para los ciudadanos un coste mayor de lo que consideraban los ciudadanos a trav s de sus representantes

2726996 hay que sumar la reestructuraci n de toda la empresa con cambios de estructura y asumiendo la salida de 4 000 profesionales y la entrada de 1 000 nuevos

2727030 cried the man and his heart fell into his knees his eyes hid in terror on the back of his head and his ears blazed bright red
2727031 he screamed and knocked her off the prow with his oar and began paddling like a demon toward shoreline
2727032 on and on he worked into the night until dressing her in furs to keep her warm skeleton womans bones were all in the order a humans should be
2727033 and the more she sang the more her body filled out with flesh she sang for hair and good eyes and nice fat hands she sang the divide between her legs and breasts long enough to wrap for warmth and all the things a woman needs

2727041 in this competitive marketplace you have to separate yourself from other athletes and the taboo of posing for playboy or modelling has started to wane
2727042 people hardly batted an eyelid when amanda beard appeared in playboy but 10 or 15 years ago this would have caused much more of an uproar in the united states
2727043 the company has requested the newspaper sunday times to publish a rectification of the article
2727044 if mbeki has a clear conscience about the deal as he insists he does then he will appoint an independent judicial inquiry into the persistent allegations
2727045 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2727046 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2727047 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2727048 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2727049 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2727050 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2727051 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2727052 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2727053 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2727054 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2727055 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2727056 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2727057 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2727058 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2727059 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2727060 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2727061 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2727062 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2727063 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2727064 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2727065 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2727066 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2727067 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2727068 if there is any evidence that the sites are not complying with the legal obligations prosecution will follow
2727069 they have not demonstrated that they are policing it to conclude that there is no risk to vulnerable children because of this the government has been compelled to take limited measures
2727070 we investigated every complaint and communicated with the complainants over 30 were received initially and we deleted every single list off the network
2727071 what do people expect us to do must we monitor every message that goes out that is illegal people have a right to privacy
2727072 people should realise that if you insult someone on the internet you can be sued
2727073 revealing personal information in any public chat room is extremely irresponsible as the possibility of criminal elements being present is a reality
2727074 the brutal reality is that criminal elements worldwide have been on the internet for years and unfortunately mxit is not spared this evil
2727075 there have been reports of abuse of the mxit site for over a year parents have been complaining if mxit was only alerted to problems because of what happened in recent weeks then there is no reason to believe that they have adequate measures in place
2727076 in providing a service that has got the potential to be abused and damage peoples lives there must be a parallel programme to address such matters
2727077 tubers start forming 4 months after planting and production peaks at 6 months
2727078 yeah we won control of the house and senate but we couldnt say a damn thing about why we were still powerless
2727079 in addition to officially allocating 13 national delegates the state convention also decided five delegates that will attend the national convention as officially unpledged here are the names of these officially unpledged alaska delegates maybe we could contact them
2727080 if have have to do this it goes my way
2727081 once again the stuff hits the fan and i have to fix it

2727085 trying to get accepted at different graduate schools just by showing up on their doorstep
2727086 he was a film noir nut he claimed we werent showing the real film noir so i challenged him to write the program notes then there was his habit of sneaking into the films and denying that he was sneaking in i told him if he was sneaking in he should at least admit he was doing it
2727087 i really wanted to do something more with this thing as a movie
2727088 im absolutely convinced its going to have a life after the oscars id like it to be a long form film
2727089 this explains that the gang members here would first confirm the serial number of the currency notes in the chest and then inform those printing the currency to put the same serial number on the ficn
2727090 but calls to these two places were much more frequent than others
2727091 if the gang had actually pumped in the amount which is being estimated at rs 40 crore then the profits incurred thereon must be traced on the ground to establish that they were major players in the racket

2727103 thank you mr chairman i know we have a lot of ground to cover today but i want to say a few things on the topic of this hearing and of the next
2727104 first on monetary policy i am deeply concerned about what the fed has done in the last year and in the last decade
2727105 second the fed is asking for more power but the fed has proven they cannot be trusted with the power they have they get it wrong do not use it or stretch it further than it was ever supposed to go
2727106 as i said a moment ago their monetary policy is a leading cause of the mess we are in
2727107 now the fed wants to be the systemic risk regulator
2727108 giving the fed more power is like giving the neighborhood kid who broke your window playing baseball in the street a bigger bat and thinking that will fix the problem
2727109 i am not going to go along with that and will use all my powers as a senator to stop any new powers going to the fed instead we should give them less to do so they can do it right either by taking away their monetary policy responsibility or by requiring them to focus only on inflation
2727110 is released next week we just got word from ea that the game will still ship with favre on the cover in his old green bay packers uniform but the following updates will make him a jet
2727111 its unfortunate because it made it seem like the game was out of reach
2727112 i think we would have gone out in the ninth a lot more pumped might have scored that tying run
2727113 if you coach long enough you see some crazy things but ive never seen anything like that
2727114 it worked out for us especially the rest of it
2727115 when you play a good team like medford it always seems like youre that much behind them and thats the difference
2727116 it was a good game for eight innings and things kind of blew up but we kept fighting back and thats all i asked for
2727117 we felt the timing was right after running through our rotation earlier in the tournament we had some guys ready to go if needed and our ace lined up for tomorrow
2727118 i think that if we played the way we were capable of we could have beaten medford any time this season
2727119 but we would get mixed up or make a mistake in one inning and that was true tonight
2727120 my dream was to be a doc ever since i was a little kid im glad i could have been on this team with these guys they should be a force to be reckoned with
2727121 some are eligible some arent like humans some have bones that are too brittle some have veins or arteries of utilities not salvageable they are lost but the healthy ones those we can work with they will be the links we can save
2727122 both times i had to throw strikes and relied on the defense behind me
2727123 it wasnt a malicious play jordan isnt that type of player he got beat to the plate fair and square
2727124 we came back out and kept going to work at it
2727125 it was one of those games where you just had to keep scoring runs to hold them off
2727126 hitters just seem to do well in this park especially ours
2727127 having a four run lead rather than three when brett goes out there to close it made him more comfortable on the mound
2727128 we rolled out 15 hits today and beat them with our bats
2727129 we have to clean it up defensively and not give the other teams a chance to come back like that
2727130 insbesondere die jungen leute unterhalten sich viel lieber ber lifestyle freunde und sex
2727131 in 5 bis 10 jahren werden schon einige produkte wie bohrmaschinen ber das internet verkauft werden bei zement ist das schon wieder schwieriger
2727132 das web 2 0 bietet chancen und risiken die chancen sind neue m glichkeiten f r unternehmer da die etablierten dort noch nicht sind risiko besteht darin insbesondere f r die etablierten dass man zu sp t kommt
2727133 jeder h rt nur was er sie h ren will
2727134 es muss auch unternehmen geben die abwarten damit die innovatoren ihre chance nutzen k nnen
2727135 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2727136 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2727137 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2727138 i saw lochte was going slower and i tried to do everything to go better than phelps but i dont have enough power for that
2727139 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2727140 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2727141 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for
2727142 that was amazing setting another world record you cant ask for anything else that was a great way to start off the meet for usa
2727143 i sort of turned around and thought i saw 4 31 and i was thinking that hurt a lot for a 4 31
2727144 but when i walked over and saw the 4 29 i thought thats amazing
2727145 it was a tough race but i cant really be mad
2727146 i was only like a half second off my best time so im happy to get my first medal of the olympics
2727147 it was amazing it was emotional it was such a dramatic moment
2727148 we hope that any success we have goes to making our sport more popular
2727149 if we can get even one girl to take up fencing then weve done well
2727150 it hasnt been an issue that has impeded our performance at all
2727151 i kind of got my head back in the bout that i was in because i was really hung up on my last bout
2727152 i dont think i anticipated the emotion i would feel up there
2727153 well probably spend about the same as we would per day in the past
2727154 we just want people to come out and enjoy our fair
2727155 i feel fortunate that our numbers are close to what they were last year
2727156 weve had a shock to our economy yet were holding our own
2727157 i would rather have had one breath of her hair one kiss from her mouth one touch of her hand than eternity without it
2727158 the greatest miracle of all that day was having that many people together in faith to see what god had for us
2727159 i am still in awe of that and honored by it
2727160 the humanness inside of you wants to ask why me but i also knew i had to accept that calling
2727161 we were told through the messengers the three parishioners there would be 20 000 there
2727162 we received specific instructions what to prepare in terms of aid stations water stations stations to serve people in need we were given specific instructions on all of the things
2727163 we had a couple of parishioners on nbc for an interview on national television and they were asked why lubbock
2727164 their answer was why not lubbock a few months afterward texas monthly magazine said there were reports of miracles but they said the miracle was getting 20 000 people to lubbock
2727165 this isnt enough to wash away the curious but i had to chuckle it was just kind of a sign
2727166 a little while later around 7 30 or 8 is when all kinds of things started to happen we saw it and everyone out there got very excited we saw the sun coming down out of the sky it was a real manifestation of god thats the only way i can explain it
2727167 and that caused him to have his hand against his chest he was unable to open his arm out when the blessed mother came to the fountain at st john neumann he extended out his hand
2727168 the biggest catholic event in the history of the diocese didnt happen
2727169 both times i had to throw strikes and relied on the defense behind me
2727170 it wasnt a malicious play jordan isnt that type of player he got beat to the plate fair and square
2727171 we came back out and kept going to work at it
2727172 it was one of those games where you just had to keep scoring runs to hold them off
2727173 hitters just seem to do well in this park especially ours
2727174 having a four run lead rather than three when brett goes out there to close it made him more comfortable on the mound
2727175 the notion that there has been a steady increase in favour of women taking an equal role in the workplace and away from their traditional role in the home is clearly a myth
2727176 instead there is clear evidence that womens changing role is viewed as having costs both for the woman and the family
2727177 it is conceivable that opinions are shifting as the shine of the super mum syndrome wears off and the idea of women juggling high powered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is increasingly seen to be unrealisable by ordinary mortals
2727178 a husbands job is to earn income a wifes to take care of the children
2727179 a change in attitude is not the same thing as a change in behaviour but attitudes do matter
2727180 women particularly mothers can experience considerable strain when attitudes reinforce the notion that employment and family interests conflict
2727181 if we are to make progress in devising policies that encourage equal working opportunities for women we need to know more about what gender roles people view as practical as possible and as fair
2727182 some schools will be able to provide intensive preparation for their pupils and others will not
2727183 it is quite disgraceful if universities are saying we are not going to use this measure because we are afraid of what it is going to show
2727184 it is a terrible situation to get in to that higher education is avoiding the best qualified candidates because of where they were educated in a bid to comply with state school benchmarks set by its paymasters
2727185 we will have good institutions that should be recruiting the brightest talent trying to fix admissions by ignoring a new grade
2727186 if there are reservations they should be about potential differences between subjects and exam boards in the awarding of a not how different schools will perform
2727187 this is woolly lilly livered thinking and not very honest it shows the extent to which universities are cowered by government pressure to widen participation they should be giving credit to pupils who are best equipped to do well in the subject they are applying for
2727188 it was noted that the a grade was intended to be awarded only to the highest scoring percentage of students who would largely be in attendance at independent schools
2727189 there are some concerns that selection on the basis of a might have adverse effects on widening participation
2727190 other institutions are not including the a in their offers as they feel that this is likely to disadvantage state schools
2727191 the admissions group felt they required a more informed debate on the issue and have asked for an indicator from the 1994 group of universities of which it is a member
2727192 no englishman can open his mouth without causing another englishman to despise him
2727193 this house will in no circumstances fight for king and country
2727194 the object in life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane
2727195 im 59 years old and ive never stood on my own two feet without wrestling
2727196 i need to find out if i can vince mcmahon cant prop me up forever
2727197 i want everybody in the world to know that i love and respect the wwe
2727198 theyve helped me through so much of my life and have made me a better person they recognized me and my family at wrestlemania and have propped me up and helped me as long as they can
2727199 sini nak mami usapin minyak kayu putih kayaknya daritadi kamu terganggu banget gara gara digigit nyamuk
2727200 if we had no sexual harassment we would have no children
2727201 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
2727202 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
2727203 abandon the idea that the afghan government will be under its control
2727204 we do not want to be the slaves or puppets of other countries
2727205 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2727206 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2727207 uplifting it was a spirit filled feeling as you know i feel very strongly about religion
2727208 i am here to help birmingham and change negative energy into new transformative acts of creative consciousness
2727209 so if you have a gige lan any trojaned machine can poison your dns during one night
2727210 we would have taken quaresma and saviola but the players decided not to come
2727211 we have always thought that this formula could be successful so we have looked at crosas
2727212 we are not finally there but that deal is now a structure which will hopefully allow us to add players going forward
2727213 hopefully it makes a lot of sense not only with barcelona but with other clubs too
2727214 a young or fringe barcelona player could come here play in our first team play in front of 60 000 and in europe and develop as a player both clubs could benefit from that
2727215 most four night reward stays are regularly 140 000 points
2727216 struggling with things beyond our understanding kasama mga anak ko siyempre pag tinatanong nga sa akin e parang ang hirap sagutin ang how are you
2727217 siguro lahat naman tayo may pinagdaanan na mga taong mahahalaga sa buhay natin na nawala and yung pakiramdam na yun in one way or another ay may pains tayo na pinagdaanan na wounded tayo so siguro maka identify ang lahat
2727218 parang may pinagdaanan ka best friend nauna ka pang lumuluha sa akin
2727219 lt explain mo nga kung bakit ayaw mo na ng isang showbiz oriented na talk show
2727220 kasi parang mahihirapan ako magtanong kasi lalo na doon sa may mga pinagdadaanan kasi i am still healing
2727221 so parang hindi ganoon katatag yung loob ko para magkuwestiyon sa pinagdadaanan din nila most especially when it comes to pain di ba and yung joy is parang oo may panandaliang kaligayahan pero parating kakabit yung sorrow yung grief na dinadaanan namin so medyo mahirap im still my children are still healing and so i am
2727222 ano ibig sabihin noon anak na ayaw mo na ng showbiz oriented show
2727223 di ba mas maganda na siguro yung tina tackle ko is yung more of pagiging ina sa bahay mga ibang aspeto ng buhay hindi tungkol sa mga intriga sa mga dapat kumbaga although siyempre lahat tayo gusto makarinig ng latest di ba yung gustong makarinig ng kung ano na ang nangyayari lalo na sa mga kapwa mo artista parang gusto ko na huwag na alamin yun gusto ko na marinig na lang at hindi na akong maging bahagi
2727224 yung tipong wala ka na sa gitna pero kung may aalok sa iyo na lifestyle talk show okay ba sa iyo
2727225 siguro mas maganda kung sitcom para naman may mas magaan na mawawala sa isip mo yung dinadaanan na proseso ayoko din kasi madaliin ayoko magpa pressure na kailangan mag heal ka na ganoon
2727226 madalas mo ngang sabihin sa akin nay na o tanggalin mo na mga gamit ni rudy hindi ayoko talaga gusto ko nandiyan lang siya
2727227 so hindi mo pa inaayos ang gamit ni daboy hanggang ngayon
2727228 nasanay ako na i always cry alone aaminin ko na last night i cried pero tapos noon wala na nasanay din siguro ako sa pagpigil e yung merong may sandali lang na naiyak ako tapos tapos na dahil kailangang kong tapusin agad
2727229 nag flashback ako dun sa seven days noong nandoon sa bahay si rudy yung pagkatapos naming umuwi galing sa hospital
2727230 yung dalawang bata ba ralph and renz and even mark anthony rudys son with alma moreno mayroon ba silang iyak na hindi mo alam o ipinapakita ba nila ipinapakita nila ang emotion nila how are they basically now
2727231 sa ngayon pare pareho siguro kami bawat pagharap namin theres always a missing part di ba iniisip naming buo kami dahil magkakasama kami pero may kulang talaga
2727232 its like twenty seven years of my life with him so lahat siguro nanamnamin mo ultimong toothpaste at toothbrush kahit maliliiit na bagay pati yung gamot niya hanggang ngayon yung iba nga nagagamit ko medyo physically apektado rin ako so yung ibang gamot niya nagagamit ko na ngayon
2727233 mahirap pala mag interview ng isang taong katulad mo mahirap mahirap bilib nga ako dito kay lolit e siguro dahil close kayo kahit ako hindi kumikibo dito e alam mo ang damdamin ko
2727234 ikaw lolit sasama ka sa holy land o bawal ka doon
2727235 ngayon ko lang nadiskubre na doon sa dalawang taon na may sakit si rudy ang pinakamasakit kay lorna ay yung seven days na inalagaan niya si rudy doon sa bahay
2727236 pinakamasakit na oras ay yung alam kong wala na akong kayang gawin bale june 6 yon a day befor rudys death
2727237 hindi ako nawalan ng pag asa sinurender ko na lang nang buong buo inisip ko na kailangan niya rudy yun na iparamdam sa kanya at ipaalam sa kanya na maging okay kami yun naman ang kadalasan na para hindi mahirapan e sabihin mo na kakayanin nila
2727238 i think yung moment na talagang hindi na kaya ng lahat ng gamot hindi na ng doctor kung papaano patataasin ang blood pressure ni rudy yung gamot kung papaano papasok sa katawan niya yun yung ang moment na pinakamahirap talaga balikan and the final hours before june 7
2727239 pero lt kaya mo na ba kasi all these years si rudy ang padre de familia lahat ng responsibility ay siya ang umaako noon
2727240 talagang ngayon mas madalas ang pag uusap namin at madalas kaming magkakasama pag may panahon at pagkakataon e pinag uusapan namin ang napakaraming bagay at yung nasa loob namin yung nararamdaman namin papaano kami maggo grow together yung kaalaman hindi lang sa nararamdaman pati sa lahat ng bagay at paano kami magtulung tulungan
2727241 inaalam niya sa akin kung sino ang casting pinadalhan niya ako ng script hindi ko nga lang nabasa agad dahil sabi ko ang revised na ang ipadala sa akin at tumutulong ako sa ganoon parang si rudy rin sa kanya i hope kahit papaano e nakakatulong din ako dahil malaki ang naitulong nila sa pamilya namin
2727242 saludo talaga ako kay senator jinggoy senator bong and ipe hindi talaga bumitiw
2727243 sobrang dami ng pagmamahal na itinamin ni rudy na talagang inaani naman namin ngayon
2727244 hindi itong medyo kasi nagpagamot din ako parang mayroon na din akong severe tension headache na sumusulpot sulpot to lighten up my spirit at the same time i go out with friends also pero mas gusto ko sa bahay bahay
2727245 bastat mayroon akong ginagawa kinakausap ko siya basta na may moment ako na tahimik kinakausap ko siya actually dalawa sila ang diyos at siya
2727246 oo nga tumawag nga sa akin anak ko ma gusto akong kausapin ni tito gorgy rula
2727247 si dennis trillo madalas pumunta sa bahay nagugulat ako minsan pag kumatok ako sa kuwarto ng mga bata nandoon siya there was a time na talagang binisita niya si rudy dalawang beses niya binisita si rudy after chemo ni rudy
2727248 ang sabi niya kay nanay lolit tapusin niya muna pag aaral niya pero pag may magandang role e puwede niyang pagsabayin ang pag aaral at pag aartista niya so depende sa io offer na role sa kanya
2727249 its so sad kasi kahit na anong mangyari pag move on ko e parating nandiyan sa tabi ko yung ayokong sabihin alaala e pero slowly but surely yes magmu move on ako kung sino man ang mga kaibigan ko na kasama ko at iba pang kasama ko na bagong kaibigan parang kailangan nilang tanggapin na bahagi sa buhay ko because i will always remember kumbaga kahit anong situwasyon sa kahit anong dadaanan ko parati kong masasabi ko at mababanggit si rudy i think moving on is not really talking about or thinking about kumbaga yung isasantabi mo hindi ko magagawa isantabi yon
2727250 ito ang madalas kong sabihin sa mga taong takot na mamatay medyo kikilabutan kayo rito huwag po kayong matakot mamatay ang isipin nyo sa kabila doon ay makikita mo ang paborito mong tao halimbawa idol mo si elvis presley ang mga dakilang tao sa kasaysayan si mahatma gandhi kahit na sila hitler may pagkakataon ka makaharap ang mga taong yan mas maganda ngayon dahil may rudy fernandez pa
2727251 sabi nga ni manay susan roces noong wake ni rudy sigurado ako ang ganda ng pelikula na ginagawa nila doon kasama si kuya ron fernando poe jr susans late husband isipin natin na napakagandang pelikula na ginagawa nila kasama ng mga magagaling na director na nandun na

2727267 the jew is no less active in profiting by the vices and necessities of the peasant than by those of the noble as sure as he gains a settlement in a village the peasantry become poor
2727268 the worst of the peasants sluggish content is that it has given him over to the exactions of the jews

2727272 the rabbis have taught that there are three reasons why a person should not enter a ruin 1 because he may be suspected of evil intent 2 because the walls might tumble upon him 3 and because of evil spirits that frequent such places
2727273 the stone which og king of bashan meant to throw upon israel is the subject of a tradition delivered on sinai the camp of israel i see he said extends three miles i shall therefore go and root up a mountain three miles in extent and throw it upon them so off he went and finding such a mountain raised it on his head but the holy one blessed be he sent an army of ants against him which so bored the mountain over his head that it slipped down upon his shoulders from which he could not lift it because his teeth protruding had riveted it upon him

2727277 if the ox of an israelite bruise the ox of a gentile the israelite is exempt from paying damages but should the ox of a gentile bruise the ox of an israelite the gentile is bound to recompense him in full
2727278 when an israelite and a gentile have a lawsuit before thee if thou canst acquit the former according to the laws of israel and tell the latter such is our law if thou canst get him off in accordance with gentile law do so and say to the plaintiff such is your law but if he cannot be acquitted according to either law then bring forward adroit pretexts and secure his acquittal these are the words of the rabbi ishmael rabbi akiva says no false pretext should be brought forward because if found out the name of god would be blasphemed but if there be no fear of that then it may be adduced
2727279 if one finds lost property in a locality where a majority are israelites he is bound to proclaim it but he is not bound to do so if the majority be gentiles
2727280 rabbi shemuel says advantage may be taken of the mistakes of a gentile he once bought a gold plate as a copper of a gentile for four zouzim and then cheated him out of one zouz into the bargain rav cahana purchased a hundred and twenty vessels of wine from a gentile for a hundred zouzim and swindled him in the payment out of one of the hundred and that while the gentile assured him that he confidently trusted to his honesty rava once went parts with a gentile and bought a tree which was cut up into logs this done he bade his servant go and pick him out the largest logs but to be sure to take no more than the proper number because the gentile knew how many there were as rav aghi was walking abroad one day he saw some grapes growing in a roadside vineyard and sent his servant to see whom they belonged to if they belong to a gentile he said bring some here to me but if they belong to an israelite do not meddle with them the owner who happened to be in the vineyard overheard the rabbis order and called out what is it lawful to rob a gentile oh no said the rabbi evasively a gentile might sell but an israelite would not

2727286 god has made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on the face of the earth
2727287 have maintained themselves so long in spite of their disorganized or dispersed condition is not at all to be wondered at when it is considered how they separated themselves from all other nationalities in such a way as to bring upon themselves the hatred of all and that not only by external rites contrary to those of other nations but also by the sign of circumcision which they most religiously retain
2727288 neither shalt thou make marriages with them the nations thy daughter thou shall not give to his son nor his daughter shall thou take unto thy son

2727311 dit is n van de dieptepunten in mijn carri re
2727312 that said the value of any gizmo that saves you those frustrating minutes of anticipation is worth every penny
2727313 is this the legacy we want to leave behind us
2727314 what legacy do we want to leave for future generations
2727315 was it really owned by a little old lady from pasadena
2727316 mustard gas was first used by the raf against the kurds in 1920 with the approval of sir winston churchill
2727317 this is shocking because i thought the government had done a lot to ensure safety
2727318 i think this might hurt chinas image in the world but i dont think itll disturb the olympics per se
2727319 to tell you the truth this is really a shock because theres so much security here
2727320 there are guards everywhere and cameras so im not sure how something like this could happen
2727321 i heard some bombs and then i heard some machine guns
2727322 its happening now because of the olympics but i dont know who is doing it
2727323 the very purpose of these attacks is all about separating the region from china
2727324 want to use the olympic stage to enlarge the impact
2727325 merely show that the culture of impunity the government has helped nurture by its inaction apathy and even its outright attempts to stifle press freedom continues to thrive
2727326 two attacks against outspoken radio commentators in the space of a week is of grave concern to us and our colleagues in the philippines
2727327 are frequently killed and assaulted with impunity all for doing their jobs
2727328 an alarming sign that violence against philippine journalists may be on the rise
2727329 this is one of the worst moments of my career
2727330 i had a very uplifting experience going to a church
2727331 it just goes to show that god is universal god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2727332 this is a true testament to the importance you place on relations with china
2727333 i like what linux offers me better it suits my way of working better im more comfortable with it than i ever will be with mac os x especially now that the ui design is a little better ive no particular need for any mac os x only applications theres nothing i need that linux doesnt offer me
2727334 e couldnt find package digikam came up went to the digikam site no package installer for ubuntu maybe i could use the tarball but frankly its not worth my fing time to go through all the trouble
2727335 eg jpg right now as we speak millions of 18 year old people are building up their digital photo collections in jpg format this means that we are guaranteed a large base of population that has a definite need for jpg reading or at the very least converting software for at least another 50 60 years

2727366 wow lisa that was straight from the heart i have not read such strong worded commentary for years on a merger news and above all everything based on facts i must compliment you for crafting such a powerful note
2727367 something you might want to point out although not directly relevant to fao is that advisors and lawyers alike are licking their chops over the prospects of reopening and renegotiating every existing eds outsourcing arrangement in consideration of the
2727368 i am not at liberty to give you an official view from my company but suffice it to say we have a strategy that we are happy with and this actually doesnt impact the space we wish to occupy
2727369 i read this and agree 100 very insightful no one else has come out with this
2727370 we agree by the way little or no effect we dont see them going anywhere on f amp a here in the uk or in europe for that matter
2727371 very interesting commentary and correct in my eyes of the effect of the merger dont worry about f amp a just generally i dont think size is everything and in fact it could be a big pain for existing clients if there are large cultural integration issues
2727372 i loved the forthright way that youve penned down your thoughts keep going

2727382 im ok youre not the message were sending nonbelievers and why we should stop
2727383 ive been working on this book really since the late 1980s and quite intensely this year as the project progressed i came to feel that my special vantage point regarding
2727384 im very very excited and i just cant take it in at the moment
2727385 it is such a fantastic achievement for nicole and she has worked so hard over the last few years and we are very pleased for her
2727386 this was the ultimate goal for her she has done a lot of hard work and preparation to achieve this ambition of hers and she has come up with a result
2727387 there was a lot of nervous tension in the house from me tony nicoles father and her brother but i think she has done a lot of homework and studied videos and prepared very well for this
2727388 we spoke to her briefly after the race and it was just so great to talk to her
2727389 she is a very nice person there are no airs or graces on her
2727390 you could see she was determined to win she always wanted to come first
2727391 you will often see her out here when she is home she will always wave and shout shes a lovely girl
2727392 we used to see her out on her bike in all weathers everyone here is so proud
2727393 she stood out a girl riding her bike nothing would put her off
2727394 they no longer believe they can live safely in the state of georgia
2727395 this statement is new to us and it requires analysis
2727396 it is a case of a third party intervening in the process which is quite surprising
2727397 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2727398 we started off slow but we started to come along once we warmed up this is our first preseason game so of course its going to be a little rusty
2727399 you start out with a three and out and obviously you want to get it going early
2727400 we bounced right back and got the ball in the end zone twice preseason you want to get it going early you want to protect the football which we did
2727401 i have a lot fun doing it if you still love what youre doing and you can physically do it why not
2727402 you get to a certain point in your career and you want to win a championship
2727403 this seemed like a good place to try to do that

2727407 im happy to have such an amazing team behind me
2727408 i wanted to go 4 03 i didnt know if i would
2727409 to be honest i didnt really feel that great and then going into the ready room i started getting chills up my body right then and there i was starting to get more and more excited i mean i was pretty emotional after that race and im pretty excited to have that first one under my belt
2727410 i wasnt comfortable after the first 200 after seeing everybody so close together
2727411 thats usually not how it as after the first 200 i think it made my breaststroke a lot stronger and at that point it was all adrenaline
2727412 i knew i had to go out fast in order to be in the race
2727413 if i was like a couple tenths slower on the back stroke i think i wouldve had a better shot i think that backstroke kind of took a lot out of me i did my best and i cant ask for anything else
2727414 i saw him after the race and he nodded and waved the american flag
2727415 its a pretty special feeling i waved and nodded my head back
2727416 it is not your love that sustains the marriage but from now on the marriage that sustains your love
2727417 y ou will be hated by all for my names sake
2727418 wed rather you didnt speak such hard things pastor just be kind winsome and tell us what we want to hear on sunday mornings otherwise leave us alone
2727419 brother will deliver brother over to death and the father his child and children will rise against parents and have them put to death
2727420 t he one who endures to the end will be saved
2727421 but the lord is with me as a dread warrior
2727422 do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell
2727423 whoever denies me before men i also will deny before my father who is in heaven
2727424 n othing is covered that will not be revealed or hidden that will not be made known
2727425 if they have called the master of the house beelzebul how much more will they malign those of his household
2727426 those who are well have no need of a physician but those who are sick i came not to call the righteous but sinners
2727427 i a poor miserable sinner confess unto you all my sins and iniquities with which i have ever offended you and justly deserve your temporal and eternal punishment
2727428 why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners
2727429 you are right in saying i have no husband for you have had five husbands and the one you now have is not your husband what you have said is true
2727430 you are living in sin what you are doing is shameful this should not be
2727431 behold lord the half of my goods i give to the poor and if i have defrauded anyone of anything i restore it fourfold
2727432 today salvation has come to this house since he also is a son of abraham for the son of man came to seek and to save the lost
2727433 all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
2727434 given and shed for you for the forgiveness of sins
2727435 almighty and everlasting god you have given us grace to acknowledge the glory of the eternal trinity by the confession of a true faith and to worship the unity in the power of the divine majesty
2727436 that we worship one god in trinity and trinity in unity neither confusing the persons nor dividing the substance
2727437 being therefore exalted at the right hand of god and having received from the father the promise of the holy spirit he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing
2727438 whoever desires to be saved must think thus about the trinity
2727439 truly i say to you unless you turn and become like children you will never enter the kingdom of heaven
2727440 all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me
2727441 blessed be the holy trinity and the undivided unity let us give glory to him because he has shown his mercy to us
2727442 for as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return there but water the earth making it bring forth and sprout giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth it shall not return to me empty but it shall accomplish that which i purpose and shall succeed in the thing for which i sent it
2727443 gives the holy spirit who works faith when and where he pleases in those who hear the gospel
2727444 why do some believe and others not why are some saved and others not
2727445 aha im the good soil the seed of the word has been cast and found a good rich fertilized soil in my heart
2727446 instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle and it shall make a name for the lord an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off
2727447 and which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life
2727448 but seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things will be added to you
2727449 for in the gospel the righteousness of god is revealed from faith for faith as it is written the righteous shall live by faith
2727450 is not life more than food and the body more than clothing
2727451 i believe that god has made me and all creatures that he has given me my body and soul eyes ears and all my members my reason and all my senses and still takes care of them he also gives me clothing and shoes food and drink house and home wife and children land animals and all i have he richly and daily provides me with all that i need to support this body and life
2727452 can a woman forget her nursing child that she should have no compassion on the son of her womb even these may forget yet i will not forget you
2727453 trust in him at all times god is a refuge for us
2727454 will you be diligent in the study of holy scripture and the confessions and will you be constant in prayer for those under your pastoral care
2727455 whoever finds his life will lose it and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it
2727456 do not think that i have come to bring peace to the earth i have not come to bring peace but a sword
2727457 glory to god in the highest and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased
2727458 therefore since we have been justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ
2727459 with all humility and gentleness with patience bearing with one another in love eager to maintain the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
2727460 whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me
2727461 whoever receives you receives me and whoever receives me receives him who sent me
2727462 for what can be known about god is plain to them because god has shown it to them for his invisible attributes namely his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly perceived ever since the creation of the world in the things that have been made so they are without excuse
2727463 for every house is built by someone but the builder of all things is god
2727464 come to me all who labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest
2727465 all things have been handed over to me by my father and no one knows the father except the son and anyone to whom the son chooses to reveal him
2727466 surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows
2727467 i am gentle and lowly in heart and you will find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
2727468 and take they our life goods fame child and wife though these all be gone our victry has been won the kingdom ours remaineth
2727469 you said that a man has the psychological need for a god but there is no such thing and i do not believe in it
2727470 well do you mean to say that you never think about god
2727471 although you insist that there is no god and support yourself with so many arguments you have lost your case already
2727472 your mouth can say as much as you want about there not being a god but your heart is on my side
2727473 you know better in your heart that there is a god
2727474 when jesus saw the crowds he had compassion for them because they were harassed and helpless like sheep without a shepherd
2727475 pray earnestly to the lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest
2727476 jesus went throughout all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction
2727477 you received without paying give without pay acquire no gold nor silver nor copper for your belts no bag for your journey nor two tunics nor sandals nor a staff for the laborer deserves his food
2727478 if the house is worthy let your peace come upon it
2727479 behold i am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves
2727480 be smart about your ministry avoid persecution when you can do so in good conscience but when the time comes suffer as an innocent dove in the hands of a predator for your reward is not in this earthly life let them drag you before their courts and synagogues and governors and kings just be faithful in your confession just trust me i am with you dont be anxious about what youre going to say because i will give you my holy spirit who will teach you what you are to say
2727481 for it is not you who speak but the spirit of your father speaking through you
2727482 the one who endures to the end will be saved
2727483 that when the called ministers of christ deal with us by his divine command
2727484 just as valid and certain even in heaven as if christ our dear lord dealt with us himself
2727485 as a called and ordained servant of christ and by his authority i forgive you all your sins
2727486 not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven
2727487 who come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves
2727488 received the word with all eagerness examining the scriptures daily to see if these things were so
2727489 you shall not misuse the name of the lord your god what does this mean we should fear and love god so that we do not curse swear use satanic arts lie or deceive by his name but call upon it in every trouble pray praise and give thanks
2727490 gods name is kept holy when the word of god is taught in its truth and purity and we as the children of god also lead holy lives according to it help us to do this dear father in heaven but anyone who teaches or lives contrary to gods word profanes the name of god among us protect us from this heavenly father
2727491 and the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat on that house but it did not fall because it had been founded on the rock
2727492 the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat against that house and it fell and great was the fall of it
2727493 bind them as a sign on your hand as frontlets between your eyes teach them to your children talking of them when you are sitting in your house and when you are walking by the way and when you lie down and when you rise write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates
2727494 what makes a work good is not how well the work is performed or the nature of the work what makes it good in the eyes of god is that it is done because of trust that acknowledges god as god and clings to him when a mother declares her childs finger painting to be priceless she does so not on the basis of its intrinsic quality or because she had it appraised by experts she praises it because of who painted it her child so it is with god regarding the works of the believer
2727495 nevertheless i tell you the truth it is to your advantage that i go away for if i do not go away the helper will not come to you but if i go i will send him to you
2727496 if anyone thirsts let him come to me and drink
2727497 whoever believes in me as the scripture has said out of his heart will flow rivers of living water
2727498 in this christian church he daily and richly forgives all my sins and the sins of all believers on the last day he will raise me and all the dead and give eternal life to me and all believers in christ this is most certainly true
2727499 whenever churches set aside the pure gospel and sacraments of jesus for something they think is more effective or more powerful they end up divided in their own confusion just as at babel the true unity of the church is always gods gracious work and it is always the holy spirit who does this work by bringing jesus to us by means of the purely preached gospel and the rightly administered sacraments of christ those who despise the humble means of grace despise god for god will not deal with us in any other way he will not bring us the forgiveness of sins peace and faith except through these means of grace the church is not free to choose for herself how she will receive the power of the holy spirit her lord has already made the choice for her
2727500 pastor i dont understand why the lord doesnt just take me home i cant do anything im all alone i need help just to get dressed in the morning why doesnt god take me to heaven
2727501 i dont know why god hasnt taken you to heaven yet except to say that if nothing else you can pray you can pray for your brothers and sisters in christ you can pray for your family and friends you can pray for the sick and the dying you can pray for those in prison you can pray for anyone who needs your prayers and you can pray for me your pastor for the church and for her mission to the lost
2727502 the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now
2727503 into the fiery furnace in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their father
2727504 no lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them let both grow together until the harvest and at harvest time i will tell the reapers gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned but gather the wheat into my barn
2727505 my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as you will
2727506 rejoice insofar as you share christs sufferings that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed if you are insulted for the name of christ you are blessed because the spirit of glory and of god rests upon you
2727507 holy father keep them in your name which you have given me that they may be one even as we are one
2727508 holy father keep them in your name the name that i possess
2727509 an alder leaf loosened by wind is drifting out with the tide as it drifts it bumps into the slender leg of a great blue heron staring intently through the rippled surface then drifts on the heron raises one leg out of the water and replaces it a single step as i watch i too am drawn into the spread of silence slowly a bank of cloud approaches slipping its bulged and billowing texture over the earth folding the heron and the alder trees and my gazing body into the depths of a vast breathing being enfolding us all within a common flesh a common story now bursting with rain

2727660 huddled in dirt the reasoning engine lies who was so proud so witty and so wise
2727661 nature hath made men so equal in the facilities of body and mind
2727662 reason an ignis fatuus in the mind which leaving light of nature sense behind pathless and dangrous wand ring ways it takes

2727684 what human beings see to learn from nature is how to use it to dominate wholly both it and human beings
2727685 there are few who have succeeded by their own exercise of mind and spirit both in freeing themselves from tutelage and in achieving a steady pace

2727687 technology is the essence of this knowledge it aims to produce neither concepts nor images nor the joy of understanding but method exploitation of the labor of others capital
2727688 imprisons human beings in the cycle now objectified in the laws of nature to which they believe they owe their security as free subjects

2727700 a student put this question to me after i had spoken at the university of the witwatersrand two weeks ago about the importance of respecting and defending our constitution he said

2727703 wellbeing programmes can reduce absenteeism and prevent illness caused by stressful work environments which increase the chance of a person developing depression or anxiety
2727704 the acc like many employers the foundation works with have realised that healthcare schemes which only focus on illness are counter productive when a broader approach that focuses on health promotion will produce better results
2727705 they should be congratulated for making the wellbeing of their employees a top priority
2727706 it helps attract and retain high quality staff especially in a tight labour market
2727707 in the case of acc staff the overwhelming majority have used their cards to buys sports equipment pay for gym memberships and so on
2727708 the 250 contribution acc makes to staff activa cards is a small sum in every sense it equates to 0 005 percent of the total salary bill or 68 cents per day per person
2727709 and in return for this investment we get improved employee productivity less sick leave and improved staff retention

2727718 its not like other shows where its like they have to do the walk of shame out
2727719 its very actually breezy if you will but usually for the most part they will leave within one to two days of being eliminated from the show
2727720 thats something you understand when youre voted off that ends for you and it goes on for the others and you just make room and its completely understandable
2727721 we make room for the other people because they have to focus on the competition then
2727722 i feel a stress lifted off my shoulders the experience was great and i wouldnt wish it away but there is a lot of stress that comes with it we dont mind leaving at all because it makes room for the others to pursue the dream
2727723 i still keep in touch with a lot of the various cast members that have been on the show

2727725 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2727726 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2727727 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2727728 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2727729 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2727736 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2727737 it looks like two kilos to me as if were feeding three families today

2727747 the bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production and thereby the relations of production and with them the whole of society conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form was on the contrary the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes constant revolutionizing of production uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
2727748 motivational marketing how to effectively motivate your prospects to buy now buy more and tell their friends every businessperson sales professional advertising copywriter should be endlessly exploring this question sadly few do instead most stay stubbornly focused on the question of how can we make them buy our thing and sadly most training remains focused on selling we are all better served pondering the psychology of the buyer rather than the techniques and tactics of selling thats what robert imbriale has done in motivational marketing this book is a valuable exercise in being about the customer
2727749 from retail sales to trade shows setting up a wholesale showroom filing answering phone being an executive assistant i had a lot of different jobs that teach you how to fill all the roles necessary to start your own business
2727750 i noticed this artwork that was very unusual like something you might see in a store in manhattan so i met with the factory owner and talked about getting an order
2727751 when i found this product i didnt know if it was available in the united states so i went to a trade show in chicago and new york to see what they had you need to find out if there is a market for your product is someone else doing the same thing and if they are what are you going to do differently that will set you apart
2727752 i started small my first order was in 1995 and the line was just boxes and coasters
2727753 customers kind of tell you what to do by what they say and by what they dont say
2727754 one thing i learned while in the lwl incubator is that you need to really think about what you want your business to be from marketing to packaging and shipping to cash flow management you have to think about every aspect and gauge how much you are able to handle a lot of small businesses try to take on too much i outsource my warehouse my sales and occasionally back office support i have no overhead other than myself

2727759 i didnt realize what i could accomplish on my own because someone else was always in charge
2727760 i had the office and management experience lenny had been a computer technician instead of looking for another job we figured why not start our own company
2727761 you have to be able to be your own boss and that requires a lot of self discipline one thing i would tell entrepreneurs who are just starting out is to make sure that your venture is something you really want to do because it is a lot of responsibility
2727762 you know when we started i was working over twelve hours a day just now do i finally have a set schedule
2727763 he has the strengths that lenny and i lacked you have to realize that you simply cannot take on everything
2727764 we proactively maintain machines in order to prevent the problems before they occur
2727765 it was so inspiring when i first joined the incubator to meet other like minded women
2727766 signing on a new client each small success is truly rewarding
2727767 my advice to anyone with a dream or idea is to just go for it
2727768 i want to put in no uncertain terms that i consider it and i trust most people are with me here much more important to be human than to be anything else
2727769 behind all these labors was another question one of great personal importance for merton
2727770 there is i think nothing in the world more futile than the attempt to find out how a task should be done when one has not yet decided what the task is
2727771 people are like stained glass windows they sparkle and shine when the suns out but when the darkness sets in their true beauty is revealed only if there is light within
2727772 thousands at his bidding speed and post oer land and ocean without rest they also serve who only stand and wait

2727774 did you humbly and patiently accept this mystery of iniquity in your life how did you deal with it did you learn from it to be patient and humble did it teach you to trust not your own ability but my love did it enable you to understand better the mystery of iniquity in the lives of others did it give you the most typical characteristic of a truly religious person that he never judges or condemns the sin and imperfection of others
2727775 you are a lovely kind soul i lubb euu worzz i still have not baked cookies for you
2727776 no s c mo nos vamos a recuperar de esta derrota creo que s lo puedo contestar eso despu s de que juguemos el siguiente encuentro perder en el partido del debut es algo que a nosotros no nos hab a ocurrido nunca antes

2727779 but what if you cannot find a hole to get back down
2727780 and we must build ties to the people of cuba and help advance their liberty by allowing unrestricted family visits and remittances to the island while presenting the cuban regime with a clear choice if it takes significant steps toward democracy beginning with the unconditional release of political prisoners we will be prepared to take steps to begin normalizing relations
2727781 upon which side shall the democratic party fight upon the side of the idle holders of idle capital or upon the side of the struggling masses
2727782 we are an army of light and nothing shall prevail against us and in those places where the sun is darkened it will overcome
2727783 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death

2727788 it isnt one of those things where you drop a meter in the water and read a needle
2727789 that is what its like for a few people but mostly there is a wide variety of symptoms such as pain in your arm or in your jaw for some women it might be a heaviness on their chest
2727790 what we need people to recognise is that once the doubt starts to seep into their minds that something is happening to them thats different to usual
2727791 its not last nights vindaloo and its not indigestion its not sunstroke it might be a heart attack with that doubt they should be ringing 999
2727792 here you can have this if youll let me sleep with your s ew etie tonight
2727793 cut out the middleman find someone you hate and give em a house
2727794 its tough on everybody to have to wait around today at least i didnt get in the middle of a round and have to go back out
2727795 the forecast right now is generally much better than today hopefully dry
2727796 pace of play will be important well need to start on time and need to get everyone out on time
2727797 we should still have time even if theres a playoff for a three hole aggregate score playoff if need be but it will be tight
2727798 i cant believe it i have a chance for tomorrow and i have to wait but its great to be here
2727799 we did obviously try to get play resumed this afternoon
2727800 we had a couple of breaks where it looked like we had a possibility to play but both times cells built up again behind to the west so obviously we did not get out
2727801 yeah if it plays a little longer itll probably set up a little better for me
2727802 the greens are still pretty firm well see they have got 12 hours or so to work on the golf course and it needed a little bit of rain so well just see what happens

2727957 there is no statistical basis for the p125 wage hike petition the p125 demand has become a political battlecry of workers

2727992 the music and writing style of indieheaven artist chris carder has proven to be unique in the contemporary christian music genera and it stems from the fact that he has spent the past three decades traveling the planet sharing his encouraging music most agree that chris sound is infectiously fun while still being undeniably christian when chris is not traveling he can be found in louisville kentucky he is the worship leader at forest park community church in jeffersontown ky and is a husband a father of two a sports nut and a seeker of gods never ending blessings

2727999 he has all the incentive to flee this jurisdiction hes a high risk
2728000 he has to be deposed i said that from last month and now i have to deal with this
2728001 does somebody want me to lock them up in jail for interfering with my process
2728002 told by paul gimenez and horace brooks not to do anything else with southland gaming for various reasons
2728003 he seriously considered the implications of everything that would have been triggered by the approval and chose not to do it
2728004 its nice to see that people have woken up to the idea that they have the power to make change i hope it continues
2728005 but what we really need to do eventually down the road is get to the point where the people decide when a pay raise happens
2728006 the next appropriate action for him to take is to rescind the raises he gave his unclassified cronies
2728007 im happy that democracy prevailed and he listened to the voice of the people i hope that this shows an example that we must rule for the people and not for a party
2728008 it was important that we begin the term without a dark cloud hanging over our head
2728009 im hoping that this level of participation continues the people need to continue this level of participation to voice their opposition or their support of things
2728010 is the right thing to do i think hes done a wise thing
2728011 we have a lot of work to do and this was really tearing the community apart
2728012 i think the governor has taken a prudent action in vetoing the legislation and i would also hope the governor would assist the legislature in doing its job by encouraging the people who work for him to give a true and accurate picture of the financial status of our government
2728013 designed to strengthen deams position as a leader in the rapidly developing market for climate change products
2728014 we believe the shift away from a carbon based economy is a mega trend that will shape the asset management industry for many years we expect return opportunities in sectors like renewable energy water and agribusiness will justify dedicated strategies and we believe climate change will be an important consideration for investment decisions
2728015 from our analysis we found that for at least the next decade climate change will affect sectors and stocks as a complex and enduring economic force which should lead to market inefficiencies and the potential for significant alpha opportunities for institutional and retail investors
2728016 involved in both the mitigation of and the adaptation to climate change
2728017 companies and investors are quickly realizing that climate change is not merely a social political or moral issue it is an economic and business issue as well which is translating into a wave of investment and innovation
2728018 we are talking to institutional clients about the different strategies that can be developed
2728019 while being unsure and even disagreeing with the scientific evidence look for investment opportunities created by early movers
2728020 a network of institutional investors and financial institutions that promotes better understanding of the financial risks and investment opportunities posed by climate change
2728021 incr members have invested over 1 5 billion of their assets in renewable energy and other clean technology ventures
2728022 the investments cover such technologies as hydrogen fuel cells ethanol geothermal facilities and advanced materials
2728023 this is a business opportunity in an ethical space its a fantastic combination
2728024 we have no motive and no suspects at this time
2728025 they said it sounded like a sheet of plywood hitting the ground
2728026 it was money we had out of our budget czm program income some cost savings and so forth i cant recall precisely
2728027 none of that money was made available to use during this process
2728028 it may have been appropriated but it was never allotted
2728029 i dont think we were close with regard to the money they were asking
2728030 before we close on a deal we need to know a source of funding
2728031 in this case with the government of the virgin islands it did not appear that there was any viable funding source
2728032 as wonderful a piece of property as that is we were not in a position to invest a substantial amount of money
2728033 completed initial steps to acquire the lindqvist beach property for use as a public beach
2728034 the question comes down to how much work does it really take
2728035 some fee increase makes sense but not a huge increase
2728036 the fee structure of existing domestic short extension products have typically charged annual management fees in the range of 60 to 90 basis points
2728037 for separately managed accounts desim will consider a variety of fee structures including those involving performance based components desim anticipates negotiating fees for separately managed accounts on a case by case basis considering in the analysis factors such as among other things account size
2728038 we are a little shocked by how quickly and violently the pricing has gone down
2728039 people are pretty quiet about what theyre paying including some of our best clients
2728040 the marketing pitch were hearing from quant driven managers is that its really easy that its basically the same process same trading platform same research base
2728041 the fee structure should be consistent with existing products on offer by the investment manager
2728042 a short extension strategy will likely utilize some of the same skills investment ideas and ultimately alpha already being offered by existing products hence the fees charged on the new product should also be consistent at least to some extent with existing products
2728043 there were encouraging signs that the hotel and hospitality industry was on the rebound the downward slide in visitor arrivals appeared to be abating
2728044 it hasnt been this bad since the gulf war in 1991
2728045 its hard to differentiate between 9 11 and the economy
2728046 is still in recession from 9 11 and theres a massive problem with the economy in the u s
2728047 if it werent for those efforts it could be a lot worse
2728048 we hope the department will continue to keep our name out there
2728049 someone can get psyched to go but when they see how much it costs to fly there theyre going to go somewhere else
2728050 it certainly didnt help when the travel section of every major newspaper across the country wrote about carnival pulling out of st croix because of crime
2728051 if someone sees that theyre not going to even consider st croix for a vacation
2728052 citing safety concerns following crimes against passengers and crew members
2728053 i believe the article could have been more precise in its depiction of the overall situation on st croix
2728054 there are other cruise lines who were not mentioned in the article that are still making calls to st croix whose passengers are happy with their experiences on the island
2728055 certainly im nervous on both of them with usair in chapter 11 and american announcing flight cutbacks
2728056 i think the trend will continue the remainder of the year will probably be slightly less than last year
2728057 right now i should be getting bookings for christmas and presidents day weekend but im just not seeing it
2728058 ritalin and amphetamine frequently cause the very same problems they are supposed to treat inattention hyperactivity and impulsivity
2728059 emotional suffering including depression exhaustion and suicide this can make children seem psychiatrically disturbed and lead mistakenly to increased doses of medication ritalin is addictive and can become a gateway drug to other addictions it is a common drug of abuse among children and adults
2728060 1and thou son of man take thee a sharp knife take thee a barbers razor and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard then take thee balances to weigh and divide the hair 2thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city when the days of the siege are fulfilled and thou shalt take a third part and smite about it with a knife and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind and i will draw out a sword after them 3thou shalt also take thereof a few in number and bind them in thy skirts
2728061 and it shall come to pass that in all the land saith the lord two parts therein shall be cut off and die but the third shall be left therein 9and i will bring the third part through the fire and will refine them as silver is refined and will try them as gold is tried they shall call on my name and i will hear them i will say it is my people and they shall say the lord is my god
2728062 for the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of god
2728063 for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming
2728064 or judged discerned and distinguished from true christians and real believers or rather that they might be condemned and punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord and have their portion in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone where the devil the false prophet and the beast whose followers they are will be cast and it is but a righteous thing with god to give them up to such delusion that they may be damned
2728065 we believe in this present time as in times past the house of judah and the house of israel have been physically separated and have not physically joined together and have not been physically reunited as a corporate people in the land of israel as described by the prophets
2728066 we believe that the house of israel led by ephraim who is scattered in the nations and their future reunion with the house of judah is one of the most significant messianic prophecies concerning the role and function of the messiah of israel yeshua jesus stated that he needed to die on the tree so that his two houses or sheepfolds could become one john 10 14 17
2728067 now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back into perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul
2728068 ruin or loss physical spiritual or eternal damnable perish waste
2728069 i am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel
2728070 we believe in this present time as in times past the house of judah and the house of israel have been physically separated and have not physically joined together and have not been physically reunited as a corporate people in the land of israel as described by the prophets
2728071 we believe that the house of israel led by ephraim who is scattered in the nations and their future reunion with the house of judah is one of the most significant messianic prophecies concerning the role and function of the messiah of israel yeshua jesus stated that he needed to die on the tree so that his two houses or sheepfolds could become one john 10 14 17
2728072 and other sheep i have which are not of this fold them also i must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one shepherd
2728073 isaiah 42 1 4 then is it jacob the patriarch in whom the gentiles and yourselves shall trust or is it not christ as therefore christ is the israel and the jacob even so we who have been quarried out from the bowels of christ are the true israelitic race
2728074 isaiah 42 1 4 then is it jacob the patriarch in whom the gentiles and gt yourselves shall trust or is it not christ as therefore christ is gt the israel and the jacob even so we who have been quarried out from gt the bowels of christ are the true israelitic race but let us attend gt rather to the very word and i will bring forth he says the seed gt out of jacob and out of judah and it shall inherit my holy gt mountain and mine elect and my servants shall possess the gt inheritance and shall dwell there and there shall be folds of gt flocks in the thicket and the valley of achor shall be a gt resting place of cattle for the people who have sought me gt gt but as for you who forsake me and forget my holy mountain and gt prepare a table for demons and fill out drink for the demon i shall gt give you to the sword you shall all fall with a slaughter for i gt called you and you hearkened not and did evil before me and did gt choose that wherein i delighted not isaiah 65 9 12 such are the gt words of scripture understand therefore that the seed of jacob now gt referred to is something else and not as may be supposed spoken of gt your people for it is not possible for the seed of jacob to leave an gt entrance for the descendants of jacob or for god to have accepted gt the very same persons whom he had reproached with unfitness for the gt inheritance and promise it to them again but as there the prophet gt says and now o house of jacob come and let us walk in the light gt of the lord for he has sent away his people the house of jacob gt because their land was full as at the first of soothsayers and gt divinations even so it is necessary for us here to observe that gt there are two seeds of judah and two races as there are two houses gt of jacob the one begotten by blood and flesh the other by faith and gt the spirit
2728075 i will put a new spirit within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and will give them a heart of flesh
2728076 after this i will return and will build again the tabernacle of david which is fallen down and i will build again the ruins thereof and i will set it up
2728077 simeon hath declared how god at the first did visit the gentiles to take out of them a people for his name and to this agree the words of the prophets as it is written
2728078 afterward shall the children of israel return and seek the lord their god and david their king and shall fear the lord and his goodness in the latter days
2728079 for thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left and thy seed shall inherit the gentiles and make the desolate cities to be inhabited
2728080 and all israel in the days of zerubbabel and in the days of nehemiah gave the portions of the singers and the porters every day his portion and they sanctified holy things unto the levites and the levites sanctified them unto the children of aaron
2728081 and the children of israel which were come again out of captivity and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land to seek the lord god of israel did eat and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy for the lord had made them joyful and turned the heart of the king of assyria unto them to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of god the god of israel
2728082 and hezekiah sent to all israel and judah and wrote letters also to ephraim and manasseh that they should come to the house of the lord at jerusalem to keep the passover unto the lord god of israel so the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all israel and judah and according to the commandment of the king saying ye children of israel turn again unto the lord god of abraham isaac and israel and he will return to the remnant of you that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of assyria so the posts passed from city to city through the country of ephraim and manasseh even unto zebulun but they laughed them to scorn and mocked them nevertheless divers of asher and manasseh and of zebulun humbled themselves and came to jerusalem 12 also in judah the hand of god was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of the lord
2728083 ye children of israel turn again unto the lord god of abraham isaac and israel and he will return to the remnant of you that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of assyria
2728084 passed from city to city through the country of ephraim and manasseh

2728118 there is no mehdi army here there is only the iraqi army
2728119 there is only one language the language of the law
2728120 hard to believe if we win that game you would think it would have been 3 2 2 1 hes pitched as well against us as anybody its baseball you can never figure anything
2728121 i honestly had no idea until you guys all told me
2728122 i really had no idea as long as im having good at bats and going up there and not making early in the count bad outs then im ok itll turn around obviously 0 for 29 it didnt turn around for a while
2728123 you go up there and try to put a good at bat together
2728124 that first at bat didnt work out in a hit but i felt it was a good at bat it was 0 2 early and i worked it to a 3 2 count i had a couple pitches missed one foul to left missed one foul to right at the end of the day to me thats a good at bat
2728125 even when hes not been swinging well hes never backed off and given up he continues to take his swings and all of a sudden he runs into something and he gets going again

2728130 we certainly wont be looking to re invent the wheel because you only have to look at the success of the team over the last six years

2728143 as the pre season has gone on i think we have played better but we didnt play really well today
2728144 in the first 15 minutes we didnt get out of our half but the pleasing thing was that the back four looked solid and they headed everything
2728145 we could have cleared our lines better but as the game went on we got more into it

2728162 kenapa tidak diturunkan kepada kita saja yang lebih mulia dibanding manusia
2728163 hee para dewata akupun mengetahui hal itu namun sudah menjadi takdir tuhan yang maha kuasa bahwa ilmu rahasia hidup justru diserahkan pada manusia bukankah tertulis dalam kitab suci bahwa malaikat mempertanyakan pada tuhan mengapa manusia yang dijadikan khalifah padahal mereka ini suka menumpahkan darah
2728164 duh anak begawan wisrawa ketahuilah bahwa para dewata memutuskan memberi amanah serat sastra jendra kepadamu untuk diajarkan kepada umat manusia

2728167 bila apa yang dilakukan wisrawa bisa nanti kayangan akan terbalik manusia akan menguasai kita karena telah sempurna ilmunya sedangkan kita belum sempat dan mampu mempelajarinya

2728186 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2728187 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2728188 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2728189 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2728190 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2728196 by calling work coveralls a prison outfit i think is rather insulting to all those people that work out in the economy every day in some kind of business that requires them because of the nature of their work to wear a coverall
2728197 public school dress codes should be limited to whats necessary to guard against actual disruption to the educational process and threats to safety

2728201 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2728202 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2728203 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2728266 in 1953 i was smuggled out of hungary by a professional flesh peddler and landed for three years in munich germany thats because my father was working at radio free europe there as a director of sports coverage i used to hang out a lot at the facilities in the english garden and befriended a lot of expatriates from the various iron curtain countries who helped the effort to inform listeners in those countries about what went on in the world and whatever else they were supposed to be doing later when i began to think more carefully about political matters i had some trepidations about whether rfe and similar ventures carried out by the united states government could pass my libertarian test for what amounts to proper public policy should american citizens be forced to fund this kind of undertaking including voice of america and later several others beaming news and lets face it propaganda to victims of soviet and soviet bloc oppression can this be construed as legitimate foreign policy for a bona fide free society why or why not

2728304 sending that by email was the worst thing ive ever done but i cant turn back the clock he was obviously upset and i should have given him more respect but there was stuff we just couldnt sort out

2728306 yves saint laurent was not only an extraordinary designer but made a significant contribution to film making this season an obvious choice for acmi and a fitting way to celebrate his life and career through film this spring
2728307 catherine deneuve and yves saint laurent did more than create the most scandalous erotic film of the day belle de jour gave a double life to luxury clothes so powerful that designers have been fantasizing about it ever since
2728308 i think the players as are most of us are forgiving and want to see the good in people so i think thats how he approached it and thats how we accepted it
2728309 i dont think it took our team very long to take him back
2728310 with chad you always know what youre going to get on the field not just on sundays but also in the work week
2728311 he works hard thats just how he is and i think its good for the team obviously hes a great talent for the offense and we need him here
2728312 i dont care who you are in this game its going to take you a while to get back
2728313 hes coming back quickly but he certainly still has a long ways to go to get to where he wants to be
2728314 i talked with him roughly once a week in the offseason and i know that when it comes time to play football he loves to do that and hell want to be the best he can be
2728315 does that mean we wont have some rocky road ahead hes an emotional person but i think hes here to do a job and do it well
2728316 when he does things right his productivity is second to none in the league when he lets his focus slip it hurts us because one of our best players is underperforming
2728317 its like any team when one of your best performers is underperforming it has an effect on everyone else and when one of your best players is playing well it raises everybody else
2728318 how can i be more honest accept things that dont go as planned
2728319 when you try to combat everything at the end of the day you realize that youre responsible for yourself
2728320 look at the attention i get its because i throw a football but thats what society values thats not what god values
2728321 he didnt invent the game we did i have some eye hand coordination and i can throw the ball i dont think that matters to god
2728322 its important because i want people to know that im not the best because im sanya richards
2728323 im the best because of god i truly believe we cant will ourselves to win i hope people see the same thing i see
2728324 so long as you practice your religious belief in conformity with the constitution and the laws there will be no problem
2728325 the practice of religion should be within the laws the chinese government is against conducting other activities in the name of religion
2728326 the conduct of participants at all sites areas and venues includes all actions reactions attitudes or manifestations of any kind by a person or group of persons including but not limited to their look external appearance clothing gestures and written or oral statements
2728327 as in all olympic games such conduct must also of course comply with the laws of the host state
2728328 there are very specific provisions on how an athlete should practice his religion or beliefs during the games
2728329 as an athlete he or she should follow that charter thats their guideline
2728330 is designed to provide a more complete understanding of the role as an ambassador of the country as an olympic athlete
2728331 frankly its none of our business we as an olympic committee never do anything to impede an athletes freedom from expressing faith
2728332 and if i dont i feel somethings missing and not because i think god wont bless me but its part of getting ready
2728333 thats my way of thanking god for giving me this opportunity
2728334 not a single participant in the games will be allowed to give a political opinion at the olympic venues
2728335 its very clear that god asks us to share this
2728336 to refrain from any political religious or other forms of discussion at events or in the olympic village
2728337 i was a little bit flustered about how i should approach
2728338 and god has called me to train and participate in the olympic games someone else might be called to protest and boycott this i feel winning a gold medal would give me a greater stage afterward like on tv or in schools
2728339 i see it as a very small thing i may not be able to hold up a sign or tear off my shirt with a tattoo of john 3 16 but it doesnt mean i cant have a smiling face and still give glory to god
2728340 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2728341 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2728342 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2728343 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2728344 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2728345 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for
2728346 that was amazing setting another world record you cant ask for anything else that was a great way to start off the meet for usa
2728347 it was amazing it was emotional it was such a dramatic moment
2728348 if we complied with a demand to grossly exceed the well established market for drafted players we would severely harm the pirates ability to build the championship caliber club our fans so richly deserve

2728350 china always breaks the record you look at how many internet users china just surpassed the u s in internet users if you can draw a huge number to watch two chinese players in the nba imagine what you could draw if you had five chinese playing
2728351 the basketball team might as well be called the nike team
2728352 they used to be extremely arrogant and it was kind of a turnoff for the world
2728353 the first thing i noticed yesterday about watching them play against turkey they were actually pretty friendly and were sort of respectful to the referees
2728354 im going to worry about learning english all the way
2728355 that was way before i knew what it meant to be an olympian and wear the red white and blue
2728356 i didnt know that in 2004 i was kind of starting to get the feeling in 2006 i think the nba title is still hot but they both go hand in hand for me now
2728357 i mean we grow up thinking about nba titles being an olympian was something i grew up never thinking about thats why at the beginning i didnt know what it meant but now i do
2728358 china always breaks the record you look at how many internet users china just surpassed the u s in internet users if you can draw a huge number to watch two chinese players in the nba imagine what you could draw if you had five chinese playing
2728359 the first thing i noticed yesterday about watching them play against turkey they were actually pretty friendly and were sort of respectful to the referees it actually depends on the people themselves and the roster is completely different from what it was four years ago or even two years ago
2728360 im going to worry about learning english all the way
2728361 that was way before i knew what it meant to be an olympian and wear the red white and blue
2728362 i didnt know that in 2004 i was kind of starting to get the feeling in 2006 i think the nba title is still hot but they both go hand in hand for me now

2728365 what happens including any error messages when you try to edit or manage your account when i try to upgrade to family pack it lets me select my exsisting debit card then says card auth successful but server error i have several pending requests on my card from apple your support chat is useless your engineers claim they are working on the fault if it is that hard why dont you just stop using web 2 0 for a bit to allow us to upgrade our accounts and then when you have sorted it change over to the current layout as it is i cannot upgrade my account and just keep getting requests to my bank its a case of do you want our money or not i have tried everything the support team have said including spaces in my card trying upper case clearing the cache cookies etc it is not working i will use another company to host my site and to use for storage if you cannot sort this soon p s chat for the uk would be nice too
2728366 if i had my choice and i could make a living at it i would stay in independent ball
2728367 its a unique level as long as you can work with your owner and its a situation where i was comfortable like a place like brockton
2728368 if it wasnt for that anything to do with money i dont need to be in the big leagues
2728369 its hard to imagine yourself making it to the big leagues even as a coach because the odds are against you its a little scary thinking of going to affiliated ball you could be in one year and out the next and then what
2728370 its a great place for somebody like me who never made it to the big leagues and may not have gotten an opportunity to even continue my career in baseball with an affiliated team
2728371 i was fortunate enough to have played in this league and transitioned into coaching they brockton fortunately took a chance on me not having managerial experience thats always a question mark for teams to do
2728372 because if you look around a lot of the can am managers have played in the big leagues such as atlantic citys cecil fielder or nashuas rick miller or even managed in the big leagues sussexs hal lanier
2728373 it used to be that way and that gave me hope
2728374 and then when you see all these big names it makes me feel happy and lucky to be here so im just enjoying my time as a manager learning as much as i can and trying to win youre trying to build a resume
2728375 it makes it a little more fun a little more rewarding i have 22 guys i have to worry about im kind of my own boss in a lot of ways we make our own moves if a player isnt producing we can go out and look for somebody else
2728376 in affiliated ball you have to put up with the first rounders so theres some problems that could happen
2728377 you learn a lot more from losing that you dont want to go through it again
2728378 its very painful you learn a lot about yourself about how you handle adversity and how you handle the players when they go through difficult times
2728379 when youre losing you do a lot of things wrong as a manger when youre winning everything seems to go your way the finals the first year its not that easy you think you have a system and way of putting together a team theres just so much that goes on in independent baseball the personalities you have on your team just how they click on the field to injuries one guy has a career year and then the next year cant hit theres just so many variables involved its like a big puzzle youre just trying to figure out what works
2728380 i dont have many contacts left from my pirates days because theyve all changed and gone all over the place im using our ownership to help with contacts it san diego wouldnt be a bad thing for me thats probably my best shot im from california
2728381 but even then ive been a hitting coach for three years a manager for three years and they still want more
2728382 it can also be frustrating at times it plays on you
2728383 it will be like college again playing 36 in one day
2728384 it happens and everyone else has to do it too so we just have to go out there and deal with it theyve got 12 hours to work on the golf course and it needed the rain
2728385 i think it is fair to say they will be significantly more receptive
2728386 almost perfect yesterday i finished very mad with my round and now after this 18 holes i cant believe it i will have a chance for tomorrow i have to wait but its great to be here
2728387 i guess the course is going to change quite a bit
2728388 its still going to be playing difficult but probably not to the extreme it was playing the last couple of days
2728389 i made a double bogey at the 18th because i was so mad i was almost fighting for the lead and suddenly i was trying to make the cut so i was going mad the rest of the whole round
2728390 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2728391 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2728392 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2728393 one minute youre in a quarterback battle and the next minute its completely different there are two ways to look at this you can get down about it or turn it into a positive i get to pick the brain of a future hall of famer that chance doesnt come along too often
2728394 it is good to have him here when you play with a legend you cant help but feed off of it i think hell fit right in with both the team and the city
2728395 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year
2728396 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the new york jets and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2728397 thus says eternal let not a wise man boost of his wisdom and let not the mighty man boost of his might and let not the rich man boost of his riches but let him who boosts boost of this that he understands and knows me that i am eternal who exercises loving kindness justice and righteousness on earth for i delight in these things says eternal
2728398 i can say here what i said earlier about the shema this is the faith all else is commentary
2728399 we then come to our three great words hesed mishpat and tzedakah in these the sovereign himself delights after all they are a description of his very character as a prescription of his way for mankind
2728400 he loves righteousness and justice the earth if full of the loving kindness of the eternal
2728401 righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne loving kindness and truth go before you
2728402 there is an interesting text in the early part of genesis the eternal creator determines to share with abraham his intimate friend his plans for utter destruction of the wicked one of sodom and gomorrah the eternal reasons within himself
2728403 shall i hide from abraham what i am about to do
2728404 there you have it the very way of eternal is defined precisely it is doing and practicing tzedakah and mishpat the entire plan of creator involving the very message of abraham depends upon this preservation and extension of this way
2728405 human beings have been apt at developing their own systems of ethics and morals however when the scriptures use these terms something absolutely specific and concrete is intended
2728406 there is a definite way of eternal it is not determined by shifting sands of human culture and opinion it has never changed in the least from the creation of adam until our day we can specifically know it that way it is actually laid out in concrete form with all of its details
2728407 there is only one place and one place alone that one can truly come to know and understand the way of eternal
2728408 but his delight is in the torah of the eternal and in his torah he meditates day and night
2728409 the hebrew scriptures always speak of the torah of the eternal in the most positive way note the following verses
2728410 oh how i love your torah it is my mediation all the day
2728411 open my eyes that i may behold wonderful things out of your torah
2728412 eighteen times in psalm 119 david exclaims his love for and delight in the torah
2728413 regrettably through the greatest deception of western history millions of
2728414 torah is a broad term that can refer to total divine revelation to humankind
2728415 the torah is the perpetual standard of tzedakah and mishpat
2728416 human beings long for the supernatural for some revelation about the mystery of our existence
2728417 bind up the testimony seal the torah among my disciples and when they say to you consult the mediums and the spiritualists who whisper and mutter but shouldnt a people consult their creator and go to the torah and the testimony and if they do not speak according to this word it is because they have no light then they will look to the earth and behold the stress and darkness the gloom of anguish and they will be driven away into darkness
2728418 this is an important and fascinating portion of prophetic scripture
2728419 and you shall put the covering on the top of the arc of the covenant in the arc you shall put the testimony which i shall give to you
2728420 here we learn that the testimony is something quite specific
2728421 and when he eternal had finished speaking with him moses on mount sinai he eternal gave moses two tablets of the testimony tablets of stone written with the finger of creator exodus 31 18
2728422 these mysterious tablets were further described in the next chapter
2728423 these ten commandments are the heart and core of the torah
2728424 this testimony offers in a beautiful summary form the outline of the creators way for all humankind
2728425 because abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge my commandments my statutes and my laws
2728426 although these men and women did not know of the torah in the precise and full form the nation of israel knows it they certainly knew this basic way of justice and righteousness see gen
2728427 those who maintain that this awesome testimony of eternal the ten words spoken by the eternal himself that they have been abrogated altered or superseded are under the most serious kind of deception let us understand what would be required to restore the abrahamic faith to this world
2728428 and many people shall say come you and let us go back to the mountain of the eternal to the house of the sovereign of jacob he will teach us his ways and we will walk in his path and out of zion shall go forth the law torah and words of eternal from jerusalem
2728429 although the torah was given once for all by moses to israel at mount sinai it is essentially universal for all humankind
2728430 know that man shall not live by bread alone but man lives by every word that proceeds from the mouth of eternal
2728431 the torah addresses all aspects of human life social relations economic justice health and hygiene ecology criminal justice sexual conduct and on and on the torah is a blueprint framed in an ancient israelitish setting of a way of justice and righteousness for all humanity until the whole world turns to the principles of the torah we will continue to suffer all of its collective ills and horrors the prophets make that clear the collapse of our human societies and the judgement that comes upon all nations on the great and terrible day of eternal
2728432 the hebrew prophets go hand and hand with the torah
2728433 each individual in seeking a relationship with our sovereign directly and without contemplation will find his or her own way to express torah faith and observance appropriate to the situation i can not think of any commandment of the eternal sovereign that is to be abrogated or ignored
2728434 the deeply spiritual nurture that comes from meditating on the direct words of eternal himself as revealed in torah and the prophets is lost to many
2728435 to live by every word that proceeds out of his mouth
2728436 oh eternal creator of the universe father we come before your presence in the very control room of the universe in the third heaven to thank you for the knowledge you have given and to thank you father for the knowledge of the faith of abraham
2728437 the talmud the great rabbinical thesaurus which grew up during the first four to six centuries of the
2728438 fringes must contain a blue thread on the hem of a persons outer garment
2728439 but in the talmud the rabbis decided not to include a blue thread in the fringes which i might add
2728440 the koran is the sacred book of islam on which the religion of more than two hundred million mohammedans is founded being regarded by them as the immediate word of god
2728441 these histories are chiefly those of the old testament but the deviations from the biblical narratives are very marked many of alterations are found in legendary anecdotes of the jewish haggada and the new testament apocrypha

2728445 the church of jesus christ of latter day saints commonly known as mormons a religious sect founded by joseph smith he said that the angel moroni appeared to him three times and told him that the bible of the western continent the supplement to the new testament was buried on a hill called cumorh now commonly known as mormon hill
2728446 he has shown you o man what is good and what does eternal require of you but to do justly to love mercy and to walk humbly with your creator micah 6 8
2728447 and his eternals feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of olives which is before jerusalem on the east zech 14 4
2728448 then the moon shall be confounded and the sun ashamed when eternal of hosts shall reign in mount zion and in jerusalem and before his ancients gloriously isaiah 24 23
2728449 of the increase of his government and peace there will be no end upon the throne of david and over his kingdom to order it and establish it with judgment and justice
2728450 bind up the testimony seal the law among my disciples
2728451 the hebrew scriptures called the tanakh incorrectly labeled the old testament by christians are divided into three parts torah prophets and psalms or writings
2728452 many people shall come and say come and let us go up to the mountain of eternal to the house of the god of jacob he will teach us his ways and we shall walk in his paths for out of zion shall go forth the torah and the word of eternal from jerusalem
2728453 for i have known him in order that he may command his children and his household after him that they keep the way of eternal to do righteousness and justice that eternal may bring to abraham what he has spoken to him
2728454 i wrote and recorded an album in 3 days therefore i hereby proclaim myself pop genius

2728474 come let us cast lots that we may know for whose cause this trouble has come upon us
2728475 please tell us for whose cause is this trouble upon us what is your occupation and where do you come from what is your country and of what people are you
2728476 i am a hebrew and i fear eternal the creator of heaven who made the sea and the dry land
2728477 i am a hebrew and i fear eternal one one single being the creator of the heavens who made the seas and the dry land
2728478 take now your son your only son isaac whom you love and go to the land of moriah and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which i shall tell you
2728479 stay here with the donkey the lad and i will go yonder and worship and we will come back to you
2728480 get you out of this country and from your family and from your fathers house to a land that i will show you i will make you a great nation i will bless you and make your name great and you shall be a blessing i will bless those that bless you and curse those that curse you and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed
2728481 look the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for the burnt offering
2728482 my son the creator will provide for himself the lamb for the burnt offering
2728483 do not lay your hand on the lad or do anything to him because now i know that you fear your creator since you have not withheld your son your only son from him
2728484 but you israel are my servant jacob whom i have chosen the descendants of abraham my friend
2728485 there shall come forth a rod from jesse the stem of jesse and a branch shall grow out of its roots
2728486 there shall be a root of jesse that will be plucked from the soil he shall stand as a banner to his people for him gentiles shall seek and where he is will be a glorious place on earth
2728487 hear o israel eternal our sovereign the lord is one you shall love eternal your sovereign with all your heart with all your soul and with all your strength and these words commandments which i command you today shall be in your heart you shall teach them diligently to your children and shall talk of them when you sit in your house when you walk by the way when you lie down and when you rise up the above affirmation defines what the abrahamic hebrew faith is all else is just words on how to fulfill it the shema is so fundamental to the abrahamic faith that it bears repeating but this time from a different version deuteronomy 6 4 7 tanakh 13 hear o israel eternal is our sovereign eternal is one 14 you shall love eternal your sovereign with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might take to heart these instructions with which i charge you this day impress them upon your children recite them when you stay at home and when you are away when you lie down and when you get up there is only one sovereign one saviour up to index few who claim to follow scriptural revelation uphold the vital affirmation that there is only one sovereign the creator chose the people of israel to be witnesses to this simple pillar of scriptural faith with all of its implications notice carefully the following quotation from isaiah where the sovereign himself speaks in the first person addressing the nation of israel and he makes this point very clearly isaiah 43 10 you are my witnesses declares eternal and my servants whom i have chosen in order that you may know and believe me and understand that i am he before me there was no other god or no other deity formed and there will be none after me i even i am eternal and there is no savior besides me
2728488 i am the sovereign of your father the sovereign of abraham the sovereign of isaac and the sovereign of jacob
2728489 the one who will be the one who is and the one who was
2728490 that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of judah in all the land of egypt saying adonay 136 yehovih 3069 lives behold i will watch over them for adversity and not for good and all the men of judah who are in the land of egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by famine until there is an end to them yet a small number who escape the sword shall return from the land of egypt to the land of judah but with out the name and all the remnant of judah who have gone to the land of egypt to dwell there shall know whose words will stand mine or theirs
2728491 call to me and i will answer you i will tell you great and mighty things which you do not know
2728492 if we do not know what his name is how can we call on it
2728493 eternal eternal sovereign merciful and gracious longsuffering and abounding in goodness and truth keeping mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin but by no means clearing the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and the childrens children to the third and the fourth generation
2728494 well i know what it says but because of this or that excuse i did it but eternal is a loving sovereign and i know he will understand
2728495 i know it says to get rid of leavening from our homes but you know im on a limited income and i just cant afford to throw that away im sure our loving sovereign will understand
2728496 i know adam said not to eat the fruit but its good for food and its pleasant to look upon and im hungry and im sure the loving sovereign will understand
2728497 the scripture said to roast the lamb but they have already boiled it and i am sure the creator is going to understand
2728498 merciful and gracious and slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness
2728499 merciful gracious and slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness
2728500 full of compassion slow to anger and great in mercy eternal is good to all his tender mercies are over all his works

2728560 primarily based on its view that parents have an absolute constitutional right to homeschool their children
2728561 we filed our original opinion on feb 28 2008 granting the petition on the bases that 1 california statutory law does not permit homeschooling and 2 this prohibition does not violate the u s constitution
2728562 in order to provide an opportunity for further argument on the multiple complex issues involved in this case including but not limited to 1 additional california statutes that might bear upon the issue and 2 potentially applicable provisions of the california constitution
2728563 i have never seen such an impressive array of people and organizations coming to the defense of homeschooling
2728564 tens of thousands of california parents teaching over 166 000 homeschooled children are now breathing easier
2728565 homeschooling was initially expressly permitted in california when the compulsory education law was enacted in 1903
2728566 in 1929 however homeschool was amended out of the law and children who were not educated in public or private schools could be taught privately only by a credentialed tutor
2728567 subsequent developments in the law call this conclusion into question although the legislature did not amend the statutory scheme so as to expressly permit homeschooling more recent enactments demonstrate an apparent acceptance by the legislature of the proposition that homeschooling is taking place in california with homeschools allowed as private schools
2728568 recent statutes indicate that the legislature is aware that some parents in california homeschool their children by declaring their homes to be private schools moreover several statutory enactments indicate a legislative approval of homeschooling by exempting homeschools from requirements otherwise applicable to private schools
2728569 it is our view that the proper course of action is to interpret the earlier statutes in light of the later ones and to recognize as controlling the legislatures apparent acceptance of the proposition that homeschools are permissible in california when conducted as a private school
2728570 a parent or guardian working exclusively with his or her children
2728571 we therefore conclude that home schools may constitute private schools
2728572 to issue any reasonable orders for the care of a dependent child including orders limiting the right of the parents to make educational decisions for the child
2728573 because the united states supreme court has held that parents possess a constitutional right to direct the education of their children it is argued that any restriction on homeschooling is a violation of this constitutional right we disagree we conclude that an order requiring a dependent child to attend school outside the home in order to protect that childs safety is not an unconstitutional violation of the parents right to direct the education of their children
2728574 parents possess a constitutional liberty interest in directing the education of their children but the right must yield to state interests in certain circumstances
2728575 in this case the restriction on homeschooling would arise in a proceeding in which the children have already been found dependent due to abuse and neglect of a sibling
2728576 should a dependency court conclude in the proper exercise of its discretion that due to the history of abuse and neglect in the family requiring a dependent child to have regular contact with mandated reporters is necessary to guarantee the childs safety that order would satisfy strict scrutiny there can be no dispute that the childs safety is a compelling governmental interest restricting homeschooling also appears to be narrowly tailored to achieving that goal without contact with mandated reporters it may well be that the childs safety cannot be guaranteed without removing the child from the parents custody as such the restriction on homeschooling would be the least restrictive means of achieving the goal of protecting the children they would be permitted to continue to live at home with their parents but their educators would change in order to provide them an extra layer of protection
2728577 that mother has a teaching credential such that the children can be said to be receiving an education from a credentialed tutor
2728578 not the quality of evidence that permits us to say that application of californias compulsory public school education law to them violates their first amendment rights
2728579 such sparse representations are too easily asserted by any parent who wishes to homeschool his or her child
2728580 they teach things that are totally contrary to what we believe
2728581 when they are much more mature they can deal with these issues alternative lifestyles and such or whether they came from primordial slop at the present time its my job to teach them the correct way of thinking
2728582 the juvenile court judge terminated jurisdiction over the two young l children in a hearing held on july 10 2008
2728583 some schools will be able to provide intensive preparation for their pupils and others will not
2728584 it is quite disgraceful if universities are saying we are not going to use this measure because we are afraid of what it is going to show
2728585 it is a terrible situation to get in to that higher education is avoiding the best qualified candidates because of where they were educated in a bid to comply with state school benchmarks set by its paymasters
2728586 we will have good institutions that should be recruiting the brightest talent trying to fix admissions by ignoring a new grade
2728587 if there are reservations they should be about potential differences between subjects and exam boards in the awarding of a not how different schools will perform
2728588 this is woolly lilly livered thinking and not very honest it shows the extent to which universities are cowered by government pressure to widen participation they should be giving credit to pupils who are best equipped to do well in the subject they are applying for
2728589 it was noted that the a grade was intended to be awarded only to the highest scoring percentage of students who would largely be in attendance at independent schools
2728590 there are some concerns that selection on the basis of a might have adverse effects on widening participation
2728591 other institutions are not including the a in their offers as they feel that this is likely to disadvantage state schools
2728592 the admissions group felt they required a more informed debate on the issue and have asked for an indicator from the 1994 group of universities of which it is a member

2728596 weve gone from a culture that values higher education for the civilizing influence it has produced and it should civilize and temper the worst impulses of humanity
2728597 now we have a vocationalizing influence our students are not coming to be better citizens but to be employable

2728713 steampunk a sub genre of science fiction offers a great deal of what is most flamboyantly eccentrically visually and adventurously interesting about the victorian era and its curious scientific hopes and speculations
2728714 weve tried to provide a blend of the traditional and idiosyncratic the new and the old while remaining true to the idea of steampunk as dark pseudo victorian fun youll find stories about mechanistic golems infernal machines the characters of jules verne and of course airships
2728715 is a way of re examining our interactions with machines to this end we find whimsy in the age of steam engines and the promises true and false offered us by the 19th century so steampunk is an aesthetic a genre a subculture and a philosophy that revolves around this understanding

2728726 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2728727 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2728728 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2728729 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2728730 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2728731 now there is only a series of plateaus staggered grey shelves where grass struggles to grow in crushed rock and shale
2728732 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2728733 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2728762 how much does it pain my heart and my soul to announce to the palestinian people the arab and islamic world and to everyone who loves peace and freedom the passing of the star of palestine
2728763 the absence of our great poet mahmud darwish the love of palestine and the pioneer of the modern palestinian cultural project will leave a great void in our cultural political and national life
2728764 darwish is the essential breath of the palestinian people the eloquent witness of exile and belonging
2728765 before anything mahmud darwish was a great poet who possessed real poetic power
2728766 he quickly became the national palestinian poet the poet of the exile and of the refugees

2728779 sir ronald aylmer fisher was by far the dominant personality in this field in the period 1925 1960 on the technical side fisher had a deep intuitive understanding and produced a steady stream of important research in genetics
2728780 fishers later dominance of the field derives less from his technical work than from his flamboyant personal style and the wordly power that went with his official position in charge of the work and destiny of many students and subordinates for 14 years 1919 1933 he was at the rothamsted agricultural research facility with an increasing number of assistants and visiting students then holder of the chair of eugenics at cambridge where he also became president of caius college he was elected fellow of the royal society in 1929 and was knighted in 1952
2728781 in sharp contrast to jeffreys fisher possessed of a colossal overbearing ego thrashed about in the field attacking the work of everyone else a footnote provides details on this with equal ferocity somehow early in life fishers mind became captured by the dogma that by probability one is allowed to mean only emphasis mine limiting frequency in a random experiment
2728782 researchers in some fields such as medical testing found it impossible to get their work published if they failed to follow fishers recipes to the letter
2728783 we recognize fishers high competence in the problems which concerned him had fisher tried more complex problems we think he would have perceived the superior power of jeffreys bayesian methods rather quickly
2728784 inside every non bayesian there is a bayesian struggling to get out
2728785 while many medical blogs provide valuable information to the public are respectful in tone and are written anonymously others pose a threat to patient privacy and have the potential to threaten the integrity of the medical profession
2728786 unfortunately no professional organization has taken the initiative to provide guidance on this issue as the number of medical blogs grows professional organizations medical educators and the blogging community must address the challenge of this new medium by setting guidelines and standards for what is appropriate

2728796 this is one of the best records jimmy degrasso has recorded
2728797 in order to prevent the circumstances in which ukraine could be drawn into a military conflict ukraine reserves the right to bar ships which may take part in these actions from returning to the ukrainian territory until the conflict is solved
2728798 it makes a third party involved and its quite unexpected
2728799 just wait a few months and you can afford whatever you want
2728800 its a pretty difficult offense to learn and im sure the one ive been in the last 16 years has been difficult too itll take some time but i think well be fine
2728801 that seems like so long ago it seems like a dream
2728802 im not going to sit here and tell you that ive got this offense down that i know every guy in the locker room or they know me
2728803 its a routine and im just kind of following them thats different for me
2728804 i was really surprised that today i was as effective as i was and im not saying that that was good
2728805 im just saying i was able to take a snap call a play we were able to break a huddle and i was able to complete passes in some sort of rhythm
2728806 all the rumors about him throwing hard yeah theyre true
2728807 as soon as we stepped out here the stands are filled and it creates a new energy for the team
2728808 i came here as a kid and there were always a few people here and there but nothing like this
2728809 viewing the 2008 olympics opening ceremony online at nbcs olympics website you can see that the order in which the countries were presented was very different from the actual order of the countries in the ceremony as listed at wikipedia
2728810 nous subissons une agression et une invasion russes tant maritimes qua riennes
2728811 les n gociations entre russes et g orgiens sont presque termin es on ma m me dit quelles taient d j finies et que ces couloirs seront ouverts aujourdhui dans le courant de la journ e
2728812 a ce stade je crois raisonnable de dire que la journ e de demain va probablement passer sans que cela arrive
2728813 nous sommes un point o nous sommes satisfaits de ce quils ont mis sur la table jusqualors ces discussions vont donc se poursuivre
2728814 youd think you would have to stop every few miles and siphon out some gas to make room in your tank for all the fuel you were saving
2728815 there are things you can do individually though to save energy
2728816 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
2728817 obama is correct that properly inflating our tires would save fuel
2728818 the x factors here are the fact that sen obama used both tire inflation and tune ups in his remarks and no one knows what volume you could would get from additional drilling in the outer continental shelf
2728819 the maximum estimated fuel economy i e mileage savings drivers could expect as a result of keeping their engines properly tuned 4 replacing air filters up to 10 properly inflating tires up to 3 and using the correct motor oil 1 2 is 18 19 since american drivers use roughly 380 million gallons of gasoline not including diesel per day an 18 improvement translates into a savings of 68 million gallons or 1 62 million barrels of oil per day
2728820 so the production offset is more likely to approach 800 thousand barrels per day a tidy sum and a worthwhile target for savings but not equal to ocs output
2728821 finally without knowing what production volumes could be expected from lifting the ban on ocs drilling moratoria its impossible to assert that taking these fuel savings actions would exceed future offshore oil volumes and in fact one might argue that the combination of achieving these savings and developing new supply would doubly enhance us energy security
2728822 apa yang kau amat amati sehingga satu setengah hari kau habiskan waktumu disini
2728823 tentu saja aku harus berhati hati aku harus mendapatkan emas 24 karat itu
2728824 seandainya emas 24 karat itu tidak pernah ada atau hanya ada satu diantara setumpuk emas ini apakah engkau masih saja mencarinya sedangkan waktumu sangat terbatas
2728825 tentu saja tidak aku akan mengambil emas terakhir yang ada ditanganku begitu waktuku habis
2728826 hai orang kaya apa yang kau cari disini bukankah engkau sudah lebih dari cukup
2728827 bagiku hidup adalah uang kalau aku bisa mengambil emas ini tentu saja itu berarti menambah keuntunganku
2728828 mengapa engkau diam disini tidakkah engkau memilih emas emas itu atau tekadmu sudah bulat untuk mengambil emas itu
2728829 atau engkau yakin bahwa itulah emas 24 karat sehingga engkau tidak lagi berusaha mencari yang lain
2728830 tuan saya ini orang miskin saya tidak pernah tahu mana yang emas dan mana yang kuningan tetapi hati saya memilih emas ini sayapun tidak tahu berapa kadar emas ini atau jika ternyata emas ini hanya kuninganpun saya juga tidak tahu
2728831 lalu mengapa engkau tidak mencoba bertanya kepada mereka atau kepadaku kalau engkau tidak tahu
2728832 tuan emas dan kuningan ini milik raja jadi menurut saya hanya raja yang tahu mana yang emas dan mana yang kuningan mana yang 1 karat dan mana yang 24 karat tapi satu hal yang saya percaya janji raja untuk mengubah kuningan menjadi emas itu yang lebih penting
2728833 bagi saya berapapun kadar karat emas ini cukup buat saya karena kalau saya bekerja saya membutuhkan waktu bertahun tahun menabung untuk membeli emas tuan
2728834 lagi pula tuan peraturannya saya tidak boleh menukar emas yang sudah saya ambil
2728835 tidakkah engkau mengambil emas emas yang lain dan menukarkannya sekarang selagi masih ada waktu
2728836 saya sudah menggunakan waktu itu kini waktu setengah hari terakhir saya inilah saatnya saya mengambil keputusan jika saya gantikan emas ini engan yang lain belum tentu saya mendapat yang lebih baik dari punya saya ini saya memutuskan untuk mengabdi pada raja dan merawat milik saya ini untuk menjadikannya emas yang murni
2728837 wahai rakyatku yang kukasihi semua emas yang kau genggam itu adalah hadiah yang telah kuberikan sesuai dengan perjanjian tidak seorangpun diperbolehkan menukar ataupun menyia nyiakan hadiah itu jika didapati hal diatas maka orang itu akan mendapat hukuman karena ia tidak menghargai raja
2728838 dan ketahuilah bahwa sebenarnya tidak ada emas 24 karat itu hal ini dimaksudkan bahwa kalian semua harus mengabdi kepada kerajaan dan hanya akulah yang dapat menambah jumlah karat itu karena akulah yang memilikinya selama satu setengah hari setengah hari yang kedua yaitu saat kuberikan waktu kepada kalian semua untuk merenungkan pilihan kalian kutunggu untuk datang kepadaku menanyakan perihal emas itu tetapi sayang sekali hanya satu orang yang datang kepadaku untuk menanyakannya
2728839 some may see the ad as humorous and i dont doubt that some people within coopers viewed it that way
2728840 last year comcast tweaked its network management system to delay slightly the uploading of data through bittorrent one of the peer to peer services people use to swap movies music and other large bandwidth content
2728841 these technical issues can be worked out through private business discussions without the need for government intervention
2728842 the family gathers for tea and there are four cream cakes for four people if one person grabbed three of them words would be said however peer to peer sharers think its perfectly ok to grab three quarters of the communal internet bandwidth

2728850 when you grow up in a very regimented system the lower you go the easier it is to train
2728851 ive asked them what their mission is and they dont know
2728852 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially here at home
2728853 the sooner congress lifts the ban the sooner we can get this oil from the ocean floor to your gas tank
2728854 the oil companies pushing for drilling is nothing more than a land grab
2728855 there is a real misconception that proponents of drilling are fueling implying that somehow this oil is going to go directly to u s consumers
2728856 the oil companies are the ones who are going to be the beneficiaries of this
2728857 so any changes we make impact the world oil market not a separate domestic market
2728858 and the argument somehow that because were exporting products that we cant use as being a situation that doesnt encourage domestic drilling i dont buy one bit

2728911 its very difficult to provide services to men who have sex with men in countries that dont acknowledge they exist or criminalize them if they do exist
2728912 to follow mexicos bold example and pass laws against homophobia
2728913 its a virus so you need to put the money where the virus is
2728914 these men believed they were not at risk because they were not having sex with sex workers or women which is what the campaign focused on
2728915 that scenario is being played out across the developing world
2728916 instead of saying they are gay its easier for them to justify their behavior they say they were drunk and they were really sexually excited and willing to have sex with whomever
2728917 in iran we dont have homosexuals like in your country
2728918 this means that we are not moving ahead with the fight against aids

2728958 as party members we must view this problem seriously and i regard umno now being in danger zone if money politics continues unabated
2728959 ive received unofficial reports that it has become rampant at all levels and it is frightening if this becomes normal practice in future
2728960 it is sad if one day the people see this problem as synonymous with umno so the situation must be corrected before the next general election

2729204 egypt has no excuse for remaining silent in face of what is happening to patients and stranded people when it is able to control and open the crossing
2729205 the palestinian legislative council plc will not allow egypt to remain idle while 150 000 patients are stuck in gaza because the crossing is a palestinian egyptian one
2729206 so far everything is fine but we all spend all our time worrying
2729207 the most terrible thing is that the russians attacked us while we were at the games opening ceremony a war is always something abnormal but when it happens at the moment when the olympic flame lights up it is a thousand times worse

2729239 early on my biggest challenge was to educate customers about transacting online internet penetration connectivity and internet suaveness were also real issues it was only when the sellers saw more bidders coming in did we witness an effective market making and a higher price realisation through this mode
2729240 while our initial expansion was in the south we now have a pan india presence with offices in over 20 locations there are opportunities in tier 2 and 3 cities where bulk purchase happens we are confident of offering a better price discovery mechanism every industrial town presents an opportunity for us to target and expand our plan is to reach these towns through a hub and spoke model we are also looking at an expansion into the south east asian market
2729241 our plan is to firm up the automobile vertical we may look at adding mining and earth moving equipment this year sale of npa non performing asset is another vertical where we are looking to gain a foothold
2729242 we were not able to move the manpower and machinery at the spot as initially there was a traffic jam it took hours for us to begin our work
2729243 the government is playing politics on the issue if it wants the resolution of the problem is very simple
2729244 whatever we have to say in this regard will be given in writing to the government
2729245 various suggestions have been put forth at the meeting these will give fillip to the dialogue process
2729246 it is not that we kashmiris do not want to give land or they jammuites want to take the land we have to find a solution and that can be found through talks
2729247 we are studying the report and it will be premature to presume that the reported suggestions made by the committee were being implemented we have to do a thorough analysis before we even think of implementing them
2729248 sinha is in the root of all this problem he should not have been made the governor

2729253 we are anguished over the callous and insensitive approach of the state administration and the central government towards towards people of jammu we condemn their approach
2729254 despite our best of efforts and support weightlifter monika devi will not be able to participate in the ongoing olympic games here with the lifting event at the games having already begun our persuasion with the organisers the international olympic committee and the international weightlifting federation has been of no avail
2729255 i can understand the valley press being prejudiced and engaging in yellow journalism but the national media has been misleading public opinion on this issue which is a matter of great concern
2729256 whereas the truth is that the state cabinet in may this year had unanimously approved of land being given to the board
2729257 the sass patronised by rss and bajrang dal is trying to give shape to the long cherished concealed agenda of the sangh parivar to divide the state on regional and religious lines
2729258 let me make it clear to sass leaders they should not try to browbeat the kashmiri politicians as such idiotic actions could cause more harm to the people of jammu than any other region
2729259 our government has requested the removal of all our forces but we are still waiting for the flight schedule
2729260 we will have to seek how to deal with the amarnath land issue we will definitely make efforts that it is resolved in a manner which does not hurt the sentiments of people of jammu as well as people of kashmir
2729261 the prime minister has also said that it should continue as in the past
2729262 there should be no communalisation of the situation there have been some incidents but we will tackle these
2729263 media can also make mistakes we request you to see what is covered is fact and done in a manner that it does not hurt sentiments of people
2729264 we will compensate the victims of violence we will compensate the near and dear ones of those who have been killed

2729267 great pit strategy got it done for us this win is a tribute to our great teamwork
2729268 is that its not necessarily the fastest car that wins its the smartest car that has positioned itself to take advantage of that at the end of the race at one point i thought we werent looking very good but then it rebounded and fell our way the team pulled together and we pulled it off
2729269 i was a little worried about pitting three and four times in a row when nobody else was pitting because it put us way back
2729270 but all of a sudden at the next yellow everyone else had to pit and we didnt and we were p1 this win is a tribute to duncan and rob and the crew
2729271 when i saw franck go down the inside of a gt car into canada corner i remember thinking that it was going to be close and then i saw the gt car turn in like he would normally and franck hadnt quite made it through
2729272 at the end my michelin tires were just coming in better and better and better and i had nothing else in my mind besides winning because i really felt we had the pace to do it the patr n highcroft acura was strong all race and i just want to add that weve had some updates from hpd and wirth engineering that have given us a little bit more power so we couldnt have done it without those modifications so it was a fantastic effort from those guys and obviously the team performed as it normally does which is pretty amazing
2729273 in my opinion they are already elements of some kind of genocide of the ossetian people

2729281 while the ultimate goal was to sit down and talk with mr selig directly the opportunity to meet with mr dupuy and mr idelson is certainly a very positive development in the campaign to have the nearly 70 year old hall of fame game tradition continue
2729282 i thank mr selig for arranging this meeting and i cannot help but view the upcoming meeting as a validation of the campaign as a recognition of the impact that passionate baseball fans from all over the country can have on the national pastimes direction and future and as a signal of mlbs and the hall of fames willingness to rethink the decision to end the great baseball american and cooperstown tradition of the hall of fame game
2729283 the opportunity to discuss with you the passion that exists for keeping a great american and baseball tradition alive and have an open discussion about options for retaining major league baseballs participation in the hall of fame game as it has been since 1940
2729284 the opportunity to discuss with you the passion that exists for keeping a great american and baseball tradition alive share some of the sentiment that is out there with regard to the choice that the league and the players union made in deciding to end it and have an open discussion about options for retaining major league baseballs participation in the hall of fame game as it has been since 1940
2729285 i definitely have to say it is an honour to be the lead
2729286 but we are just four races into this and its a long regatta were not even halfway
2729287 my overall goal coming into this was to sail conservatively and not take too many chances
2729288 this is a big event it is always on your mind when i go to bed i think about what i am going to do and then think about it in my sleep
2729289 i just try to conserve everything and make it into the semifinal i try to bank as much rest as i can tonight recover and sleep and try to warm down and get out of here as fast as i can so im not getting so run down
2729290 i was still running off the adrenaline and hyper from this morning
2729291 the 100 back is probably the quickest progressing event in the past year in swimming theres a lot pressure on me but im going to enjoy it as much as possible
2729292 the 100 is just fun for me so im just enjoying it right now setting myself up for the 200 and hopefully get a medal out of it
2729293 for a prelims swim i keep wanting to say morning swim but its night here it felt very relaxed
2729294 im quite shocked actually i had a pretty crazy swim
2729295 that was a little faster than what i expected to do
2729296 the 100m back has been the quickest progressing event in swimming over the past year
2729297 i thought if i went 59 anything it would put me into semi finals
2729298 you want to swim as fast as possible while leaving something left in the tank i think i achieved that
2729299 i did everything i needed to do to get into tomorrows semi final
2729300 i think the biggest thing is having a good swim tomorrow morning
2729301 i was just in it to get to tomorrows semifinals
2729302 i felt very strong but i wasnt concerned about outcomes or times im quite shocked actually i was just out there having a cruisy swim
2729303 i was just concerned about swimming my best and carrying the momentum into tomorrow
2729304 but i was right on my time so there was really nothing more i could do
2729305 i tried to tell myself i wasnt nervous but i think i was
2729306 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2729307 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2729308 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2729309 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2729310 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2729311 creio que quando se est em uma situa o como esta uma olimp ada voc n o tenta interferir muito o t cnico faz um plano de jogo simples e deixa os jogadores sentirem o jogo e isso o que vamos tentar fazer

2729314 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2729315 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2729316 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2729325 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2729326 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2729327 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
2729328 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2729329 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this

2729357 it is unacceptable that more than 70 percent of women arent regularly orgasmic during intercourse the society is fixated on male orgasms and women are left without while it should be any womans right to orgasm almost every time they have sex
2729358 frozen sperm banks have been available for over thirty years egg freezing and thawing has been much more technically challenging nevertheless research has progressed and various options for egg freezing and banking have now arrived
2729359 frozen eggs offer women options in deciding when they wish to conceive whether with their own eggs or with donor eggs
2729360 some women have diseases such as cancer earlier in life and must delay childbearing in addition cancer treatments can destroy eggs around the world many women have chosen to bank their eggs and or ovarian tissue for future use others have opted to use donor eggs
2729361 many of our patients who use donor eggs are only in their thirties
2729362 they are often upset because no one informed them previously that ovarian aging is a serious and common problem
2729363 freezing eggs give women and couples the time and convenience of using their eggs when they are ready to get pregnant liberated from the financial personal and ethical dilemma presented with frozen embryos
2729364 egg donation is a highly successful treatment option for women who may not be able to get pregnant with their own eggs but are still able to carry a pregnancy however the process of selecting the right womens eggs often presents challenges
2729365 patients frustrated by years of tests and failures greatly value the speed and convenience of frozen eggs and will seek the procedure in greater percentages
2729366 we are very excited to launch this program in support of breast cancer research and october breast cancer awareness month
2729367 paypal is a safe and easy way to pay and get paid online

2729369 in a recent survey of customers by alwaysforme com we found that paypal was a preferred method of payment for its ease of use cited by 79 of respondents security 71 and reputation 54
2729370 over three quarters of customers surveyed use paypal frequently when shopping online
2729371 from the familys perspective this is just one more in a long line of lies and deception it makes them more adamant to learn how and why he died the only way that can be done is by a full public inquiry
2729372 sir ian blair as head of the metropolitan police bears ultimate responsibility for the menezes killing and that he deliberately tried to cover up what really happened after jeans death
2729373 the pain of the loss of our cousin at the hands of the police was immense but the fact that the police lied about what happened and tried to cover up the truth made our pain unbearable
2729374 the state got by for so long on agriculture tourism and services all of which run mostly on lower wage jobs that dont require an undergraduate degree much less an advanced degree but since 2003 the housing bubble and hurricanes have made florida more expensive and there arent enough higher paying jobs to keep the economy humming this may be the fourth largest state but it has the manufacturing industrial base of a country that sends 10 athletes to the olympics study after study has shown the link between better jobs and better universities
2729375 i think that the budget cuts have had positive unintended consequences

2729384 cute and catchy the dream bitches weave folk style harmonies with simple acoustic instrumentation they breathe fresh air into the riot grrrl scene with their clever approach that doesnt involve heavy guitars and screaming instead they provide a dreamy cloak over the smart punky lyrics without listening too closely the girls could be singing about walking down the beach with balloons or their favorite cat with their at first innocent flair but just as their name would encourage us to look closer we would discover it isnt all kittens and sunny surf
2729385 youre as perfect as i want it youre as pretty as they come
2729386 at once cutesy and clever girly and rebellious the dream bitches excel at crafting songs that are almost as oxymoronic as their name the songs on sanfransisters are bubbly and familiar sounding but underneath the melodic dreamy exterior youll find lyrics that are caustically biting and as bitchy as the bands moniker would have you believe sung fiercely with standard riot grrl attitude yet the fact that the ladies deliver them over jangly acoustic chords rather than aggressive electric riffs sets the dream bitches apart from their girly punk counterparts
2729387 with subject matter ranging from long distance love to halloween costumes the songs on sanfransisters are touching clever and likely to induce bedroom dancing a perfect punk rock campfire singalong
2729388 we are thrilled that circus circus reno has invited us to help them in their fundraising efforts

2729391 it really gives companies a unique way to raise thousands of dollars for a great cause weve had an overwhelming positive response from this program so far

2729407 it really affects your family you have to pull your children out of school your wife has to fit in its very difficult it tears families apart
2729408 i really feel that what investors are looking for right here is signs that the economy is starting to pick up right now
2729409 it looks like we are finally getting the break weve been waiting for in terms of slowing down the inflation spiral that has been taking place
2729410 you have a tremendous rise in the dollar and thats putting pressure on crude oil which is helping to buoy u s equity markets

2729417 i think it is another step but for some reason im not really as nervous for that as i was the first two days of practice

2729428 whatever their publicized angst over saddam husseins weapons of mass destruction american and british authorities were also concerned about violence in an area that harbors a resource indispensable for the functioning of the world economy
2729429 never heard them basically say weve got to protect the oil supplies of the world
2729430 if somebody asked me are we fortunate in taking out saddam i would say it was essential

2729444 that was a letdown in the middle of the game
2729445 i was looking forward to him coming back as much as he was
2729446 if hes got a chance to come back hes going to battle
2729447 if everything goes great and he feels nothing sure he can come back and be here in september or something
2729448 the problem is when you get to september there is nowhere to pitch during a rehab stint no place to go

2729481 our song booty music was one of the tracks we recorded when we were between labels
2729482 though i do most of the production all group members contribute to the lyrics and vocal arrangements we are our own worst critics so we have no problems trashing a song if it isnt up to par

2729487 though there were other labels that were interested in us we signed to so so def island urban because we thought they were more artist driven
2729488 git fresh felt at home from the moment we walked through the door
2729489 we have been honing our skills for a long time
2729490 it was as if we put ourselves in boot camp in our early days it was rough but we stuck together through negative energy and hard times
2729491 as a group were just so excited about where our music is going though we make slamming club records we also like making ballads that give us the opportunity to show heartfelt emotions
2729492 our sound represents all that is culturally diverse in music

2729603 five people have been injured in what appears to be a russian air raid
2729604 when you speak to people here they have no idea why this place would be targeted while there are military parts housed here it is not a military base some say that perhaps there may have been confusion on the russian side

2729618 there is not any doubt for me things are taking place in a favorable way for north vietnam in particular before world opinion at present the united states is virtually standing alone
2729619 my assignment to the oriskany i told myself was due to serious losses in pilots which were sustained by this aircraft carrier due to its raids over north vietnam territory vna and which necessitated replacements from 10 to 12 pilots were transferred like me from the forrestal to the oriskany before i was shot down we had made several sorties altogether i made about 23 flights over north vietnam
2729620 while moving toward the target we stumbled over a very dense network of fire a very powerful riposte a few rockets were seen our chief turned to approach the target and i followed him at a distance at the time when i was preparing to drop my bombs i did not know whether i could drop them because things were happening too fast i heard a terrible explosion which shook my plane and sent it toward the group it was hit so violently that i was thrown on my back and went straight toward the ground in this posture i tried to pull the direction stick naturally i felt buffetting because my bailing out was made at the time when the plane was falling too fast when the parachute opened i looked down and found out that i was going to fall into a lake i was really lucky to be able to fall into a lake all around me bombs were exploding while rockets and antiaircraft shells were streaking through the sky i hit the lake and went to the bottom while trying to return to the surface i was seized by vietnamese and pushed to the bank of the lake they disarmed me and brought me to prison
2729621 very intense very accurate when a fire barrage is so accurate one has to reckon with it you are excellent artillerymen naturally i have never seen such a fire network because it was the first time that i flew over hanoi
2729622 for me there is no longer any doubt things are taking place in a favorable opinion the united states at present seems to be standing alone so much is its isolation
2729623 i was a u s airman engaged in the crimes against the vietnamese country and people i had bombed their cities towns and villages and caused more injury even death for the people of vietnam after i was captured i was taken from a hospital in da nang where i received very good medical treatment i was given an operation on my leg which allowed me to walk again and a cast for my right arm which was badly broken in three rpt three places the doctors were very good and they knew a great deal about the practice of medicine i remained in the hospital for some time i regained much of my health and strength
2729624 my name is john sidney mccain and i am a lieutenant commander in the u s navy serial no 624787 i understand and speak some spanish i studied it in school and i have been in spain several times on one of those occasions i visited the navy academy and met prince carlos
2729625 on 26 october 1967 i was overflying hanoi in an a4e plane based on the carrier oriskany when my plane was hit by a ground to air missile i bailed out colliding in the air with the remains of the plane and i landed in one of the lakes in the center of hanoi in the middle of the water on landing i tried to get free of my parachute but could not move and did not realize why i could not move my arms or legs but it was because of the injuries
2729626 yes as a result of colliding with the remains of the plane i fractured my right leg at the knee and both arms the right one in three places moreover i dislocated both shoulders
2729627 well many people gathered around since it was the center of hanoi and at midday
2729628 i could not determine exactly because they had removed their clothing in order to take me out of the water
2729629 from there they took me to a military hospital in hanoi a large hospital where they operated on me and attended to the multiple fractures i understand i received more than a liter of blood
2729630 no although at the time of capture i could sense the peoples hate or indignation there were no insults or violence of any type on the contrary you have seen how i am recovering from my injuries
2729631 actually i never thought i would become a prisoner therefore those fears never came up
2729632 no i was traveling at high altitude i felt completely safe in the plane i am considered one of the best pilots
2729633 there was a family reason since i have many relatives in that branch of service in particular my grandfather was difficult to read nding in world war ii he was one of those who saw the japanese sign the act of surrender and a naval destroyer bears his name and my father is also an admiral he is chief of the pacific command of the u s armed forces actually it is a matter of military tradition once of my forebears was a colonel in washingtons independence forces another was a general in the war of secession thus it was natural for me to follow a military career of course my father was not always an admiral during world war ii he was a commander of a submarine he has been in the navy since 1927 and has been an admiral since 1965 he holds the highest rank in the navy if i had not been downed i would have become an admiral at an earlier age than my father theoretically general abrams is his subordinate
2729634 yes although in practice because of the importance of this war gen creighton abrams receives his orders directly from washington
2729635 well look in fact abrams is his subordinate but since the tet offensive of 1968 in view of the gravity of the situation abrams instead of asking for instructions from my father who is in honolulu so that he in turn would ask for them from washington went directly to washington for them because the war is here in vietnam and my father also has okinawa korea and so forth under his command that is why since the war is so important he receives his instructions directly from washington it is a political problem also not only military
2729636 look my father is a very intelligent person but when the bombings of the north began johnson asked abrams opinion not my fathers because abrams is in saigon in the war
2729637 i saw her the last time in august of 1967 at that time i was on the aircraft carrier forrestal when i fire broke out wich damaged it heavily and it had to be sent for repairs to the united states at that time i miraculously escaped with my life because i was in my airplane and the two pilots on my left and the two on my right were killed
2729638 a plane caught fire and one of its rockets went off this in turn caused other explosions there were 135 deaths almost all the airplanes were destroyed and the ship was seriously damaged as a result of the fire i became famous on tv
2729639 yes but in addition i was able to see my family and stay there nearly a month i then returned this time to the aircraft carrier oriskany and 1 month later i was shot down
2729640 she is very pretty before marrying me she was a model for magazines and on tv we have a 3 year old girl when i saw her she was still a baby she also has two children from a former marriage she now returned to work as a model on tv
2729641 i had a letter from her after i became a prisoner
2729642 yes they authorized me to recieve a letter and presents on christmas eve and i was able to send greeting cards
2729643 if you would be so kind tell her i am well that i wish her happiness and not to worry about me
2729644 her namy is carol mccain mrs carol mccain she lives in
2729645 yes 4 000 they really demand 200 but i flew 4 000 hours
2729646 i wanted to become a test pilot it is fascinating to test new models
2729647 well look it was because i wanted to be an astronaut that is why i also engage in a great deal of sports boxing wrestling swimming camping and so forth
2729648 my beliefs have always been more or less the same intensity as long as the war lasts i do not have much hope for the future

2729671 the vast majority of rational dcs understand that life is the antipathy of higher education king guy may have fooled the idiots evil vendors and chirovangelists but he has not convinced anyone else who appreciates the value of higher education that life is on the right track but since most lifers have never graduated from a real university they fail to understand the difference between education at a diploma mill and a credible institution of higher learning ya folla obviously the money hum speaks louder than having an administration versed in higher education

2729719 i got him in the ribs and hell probably see that when he gets up off the floor
2729720 i did start slow and i let the occasion get to me but i hurt him with the same punch earlier and he was wide open ive definitely got the power and i proved it tonight
2729721 its going to be hard and im going to have to put everything into it to get a result but ive already beaten the cuban before
2729722 today ive beaten the world bronze medallist by 10 points so im feeling great ive got to deal with this sort of pressure and if i do it then hopefully ill get a medal for great britain
2729723 ive overcome this big step of getting into the ring for the first time and hopefully ill continue to improve im in a tough draw but ive got to stick to it and hopefully get through
2729724 everybody who goes into that ring is going to be nervous because of the venue and having the olympic tag on the end of it
2729725 it was a mature performance from the youngest member of our team its billys first big tournament and they dont get any bigger than this he showed so much maturity
2729726 i think billys a bit more mature than amir was at his age billys got a good brain and hes particularly quick and adaptable he can cope with most styles and its a great start for him
2729727 i am not quite sure what all the stephen ireland rumour is about
2729728 there was a bit of confusion about stephen before the game against milan but i had a word with him before the game and explained my interpretation of it it has been sorted out and i explained my understanding of it
2729729 at this time of the year a lot of agents are flying around and at times some are of a view that they can start to exercise some interest in their clients
2729730 anything we have said in regards of stephen has been misinterpreted and people have run away with it
2729731 he is staying absolutely he is staying sunderland has been mentioned but there has been no contact in that respect

2729747 your pal seemed to like to talk about it and mokoto confirmed much of what he said
2729748 did they also tell you that gerrard was one cold blooded s o b
2729749 maybe they also forgot to mention that if gerrard was alive and here and still working with us youd either be dead or wishing you were did they mention all the people he killed
2729750 well then you dont know it all gerrard was a friend he was a colleague and he was not a man to be messed with i get the impression you all thought he was just some coffee slinger with a weekend job meant to get with girls

2729781 considering the statements from al qaeda and the iju we are convinced it has been decided to mount attacks in germany
2729782 however there is currently no concrete evidence of imminent strikes
2729783 altogether there are currently 200 investigations linked to islamic terrorism being conducted the danger has therefore in no way diminished
2729784 our observation posts have spotted georgian law enforcement units as well as artillery and armoured vehicles

2729805 para n s uma luta da maioria branca contra a tirania das minorias essa era trouxe dist rbios pobreza chantagem assassinatos e poder pol tico para as minorias

2729807 votar o em obama com a esperan a de que isso lhes ajude a impulsionar uma revolu o branca
2729808 os supremacistas acham que uma vit ria de obama seria como um grito de batalha dos brancos e que milh es se unir o em sua causa e armar o a revolu o
2729809 seria um s mbolo da decad ncia do pa s e do mal pelo qual os brancos est o passando

2729813 all things are subject to causes and conditions none are independent
2729814 all things are subject to causes and conditions none are independent all are born from causes and conditions and because of this they have no intrinsic nature of their own because of having no intrinsic nature they are ultimately empty not clinging to them because they are ultimately empty is called transcendent wisdom
2729815 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is a fabulous person
2729816 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man
2729817 the only thing weve heard is they were not identifiable except for a small volleyball pin which would probably be invisible to a guy
2729818 its certainly a down day certainly for the u s people
2729819 here it is supposed to be a great time of happiness and peace and all that thats what we work hard for then for one person to be able to put a dark cloud on that
2729820 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2729821 i dont know if theres another word for it we said a prayer for them in the locker room i get goosebumps talking about it its something obviously that just changes the events right now for the olympic games
2729822 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others

2729828 in the great metropolis of the young australian nation those young people were a sign of authentic joy sometimes noisy but always peaceful and positive
2729829 despite their large number they did not cause disorder or any damage to have fun they did not need to engage in raucous or violent acts nor rely on alcohol and drugs
2729830 how can one not contrast them to their peers who searching for false escapism consume degrading experiences that sometimes result in tragedy
2729831 in this way the spirit does not rest the heart does not experience joy but in fact ends up being more exhausted and sad than before
2729832 lets pray that in a society which is always moving faster vacations may be days of relax during which we can find moments for prayer and time to find ourselves and others

2729839 this reminds me all too much of other recent conflicts that have torn our continent apart particularly in the balkans
2729840 we have left practically all of south ossetia as an expression of goodwill and our willingness to stop military confrontation
2729841 we have asked united states secretary of state condoleezza rice to mediate with the russians to transmit them our message
2729842 has already caused a great number of innocent victims and forced a great number of civilians to leave their homes
2729843 refrain also in the name of the common christian heritage from further confrontations and violent retaliations that could degenerate into a wider conflict
2729844 in the past month i have been in so much pain and i havent been able to practise for 10 days

2729846 it was very exciting sitting there this morning watching michael phelps set a world record was special to me because it made me realize how many people are inspired by him

2729861 we did reach out to google before we started the program and they said they would cooperate
2729862 our next step will be to send dmca notices to the isps who host the site or the search engine that shows sites up in results
2729863 google is selling advertising on all the big copyright infringing lyric websites
2729864 it may seem like small potatoes but lyrics are a huge search term on the internet for years but until recently there wasnt a readily available way for consumers to get lyrics from copyright holders
2729865 we wanted to make sure there was a legitimate alternative available and now that there is we think its appropriate to have the lyrics taken down off the other sites
2729866 there is a market for these lyrics there is consumer demand and the lyrics enhance a digital service its a very significant potential market

2729870 it marks our transition from a successful start up in the emerging field of cell phone recycling into the undisputed global leader in electronics sustainability
2729871 our goal was to develop a profitable company that was socially and environmentally responsible
2729872 through the dedication of a talented team of people recellular has exceeded all expectations with igcs support and investment we will dramatically expand the company and set the standard for success in electronics sustainability and clean tech operations
2729873 they have revolutionized the electronics sustainability industry by providing a convenient solution for consumers to recycle their used handsets while at the same time extracting enough value from these phones to build a successful business we have investigated many clean tech companies including many in the cell phone recycling arena and we felt that recellular was clearly the worlds most promising cell phone reuse and recycling firm
2729874 we chose to partner with igc because of their deep knowledge of the sector their experience with growth stage companies and the value they can bring through rich networks in the u s europe and asia
2729875 we processed almost 5 000 phones in our first year of business
2729876 today we get an average of 24 000 phones enough to fill seven mail trucks every day five days a week with the support and resources of igc we see the potential to double the number of mail trucks delivering to recellular in the very near future
2729877 to learn english faster students must avoid these five common mistakes
2729878 the uacs goal in this project is to raise awareness because most people have no idea what sharia law is
2729879 we are confident people will see the billboard and learn on their own what sharia law is and come to their own conclusions at the very least we hope our billboard will spark public debate on this overlooked issue
2729880 under sharia law if you are accused of stealing a hand and foot from opposite sides are amputated if you are caught having an affair the woman is stoned to death and the man is given 80 lashes if you change religions you can be charged under apostasy laws and given the death sentence by a legal sharia court if you want to marry a nine year old child sharia law condones pedophilia because mohammad married aisha at six and consummated the marriage at age nine i find these and many more practices of sharia law despicable and hateful
2729881 if a person condones the horrors of sharia law enforcement then living under our u s constitution and bill of rights is not possible
2729882 discussing everything you will never hear from the mainstream press
2729883 sharia is the glue that holds an islamic society together
2729884 the harsh punishments associated with sharia law in all facets of day to day life create a never ending atmosphere of abject fear for those living under sharia law
2729885 for those people calling me hateful then they would have to condone child marriages amputations for stealing and death for apostates to name only a few punishments attached to sharia law if my critics condone this type of activity under

2729890 we are thrilled that circus circus reno has invited us to help them in their fundraising efforts
2729891 its a great program because it fills three needs at once
2729892 first it gives employees and patrons of organizations a chance to sell old jewelry getting instant cash for unwanted outdated or broken items that have been collecting dust in a box or drawer second it recycles precious metals which helps alleviate the need for further mining and damage to the environment
2729893 it really gives companies a unique way to raise thousands of dollars for a great cause weve had an overwhelming positive response from this program so far
2729894 the event has attracted massive publicity and as such we anticipate that the local police and security bureau will have beijing well locked down so that general security risks are likely to be mitigated and therefore not a major concern for the general public attending the events
2729895 we have recently seen a large backlash against china from various factions protesting about chinas human rights record who may well attempt to use the mass media coverage of the games to publicise their cause and attempt to disrupt the event should any such incident occur it is possible that attendees may be caught up and as such should be on the look out for anything they instinctively feel is not right or suspicious
2729896 consider the fact that such large crowds of visitors unfamiliar with beijing will attract pickpockets fraudsters and other petty criminals some popular scams to be aware of are offers of taxi services not from authorised taxi pick up points or requests to have a drink with a friendly local in order to help him improve his english skills
