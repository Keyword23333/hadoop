1540011 its swatting a fly with a sledgehammer theres no need to get rid of literally hundreds of thousands of books that are fine simply because you have a problem with an isolated book or piece of literature that presents extremism
1540012 since when does the government even with the assistance of chaplains decide which are the most basic books in terms of religious study and practice
1540013 you know what people in la do on their weekends first they go wash their cars then they cut off us shuttle drivers

1540022 there were some people in the courtroom that were taken aback by it
1540023 those were the only words i heard him utter in the courtroom
1540024 he shook his head in response to questions from the judge some shakes of his appeared to be in the affirmative some of them appeared to be in the negative

1540027 we stopped any production of any ads that were going to be going out and anything that was still up we asked to be removed immediately
1540028 its strange to see hunger when everything is so green
1540029 when i started working a lot of people in this community were sick with malaria
1540030 you would find two or three members of the same family sick at the same time there were times when we buried two or three persons who had died from malaria in one day
1540031 first i have protected myself from getting sick i use myself as an example to teach others to transform their lives
1540032 if a malnourished child catches malaria it is prone to complications and has a higher risk of dying
1540033 we are distributing insecticide treated bednets there because there are a large number of children who are malnourished
1540034 most feel this has been a total let down their kids have been through all this stress and the parents have been through it too
1540035 there is a general feeling that they cant be relied on and if we manage without them this year why do we need them
1540036 to hear the secretary of state on the radio when challenged not going to take responsibility and say it is a matter for the qualifications and curriculum authority qca and ets is not right
1540037 whats making it even worse is that now all the ministers have gone off on their 11 week summer holidays and parents are at home with children who still havent got their results
1540038 how are we as parents going to motivate the next lot of children to take the tests next year
1540039 theyre already asking whats the point if their tests arent going to be marked what can we say to them theyre right
1540040 there were some people in the courtroom that were taken aback by it

1540047 that would certainly make a statement about gay marriage and would actually be within the jurisdiction so to speak of the aals which is all about law professors not hoteliers
1540048 does this now mean that a member of the legal writing institute or these aals sections who is opposed to same sex marriage is no longer a member in good standing does this mean that a member of these entities who dissents from the new official position in favor of same sex marriage would be well advised to remain silent or even resign
1540049 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
1540050 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
1540051 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
1540052 nor could we check our sympathy even at the urging of hard reason without deterioration in the noblest part of our nature
1540053 if it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous successive slight modifications my theory would absolutely break down
1540054 was devoted to leading a crusade to ground a humanistic philosophy in evolution
1540055 evolution or to spell it out the idea of evolutionary process is the most powerful and the most comprehensive idea that has ever arisen on earth above all it unifies our knowledge and our thought thus the evolutionary idea must provide the main unifying approach for a humanist educational system and evolutionary biology could and should become a central or key subject in its curriculum
1540056 in part because it undermined his evolutionary humanism and his progressive worldview
1540057 offered an inquiry into an ethical system an ethos grounded in evolution with its fundamental principle of natural selection
1540058 a towering figure in german biology and an early darwinian
1540059 a racist a believer in a mystical volk and a strong advocate of eugenics
1540060 psychologically nearer to the mammals apes and dogs than to civilized europeans and therefore we must assign a totally different value to their lives
1540061 the judeo christian worldview had been accepted as adequate for centuries and remains so for many individuals today but it leads to a very different view of nature than the one provided by modern science
1540062 involve science and the judeo christian worldview in yet another confrontation one that lingers to this day
1540063 true belief requires the acceptance of some things and not the other
1540064 the statements of science are derived ultimately from the data of observation and experimentation
1540065 one might seek to blame the judeo christian dogma of special creation for inhibiting thought about descent with change and to some extent this blame is valid
1540066 it is true that the attitudes of the church prevented the development of science for more than a thousand years and inhibited it for centuries the church never was a supporter of open minds
1540067 i acquainted myself with the genetic work of the zoological institute and of the institut fur psychiatrie under dr rudin whose very comprehensive material offers a nice field for the study of mutations in man and of their inheritance
1540068 meritorious pioneer of the racial hygiene measures of the third reich
1540069 bronze medal bearing the nazi eagle from adolph hitler who lauded him as the pathfinder in the field of hereditary hygiene
1540070 in an extreme form the attraction of the nazi biomedical vision for a certain kind of biologically and genetically oriented scientist
1540071 brought such odium upon the whole concept of eugenics as to run it into the ground
1540072 held that genetics in man could be left to care of itself
1540073 the apex of international support of nazi race policies and represented a great success for the nazi race propaganda machine
1540074 synthesis of the work by anthropologists eugenicists and social philosophers
1540075 john moore is the originator and guiding effort behind the entire saawok effort
1540076 the widespread feeling that human beings have become so numerous and are consuming resources so avidly that the earth cannot long continue to support our way of life
1540077 sought to help remedy these problems by providing materials to assist in understanding
1540078 the responsibility of each poor country is to keep the excess population from being produced
1540079 chinas methods may not be acceptable everywhere but the goal should be universal each country must choose the means that meshes with its culture
1540080 we have to change the ways we live and breed these matters must
1540081 the once sacred rights of man must alter in many ways it can no longer be affirmed that the right of the man and woman to reproduce as they see fit is inviolate
1540082 no parents will in that future time have a right to burden society with a malformed or a mentally incompetent child
1540083 to support him with a letter of recommendation for the united states
1540084 one of the pivotal scientists who shaped the intellectual watershed known as the evolutionary synthesis
1540085 for huxley a grounding in evolution and the construction of an
1540086 we can discover no divine purpose or providence for the human species science affirms that the human species is an emergence from natural evolutionary forces
1540087 the first synthetic account of evolution had been written by theodosius dobzhansky in
1540088 what teilhard tried to do was something entirely different namely to create a coherent weltanschauung including his mystical christianity as well as his scientific knowledge
1540089 the concern is the development of ideas not to present a balanced history so the emphasis will be on key individuals and key concepts
1540090 most of these problems such as abortion genetic engineering right to life environmental pollution and overuse of natural resources have no single solution science can be invaluable in helping human beings make informed choices
1540091 through events over which the society had little control got into disrepute how it came to be regarded as a field for cranks misguided enthusiasts and irresponsible propagandists the hostility to eugenics seems to have come and gone in waves
1540092 i should like to say a word about the societys attitude to propaganda
1540093 implications of the new studies in population and psychology for the development of eugenic philosophy
1540094 superiorities or inferiorities of a biological nature to social classes to regional groups or to races as a whole
1540095 scientists are not at all sure that any races or social classes in this country are above or below others in biological capacity for developing socially valuable qualities
1540096 eugenics should therefore operate on a basis of individual selection the public emphasis of eugenics should be on a basis of individual selection the public emphasis of eugenics should be on a better distribution of births throughout the population
1540097 warding off reduction to the physical sciences became a primary concern for ernst mayr the architect most sensitive to philosophy at this time
1540098 but science whilst giving us good ground for hope also issues grave warning concerning the danger of national deterioration resulting from the unchecked multiplication of inferior types a determination that such a downfall shall not be the fate of this nation is a sentiment felt by every man who is animated by the eugenic ideal an ideal to be followed like a flag in battle without thought of personal gain
1540099 figuring out which families to encourage confessed physicist sir charles galton darwin is a discouraging problem quoting darwin the breed of race horses has been improved indeed to a remarkable degree
1540100 and it seems it is these mutations which provide the raw material for real large scale evolutionary change in the pressure of the struggle for existence the harmful changes are gradually weeded out the favorable ones survive in large numbers and are incorporated into the race the struggle has a sifting action on the mutations this is what darwin seventy years ago called natural selection and it is this sifting selection which picking out the good mutations gradually pushes the race along its evolutionary path
1540101 the effect of the advances in medicine and the improvement in our system of public health which have taken place in the period specified has been to lower the hurdles and to increase the individuals chances for survival
1540102 c ivilization has brought sympathy pity tenderness and other lofty and worthy sentiments which interfere with the law of natural selection
1540103 quotable quotes from the birth control review version 1 o february 1997
1540104 the highest type of all the caucasians represented by the civilized white inhabitants of europe and america
1540105 they not only do harm to others by corrupting stealing or spreading disease but they are actually protected and cared for by the state out of public money largely for them the poorhouse and the asylum exist they take from society but they give nothing in return they are true parasites if such people were lower animals we would probably kill them off to prevent them from spreading humanity will not allow this but we do have the remedy of separating the sexes in asylums or other places and in various ways preventing intermarriage and the possibilities of perpetuating such a low and degenerate race remedies of this sort have been tried successfully in europe and are now meeting with success in this country

1540107 the road to abortion part i how eugenics birthed population control
1540108 changing emphasis less on knowing scientific facts and information more on understanding scientific concepts and developing abilities of inquiry

1540113 we are defending islam and its sanctity this is the country we were raised in why should we stand by while our men are defending the country
1540114 the americans took my husband they destroyed our home weve got nothing were living by the grace of god we will not stay silent and everything including bombings we can do in response
1540115 violence by u s or iraqi forces will lead in many cases to grudges and a wish to take revenge especially when husbands are killed i think this is one of the main reasons for female bomb attacks
1540116 female suicide bombers cost little provide ease of planning and are relatively free of risk to terror organisations there is little chance that security forces will obtain sensitive information from them
1540117 we hope that more women will join us in this work
1540118 we are helping our brothers to protect the new iraq

1540124 let me make a point about efficiency because my republican opponents they dont like to talk about efficiency
1540125 you know the other day i was in a town hall meeting and i laid out my plans for investing 15 billion a year in energy efficient cars and a new electricity grid and somebody said well what can i do what can individuals do obama recalled
1540126 so now the republicans are going around this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand it theyre going around theyre sending like little tire gauges making fun of this idea as if this is barack obamas energy plan
1540127 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent
1540128 you know they think it is funny that they are making fun of something that is actually true they need to do their homework because this is serious business instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference
1540129 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
1540130 probably the biggest lie told in schools though is that the way to succeed is through following the rules
1540131 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
1540132 the 21st century has an extreme reminiscence to the 21st year of a persons life it is a year of coming of age when a person becomes an adult mankind has not the right to take a beautiful world with all its privileges and opportunities and turn it into a purgatory this situation should remind freemasons that they have something to live for we have the power to build worlds the wisdom to govern them and the divine right to inherit the earth and preserve it in good condition in order to pass it on to our descendents as a place of happiness usefulness and security for thousands of years to come were not asking for treason were not asking for disobedience were only asking that in every way possible when they have the choice stand for truth and if necessary take a little punishment for it

1540147 there are tremendous curveballs thrown at you during filming she lets you know when youre hearing something you dont want to hear that its going to be ok its like a warm hand on the shoulder that soothes rather than amplifies the conflict
1540148 she is the rare woman who always wants to take the joke farther than any man wants to go
1540149 a little sexist it paints the women as shrews as humorless and uptight and it paints the men as lovable goofy fun loving guys
1540150 i dont share that opinion i feel like we have very strong women in our movies
1540151 its good early training to have an incredibly irresponsible family it forces a young person to take responsibility to be organized

1540155 sar passato un anno da quando ho deciso di tornare pienamente alla mia vita materiale e ora incontro voi che mi riportate indietro questo per non mi dispiace anzi il fatto che ho smesso di pensare a certe cose le ho archiviate e infatti non mi succedeva pi quasi niente ma da quando vi ho conosciuto mi accadono queste cose tutti giorni perch ero sola e avevo paura ora invece col vostro appoggio mi sento pi forte ieri ho avuto una visione e nel bel mezzo di essa la cosa che mi ha dato il coraggio per andare avanti era non esser pi sola io dovevo continuare a vedere e dovevo farlo per me e per voi ora che vi conosco ho meno paura

1540177 personal tax cuts and higher spending on health and education programmes will lead to modest deficits over the next few years

1540180 the average pay differential between the public and private sector was between 17 percent and 21 percent
1540181 in addition public sector workers appear to benefit much more from a warm glow belief that in their job they can help others and that their job is useful to society
1540182 in competitive labour markets people would be willing to work for less to feel so good about themselves and their jobs
1540183 so the fact that public sector workers actually get paid 20 percent more is evidence of how out of line wage setting has been in the public sector
1540184 some job factors like stress may be worse in the public sector but others like the work not being physically demanding and not being viewed by the worker as boring are better than for private sector workers

1540195 im glad that governor gregoire has started to recognize the budget crisis shes created she had to know that by increasing spending 33 percent in her first term she was heading the state toward a budget deficit
1540196 in addition to a hiring freeze we should also freeze salary increases for politically appointed state employees further governor gregoire should suspend salary negotiations with state employee groups over pay increases until we know the full extent of our deficit next year

1540321 let me make a point about efficiency because my republican opponents they dont like to talk about efficiency
1540322 so now the republicans are going around this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand it theyre going around theyre sending like little tire gauges making fun of this idea as if this is barack obamas energy plan
1540323 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
1540324 this is an important piece of the puzzle as we attempt to determine whether habitable conditions exist for microbes on mars
1540325 in itself it is neither good nor bad for life
1540326 this desert is a hyper arid environment that rarely sees rain and has no vascular plants and is often used by scientists as a matter of fact as a martian analog site
1540327 these compounds are quite stable in soil and water and do not destroy organic materials under normal circumstances in fact there are species of perchlorate producing microbes that live on the energy provided by this oxidant
1540328 unfortunately there was a story out that we were hiding something and of course as soon as that story goes out people speculate the speculation leads to all kinds of wonderful stories of discoveries that i wish wed made but we havent
1540329 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1540330 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1540331 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal
1540332 in the battle of ideas with the gun lobby were at a constant disadvantage because were honest

1540340 you know if kids are not around alcohol and they see it it makes a bad impression on them
1540341 you can look forward to the same action and hype and adventure and the wonderful cliffhangers that the first season had a lot of us are working much more closely together a lot of the main four cast which is kind of what i think the audience missed about the second season and what we all missed was that we didnt get the chance to work with each other so were all crossing paths this season its so action packed and it leaves you with wonderful cliffhangers its a really tremendous season
1540342 one cool thing about this season is i get to play kind of two different characters for a second we hop back and forth a little bit from the present to the future
1540343 were only up to episode eight so im not sure if shes going to continue to do it in the future id love to know but i dont

1540348 something happens to her thats actually quite frightening to her and it plays a very big part in who she becomes in the future and what happens to her and i wish i could babble about it now because i have a lot to say about it but i cant but its something that yes manifests further with her ability that weighs heavily on her emotionally and mentally as a person and i think it would anyone that would be going through a situation like that

1540367 theyre losing jobs and theyre getting a double bite as wage growth slows down and inflation kicks up people are losing out on both ends
1540368 you read the headlines and you look around and you think the world is coming to an end
1540369 but i dont think so if youre going to tell a worst case scenario story at this point its only going to be because the fed loses control
1540370 the fed isnt the whole story but its a big part of it
1540371 it allowed these absolutely insane bubbles to happen the lesson is you cant let these bubbles continue unabated with no policymaking
1540372 they thought it was just a great thing that the stock market kept going higher and higher
1540373 then of course wall street just ran wild it was some mix of irresponsibility and downright greed theyre all sort of on the hook but greenspan sits front and center

1540400 una promulgazione del messale romano rivisto in base ai decreti del concilio ecumenico vaticano secondo
1540401 praticamente significa che se la messa antica ha perduto la sua posizione privilegiata ci nonostante continua ad esistere e il fedele ha diritto ad essa
1540402 problema dei sacerdoti e fedeli che assistono alla cosiddetta messa tridentina

1540405 huiusmodi missalis romani renovatio nequaquam ex improvviso inducta putanda est
1540406 lo stesso messale romano del 1570 era il risultato del confronto e della revisione di antichi codici
1540407 inoltre afferma che il messale stato rinnovato introducendo accanto al patrimonio venerando della liturgia romana nuove norme per la celebrazione
1540408 il concilio non ha per se stesso riformato nel senso di inventare i libri liturgici ma ha disposto la loro revisione e a tal fine ha dato alcune norme fondamentali prima di ogni altra cosa il concilio ha dato una definizione di cosa sia la liturgia e tale definizione costituisce il termine di paragone per ogni celebrazione liturgica dove si scansano tali norme e si mettono da parte le normae generales che si trovano ai numeri 34 36 della constitutio de sacra liturgia sc in tal caso certamente ci si rende colpevoli di disobbedienza al concilio e alla luce di questi criteri che le celebrazioni liturgiche devono essere valutate sia che avvengano secondo i libri antichi sia che avvengano secondo i nuovi e bene ricordare qui che il cardinal newman osservava che la chiesa durante la sua storia non ha mai abolito o proibito le forme liturgiche ortodosse cosa che sarebbe del tutto alinea dallo spirito ecclesiale una liturgia ortodossa cio quella che manifesta la vera fede non mai una compilazione di differenti cerimonie fatta secondo criteri pragmatici costruita in modo positivistico e arbitrario oggi in una maniera e domani in unaltra le forme ortodosse di un rito sono realt vive sgorgate dal dialogo damore tra la chiesa e il suo sposo esse sono lespressione della vita della chiesa che hanno nutrito la fede la preghiera e la vera vita di tutte le generazioni e che incarnano in forme specifiche sia lazione di dio sia la risposta delluomo tali riti possono finire se quelli che li hanno usati in una particolare epoca dovessero scomparire oppure se le condizioni di vita di quelle stesse persone dovesse cambiare lautorit della chiesa ha il potere di definire e limitare luso di tali riti nelle differenti situazioni storiche ma essa non pu mai just puramente e semplicemente proibirli cos il concilio ha disposto la riforma dei libri liturgici ma non ha proibito i libri precedenti

1540411 e voltatosi ai cristiani disse queste parole fratelli miei sino oggi abbiamo combattuto per defensione della patria e per salvar la vita e per li signori nostri temporali ora tempo che combattiamo per salvar lanime nostre per il nostro signore quale essendo morto per noi in croce conviene che noi moriamo per esso stando saldi e costanti nella fede e con questa morte temporale guadagneremo la vita eterna e la gloria del martirio a queste parole incominciarono a gridare tutti a una voce con molto fervore che pi tosto volevano mille volte morire con qual si voglia sorta di morte che di rinnegar cristo
1540412 ratificarono tutti la professione di fede e la generosa risposta data innanzi onde il tiranno comand che si venisse alla decapitazione e prima che agli altri fosse reciso il capo a quel vecchio primaldo a lui odiosissimo perch non rifiniva di far da apostolo co suoi anzi in questi momenti prima di chinare la testa sul sasso aggiungeva a commilitoni che vedeva il cielo aperto e gli angeli confortatori che stessero saldi nella fede e mirassero il cielo gi aperto a riceverli pieg la fronte gli fu spiccata la testa ma il busto si rizz in piedi e ad onta degli sforzi de carnefici rest immobile finch tutti non furono decollati il portento evidente ed oltremodo strepitoso sarebbe stata lezione di salute a queglinfedeli se non fossero stati ribelli a quel lume che illumina ognuno che vive nel mondo un solo carnefice di nome berlabei profitt avventurosamente del miracolo e protestandosi ad alta voce cristiano fu condannato alla pena del palo

1540428 mom first of all healing does not necessarily mean curing in art therapy healing is considered an ongoing psychological process so we are all healing all the time from something whether its cancer or mental illness or divorce or even simply having a bad day in my case i was constantly healing myself of all the sadness and anger and frustration that i had to deal with every day while michelle was sick she and i both took care of our spirits by making things she loved to draw and paint and i loved to garden and sew and make jewelry just the process of making something is healing in itself because the maker is focused on something besides his or her own pain if it is a long term project then it becomes an outlet for the person to sort of fall into a much valued gift of self becomes a gift do you remember the quilt that i made for grandma well i started that quilt just before michelles relapse and continued to work on it for the next few months while she was in the hospital receiving her treatments of course i worked on various projects with michelle but when she was sleeping or too tired to do anything i just sat by her bed and quilted all those stitches into the quilt part of the time i was thinking of michelle and other times i was thinking of grandma i remembered all the delightful stories grandma would tell me and sometimes i would tell them to michelle i put my heart into each stitch and i knew that when grandma saw it she would know that it held as much love as i could give it so in this situation making that quilt helped me to heal my spirit and kept me from getting depressed it distracted me in a way from all the doom and gloom in that hospital as far as michelle was concerned going to the hospital was just a part of her life and all she cared about was having plenty of things to do while we were there one time we made a sculpy clay model of the state of california the doctors and nurses kept coming in and looking at our progress all the while michelle was hooked up to an iv with two or three types of medicine dripping into her veins while we were working on this project though none of that mattered i could go on about this but i guess the bottom line is that being creative for me has been soul saving i have also gotten a lot of satisfaction volunteering for bob burkes kids sam and i do arts and crafts with the kids in the summer and they just love it it doesnt matter what the project is they know that they will be able to go into their little creative fantasy worlds for a few minutes and will come back with something to take home with them just watching their faces is enough to make me want to come back and work with them for the rest of my life

1540485 my daughter camilla lives in new york so i thought why not
1540486 though it is 20 shows later it is still a nerve racking experience to walk into a gallery for my paintings to be on show
1540487 but it is wonderful when they are sold to someone who appreciates them

1540555 hay tambi n una sala de juegos ah bajamos los dos a jugar un rato el lunes por la noche fue bastante divertido fuimos a cenar con gente de otros deportes porque yo conozco a muchos de entrenarme en el centro de alto rendimiento de barcelona ves a alguien con las chanclas de espa a y le saludas rafa y yo jugamos con unos de b dminton al futbol n y los discos fue divertido pero a m nadie me molesta a rafa s el pobrecito se pasa todo el d a firmando fotos dando aut grafos no para

1540559 se calcula que en un viaje hacia el este cada hora de diferencia precisa un d a y medio de adaptaci n
1540560 as que te ricamente pek n a seis horas de espa a exige nueve d as de adaptaci n pero claro siempre hay una componente individual
1540561 lo m s importante ha sido venir aqu un mes antes a los mundiales de osaka jap n 2007 llegu s lo 11 d as antes y no me fue bien aqu los primeros los he dedicado a la adaptaci n horaria y a partir del quinto ya pude entrenarme con las mismas sensaciones que en espa a con el pulso en su sitio que en osaka sal a con 12 pulsaciones m s por minuto
1540562 y ahora me estoy adaptando al calor y la humedad a lo bruto claro por ejemplo salgo a correr a las doce del mediod a justo el momento en que peor hace y me va bien tanto que deseo que el d a del marat n el 24 de agosto la ltima prueba de los juegos las condiciones sean extremas para que sufran todos los dem s y yo no est tan penoso como estuve en osaka al menos hasta el kil metro 30

1540566 lo tenemos todo muy calculado la cantidad de agua que bebe su temperatura muy fr a y el uso de los chalecos muy medido durante las series a la hora de mayor calor pues cargan los trapecios y los dorsales y eso es malo para la nataci n despu s de las series meten las piernas 10 minutos en hielo para acelerar la recuperaci n
1540567 pensaba que no iba a ser tan fuerte como me hab a explicado el seleccionador paco antequera pero lo es m s es una subida de 12 kil metros que hay que hacer casi con plato peque o con una media del 5 y tramos del 10 y hay que subir siete veces para nosotros para freire y para m mejor imposible

1540573 los que han corrido el tour cuentan con una gran ventaja tienen fondo y golpe de pedal
1540574 lo nico que necesitaban tras una semana de descanso era recuperar las sensaciones en la cl sica de san sebasti n aunque eso significara que llegasen m s tarde

1540589 lo primero que he pensado es que ten a 48 metros
1540590 no me pareci tan larga es sin duda la piscina m s r pida en la que he nadado en mi vida la mejor del mundo
1540591 cuando te echas a una piscina r pida lo notas enseguida ste es un deporte de sensaciones de detalles notas la diferencia cuando te afeitas y notas cu ndo una piscina est bien construida el vaso es muy bueno es profundo de unos tres metros y eso disminuye las turbulencias porque anula el efecto rebote las calles son anchas y la recolecci n de agua en los costados es eficiente y absorbe las olas
1540592 esto no es real no me puede estar pasando a m ahora
1540593 me preparaba para estar en la competici n m s importante de mi carrera y fue como si me hubiera ca do una bomba encima yo cre a que esto s lo le ocurr a a gente cinco o diez a os mayor

1540597 we are not the faa police the faas and controllers mission is to provide the safe and efficient movement of live air traffic
1540598 the fact that the faa is now disciplining controllers for not policing pilot actions as they relate to flight regulations is indicative of the tyrannical and oppressive culture the faa has created
1540599 the bottom line is there has been no change in atc requirements just reinforcing the reporting piece
1540600 there were some people in the courtroom that were taken aback by it
1540601 those were the only words i heard him utter in the courtroom
1540602 he shook his head in response to questions from the judge some shakes of his appeared to be in the affirmative some of them appeared to be in the negative
1540603 people should not touch it or attempt to pick it up by the tail as these snakes do bite

1540612 entre las mujeres la espalda los estilos y el 800 son carreras en las que han aparecido grandes nadadoras que est n recortando las marcas
1540613 pienso que para alcanzar la final de 800 libre femenino no ser suficiente con bajar de 8m 23s

1540616 he was a big beautiful animal when i got on him i could tell he was cut out to be pretty special but he had shin problems so we waited on him and i think that was the key
1540617 it was a tough position to be in but its part of the game
1540618 it kills me every time i see curlin run but im happy for them all
1540619 you can elaborate on all the bad things id be much happier if we had played great but i would be much sadder if we had lost
1540620 i told them lets just take it to beijing this was our worst effort or not effort but performance i was concerned after our last game a 21 point victory over russia our guys were already in beijing

1540624 i am saddened not to be able to attend the games
1540625 the olympic games represent something powerful that people can come together from around the world and do things that no one thought were possible
1540626 the olympic truce captures the spirit of the olympics around the games the world should come together to work for peace and speak out against conflict
1540627 that is the first time im hearing it bolt said
1540628 its the first miscommunicating ive ever had with my coach i hope it never happens again
1540629 i thought it was 80 percent but now im 100 percent sure im going to be doubling the jamaican sprinter said with a smile

1540635 absolutely no regrets about the iocs having awarded the games to china
1540636 may i kindly remind you what the topics and the headlines were in athens a week before the 2004 olympic games
1540637 the question mark was will the venues be ready will the organization be ready the beijing venues have been ready since a year ago
1540638 where we had great concerns in athens about the organization but still had wonderful games thanks to the greeks love for the games today we have absolutely no concerns about the organization
1540639 when beijing was awarded the games the ioc required it to provide media with the fullest access possible to report rogge said
1540640 this is what the beijing organizing committee has said it will do
1540641 he believed genuinely and in good faith that a deal had been struck
1540642 im not going to make an apology for something the ioc is not responsible for rogge said
1540643 we are not running the internet in china the chinese authorities are running the internet
1540644 let me be very clear the ioc is in favor of the broadest availability of internet for the media
1540645 the fault now lies on many shoulders and i fear that incompetence laziness and deceit may have played a role kirk wrote on her
1540646 that is much harder to take regardless of intent mistakes were made and i am paying for them
1540647 people i trusted to do their jobs and to ensure the working order of the system we put in place for our sport failed me
1540648 whoever was involved in that shift in position should have made it known to the international media
1540649 the aim of the review is to make the system simpler and to make it more efficient but im not going to buy into the means by which we do that
1540650 it will not be my task in this process as we go through it to rule some things in and to be ruling things out
1540651 i make no apology none whatsoever for saying that we will not be moved on the base or the rate of gst
1540652 that was a committment that we made to the people at the last election and we are not moving on that
1540653 no doubt some people will find some of the observations a little uncomfortable
1540654 i dont want to point to any particular ones to do so would be in itself to make comment on the quality of other peoples arguments and i dont want to choke off discusssion
1540655 if a man was riding a bike with a semi automatic weapon in insert predominantly white middle class neighborhood here and someone called the police something would have been done to make sure those children were safe
1540656 i enjoyed my time here in chicago i wish it would have turned out different
1540657 the hardest part is saying goodbye to teammates its a great bunch of guys a great place to play
1540658 i think i did that to myself last year in the first half
1540659 i dont think lou ever got over that you know thats fine i have no ill feelings and i mean that truly
1540660 i had a bad game against tampa bay giving up four runs and three hits in one third of an inning on june 19 and kind of got pushed aside and everyone else pitched so good
1540661 you cant really go in and complain and say hey i want to pitch because everyone else is doing so well
1540662 jeff samardzija left little room for eyre who was 2 0 with a 7 15 era in 19 appearances this season and also spent two stints on the disabled list
1540663 given queensland healths poor record in managing these issues to date we have concerns about the governance structures and the management accountability within queensland health
1540664 we believe its essential that an external body continues to monitor that very closely
1540665 ill get him one more game in that type of middle relief and hell be able to get back to the closers role
1540666 thats the prudent thing to do get another nice inning of work in the middle and make sure he gains a little more arm strength
1540667 he has had three weeks off so i think we could use him back to back to back as long as he doesnt throw too many pitches
1540668 i felt the hair going up on my back i felt the electricity
1540669 i saw that it kept coming closer and when i saw berkman go i was right behind him
1540670 felt something in my headset right before the game was called without the ninth inning being completed
1540671 you didnt want to be plugged in to anything on that last bolt
1540672 i felt the electricity in the park so to speak
1540673 we didnt get to finish it but we dont have any complaints about the way it was handled
1540674 we were very fortunate no fans were injured that was a very dangerous situation much more for the spectators than it was for the players
1540675 to open the susurluk file means challenging the system neither erdogan nor baykal have such a concern
1540676 baykal is trying to conceal the real perpetrators by this quote
1540677 one of the strategic goals of the kurdish freedom movement is not being only kurdistans social movement but at the same time it aims to gain the turkish people and create living conditions based on the peoples brotherhood and equality in this respect it is impossible for us to implement such an attack in g ng ren given the fact that our goal is to gain the hearts of the turkish people our movement never targeted civilians directly in addition our movement refused all kinds of violence that exceeds our right to self defense and see such violence as counter productive and terrorism
1540678 it is a natural expectation for the turkish people to show their legal and democratic reaction to the unlawful attacks against the tsk

1540683 i cant tell you how much i appreciate the opportunity to tell you what you have done for this country you fought not only the enemy but you fought prejudice and you won you have made the constitution stand for what it really means the welfare of all the people all the time
1540684 well we did what we had to do and all we had to hear was that our boys were in trouble
1540685 i think the whole point was that so many of those men in the 442nd thought they were sent in to rescue the lost battalion because no one valued the japanese american lives two armies had already failed at making the rescue the 442nd is the most decorated veterans battalion of wwii
1540686 we wanted to go to the reunion last september to thank them but they spent all their time thanking us
1540687 they were grateful to learn what their fathers had done because their fathers never talked about it

1540715 the cell phone is a remarkable invention and a breakthrough of great social importance our society will no longer do without cell phones none of the members on the expert committee has stopped or intends to stop using cell telephones this includes dr david servan schreiber a 16 year survivor of brain cancer however we the users must all take precautionary measures in view of recent scientific data on the biological effects of cell phone use especially those who already have cancer
1540716 1 electromagnetic fields from cell phones are estimated to penetrate the brain especially in children figure 1 modeling in the diagram below estimate that young children are more susceptible to electromagnetic fields due to smaller sized brains and softer brain tissue
1540717 electromagnetic fields generated by cell phones should be considered a potential human health risk

1540722 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
1540723 we should require that u s taxpayers be reimbursed for the cost of large projects
1540724 despite iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue in the past five years u s taxpayer money has been the overwhelming source of iraq reconstruction funds
1540725 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1540726 the report shows iraqs budget surplus is likely to grow significantly over the course of 2008 but it is equally important to realize that spending in iraq is also increasing
1540727 were dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon
1540728 is going to make a lot of american families very angry
1540729 the record gas prices they are paying have turned into an economic windfall for iraq but the iraqi government isnt spending the money on rebuilding
1540730 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion

1540738 i read the extending your wiki document that was recently released and it says that in the wireframe theme plist file there are sample sidebars that you can edit to suit your purposes however after looking at that plist both in propery list editor and a text editor there are no sample sidebars in that file

1540743 im able to spare all the things that help men have their dignity and at the same time take away the cancer
1540744 but to say weve seen a quantum leap in regards of one treatment being better than the other is premature
1540745 whats driving the increase is truly the consumer patients are requesting it like never before
1540746 the fact that less blood is lost and a short hospital stay is appealing for some patients
1540747 i freaked out a bit got on the internet and called around to find out what was out there for me
1540748 i do a lot of exercise i wanted to be back on my feet as quick as possible
1540749 i was amazed at what little pain i had i was at home and even walked my dog the very next day
1540750 its important to talk to your doctor to figure out what is the best way to treat your individual case
1540751 most important thing is for men to get screened and know what treatment options are out there for them

1540753 i cant die and leave daniel alone with the kids
1540754 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1540755 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1540756 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal
1540757 in the battle of ideas with the gun lobby were at a constant disadvantage because were honest
1540758 the fact that he fired it was pretty unbelievable that no one was hurt
1540759 if you dont come with me bad things are going to happen
1540760 yes i took her and as long as you play by my rules she will come back unharmed and breathing however failure to abide by the rules will result in a bullet put in her head my rules do nothing sit there in silence and suffer
1540761 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them
1540762 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1540763 we dont know the source of the information being quoted in the media regarding the governments inquiry but these descriptions are incomplete and inaccurate
1540764 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1540765 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1540766 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1540767 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1540768 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1540769 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1540770 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaeda connections that went beyond the evidence
1540771 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1540772 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people
1540773 george said something like well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
1540774 richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationery on which the assignment was written
1540775 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1540776 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1540777 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1540778 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated
1540779 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case
1540780 while i am embarrassed for the idoc and deeply angered and disappointed in the officers conduct that led to the offenders escape i am proud that my department moved quickly to identify those involved in aiding in the escape

1540782 the whole team put together what we did at practice there was so much urgency and more self belief
1540783 we are at a crucial time moving towards the play offs and the end of the competition
1540784 i want them to change their plans and to put forward a similar business plan to paraparaumus
1540785 i am investing a substantial amount myself to bring the parties together to have a discussion and take this venture along a different path
1540786 i am not representing any parties here i am just in the fortunate position to be able to see a possibility and be able to facilitate it
1540787 its important for the community that every airport stays open thats an underlying non negotiable fact
1540788 with wigram ngai tahu can achieve exactly what they want to do but on a more commercial model where commercial activities are carried out which complement the airport
1540789 our strength in new zealand is our natural beauty and tourism is going to be one of the most important aspects of our future we need to have good transport systems in place for that
1540790 in that case it might be worth looking at i will read mr lords letter when it comes
1540791 one thing you would need for the scheme is people to invest in it at the moment ngai tahu is not convinced the scheme would work
1540792 the only thing that will stop us going down the track we are on is if there is a better financial solution and no one has produced that to date
1540793 our props went forward and that laid the platform for the rest of them they were awesome today
1540794 only one team turned up to play today and they were the green team
1540795 we didnt complete a set till about four minutes near the end of the first half we never got any football
1540796 we kept our noses in front all the way but it was real nail biting stuff
1540797 el hecho de que sheen y petersen resulten estar los dos en cbs es una coincidencia

1540800 hes lazy doesnt bring anything to the house got a bit of a temper on his i live with him hes not funny he is not funny so why the is he still in the house i dont understand it at all
1540801 i still dont agree with how he spoke to housemates when we were picking head of house and he snapped and started kicking off with people
1540802 stuarts been hinting to everyone in the house that he wants to go home and i do feel its sort of like hes been putting pressure on all of us to nominate him and to me he shouldnt be doing that
1540803 he doesnt really join in much with the group discussions and he goes to bed early pretty much every night he doesnt really contribute that much compared with everyone else
1540804 i know he really wants to go and i feel so bad saying this because i really get along with him but he doesnt let me and kat and rachel sing
1540805 they are going to have less votes than me i think
1540806 face eviction this week and thinks a nomination for them gives him a better chance at this

1540810 o rosalie youre gonna turn 18 before you know it girl then we can finally do it legally wont that be cool
1540811 yes i am the mother that something bad happened too and no there is no good news the last news you had was more than you could fathom and its gotten so much worse you are very smart not to talk to me just keep doing what youre doing and dont worry i already know you feel bad because it was me and not you but its okay really it is because this is just life and i know about life
1540812 i was lucky to move to milan im very happy and confident of doing well in the olympics
1540813 i am a professional player in every game and every transfer and i want a fresh start
1540814 there is a good mixture of young talent and experience
1540815 mirel is the best player that i have ever worked with
1540816 he is a true professional in all senses and as well as being an excellent defender he can adapt to play anywhere
1540817 i am a conservative in politics but i am not a revolutionary in football simply i have very clear ideas my own philosophy of work and a total confidence in my potential that no one is going to change
1540818 im happy for del piero last year he was unable to carry out preseason and we had to take a little time to get him in shape while this year he is training very well already
1540819 everyone is giving me what i was expecting there will be space for everyone even in attack
1540820 his departure will be official only once he has signed and he has not yet signed anything
1540821 since i started playing as a child i have always dreamed of playing in serie a
1540822 now that i have achieved that aim i want to give everything as i always have and i have added motivation
1540823 people say that i am like a young toni that doesnt scare me on the contrary it pleases me
1540824 i am tall and good in the air but i also like to get the ball at my feet and to run from behind
1540825 we are talking with san lorenzo although we have not yet closed the negotiations
1540826 i am really charged up and want to prove my worth
1540827 id prefer not to talk about juventus and what happened there claudio ranieri was the one who agreed my signature then i had no space in his team
1540828 the last year has been useful in gaining experience i am motivated and have come here to show juve they made a mistake by not putting more faith in me
1540829 i still have a lot of years ahead of me in my career and need to build myself up and develop my right foot
1540830 i dont think hearts have a chance of winning the scottish league
1540831 the main goal for hearts is not winning the league the main goal is to have young players playing and getting better
1540832 this might be the way for them to go to better teams
1540833 forty years to come rangers and celtic will be leading in the scottish premier league and they will be winning the league
1540834 we dont think its the best result because before the games against andorra santa coloma we had problems in the line up we had no strikers
1540835 of course the result is perfect but we hope we can go further now
1540836 samir nasri is a very good player and we are lucky to have signed him i have played alongside him in the french national team and i know he will find his place in the arsenal team
1540837 ronaldo is a fantastic player one of the best in the world
1540838 double indemnity de billy wilder 1944 um dos s mbolos maiores do
1540839 i keep it too real why is n as fakin
1540840 wish i had me some money id buy me some better luck
1540841 my presidents black my lambos blue ill be goddamned if my rims aint too
1540842 it is a thigh strain we need to wait but it could be one week
1540843 it was another good work out it was a good game with four goals for us and good play
1540844 but the players arent 100 per cent yet that would be difficult right now
1540845 that is one of the ones you can believe in the papers he is one of his the managers major targets but there are others who have not made the papers yet thankfully
1540846 david said last week in america i am only going to bring in players who will take the club forward and that is how he is
1540847 he is relentless in that i have never known david say hell do or thatll do
1540848 ive had great support from the chairman and the board ever since ive been here
1540849 hopefully the reward is a bit of stability and a team that proves over the next few years that it is a premier league club
1540850 i would hope there will be a few more coming in before the season starts three four five who knows
1540851 but sometimes the expectations from players advisors are way beyond where we can go
1540852 thats fine by me weve got a wage structure at west brom and the players all understand that its a philosophy i try to have and it wont be broken
1540853 but the search for new players is continuing there is a lot of work going on behind the scenes some targets get pretty close to coming to fruition and then disappear
1540854 on the other hand we continue to get closer to the finish line with other targets
1540855 i would like a few more bodies in but they have to be of the right quality if you cant get the right quality you just have to keep going
1540856 for me by the end of this window hopefully weve got a squad together that can compete for the first three or four months of the season and do okay
1540857 if we need to do anything in january hopefully we are in a position where we can continue to strengthen which we must do
1540858 if it seems to good to be true then it probably is
1540859 the moa was discussed pi ol said if thats the moas content we will ask for a tro temporary restraining order i remember that
1540860 but i said lets not rush anything and think of the consequences
1540861 pag na tro kami diyan bahala na kayo sa sarili ninyo we are not going to sacrifice the lives of the soldiers to defend you
1540862 ang sabi ko noon ang kaso ganito kapag may kaguluhan na nangyayari dito huwag ninyong aasahan na parang tayo ay nasa year 2000 na aatakehin ang milf camps ganun ang konteksto ng usapan namin noon what i said was if ever violence erupts dont think that we will attack milf camps just like what happened in 2000 that was the context of our conversation
1540863 the role of the armed forces of the philippines and the police is to secure the community the line of communications why would anyone think that we will turn our backs from that role i will never abandon mindanao

1540865 cars stuck in traffic or on slippery roads will be able to communicate with other vehicles in a bid to cut down on traffic jams and road accidents under european commission plans unveiled tuesday
1540866 todays commission decision is a decisive step towards meeting the european goal of reducing road accidents
1540867 so clearly saving time through smart vehicles communications systems means saving money
1540868 im not so interested in traditional folk music or patriotic songs
1540869 you need to fill the fema aid application out as soon as possible
1540870 the reason being is if for some reason the sba is not able to provide you with the loan they will refer you back to fema for possible other needs assistance
1540871 i am not so sure hes capable of backing off
1540872 i think hes kind of got a mind set which i think is the best way to race for a championship to go after it every week we wouldnt want to have him do anything other than try to win every race
1540873 im not a happy person when im not running well
1540874 you try to look forward at things and hopefully you can say that 13 is reasonable
1540875 it was pretty cool growing up and watching him and those times when he was able to run well and get those marks and think of the unbelievable seasons that he was having watching him when i was a kid
1540876 if theres a shot for it that would be pretty cool
1540877 when the chase starts theres going to be a different race going on
1540878 theres not going to be the race of going out for wins and doing pit strategy things and stuff like that which will take your chance out of a good top 10 or a good top five you just have to be consistent and stay up there in order to get those finishes
1540879 if theres going to be a way to get through it then im going to do it

1540886 northern rock said they wouldnt offer me a new deal and if i couldnt find one at another bank id go on to their variable rate
1540887 i think the brand as an entity is dead why would you invest in northern rock if you have similar product in another high street bank were seeing fewer and fewer customers going to northern rock the future does not look good for the bank
1540888 northern rock has to be the safest bank in europe if not the world its backed by one of the worlds largest economies so if safety is what you seek northern rock is the place to be
1540889 i believe the mortgage book the retails book and a variety of other assets will be sold because there is value within this organisation there is just no value within the brand itself
1540890 it looks quite scary at a first glance but theyve actually paid back 9bn which is impressive
1540891 northern rock could have closed but it didnt it is still in business even when they make the 1 300 redundancies later this month there will still be something in the region of 4 000 employed and another 12 000 to 15 000 people whose incomes rely on their spending power this is a big deal for the north east
1540892 he just walked down the aisle and stabbed the man in the back
1540893 his pitch was this is the answer to the difficulties with forestry none of these things are new its things they talked about in the past and when you dig down into them an awful lot of them they certainly dont seem to offer the sort of initiative that is needed
1540894 the fact is with this governments policies theyve lost over 20 000 jobs more than 50 mills and you have companies in this area on reduced shifts including here in golden
1540895 there are things that need to be done that are dramatic and i would characterize it as nothing substantive has been done by the government
1540896 you have these cycles constantly and this is not the worst down cycle weve had and what governments have always done is made sure when the cycle was tough like it is now you maintain the capacity
1540897 and thats why you have these mill towns everywhere and that went on all the way up to 2002 2003 and this government got rid of that and so many things and at the time people said well this is going lead to problems and it has
1540898 i cant take it anymore can mets fans please get one day one night where they dont have to sit at the end of the couch with their shrinks phone number in one hand and their favorite beverage in the other what is going on
1540899 i just kind of exchanged looks with pedro and he pointed to his groin area
1540900 maybe wed like to disclose more but legally were disclosing everything we can john van dongen cabinet minister responsible for icbc or maybe the b c liberal government really wouldnt like to disclose exactly what happened with the insurance corporation of b c s little chop shop of horrors
1540901 we need to get an exact sense of the decision
1540902 get big fast damn the cost be brave go over the cliff the competition doesnt have the
1540903 china is a freer better richer place than it was when it was awarded the games
1540904 but actually at closer examination what seemed to come through was firstly its more to do with things like opening up the economy as a whole
1540905 thats one thing we looked at zero flood zone told us it was at the time
1540906 now taking that old study and coming up with new lines how can you do that a lot of things have changed and thats our point
1540907 so now your slab that was okay two years ago is under base gotta have flood insurance thats whats happening
1540908 had some engineering done ourselves in some of those subdivisions box culverts cant even tie new ones back to old ones some are off 3 4 5 feet
1540909 we been through katrina st bernard parish and when i got here said no flood zone but i got it anyway rather be safe than sorry
1540910 the influence is still there that they want it to happen they probably themselves dont have a day set to do it but theyre waiting for an opportunity and something will come along
1540911 the sad part is a lot of people wont be surprised its tragic its sad all we have to do is have one our ships hit and a bunch of americans killed and one or two news stations say it was the iranians and the countrys going to be ready to go to war theyd even be willing to call a draft to say we have to go to save israel we have to march in so we need a draft thats the worst part that i fear
1540912 contrived gulf of tonkin style incident that may well occur to gain popular support for an attack on iran
1540913 it is still totally bewildering to me when i see men and women in the congress that i know and like doing this just to get along
1540914 i agree with you on all you say but the iranians are bad people and they might attack us some day i hear members of congress saying if we could only nuke them

1540916 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1540917 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1540918 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1540919 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1540920 a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
1540921 the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket
1540922 you would have to be crazy who would want to turn themselves in
1540923 are people actually doing it i really find it hard to believe
1540924 gives you time to make arrangements and take care of your personal matters
1540925 it is a way for you to plan your return home
1540926 we understand the impact it has on them when we knock on their doors early in the morning and take them out of their homes
1540927 they dont want their children to go through the trauma of being arrested in the morning
1540928 noted by ice as a factor in your immigration records
1540929 for anyone to say no one will do it thats absolutely wrong
1540930 the change was generated principally by the larger results of our holdings due to the impact a sharp increase in raw material prices had on inventories

1540948 luego de lo ocurrido en la catedral nores bodereau que
1540949 now when abram was ninety nine years old the lord appeared to abram and said to him
1540950 now the lord appeared to him by the oaks of mamre while he was sitting at the tent door in the heat of the day
1540951 your name will no longer be jacob but e because you have struggled with god and with men and have overcome
1540952 it is because i saw god face to face and yet my life was spared
1540953 then moses went up with aaron nadab and abihu and seventy of the elders of israel and they saw the god of israel and under his feet there appeared to be a pavement of sapphire as clear as the sky itself yet he did not stretch out his hand against the nobles of the sons of and they beheld god and they ate and drank
1540954 thus the lord used to speak to moses face to face just as a man speaks to his friend
1540955 no rather i indeed come now as captain of the host of the lord
1540956 m remove your sandals from your feet for the place where you are standing is holy
1540957 but he god said you cannot see my face for no man can see me and live
1540958 no man has seen god at any time the only begotten god who is in the bosom of the father he has explained him
1540959 god who alone possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable light whom no man has seen or can see
1540960 not that any man has seen the father except the one who is from god he has seen the father
1540961 i will go over and see this strange sight why the bush does not burn up
1540962 take off your sandals for the place where you are standing is holy ground
1540963 i am the god of your father the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob

1540965 most modern players are aware of the realism and skill of the pro evolution soccer series
1540966 it is a game that truly mirrors the pace and control of real football and as a diehard fan of the series i am delighted to be working with konami on the latest version
1540967 pro evolution soccer has always been the game of choice for soccer enthusiasts due to its ultra realism and superior gameplay and there is no player in the world more suited to be on the box than the talented forward from barcelona lionel messi
1540968 lionel is one of the most exciting and accomplished players in the world and we look forward to working very closely with him to promote the most advanced pes title ever developed

1540973 hi im calling with the results on the skin biopsies we did ok the one on the right middle back was benign
1540974 the other five all came back abnormal we call it neoplastic
1540975 theyre pre cancer cells which means if they had been left alone they were more likely to turn into skin cancer there are three levels of abnormal cells mild moderate severe so far all of those came back mild but the doctor now wants to see you every four months for rechecks and to remove any more that show any signs of change
1540976 well youre at a much higher risk for skin cancer now so if youre not already doing it protect your skin preventing further skin damage will help although the past damage still keeps you at risk
1540977 no i want to be a little girl and wear a diaper

1540981 desde hace alg n tiempo sabemos que la expansi n del tratamiento puede ayudar a disminuir las infecciones por vih sin embargo nos sorprende el elevado n mero de nuevos casos que se podr an evitar
1540982 a pesar de que se ha incrementado enormemente el n mero de opciones para el tratamiento del vih en todo el mundo a n no nos hemos librado de la epidemia necesitamos utilizar todas las opciones de prevenci n que tengamos al alcance y de una vez para siempre unir la terapia con la prevenci n y no pensar en ambas por separado esto es esencial para lograr el m ximo beneficio de la comunidad en el cuidado del vih
1540983 los resultados de este estudio deber an ayudar a reactivar y mantener la expansi n de los programas antirretrovirales en todo el mundo
1540984 de acuerdo con las experiencias pasadas el aumento de los programas de tratamiento ser un reto importante y dif cil de llevar a cabo
1540985 todav a hay millones de personas que necesitan los f rmacos tenemos dos a os para lograr el acceso universal este trabajo muestra por qu debemos trabajar m s para lograr esta meta el tratamiento como herramienta de prevenci n representa una oportunidad nica pero debemos tener en cuenta que la terapia necesita ser parte de un enfoque integral no tiene sentido tener un programa de tratamiento antirretroviral efectivo en comunidades africanas por ejemplo si no se han atendido al mismo tiempo los problemas de nutrici n y seguridad alimenticia

1540989 the salute is a form of honor and respect representing pride in ones military service
1540990 veterans and service members continue representing the military services even when not in uniform unfortunately current u s law leaves confusion as to whether veterans and service members out of uniform can or should salute the flag my legislation will clarify this regulation allowing veterans and servicemen alike to salute the flag whether they are in uniform or not i look forward to seeing those who have served saluting proudly at baseball games parades and formal events i believe this is an appropriate way to honor and recognize the 25 million veterans in the united states who have served in the military and remain as role models to others citizens those who are currently serving or have served in the military have earned this right and their recognition will be an inspiration to others

1541033 everyone has their full teams and the top three teams in the world are here its a great lead up to the olympics
1541034 this was a great tournament for us in terms of our preparation and i couldnt have asked for more
1541035 our goal in the olympics is to try and beat new zealand
1541036 thats the team that we think we have a shot to compete against the rest of the time is just a learning experience for us
1541037 its pretty amazing whats happened to me since ive been called up
1541038 ive tried to look back and see whats happened but it is all a blur i dont know how it has happened ill have time to think about it later the team is the most important thing right now
1541039 its weird because when i came up i saw the overall leaders had seven home runs and i wondered how am i ever going to get that many
1541040 offensively you are going to see a lot more we havent seen him get hot for an extended period of time hes the type of player that can carry a team for a while hes going to hit for average hes going to hit for power hes going to be a force for a long time
1541041 i didnt know what to do my parents had no idea of what to do either because they hadnt been to college
1541042 our league was horrendous just horrible pitchers werent throwing 93 mph but no jcs even looked at evan so we picked rio hondo because we wanted to go where we could play
1541043 it says a lot about a guy when he wants to come to a team that already has a shortstop
1541044 i was shocked that i got an f and i apologized it taught me that if i wanted to be a team leader i couldnt take things like that for granted that translates to the big leagues if you do things at half speed you arent going to be around long
1541045 it is a life lesson and im glad he remembers it
1541046 two months before the draft we were going to take a pitcher but from all we could gather evan had a combination of things we wanted
1541047 and that includes brooks robinson graig nettles and mike schmidt
1541048 looking down the road i dont want this to be a one year thing
1541049 we have the right players to contend in the east every year i was with montgomery when we won the southern league championship things got crazy speeded up i can only imagine what it is like in the big league playoffs
1541050 in which air quality is comprised of elevated levels of air contaminants
1541051 airborne pollutants that can cause health effects such as cancer genetic mutations organ damage changes to the nervous system and physiological harm as a result of prolonged exposure even in relatively small amounts
1541052 current regulatory criteria for air quality are not sufficiently protective of human health
1541053 for some pollutants there does not appear to be a safe level of exposure even low levels of air pollution can negatively affect human health
1541054 the current point of impingement standards are not adequately protecting human health and the cumulative impact of multiple emitters in an airshed must be considered when approving new industry

1541099 advertisers have pulled back in a pretty meaningful way and display is feeling the brunt of it
1541100 the old model of advertising you create something and buy the space to put it in just isnt working
1541101 during periods of slow economic growth the last thing an advertiser wants to cut is spending on search based advertising
1541102 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1541103 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities
1541104 the wording is a little strong over inflation but theres really no real change in policy
1541105 i think they are trying to buy time to allow the economy to recover and so that the financials can slowly repair
1541106 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1541107 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1541108 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves

1541115 we are grateful for the fact that there is a greater degree of understanding of the magnitude of the problem in afghanistan and therefore a greater degree of commitment
1541116 the fact is that afghanistan is larger than iraq with terrain that is more difficult and more complicated the forces only just got increased to 85 000 and this is not enough to defend the country against terrorism
1541117 these were not accusations these were clear facts while some of our international friends didnt agree with our decision to take a stronger stand against pakistan over the last six years for political reasons we were very clear to point to the real origin and the real source of terrorism in the region
1541118 the civilian government understands the danger of the talibanization of pakistan which is coupled with another serious threat i call the pakistanization of al qaeda do they have the necessary capability well have to see the military has the capability but they dont have the commitment
1541119 iran has a huge problem of addiction and consumption particularly in heroin and opium this has been a historic problem in iran there has been a very good degree of cooperation between the two countries especially along the border

1541126 they will learn the words they just wont point and wine before they learn to talk that leads to fewer tantrums and wining as toddlers
1541127 i love that i am helping these families but we pay to put the show on the air

1541141 the consequences are already happening in neighboring countries like china south korea and taiwan they have to import brides
1541142 i dont know where vietnam could import brides from if that situation happened here in the next 10 or 15 years
1541143 i have noticed that there have been more and more boys than girls
1541144 most women are very happy when they have boys while many are upset if they have girls
1541145 its very difficult to imagine whats going to be the exact impact of these missing girls in 20 years
1541146 no human society that we know has faced a similar problem
1541147 my husband took me to a private clinic to be checked i broke down in tears when i saw the result because i knew this is not what my husband wanted

1541149 thats all i can tell you right now he said
1541150 it might be someone who got slighted on the reps he said
1541151 i think the black people would say he obama dont talk act or carry himself as a black person
1541152 but i think that thats what they would say even though the black society would pull for him i still think that they think in the back of their mind that the only reason he is in the general election is because he talks acts and carries himself as a caucasian
1541153 a conservative democrat who is sometimes embarrassed for his party
1541154 we did some rehearsals but then i found out it was six days a week for a couple of months i was flattered but with my schedule there was no way i could fit it in

1541186 men are naturally impelled to preserve the memories of the laws and institutions that bind them in their societies
1541187 men mean to gratify their bestial lust and abandon their offspring and they inaugurate the chastity of marriage from which the families arise

1541193 by the time he met the senora de vidal he had become deeply interested in manila and was ready to be interested in any woman who most piquantly suggested that combination of primitive mysticism and slick modernity which he felt to be the special temper of the city and its people
1541194 the mountains and the woman sleeping in a silence mighty with myth and mystery for she was the ancient goddess of the land said the people sleeping out the thousand years bondage but when at least she awoke it would be a golden age again for the land no more suffering no more toil no rich and no poor

1541197 the present is included in the origins chronology remaining a repetition of the genesis if not actually a genealogical transfer one can say that this novelistic drive to trace the origin of a sequence or progression testifies to a scheme to wrest an original omniscience belonging to god

1541214 the bush administration estimates that expanded offshore drilling could increase oil production by 200 000 bbl per day by 2030 we use about 20 million bbl per day so that would meet about 1 of our demand two decades from now meanwhile efficiency experts say that keeping tires inflated can improve gas mileage 3 and regular maintenance can add another 4 many drivers already follow their advice but if everyone did we could immediately reduce demand several percentage points in other words obama is right
1541215 using your logic maybe we should shut down the existing offshore oil rigs and the land rigs too

1541242 we are just out here enjoying it trying to feel that good breeze thats coming in
1541243 weve fared this pretty well thank god weve had a lot worse
1541244 demand numbers have been weak here for quite a period of time
1541245 may confirm expectations but theyre not a shock to the system
1541246 we were down big overnight and it really started on the european soft market data on manufacturing
1541247 retail sales were pretty lousy leading everyone to surmise that the european economy isnt immune to the slowdown here in the u s
1541248 very little oil production seems to have been shut in by edouard
1541249 gasoline stocks are high enough to limit any crisis from refinery shutdowns so the markets returning its attention to the weak demand picture
1541250 i was trained almost 30 years ago and received a lot of training in psychotherapy
1541251 thanks to the advances of managed care psychotherapy was basically devalued from the perspective of psychiatry all that we were supposed to do was diagnose and consult for pharmacotherapy a lot of the incentives for wanting to be in psychiatry were essentially removed by managed care
1541252 they tend to rely more heavily on self paying patients
1541253 whats happened anecdotally is that some of the residents that i trained with have basically dropped out of insurance plans and are taking cash only business where they can provide the comprehensive services including psychotherapy
1541254 its a clientele thats at a much higher economic level if theyre socially inclined they end up volunteering at community mental health centers
1541255 we know that for depression the combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy leads to better outcomes
1541256 galveston is open for business and we certainly welcome the tourists back to the island
1541257 texas is grateful that this storm did not escalate to hurricane strength before making landfall on our shores
1541258 youll see some green up ideally if you get enough rain you can sustain a good bit of growth and maybe get some hay out of it
1541259 overall its just one of those years everybodys just hanging on living from one rain to the next

1541264 this evening i have received formal advice regarding legal discussions surrounding paula wriedt and am now taking the first opportunity to advise the public
1541265 dpac has advised that they have entered into the proper formal process to resolve this matter
1541266 when dad started the business back in his early 20s he probably didnt think it would be in business 70 years
1541267 coming from the same family and having the same upbringing we have the same values
1541268 being a small company and being flexible we can turn on a dime
1541269 there were plenty of chances to roll with the punches and figure out how to make things work in those years when money was tight and the market was low
1541270 so the more we produce the lower the price and people tend to eat more of it
1541271 we have a much better quality product because of reduction of blood spotting in white meat areas and wingjoint areas
1541272 its day and night from what it used to be
1541273 taking action in order to raise the highest quality healthy animals and being stewards to the environment
1541274 the optimal way of producing goods through the removal of waste as waste is eliminated quality improves while production time and cost are reduced
1541275 by having them participate in change they feel part of something
1541276 you must have convicted dedicated and passionate people who are interested in making change for the better
1541277 we learned a long time ago when we were small and trying to expand how important it is to have good people surrounding you who care about the business and running it day to day
1541278 we want people to take it upon themselves to act like business owners here
1541279 one nice thing about working for this family and why they have been around so long is they have the initiative to be out on the leading edge
1541280 we call our employees team members because were all in this for the same cause
1541281 everyone is hands on from the top level of management to the bottom
1541282 there is a lot of emphasis placed on team members safety environment and always being fair
1541283 weve been a young company for the most part but we have people who are thinking about moving on
1541284 and these people are in key positions if we dont handle succession planning on our management team we will face an obstacle to our future
1541285 theyre the next generation moving in and theyre part of our succession plan
1541286 they really wanted to blame somebody in the middle east
1541287 how to deploy and use these kinds of substances so you start to piece it all together

1541300 the media has ignored in their reporting the increase in antarctic sea ice cover in recent years with at present a coverage that is well one million square kilometers above average
1541301 unfortunately it appears that most journalists just parrot the perspective of the first news release on these climate issues without doing any further investigation
1541302 if we ever forget that were one nation under god then we will be a nation gone under
1541303 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb protesting the vote

1541307 we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain who has fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
1541308 weve seen this happen before and were not going to let it happen to us
1541309 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
1541310 an unattractive carryover from his days playing pickup basketball at harvard
1541311 the sole consistency that i can find is that the government always wins
1541312 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1541313 i dont think theres any question that obamas race will be made salient by republicans at various levels
1541314 in most universities being a racist is a lot worse than being a commmunist
1541315 rush invents overstates and makes the topic inflammatory and a focus of anger
1541316 its most likely the matter will result in a high court action

1541321 viewed on the whole the group more than compensates for the services it receives
1541322 i have two sons who fought in the war one went to iraq and one to kuwait
1541323 oh hey sweetie what time is it is something wrong
1541324 yes im wrong mister and i need to get right i am in dire desperate need of some seriously dark deep down home disease free deviant dickin in my ditch of debauchery i need to get sticky goddamnit and you are the man for the job
1541325 come on baby cut the shit i am completely horn dog horny over here im dripping like a hot coffeemaker in hells kitchen im as moist as grandmas homemade buttermilk biscuits
1541326 are you certifiable are you insane i mean its 2am in the morning woman besides i have my kids with me
1541327 so just leave them be and come on over here besides it really shouldnt take that long knowing you
1541328 now wait just a goddamn minute dont you be startin no shit with me because i will hang up this phone and then you can just go kindly fuck the kitchen appliance of your choice
1541329 no listen to me ive left my own children at home alone dozens of times ya know kids are really self reliant youd be surprised
1541330 yes i remember you saying that on the witness stand when i went to your trial for child negligence
1541331 for serious shug all i need is for you to just slice me a half dozen good strokes with that thing and my pussy will be purring like a kitten with my whiskers all covered in milk when its over
1541332 hell by the time i finish with you your pussy wouldnt be purring it would be straight up put to motherfuckin sleep
1541333 well come on over then and euthanize me good n proper with your special man made injection
1541334 i dont think so besides i thought you were on your period
1541335 yeah so i mean i have a shower that works and plenty of clean towels i have the technology
1541336 no its just hella gross besides i heard that you can get sickle cell anemia from doing that
1541337 oh bullshit only black people get sickle cell and i know that you damn sure cant get it from pussy i think that you are righteously out of your goddamn mind i think that you read too many dumbass books
1541338 well still i aint no fucking bloodsucking fornicator maybe you should hook up with dracula instead he lives over on the east side and he drives a pimped out hearse with gold rims i also heard that he deals weed too and that its potent enough to even knock a zombie on its undead ass
1541339 oh come on you wouldnt get any blood on ya i promise we could use a condom
1541340 no i dont use condoms and you know this because i said goodbye to that shiznit the day i had my vasectomy and as far as me having any sexually transmitted diseases lemme tell ya my dick is so clean that you could boil it in a pot of cabbage and serve it to some leprechauns come st patricks day
1541341 god you are impossible i cant believe youre turning down a perfectly good piece of ass at 2 in the morning
1541342 thats just an excuse dont go blaming your pitiful libido on poor dinner choices and you leave the chef out of this i think hes pretty hawt for an old dude i always did like a man who could cook
1541343 ya know you are really one morose motherfucker shuga i think that you really need to get on some sort of anti depressant medication youre the only man i know who could turn a booty call into a moody call
1541344 well im sorry that i have a brain and that im able to reason and rationalize and that i dont wanna get any blood on my boner i apologize profusely for that and let me tell ya something else i think that the longer a person goes without having sex the smarter they become i think its due to all of that built up excess energy so i figure if i go another 6 months or so without getting laid then i will have singlehandedly thought up the cure for cancer
1541345 are you telling me that youre just gonna bitch out on me and leave me here hanging all hot and bothered dont you just wanna come over here slam my head up against the wall and fuck the shit right out of my ass right here on the goddamn puke green carpet
1541346 you always were a hopeless romantic darlin but im really not into anal either i told you i am an american and besides its a well known fact that anal sex between heterosexual couples is never done just for recreational purposes its strictly political the only time you ever fuck a woman in the ass is when you want to make a profound statement of some kind because those are the rules and without rules we have nothing but total ass fucking anarchy
1541347 so if anal sex amongst heterosexuals is strictly political does that mean that presidential candidates should start incorporating sodomy into their ad campaigns
1541348 well if they did then its quite possible that i might actually start voting
1541349 youre an asshole shuga and i hope you end up wasting away in some nursing home nut house somewhere after some chick cuts off your balls one night and sells em to a butcher shop
1541350 listen will you please just go away and bleed and leave me the hell alone you cant emasculate me like that and then expect to get laid it just doesnt work that way
1541351 fuck you and if you see me at the supermarket do not speak to me
1541352 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1541353 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1541354 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1541355 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1541356 a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
1541357 the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket
1541358 proper inflation can also improve gas mileage by more than 3 when maintained regularly
1541359 if i do this or dont do this will you make the pain go away
1541360 if you make it not so i promise that i will

1541364 we feel this is a serious crime he has destroyed many peoples lives
1541365 to say that mr atkins has not cooperated with the state securities department is a fallacy
1541366 theyre left destitute and without resources because theyre past retirement age
1541367 he came out with an emphasis just to be himself just do his thing the right way
1541368 t his interview will open many peoples eyes it will shake islam from the roots and im not exaggerating
1541369 what other case do you know where a son of a hamas leader who was raised on the tenets of extremist islam comes out against it
1541370 to see your interpretations make sure to post a link to your creation in the comments
1541371 were taking existing resources that are already available and then providing more training and organization and expertise for those individuals coming home
1541372 it is a good fit because our military personnel are already pretty physically active also the idea of representing their country is very important to them
1541373 for a long time i went through a lot of depression
1541374 it takes a big toll in your life to go through what i have but i learned there is light at the end of the tunnel
1541375 when i put the uniform on there is a lot of pride all over again and there are a lot of veterans like me who are injured thats going to be our future with the paralympics
1541376 they are the greatest athletes in the world who are physically disabled there are world records and amazing performances
1541377 one of our biggest supporters is the u s paralympics team
1541378 we teamed up with the olympic training center and they are working with us as we train for future events
1541379 a lot of the paralympic athletes show up at our events
1541380 the movement exists today as a result of injured veterans coming home from all over the world
1541381 we have always served the military weve always been involved with veterans that is why we are here
1541382 i cant tell you how important sport is in rehabilitation not just in the physical side but the mental side
1541383 look at scott winkler he left this country larger than life and came home in a wheelchair it was sport that re engaged him it not only changes the individuals perspective but the perspectives of friends and the family and the entire support network
1541384 it gives you something else to do something to focus on because when you are sitting in the hospital you are depressed and thinking oh my life is over now
1541385 life is not over just because youre injured or disabled there is a whole new life you can lead
1541386 i have a saying if you can believe you can achieve
1541387 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1541388 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory
1541389 its just silly because the way people are talking about it youd think it was a bertolucci movie or something
1541390 were just recently very recently engaged so you know were just taking it easy and no big plan yet but its a good time and were just enjoying our time to be young and engaged
1541391 i mean im 23 theres no reason to rush into it everything feels very natural and relaxed
1541392 we are studying this issue so we can put an end to this phenomenon
1541393 there are different religious opinions regarding the marriages which is why we need the government to settle the issue through legislation
1541394 islam has stipulated that both parties agree to the marriage contract
1541395 the woman must express real consent to the suitor and a guardian must not impose his choice of husband on her or force his son to marry someone he doesnt want
1541396 can enter a marriage contract with a 1 year old girl not to mention 9 years 7 years or 8 years
1541397 this is just a contract indicating consent and the guardian in this case must be the father
1541398 isnt it better to marry his daughter to a man with whom she can stay and who can protect her and support her and when she reaches the proper age have sex with her who says all men are ferocious wolves
1541399 a marriage official should not conclude a marriage contract without the womans agreement and without her signature
1541400 when girls are married off at a young age they will be deprived of education and of enjoying their childhood
1541401 their bodies wont be able to tolerate pregnancy and delivering children
1541402 there were some people in the courtroom that were taken aback by it
1541403 those were the only words i heard him utter in the courtroom
1541404 he shook his head in response to questions from the judge some shakes of his appeared to be in the affirmative some of them appeared to be in the negative
1541405 i ask you therefore will you love her honor and keep her and be faithful to her so long as you both shall live
1541406 i bring the adventurous side out of darren he used to be scared of heights
1541407 we are a bit crazy together so we wanted something that suited
1541408 we are looking for a clear positive response from iran and in the absence of that were going to have no choice but to pursue further measures against them
1541409 but to begin again to prepare sanctions resolutions for the security council
1541410 theres no question heath ledgers performance has made cinematic history its one of the most important or memorable villains ever
1541411 that added to it but i think you have to look at a film in its entirety its the marvelous job the filmmakers and the actors did
1541412 i just dont like him for the things hes done he seems to be fighting the abortion issue more than anything else

1541419 lets go out to my car so we can talk
1541420 start out slow and build yourself up to get in better shape
1541421 hey it is icy out there and remember you dont know how to drive on the ice so either dont go out and drive or slow way down
1541422 theyre going to be held every tuesday in the month of august free and open to the public
1541423 theyre not connected we certainly hope some people might feel the need to attend all of them but each one stands on its own
1541424 periodically we do various types of community training and community interest types of things
1541425 we have a parenting series that will start in september when we do these presentations the more people who take advantage of them the better
1541426 first you have to understand what normal grief is second you have to look at the differences in how people grieve there are major differences between men and women
1541427 third well look at what are some specific things people can do to help themselves recover
1541428 fourth what are the key resources for most people one of most basic resources is the dimension of spirituality
1541429 any time we experience loss it creates a search for meaning how do we make sense out of death
1541430 people whove been transplanted from some other place can often go through a time of grieving the loss of friends family familiar places
1541431 nancy reagan had to be telling him goodbye and taking care of him for 10 years empty nesters whove lost children through the natural process also grieve
1541432 i compare it to an athlete who has experienced an injury in a game
1541433 they have to do workouts and get strength back grief work is that kind of process
1541434 the loss of children especially younger children is something parents never fully get over
1541435 but you can get a whole lot better there will always be some scar tissue there but it wont be sore and wont be hurting and aching like it did at one time
1541436 my interest was prompted by what i could do to help those people
1541437 to me when somebodys going through a heavy loss its a kind of sacred honor to walk with them through that experience theyre opening their heart and life to you and thats pretty special
1541438 be supportive to them and do a lot of listening
1541439 do not tell them its okay youre going to get over it
1541440 i remember one lady i worked with who had lost a child as an infant 44 years ago
1541441 she came to one of my grief groups everyone had told her she was young she could have more babies
1541442 she said i was trying to honor that life that was lost she carried that with her for 44 years
1541443 i do 1 500 to 2 000 miles a month

1541461 in the immediate aftermath of the 2001 anthrax attacks white house officials repeatedly pressed fbi director robert mueller to prove it was a second wave assault by al qaeda but investigators ruled that out the daily news has learned
1541462 after the oct 5 2001 death from anthrax exposure of sun photo editor robert stevens mueller was beaten up during president bushs morning intelligence briefings for not producing proof the killer spores were the handiwork of terrorist mastermind osama bin laden according to a former aide
1541463 they really wanted to blame somebody in the middle east the retired senior fbi official told the news
1541464 on october 15 2001 president bush said there may be some possible link to bin laden adding i wouldnt put it past him
1541465 if you want us to take all your money press 6 automated messages
1541466 understood that this extended to things like downloadable content and online play
1541467 if i had asked my customers what they wanted they would have said a faster horse
1541468 im a loving judge i know you have a good heart you are forgiven of your crimes and are free to go
1541469 if you believe what you like in the gospels and reject what you dont like its not the gospel you believe but yourself

1541473 ok so its not this and its something broader but then what is it
1541474 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
1541475 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
1541476 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
1541477 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
1541478 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1541479 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1541480 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
1541481 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
1541482 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
1541483 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
1541484 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
1541485 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
1541486 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1541487 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1541488 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1541489 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
1541490 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
1541491 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
1541492 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
1541493 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
1541494 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
1541495 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
1541496 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
1541497 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
1541498 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
1541499 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
1541500 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
1541501 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
1541502 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
1541503 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
1541504 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
1541505 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
1541506 oh yeah that guy from the beach was really hot
1541507 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
1541508 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
1541509 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1541510 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1541511 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
1541512 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
1541513 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
1541514 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
1541515 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
1541516 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
1541517 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
1541518 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
1541519 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
1541520 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
1541521 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
1541522 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
1541523 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
1541524 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
1541525 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
1541526 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1541527 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
1541528 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
1541529 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
1541530 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

1541534 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
1541535 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba

1541537 sounds like paris is taking the all of the above energy approach that john mccain has advocated both alternatives and drilling

1541540 if you want to see the future imagine someones boot stamping on the human face forever
1541541 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
1541542 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
1541543 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
1541544 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
1541545 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
1541546 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1541547 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1541548 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
1541549 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

1541586 i thought the provincial unions were working together in terms of looking at the air new zealand cup review and here we are hearing about nine unions wanting to go it alone in a competition that will see the demise of the franchises which is not in the interests of tasman thats for sure
1541587 im only hearing through the media that tasman doesnt have a place in the air new zealand cup in 2009 i havent heard that confirmed one way or the other by the new zealand rugby union so whether its media speculation or people reading into the comments of nzru chief executive steve tew as far as im concerned the decision hasnt been made

1541592 paul has done a track about how he feels about heather and what was going on with the paparazzi because no one has heard his side of it at all so this will be the first time anyone hears a song relating to that subject
1541593 what the song shows is that rather than feeling embittered towards heather paul just feels sorry for her
1541594 he feels sorry that she was never able to tell him the full truth about her past life he feels that their romance happened so fast and so publicly that a lot never really got said
1541595 paul knows heather is a complex person and deeply misunderstood but that she has hardly helped herself by being less than transparent about her life

1541601 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1541602 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
1541603 the era of u s funded major infrastructure projects is over

1541686 together the first time home buyer tax credit and foreclosure relief in the housing bill will help to reduce inventories

1541747 its like the first day of school and trying to find your way around
1541748 but ive been here before just not on the other side it will be a lot of fun im going to enjoy it
1541749 i played against ozzie i also had a fiery manager in lou piniella so i know what to expect but these guys were in first place before i got here
1541750 they are a great bunch of guys usually im the loud one before a game but in no way shape or form am i on this team
1541751 ive caught myself staring at him walking up and down the locker room
1541752 everyone can sit there and i say i collected his baseball cards but i really did i remember going to stores and getting a pack of cards and hoping that he was in there its shocking hes in our locker room but hes quiet and takes care of business
1541753 ive played with or against three of the coaches here
1541754 rather than placing them uniformly the cells are arranged in changing densities which allows for more natural light to reach the interior as well as converting excessive solar radiation into energy thus increasing the buildings performance
1541755 i built it for myself about 4 years ago and this is the culmination of years and years of thinking about how to make it available to the world before long youll have a rolling history of your sex life on which to reflect
1541756 that was my dream to see how easy it is to criticize people from up there
1541757 how its easy to see the game real nice from there get up and eat drink talk be on the phone
1541758 no i dont know yet last time i was in general manager ken williams and chairman jerry reinsdorfs office and i dont like that i might go to my house and watch it
1541759 you cannot win no matter what you do or what you say
1541760 they thought i said the wrong thing through the media but i just wanted to make it clear when i talked to the media sunday it was right before the umpire came out and apologized and said i made the wrong decision
1541761 after you see zack greinke hit nick swisher that clicks in your mind like whats going on here you start looking around like are they abusing my team or are they thinking were scared thats why i made that comment
1541762 a lot of people thought when we went to kansas city we were going to have some problems i didnt do anything because i truly believe those guys didnt throw at my players
1541763 now i know i cant do anything about it because theyre going to have a warning theyre going to be looking at me
1541764 ill just move on quiet and im not going to start anything i will finish something but im not going to start
1541765 when i heard that the carrasco did not get suspended at all i was disappointed because im hurt
1541766 i got my left hand hurt and my right hand hurt i didnt agree
1541767 like i said no one was throwing at anybody we werent trying to hit anybody
1541768 the bases were loaded and we were down six or seven runs its idiotic for anyone to think that
1541769 lets face it none of us have heard of anyone hitting anyone on purpose with the bases loaded
1541770 ive never heard of that in the game after that the comments that were made subsequently were the ones that ultimately got ozzie in trouble
1541771 the only thing is the money thats a lot of money
1541772 i can buy another house in venezuela with the money
1541773 its only been a few days but manny is like pujols in that they not only drive in runs but they make the guys around them better because pitchers are so concerned with their spot coming up in the order
1541774 so the hitters in front of them might get better pitches because the pitcher doesnt want these guys coming up with the game on the line
1541775 thats what it means by just having their presence in the lineup tony la russa cardinals manager always put a good fastball hitter ahead of albert to get better pitches to hit last year it was chris duncan a lot
1541776 you can already see the same thing happening with us russell martin batting third is seeing better pitches and if the guys ahead of him get on hes not only capable of driving one in hes a threat to clear the bases
1541777 from what i understand the energy makes these potentially the biggest moves to help us win the division one guy cant win a division but weve got a legitimate power guy now and he hits for average
1541778 i dont expect people to be happy about not playing
1541779 id rather have an unhappy player than a happy player sitting on the bench
1541780 the argument for juan is the job he did when rafael furcal went down the quality of his at bats the dimension of speed he gives us ethier is more of a power hitter with a great arm but doesnt possess speed
1541781 its almost like youre going through spring training again knowing youre down for a period of time
1541782 if you let him go out and throw three innings any pitcher is going to feel it more than you want to weve got to build him back up again i think he will build up quicker but we still have to go through that process
1541783 it would be hard to imagine him not having probably four
1541784 you look at two innings then three four five you always figure one in there where the guy goes backwards a little bit or needs to go backwards on workload i think thats realistic
1541785 they said the anti inflammatory part would feel good within the first 24 hours and then whatever the medicine is might take three or four days
1541786 getting out of bed my abs didnt hurt so ive got to believe thats a good sign i havent jogged or anything but moving around feels a little better im hoping thats a step in the right direction
1541787 were trying to get this lineup as elongated as we can
1541788 i like right now the way youk is hitting youk has been a pretty legitimate bat right in the middle of that order were just trying to again have some depth and some balance
1541789 i dont think j d has any aspirations of becoming the next rickey henderson
1541790 but hes doing it kind of for the good of our team which i appreciate and i actually dont want him to hit first the whole year in the meantime for right now it gives us the best chance to win thats really all it is im not trying to shake him up just trying to have some balance and get some guys on base that for when the middle of the order comes up we have the most guys on base
1541791 they told me they could give me shots every six weeks im not sure that i want to go that rout
1541792 maybe theyve thought of some different treatment stuff like pool stuff where you dont have the stress of weight bearing stuff were going to try that especially when we get back to boston just anything to make it feel more comfortable
1541793 hes another big piece of what were building here its going to be great to see him get experience and get it started out here
1541794 wednesday was gios regular day to pitch and i wanted to give duchscherer a regular days rest
1541795 duchscherer is having such a great year i just felt like at this point of the season giving him an extra day would be good
1541796 hes young and just needed to sharpen up a couple different parts of his game in the spring but his fastball and curveball and everything were well above the major league average it was outstanding he needed a little bit more seasoning but obviously he made a real good impression with everyone
1541797 first time facing hitters i was flying open really bad so ive got some work to do mechanically but those are things you can knock out usually pretty fast my arm felt good and my finger felt great
1541798 thats a product of flying open and not allowing your body to be in the right position to throw the ball
1541799 at times i was like that but there were other times where i was good the consistency just comes with pitching with the exception of my slider i was decently happy with it i dont think i was very sharp by any means but i would have gotten some outs today
1541800 you dont expect him to walk out there and be in midseason form
1541801 hes got to get a feel for his delivery and everything but the most important thing is his health and that looked good im encouraged that hes healthy thats a good start
1541802 the things that you lose when youre not out there every day are the life on your ball and the consistency of your mechanics
1541803 my finger was great i didnt have a second thought about it i feel like im one or two throws away from being right where i need to be
1541804 you know the games changed when the commissioner bud selig has to come up with an incentive for guys to want to play the game
1541805 it certainly has changed and i think once the game starts guys get hyped and excited about it were just hoping that the excitement will be back there in the national league to turn it around
1541806 weve got a new city now and its something to show off
1541807 this is a very exciting time for cardinals baseball and the city of st louis
1541808 it will pump hundreds of millions of dollars into our economy and tens of thousands of people to st louis
1541809 i know major league baseball is going to be very happy about this
1541810 im here to guarantee you that this is going to be the absolute best all star game that youve ever seen
1541811 when the fans come here they are going to see a great city and a great region i know its still a year out but were looking forward to it and i think its going to be great
1541812 the crow case is a little interesting in some respects that decision is easier than all its kind of pretty well determined
1541813 we know what the chad corderos the ryan zimmermans the chris marreros and the ross detwilers received we know what their value is we know what the no 10 pick in the first round is already getting the feeling is regarding crow its between no 10 this year and what detwilers contract was thats the appropriate value its fairly easy to figure out
1541814 im sure well sign some more of our picks but i dont think we will sign all of them but we will try
1541815 we studied this pretty carefully we decide the value that we place on prospects thats the no 1 consideration sometimes its more than major league baseballs recommendations sometimes its less than the recommendations
1541816 it still comes down to what value we place on guys and to determine that value we pay close attention to the market activity and comparable signings we are just not going to pay something because extraneous voices decide well this is what i decide i have to have we are not going to do that
1541817 the 2008 draft felt like one of those years where we wouldnt sign all of our top picks which is like a normal year last year was an aberration
1541818 this draft has felt different to me because of the kind of guys we drafted and some of their circumstances and i think thats how its playing out
1541819 last year we were among the leaders in amateur signing bonuses we are prepared to do that this year but we are not going to do unreasonable contracts
1541820 that was the best and roughest time ever for me
1541821 its always exciting to get a chance to see people especially with an off day here
1541822 theres friends and family that i always stay in touch with but my friends and family do a great job and i appreciate it of coming to detroit a lot too so its not like when i come here that i havent seen people in a long time
1541823 when i talk to other guys on the team they say when they have friends and family in town and theyre playing in front of them theres so much pressure to perform
1541824 and the good thing is considering this isnt the only game theyre going to see me that theyve had a chance to see me five 10 15 sometimes 20 games one of those games ive done something and at the end of the day it doesnt matter if its 0 for 4 or 4 for 4 theyre just happy to get a chance to come to the game and see me
1541825 i think were at where we hoped we were going to be hes healthy and i think the next step is for him to be able to face live hitters and wed like to get him into an organization where he can sign now
1541826 the mets were one of the first teams interested back in october
1541827 general manager omar minaya has been in touch with me the mets were one of the teams we couldve signed freddy to in the offseason but he opted to do his rehab on his own
1541828 we aspire to something more than that something fair to garcia
1541829 he doesnt seem to me to be a this year guy
1541830 i just need to pitch to hitters and throw in games so i can show them my true velocity thats whats missing is the games
1541831 first i have to sign with someone if not i wont be able to pitch anywhere
1541832 yeah i think if i throw three or four innings and i pitch like five games ill be ready in the bullpen nobody throws as hard as they can
1541833 when i saw him and where hes at right now i dont see that happening
1541834 as he starts facing hitters and his velocity kicks in hell have even better stuff and more velocity
1541835 but were not going to take every dollar that this club has at its disposal this year and will next year and give all that money to a player who has yet to take a swing in professional baseball
1541836 a much more beneficial way to allocate that money is to sign more players in the draft or to sign some of the core players that could be big pieces on this club for years to come to longer deals
1541837 we knew we were making aggressive selections and thats why we set the draft budget higher than in the past
1541838 now with that extra money yes maybe we can sign some of those aggressive selections
1541839 given the discussions with alvarezs representative the thought is that the best deal is going to come in those final minutes before the deadline
1541840 but at some point we are going to have to make a decision regarding where our money is best spent
1541841 hopefully were looking forward to having many players from our ballclub
1541842 if we have many players in the all star game next year that means that were having a great year hopefully well have tony la russa being our manager because that would mean that we won the world series this year or the national league championship
1541843 hopefully if he is our manager hopefully he can put me in the game
1541844 the extra stuff that comes with it is a part of it im not worried about being a face of the cardinals im not worried about anything like that im worried about taking the field to try to help the team win
1541845 fortunately for me this year ive had a good year and ive been able to do some things this year that a lot of people didnt expect its just been a tremendous year
1541846 major league baseball put on a great event from the red carpet to the hall of famers the tuesday game was a memory that is always going to be with me seeing all these hall of famers walking in ozzie smith bob gibson lou brock and all the other guys it was an unbelievable moment
1541847 slept good for the first time in a few weeks
1541848 anytime you have surgery in that area theres some risks
1541849 but i think dr dan riew was so confident in his procedure that it kind of put me at ease
1541850 one of the comments the doctor made when he went in there and saw the mess he had on the nerve
1541851 he cant believe he was playing over the last period i mean this guys got incredible guts
1541852 i think i just have to be careful for a couple weeks and i can do ordinary stuff

1541871 the council does acknowledge theres definitely a concern for the neighbours and its a matter that has to be addressed
1541872 at the end of the day if we can achieve an outcome where theres a win all around that would be ideal but we have to deal with this clearly and objectively

1541889 the goal is to excite and entertain a non theatre going audience and inspire them with the limitless possibilities of live theatre
1541890 the audience which did not resemble any audience i have seen at the delacorte or any other mainstream shakespeare venue obviously loved it
1541891 our production of romeo and juliet was loosely based on the tv show law amp order and the tempest was inspired by lost this production of twelfth night is loosely inspired by image conscious new yorkers obsessed with their fitness rituals
1541892 is the brightest star in the musical theatre galaxy it is a perfect union of story and song that sparkles with buoyant wit irrepressible joy and unabashed ardor
1541893 a musical like requires talent experience and the technical skill represented by our veteran performers it also requires the stamina enthusiasm and exuberance of our young professionals not only do they get to work on the greatest material ever written but in rehearsals they have gotten a daily workshop in singing acting dancing in a variety of styles and even dialect work from some of the nations most experienced performers they are becoming more versatile and discovering just how much they will need to know to make it in the business
1541894 a brilliant performer and i have learned so much from working with her going through her movements and singing her songs i have learned a lot about myself as a performer and about working in a professional environment the broadway actors have been so sweet they are older than me and so it has been interesting because as their choreographer i am kind of their boss i look up to them because they are all so impressive but they have treated me as a professional the whole process has been awe inspiring
1541895 106 7 lite fm presents broadway in bryant park 2008

1541898 genial bizarre blend of frank capra pirandello and neil simon hilarious
1541899 s concise fast paced adaptation does an exuberant job of story telling masons text is bright witty and doesnt talk down to its child audience
1541900 by working on peter pan these wonderful young actors will come to understand the process of interacting with professional designers and technicians theyll discover the actors responsibility within the process and have a chance to grow a show by performing for multiple audiences because this is a musical version of the story theyll learn how music helps tell the story and create the characters
1541901 they had some type of smoke or odor in the cabin
1541902 the captain elected to declare an emergency and get everybody out of the aircraft via the slides
1541903 and thus far found no evidence of an active fire
1541904 you hear from time to time about planes returning to airports because an indicator light went on but its pretty rare that they actually deploy chutes
1541905 thats essentially up to the pilot who makes the call based on the particular circumstance he or she faced
1541906 i believe that this has been the most expensive exercise in futility i have ever been to
1541907 it feels as though this is a process to divide and conquer

1541912 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
1541913 the french support was of a political military diplomatic and logistic nature
1541914 considering the gravity of the alleged facts the rwandan government asks competent authorities to undertake all necessary actions to bring the accused french political and military leaders to answer for their acts before justice
1541915 if you go to the report you will see for yourself how communication was done from the top leadership in paris to the embassy in kigali and how different people who had a role in the genocide were housed at the embassy residence
1541916 the role played by france in the aftermath to protect the genocidal forces and make it very difficult for them to be apprehended and brought to justice
1541917 this should be clear that this report will not go lie down put in store somewhere this report will be used it will help in bringing to justice making very serious attempts to bring to justice people who were involved in committing genocide in this country
1541918 this report now that its out it shows all of the individuals in the france government that were involved in the genocide
1541919 its just now starting to recede at one point it was up to four feet in the front yard
1541920 the van is going to be one of those insurance cases

1541924 lord it is good for us to be here let us make three tabernacles
1541925 for the spirit was not yet because jesus was not yet glorified
1541926 having put off from himself the principalities and the powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in the cross
1541927 get thee behind me satan thou art a stumbling block unto me
1541928 peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep
1541929 when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father thereof
1541930 may god be propitious to thee lord this shall not be unto thee
1541931 thou art the christ the son of the living god

1541945 it may be the first and last time i stop at this tree
1541946 so how does it feel to know that someones kid in the heart of america has blood on their hands fighting to defend your rights so you can maintain the lifestyle that insults this familys existence well where im from we have a special salute we wave high in the air towards all those pompous asses who spend their days pointing fingers fuck you be quiet you might piss somebody off like the heartbeat of this country when antagonized too long ill be damned if you count me inas part of your generous hypocrisy collected in a maze tabloid gossip we want less real theres no need for us to bury you selfish agenda once again right this way deter your own grave telling them its all for something real dont forsake the words you speak youve gone too far acclaim all the way from the east to the west weve got this high society looking down on this very foundation constantly reminding us that our actions are the cause of all their problems pointing the fingers in every direction blaming their own nation for who wins elections theyve never contributed a fucking thing to the country they love to criticize
1541947 along with turkey and mexico italy is one of the most closed in terms of human capital and has the lowest ratio of graduate programmes about half the eu 15 average
1541948 do we want to follow internationally accepted rules of appointments or the bureaucratic national selection procedure which prevents openness
1541949 gods been putting you on my heart im supposed to call you and share a need
1541950 you really have no idea what youre doing do you
1541951 its okay we dont want to fight well get wet
1541952 whatever the result the referendum is going to show that this is a divided country
1541953 difficulties in administering the penalty to ensure its arbitrary and capricious application require adherence to a rule reserving its use at this stage of evolving standards and in cases of crimes against individuals for crimes that take the life of the victim
1541954 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter is absurd
1541955 ultimately habbush could not offer proof that weapons that didnt exist didnt exist
1541956 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document from habbush as outlined in mr suskinds book
1541957 i have no knowledge to the origins of the letter
1541958 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack
1541959 the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1541960 there were four of them they were big what could i do
1541961 to allow a number of people to protest simply because it would be embarrassing to have these parks standing empty
1541962 such mutual clarification can pave the way for a speedy and transparent negotiating process with a bright prospect
1541963 the republic of iran is ready to provide a clear response to your proposal at the earliest possibility while simultaneously expecting to receive your clear response to our questions and ambiguities as well
1541964 the second phase of negotiations can commence as early as possible if there is such willingness
1541965 our offer is clear and their response is not clear
1541966 the iranian government needs to respond in a very clear way to the generous offer from the international community
1541967 its a stalling tactic reiterating that they have goodwill but not answering the exam question
1541968 to be fair to the iranians they do this kind of thing rather well
1541969 i dont see any reason to believe that the russians and the chinese are any more willing today to support really tougher sanctions against iran
1541970 sir would it be fair to say you dont know how many officers you have working here
1541971 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1541972 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
1541973 the era of u s funded major infrastructure projects is over
1541974 accurately highlights that iraqs revenues have grown substantially in recent years
1541975 still needs to improve the speed and effectiveness of its budget execution and the transparency of its budgeting and accounting practices
1541976 we estimate that the iraqi government could spend between 35 3 billion and 35 9 billion of its overall 49 9 billion budget
1541977 it is about capitulating to an abusive government for the sake of keeping the games going come hell or high water
1541978 the ioc tried to tell the world that holding the games in china was for the good that they would do their utmost to use the olympics to uphold respect for human rights
1541979 either they are a lot less powerful than they told us they were or they have been quite disingenuous or their standards are unacceptably low
1541980 if there is any prospect for redemption on the horizon the ioc should add a standing committee to take into account the human rights records of countries bidding to host the games and to monitor if an independent judiciary and a free press get upheld in the run up to the games
1541981 they relate to the core value of the olympic charter and promises that human rights will improve
1541982 but what we have seen is that things have tightened up for activists and lawyers because of not in spite of the games
1541983 if either security logistics or human rights are not acted upon to our satisfaction
1541984 im not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for
1541985 we are not running the internet in china the chinese authorities are running the internet
1541986 it may be the first and last time i stop at this tree
1541987 sometimes i worry that my own troops will shoot me in the back
1541988 many are undisciplined some are compromised working for the enemy
1541989 you have no way of knowing if theyve had secret connections with the taliban
1541990 i cant tell you what to do sir but as your adviser i can tell you what i would do i would send some men out there to find out whats going on and id do it sooner rather than later
1541991 for all we know it could be a set up the whole story it sounds to me like it could be made up to make the afghan national police and u s forces drive down there into an ambush
1541992 cases like this send a clear message to those who might be tempted to abuse our computer networks to steal information and harm law abiding people and businesses if you do we will track you down wherever you are in the world we will arrest you and we will send you to jail
1541993 millions of americans have had their identities compromised each year
1541994 the annual costs to american citizens and businesses are in the billions
1541995 this was a big deal that they finally proved its all linked
1541996 this is the largest most sophisticated identity theft ring ever prosecuted by the doj
1541997 even as we fight the epidemic globally we must focus at home and i intend to do so with my foundation
1541998 i have been extremely disappointed with the clinton foundation especially with it headquartered in harlem of all places that it has been silent on this issue
1541999 im very grateful and it is appropriate that president clinton is committed to taking this on

1542009 it is harrowing to hear a child saying that if it was madeleine it was a disgrace that it was not passed on
1542010 we need to know what happened with this this is exactly the sort of primary information that we need to know if it was followed up properly by the police
1542011 if that hasnt been done that is exactly the kind of information that the private investigators are going to follow up
1542012 we understand that the european court has today ordered that abu hamzas extradition should be stayed while it considers his appeal against extradition to the us
1542013 the decision is a matter for the european court the uk cannot extradite hamza while the court has ordered his extradition to be stayed
1542014 we need to know what happened with this this is exactly the sort of primary information that we need to know if it was followed up properly by the police if that hasnt been done that is exactly the kind of information that the private investigators are going to follow up
1542015 were not claiming that terrorists are able to do this to all passports today or that they will be able to do it tomorrow but it does raise concerns over security that need to be addressed in a more public and open way
1542016 we take security and privacy very seriously which is why the british biometric passport meets international standards as set out by the international civil aviation organisation and we remain confident that it is one of the most secure passports available

1542043 the substantive issue hasnt gone away and that was that the interim decision said the flow regime trustpower was after was acceptable our concern was that that is contrary to the provisions of the wairau awatere resource management plan
1542044 the only conditions suitable to us would have rendered the scheme unfeasible however we would have at least expected the commissioners to attempt to impose conditions that would have reduced the dangers for wairau valley residents
1542045 they have blithely taken trustpowers so called experts opinions and ignored the pleas of the citizens of marlborough its an absolute disgrace

1542060 reports that the examination done a few hours before saiful lodged a police report against anwar showed no evidence that saiful had been sodomised by anyone has raised serious quesions
1542061 the answers are important as they bring into focus the integrity of the malaysian law enforcement
1542062 also of concern is the abrupt disappearance of private investigator p balasubramaniam in the altantuya shaariibuu murder case after his first and second statutory declarations
1542063 the disappearance has yet to be satisfactorily explained by the authorities all these show a pattern of events that caused much disquiet to the right thinking public its disturbing that the questions are unanswered
1542064 the credibility of malaysias judicial system is at stake as the public must be left without doubt that the criminal justice system is not misused or abused

1542068 that autumn i learned from my own experience that a man can cross the threshold of death while occupying a body that is still not dead your blood still circulates and your stomach digests things but psychologically you have completed all your preparations for death and lived through death itself although you have never regarded yourself as a christian sometimes indeed the opposite now you suddenly notice that you have already forgiven everyone who has insulted you

1542076 im not sure id be pitching again unless its a one inning appearance so i was going out there and give it everything i had
1542077 i had a little left in the tank so i thought id empty it out
1542078 he deserved to finish weve watched his pitch count all year and the way he throws the ball there was no need to get somebody up in the bullpen in a 1 0 ballgame he went out and battled and challenged them with his fastball he could smell it after that eighth inning
1542079 i hit a guy and told myself ill get an out for each base he scores and ill get the third out before he scores
1542080 i just said ill get the next three guys out and if he advances a base who cares
1542081 i just wanted to start us off right last year we started off in the losers bracket now were a game up
1542082 i knew it was in the gap and my right fielder sean laird never called for it so i laid out and made a catch for my pitcher
1542083 i ran a long ways my feet got tangled up but once i got there and laid out i knew i had it
1542084 the keys were lairds running catch and j j s diving catch with a runner on
1542085 freshwater habs pose serious threats to human and ecological health this report assesses the state of knowledge about freshwater habs in the u s and sets research priorities to improve our ability to minimize or even prevent impacts of these events
1542086 the goal of the assessment should guide the choice of the assessment tools used and assessments that will have widespread effects should meet high standards of rigor and validity
1542087 for example using a standardized test with a sample of children in a program would be suitable if the goal was to determine whether the program is bringing children closer to national norms but if the purpose is to guide instruction within a specific classroom a nonstandardized assessment linked to the curriculum would be appropriate

1542093 this new station will enable us to house our equipment more efficiently where it is easier to access
1542094 this station gives us a central hub for training and meetings as well we work closely with the ses in most situations involving fire car accidents and emergencies so it is practical to co locate both services we also train together two or three times a year so this facility works well
1542095 this facility enables volunteers to be more service oriented it is a huge building and very user friendly and professional we have more electronic equipment including weather stations video conferencing and teleconferencing equipment we had our change over in november last year and without doubt it has been an absolute bonus to the ses
1542096 we are currently going through a power upgrade with an improvement to race day amenities with the use of relocatable toilets for the easter race day
1542097 the big screen television will also be back for this years easter races
1542098 the racing club is part of the fabric of the local community and clare would be a pretty quiet place at easter without the races
1542099 it is good for tourism and brings a lot of focus to the valley both as a boost to its reputation and for the local economy
1542100 the future rests squarely with the younger members of the community who need to be prepared to drive its success
1542101 what do we want a fair deal when do we want it now
1542102 we came today to support what is happening by the union
1542103 there has already been talk of forcing us into a super school cluster with saddleworth hamley bridge tarlee and manoora at riverton which we see as a back door tactic for a push for larger schools
1542104 about 70 percent of our families are on school card and if these funding cuts go ahead parents wont be able to afford to pay extra for excursions or camps our early intervention programs are under threat with funding affecting our special needs students
1542105 we already have teachers who have to negotiate their way in a class of 32 children in a room built for smaller numbers
1542106 and in particular children with special needs will fall between the cracks
1542107 the government is proposing a funding model that will take money away from schools and the aeu is never going to agree to a model which devalues our schools
1542108 the reality is that the government has no plans to close any small school by diminishing their funding levels
1542109 in it we had improved our reliability and our ability to develop new applications but there was still a disconnect between the capability of the systems and their impact on operational effectiveness
1542110 so our ceo made the decision to integrate it with operations and he made me accountable for the whole thing his thinking was that we could accelerate change and improve processes more quickly with a team that is focused on an integrated set of objectives
1542111 when we merged it and operations we looked across all of the sites and found the five or six best practices on turnaround time and defect reduction and built an applications road map across all of the regions we then held the gms accountable for the new standards
1542112 having an integrated approach and control over so many levers put our process improvement on steroids

1542140 we are adamant that workers should not be asked to pay for governments failure to invest in electricity
1542141 a time of worship fellowship and sharing but more importantly a time of expressing our unity in diversity there is recognition and appreciation of each others traditions and practices while at the same time affirming our unity in jesus christ and our common heritage in a unity movement which began over 200 years ago
1542142 for over 75 years we have been working to build fellowship understanding common purpose and effectiveness within the family of churches known as christian churches of christ and the disciples of christ
1542143 now is an appropriate time to be looking ahead as the world moved into the twenty first century our global family moves into its third century this is our bicentennial era of the stone and campbell movements and it is also clear that we are not there yet that also makes it map and compass time you probably know the saying that those who without goals are bound to achieve them unless we shape our third century seeking gods presence and leading under the lordship of christ our third century will most certainly shape us the pioneers in our movement were deeply concerned that the church of their time was not effective in proclaiming the good news of jesus christ they saw division of the church which had broken down even further in many cases into bitter sectarianism as one of the major obstacles to the churchs witness a divided church could not without hypocrisy preach the gospel of reconciliation how could unity they wondered the unity which christ prayer for that the world might believe be achieved the question led to their vision of a church united by restoring the ancient order of things returning to the new testament to discover what the church was to be like surely they felt that would be a sound basis for all christians to find their unity in christ unity was to be an end in itself but unity would guide the church to becoming the serving witnessing universal church of jesus christ in this transformed christian community which they at first hoped to achieve from within existing denominations there would be unity in essentials liberty in nonessentials and love in all things

1542148 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord
1542149 but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord
1542150 but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him
1542151 whoever will call on the name of the lord will be saved
1542152 there is a god shaped vacuum in the heart of every person and it can never be filled by any created thing it can only be filled by god made known through jesus christ

1542176 you can fit your studies into your schedule and you can study from home
1542177 i did not have time to attend night school and was not interested in the programs or schools available locally anyway moving was not an option and i was not able to take advantage of a fully funded graduate school program during my time on active duty the online program offered the degree i wanted from an institution i respected in a format i could manage easy decision
1542178 didnt want to just fill the masters check box in my personal readiness folder
1542179 the only way i could get a masters from a seminary program was to go online
1542180 we have students in california ireland and in my case iraq
1542181 some have civilian backgrounds some military some academic and we even have a b movie actor that has decided its time for a change of pace
1542182 during our online discussions we often drop movie quotes into our academic postings

1542196 the franchise has now been off the air for almost two years if were going to go forward with new movies we have to get new fans you cant just hope to get your base from years ago its not the first time weve tried to make a feature we need to have access to 100 of the audience not just our own audience under previous management we had toyed with a bigger movie continuum could have been even bigger
1542197 you put up a blue screen how hard can it be but really theres a lot of give and take because you have to halt production to do vfx shots while everyone else is waiting around its an extremely long process for everyone involved in the cg department we had over 240 shots on this alone but we do have fun i dont think people will be able to tell if some things that weve done arent real
1542198 weve done so many two parters youd think it would be easy but its a very different structure it doesnt have to owe anything to the episode before or after the fun part was setting out to write a movie and not just a long episode robert cooper helped me a lot on continuum i had december and january to write the movie i hadnt had that much time to write something in years but i had to finish the arctic scenes first i had to have that part of the film done long long before we actually shot that even before we shot ark of truth
1542199 this reminds me of an old joke i once heard
1542200 an elephant just ran under the car didnt you see that
1542201 please dont use that language neither of us appreciates it its unnecessary vulgar and not ladylike

1542208 those cows there on the side of the road theyre mine
1542209 yeah youre driving down the road right and if you see any cows you say my cows
1542210 well theres really no winning no counting of cows and it doesnt matter how many are in a given pasture
1542211 i know my cows way over there by that overpass
1542212 maybe you could add up all the cows in a given day and the person with the most cows wins
1542213 or you could count all the cows and win by the number of cows you can count
1542214 you do that if you want rules just dont make sense in my cows my cows on the hill there really arent enough graveyards in this town
1542215 those are sheep not cows you dont get them sorry
1542216 no you dont get those either theyre in the same pasture
1542217 theres a road between them they arent owned by the same farm
1542218 you a professional who works in a fourteenth floor office and hasnt set foot on a farm in 35 years knows that guy
1542219 oh wait hang on a second what color are my eyes
1542220 thats right if i were full of shit theyd be brown
1542221 would you just look at them theyre not cows theyre horses
1542222 not all that matters is who sees cows or a graveyard first kind of like i spy
1542223 those horsecows are in the same pasture as the horsecows you called a minute ago
1542224 there was a squirrel dead on the side of the road

1542242 one of my kids will do just enough to keep us off his back in terms of grades
1542243 hes bright enough but hell do just enough to get a b
1542244 he might as well get his b in honors english than regular english
1542245 the bright kid whos not highly motivated may actually do better in ib because theyre stimulated
1542246 we gave him the choice of telling us his grades he chose not to
1542247 we said fine but he had to understand that he was making adult decisions and there would be adult consequences
1542248 and we never asked although i can tell you it wasnt always easy
1542249 we always felt it was our job to be him into a responsible person who accepts the consequences of his decisions
1542250 larrys favorite line was we cant live his life for him
1542251 she told me she was just one room over from where she was suppose to be
1542252 so she would tell me about billy and how billy got into trouble when billy didnt do anything and id respond im sure the principal is out to get billy and im sure he was making up stories because he wanted billy to get suspended
1542253 she learned there was always more than one version to a story
1542254 even now when shes telling a story shell say but this is version
1542255 theres a lot of anxiety for incoming freshmen and their parents
1542256 she was coming from st margaret school where there were 14 eighth graders to a class b high school where she didnt know most of the kids
1542257 she skipped school the second day she came home and threw up and came down with a psychological illness
1542258 i think she walked around that high school for a year with her head down
1542259 its an awkward time in a lot of peoples lives
1542260 mental illness is responsible for 13 3 per cent of the total burden of disease in australia and so is clearly one of the most significant conditions for the nation
1542261 in india breastfeeding is not just a part of culture there are a lot of religious and social sentiments attached to it but adopting westernised culture has made many mothers to feed their babies with breast milk substitutes such awareness programmes are to tell them that there are no substitutes for breast milk
1542262 the couch or more generally long term psychoanalytic psychotherapy was for so long a hallmark of the practice of psychiatry it no longer is

1542266 we get to spend some quality time together that definitely is a benefit for me
1542267 you think this qualifies as quality time wow you are even more disturbed than i am
1542268 it was so let me ask you something what do you think of all this
1542269 this stakeout and our suspects do you think we are chasing a ghost or do we got the right guys
1542270 honestly no i dont i know quite a bit about the ala with my desk job at the bureau i didnt have much else to do but research groups like this they are mainly farmers and low income citizens not ignorant but not the type of people who are capable of pulling off anything like this
1542271 sellers is a bona fide lunatic have no doubts about that he is a cold blooded killer when that approach suits him he lacks the mental capacity of planning something as complex as this mail bombing civil disruptions that is the kind of thing he is capable of pulling off i think we are on a snipe hunt
1542272 i agree nothing fits if it is them why attack midland city there arent any major government buildings in this city if they wanted to destroy the government like their mission statement claims with this virus they could wipe out the entire government in two days if they attacked washington d c i dont think it is possible that this is the ala its too much of a jump from what they have done previously and like you said nobody in the ala is intelligent enough to manufacture a new virus
1542273 yeah lets not forget the only reason we even got this tip was because a nosy neighbor was able to hear every word they were saying in the apartment you would think a group that had been so careful in their planning and execution in the past wouldnt slip up this bad its not like them at all
1542274 add it all up and you get a nice fresh pile of bullshit to watch over
1542275 you really do have an elegant way of phrasing things you know that
1542276 now all we have to do is keep ourselves occupied for eight hours i have a few ideas on how we could do that
1542277 nice try damon but i think this time should be filled with some seriously deep intellectual conversation
1542278 yeah youre right that sounds like so much more fun
1542279 okay so what is this deep intellectual conversation that you want to have
1542280 i might be stretching it a little bit calling it an intellectual conversation tell me something you have never told anyone before
1542281 something i have never told anyone okay i got something its not much i have never seen the movie titanic i think i may be the only person left in the world who hasnt seen it
1542282 thats your revelation you have to have something better than that that is weak
1542283 its the only thing that came to mind i need more time my life isnt filled with a lot of things that have been kept secret your turn for revelations whats something about you that you havent told anyone else
1542284 i read comic books all the time when i was younger
1542285 and you were making fun of my revelation your revelation is just as weak as mine
1542286 its not that lame it isnt common for girls to read comic books i didnt know of any other girls that read comic books its not something that i could tell many people every guy would have seen me as a tomboy and not a normal girl
1542287 okay i will give you that its slightly better than mine still not great in the terms of revelations what kind of comics did you read archie barbie
1542288 no i read the real comics like you did i read superman barman spiderman and all the regulars
1542289 spiderman i just love the whole idea of the character peter parker hates being spiderman in so many ways but he cant give it up because of the guilt that he feels for letting the man who murdered his uncle get away he wishes he could give up the power his life is a mess because of spiderman he is always rushing out risking his life to save the city and he cant share it with anyone hes always late and he has to make up these lame excuses about where he has been its quite sad really because he is always letting down the people closest to him even though hes more of a hero than they will ever know who was your favorite
1542290 my favorite is batman without question he is different from most heroes because he has no superpowers his power lies in his will and determination to train himself in the martial arts he uses his wealth and intelligence to create weapons that will help him in his fight for justice he too is a disaster he became batman because he blamed himself for the murder of his parents it doesnt matter how many criminals he stops it will never be enough to erase the guilt he feels not only will he never overcome that guilt his existence as batman creates more villains than it stops
1542291 what does it say about us that we picked two of the most disturbed heroes in the comic universe
1542292 im sure there is some deep meaning behind it but i have always been a shallow thinker deep thinking is overrated
1542293 point taken so what shallow conversation shall we engage in next
1542294 none our boys on the move that was a quick work day
1542295 no you arent your eyes are acting like they are weighed down by thirty pound anchors get some sleep
1542296 you are so full of shit you are going to sleep even if i have to knock your sorry ass out to get you there
1542297 i didnt want you to see me like this its why i was so reluctant to go to sleep its not a very flattering image to see a grown man look like hes about ready to piss his pants
1542298 usually it last until i smoke some pot it seems to be the only thing that can calm me down unfortunately i didnt bring any with me so i dont know when it will end
1542299 lets see if we can find another cure for the shakes recline your seat
1542300 agent brawler this is agent barrow suspects are on the move what is our course of action
1542301 you know what about we already know everything make it easy on yourself and tell us the truth
1542302 you are here because you are actively involved in terrorist activities
1542303 what im not a terrorist you got the wrong guy
1542304 no we dont do you really expect us to buy any of this you cavort with known terrorists in jeremy hite and lance ramer i suppose that is just a coincidence huh
1542305 they are registered members of the american liberation army which is considered to be a terrorist organization by the united states government
1542306 they havent been involved with the ala for years they finally came to their senses and left those moronic redneck assholes
1542307 they are still listed as active members but ill give you that one i believe you maybe they arent active members any longer that isnt all the evidence we have linking you to recent terrorist attacks we have a witness who overheard you planning your attack
1542308 come on im a little smarter than that alan im not going to give up the name of my witness so you can have her killed give me a little more credit than that
1542309 that i can do she overheard you and your friends in your apartment building talking about how you had created the virus and it was ready to be tested
1542310 oh my god i can explain that its actually kind of funny
1542311 you need to give us more than that you think we are just going to take your word for this and call it a huge misunderstanding let you go walking out the door
1542312 yeah it means massively multiplayer online role playing game they connect thousands of gamers across the county on a single site they can play the game against each other we were playing an mmorpg i designed its called terror cell ours is a small game only a hundred people play it most online games have thousands of people playing there are twenty five groups of four people in terror cell each group represents a country like the united states or canada the object of the game is to make the other groups governments collapse using terrorist attacks like bombing and viral warfare
1542313 i almost hope hes lying if it is true while he might not be a terrorist he is one messed up individual
1542314 do you really need it doesnt the existence of the site alone prove i wasnt lying
1542315 the username is king and the password is badass all lowercase
1542316 okay now lets talk about this game a little more
1542317 there isnt much more to tell you attack countries using terrorist tactics in an attempt to destroy the government there is a scoring system you have to score one million destruction points in one attack to send the country into anarchy and cause the government to collapse attacks on big cities generate the highest point totals the most points are issued for damage done to government buildings or assassinations of government leaders they have the lowest success rates though the lowest scoring attacks are the ones that kill civilians but they are the easiest to complete you have to make a choice whether you want the high reward result and run the risk of getting caught or go for the series of smaller coordinated attacks to accomplish the goal our plan in the game was to unleash a new bioengineered virus into the water system of paris what your witness probably overheard was the planning meeting where we create our mission statement claiming responsibility for the attack
1542318 the game is real i could see they were planning a viral attack in the game just like he told you
1542319 okay im going to go see what everyone else has found out want to hang out with our new friend for a while
1542320 good then i will be back in a few minutes
1542321 i got the same story as the others the story checks out the site and game are real
1542322 did you ever think they set that up as a cover in case they got caught
1542323 you arent that dumb you know damn well they had nothing to do with any of this hardened terrorist arent the types to sob and piss their pants in fear
1542324 did you two have a good time while i was gone
1542325 alan has come to the realization that his game is disgusting and is going to disable the sit tonight isnt that right alan
1542326 ive got good news for you alan you and your friends are free to go
1542327 i can not reveal my secrets i may need to use them on you one day
1542328 it wasnt so much about finding my classes but things like having people to sit with at lunch
1542329 i volunteered to do this because i felt like it was something that would have been beneficial to me
1542330 someone in this room is probably your new best friend you probably just dont know it yet

1542332 dogs in good health with good energy respond quicker than a dog with multiple health issues
1542333 it takes a little experimenting to find out whats going to work for each dog not all dogs relax so nicely but its great when it happens
1542334 we spend a lot of time quietly watching the dog resting
1542335 protecting the carbon in natural forests is preventing an additional emission of carbon from what we get from burning fossil fuel
1542336 the majority of biomass carbon in natural forests resides in the woody biomass of large old trees commercial logging changes the age structure of forests so that the average age of trees is much younger
1542337 they should talk about the school and the new teacher in positive terms
1542338 because this is how we should all be thinking now
1542339 i used to have italian tiles in my kitchen and every time a drop of lemon juice or wine got on them it would stain
1542340 i would spend 3 000 every six months to have the italian tile people come out and scrub it with harsh chemicals and seal them with harsh chemicals there was too much anxiety about them i was a slave to these tiles
1542341 i designed clothes for 10 years for sears and know that something cant just be beautiful
1542342 its very zen very soothing and then my son plays his drums in there and thats not as soothing
1542343 i didnt feel as strongly about green living until the last 15 years and now we have no choice this has to be the way
1542344 a lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes
1542345 my goodness you are going to waste away i cant believe how skinny you got
1542346 the mortgage forgiveness debt relief act of 2007 will help people who have lost their homes through foreclosure or whose lenders have forgiven some of their mortgage debt so they can keep their homes
1542347 ordinarily when someone is relieved of a debt the amount forgiven is considered taxable income
1542348 people who didnt have the money to meet their mortgage payments have found that they owe income taxes on tens of thousands of dollars
1542349 it seems like the tax system is kicking them when theyre down
1542350 the new law excludes discharges of up to 2 million of indebtedness from taxation if the debt is secured by a principal residence and if it was incurred in the acquisition construction or substantial improvement of the principal residence
1542351 for those of you that arent up to speed on the downside of a short sale if the bank lends you 100 and you end up only having to pay back 75 then by keeping the 25 you have to declare that 25 as ordinary income
1542352 this new law is not going to give relief to flippers that have flops or investors that over financed or even homeowners that leveraged up their loans after acquiring the house
1542353 it will make no difference today it will make no difference tomorrow it will make no difference ten years from now
1542354 en fait je vous surveille ya des psychopathes qui suivent les gens par ici

1542370 this is a shocking blow for the workers at the mill and their families who are dependent on the mill for their livelihood
1542371 our hearts go out to those loyal employees at dartmoor who may potentially have lost their jobs through this decision
1542372 we are hopeful that they will very quickly be able to put their skills to use in the blue gum industry which is about to commence its first harvest
1542373 we would be very hopeful that existing employees at dartmoor are offered work at the sister mill in mt gambier or alternatively can find new employment in the blue gum industry
1542374 the green triangle has 150 000 ha of blue gum plantations ready for harvest and provides 20 per cent of australias plantation timber exports with the major proportion of this timber located within the glenelg shire
1542375 companies will need to be located in the glenelg shire to harvest and export chips from the blue gum plantations and this means work for our community members
1542376 a council delegation has recently returned from a study tour to albany in western australia and there is tremendous interest from businesses wanting to start up in glenelg shire as part of the blue gum timber industry
1542377 this will create around 1 600 new jobs over time including harvesters drivers and the range of support industries such as truck maintenance and repairs tyre fitters and safety supply companies
1542378 council will continue to work with the timber industry and the state government to capitalise on the opportunities for employment and economic development that the timber industry within our region provides
1542379 this package will soften the blow of the mill closure somewhat and hopefully be of assistance to workers their families and the communities affected
1542380 i am calling on the premier to make available all government resources with a view to turning around this decision it is a travesty that 128 jobs will be lost to country victoria
1542381 the dartmoor community relies on the saw mill for its economic activity and i am extremely disappointed with its imminent closure
1542382 western victoria has suffered enough with the ongoing affects of drought and we must ensure western victorian jobs and the timber industry are not moved interstate
1542383 it has also been suggested that about 3 million in wages alone will go out of the economy
1542384 with the increasing costs of water council rates power fuel and groceries which are imposing more stress on the family budget the government must provide support in these trying times to the employees their families the town of dartmoor and the communities of south west victoria
1542385 i learned that this was one of the last family owned tracks in the country and the steeples you could see off in the distance made it look like churchill downs i heard that the grandfather who owns this track dr joseph mattioli doesnt let his wife go to the horse racetrack so he brought the track to her
1542386 im just amazed how calm all of those guys are
1542387 they are just a couple of hours away from putting their lives on the line and yet it seems like any other day to them
1542388 one of the things ive always loved about nascar is that theres a sense of competition that was born with one family going against another family and another family and another family and theyre all from the same hometown and they ultimately got together and went down to daytona to race on the beach
1542389 that basic sense of competition hasnt changed over the last 75 years so i have followed nascar
1542390 the first racing event i ever saw that turned me on to racing was actually the indy 500 where danny sullivan spun out with a 360 degree spin and still beat andretti
1542391 that brought me into racing and then the nascar things i have done got me familiar with some of the drivers every teamster who worked on our show 24 was a big nascar fan and it became a talking tool for all of us no matter what youre role was on our show it was something you could talk about

1542560 the economy has been a sea of bad news for republicans and this is the first island of hope theyve found in a long time
1542561 i dont think the public view is we can solely drill our way out of this but clearly the republicans believe that they have a political advantage on this and they are determined to exploit it for all its worth

1542571 windows is not a huge cost when you get it on a new pc and the annual cost to get a supported version of linux with seven years of security fix support could end up costing you more than youre paying for windows windows has at least 10 years of security support and its free
1542572 and that does not even address access database apps or excel macros which may not run on linux or which may require significant migration costs of their own
1542573 for a greenfield environment with no windows apps linux is a viable choice as is apple mac

1542602 i think it is very fair to say that the internet would not be where it is in the united states without the strong support given it and related research areas by the vice president in his current role and in his earlier role as senator
1542603 t here are so many people who did at least one pivotal thing in either creating the network or encouraging the use of the network or bringing the network to the public and gore was one of those people

1542623 that was how i approached it and continued to approach it and that is still what i believe now
1542624 one of the things a coach strives for in his career is to have his team play a perfect game
1542625 error free it doesnt mean you dont lose a wicket

1542628 weve never compared ourselves to our opposition we would look at our opposition as preparation but our comparison was always with ourselves thats one of the key reasons the australian team is different
1542629 that was never really too much of a concern provided i didnt ostracise myself from the team i dont think that was the case

1542635 without saying i would deliberately leak documents i always did have in the back of my mind that they could get out my experience in wa was that it did more harm to the opposition than it did to us

1542639 second if youre not going to have all combat troops out of iraq are you going to continue combat missions in iraq over the longer term
1542640 the third question is will you keep permanent military bases in iraq the answer to that question for me is no i will not no combat troops no combat missions no permanent military bases
1542641 should i write out a challan of rs1200 or are you ok to pay rs 600 only if i note the offence as a red light jump as the fine is cheaper or as you are a lady i can be considerate towards you if you just pay me rs400

1542713 you can build vehicles that get better fuel economy and with reduced emissions but theres a cost connected to all that
1542714 this is probably one of the toughest market segments to break through with a hybrid
1542715 we dont understand whats driving gms decision to build them but its a very good litmus test for the broad based acceptance of hybrids if the pickup buyers really take to it
1542716 criteria to win are tough because the award is intended to drive continued safety improvements such as top crash test ratings and rapid addition of electronic stability control which is standard equipment on the cts recognizing vehicles at the head of the class for safety helps consumers distinguish the best overall choices without having to sort through multiple test results
1542717 all luxury cars should perform as well as the cts

1542723 its a fact as temperatures drop below 45 degree so does an all season tires ability to grip the road and that can lead to dangerous driving conditions since all season and winter tires are about as similar as sandals and snowshoes weve launched this program to encourage our customers to stay safer in winter by switching to continental winter tires
1542724 summer tires just arent built to hold the road in the same way that winter tires do
1542725 during winter drivers would experience a dramatic drop in grip meaning longer stopping distances less driving control and by far less safety

1542729 when our torrance based product planners and engineers heard about toyota motor corporations tmc plan to run a distance of 348 miles from osaka japan to tokyo on a single tank of hydrogen they thought it was a great idea that probably didnt go far enough in showing how far this new system had advanced
1542730 beyond the single tank range capability this new system was developed to deal with two major challenges to the refinement of fuel cell power trains that is starting and operating in cold temperatures and standing up to the vibration and harshness of rough road conditions over a long distance over a long time

1542736 if anyone went into any slaughterhouse be they handling chickens or ducks or cows it is not like going into the metropolitan museum of art
1542737 but the issue is not one of aesthetics as it is in a museum but one of health for the consuming public and we pass every test
1542738 weve had to litigate in the dark for two years without these documents
1542739 were confident they are going to show that the cost of this grant outweighs the benefits we are going to show that the grant was illegally made
1542740 the impetus for the lawsuit is frustration with purchasing a product he thought he was getting that was heavily promoted in a certain way by the developer and realizing thats not the project that will be delivered

1542745 given that the irregularities already revealed have shown that ceo jerry yang received less than 67 affirmative votes and chairman roy bostock received only about 60 investigation into this other irregularity is essential
1542746 shareholders who voted the icahn slate before the agreement was announced could easily have been misled into thinking that having already voted for the icahn slate their vote was recorded as withheld in terms of the existing yahoo board
1542747 there were a flurry of proxy cards sent out to shareholders in the 10 days prior to the vote making the potential for confusion and error extremely high
1542748 had all yahoo shareholders had their intentions correctly represented some members of the board would have received less than 50 affirmative vote

1542756 the new bridge is 52 metres long and is almost twice as wide as the old bridge
1542757 this upgraded bridge will improve traffic flow and alleviate the load limitations and speed restrictions that were imposed on the bridge since 2000 due to deterioration
1542758 also part of the design was the inclusion of a new pedestrian walkway and this will greatly improve safety for all users of the new bridge

1542761 in the afternoon of wednesday august 13 each of the 90 returning officers across the state will conduct the all important draw to determine the order in which candidates names appear on the ballot paper
1542762 all candidates must ensure that their nominators are enrolled for the council area or ward in which they are standing and nominators should check their own enrolment status
1542763 we suggest that candidates are proposed by more than two nominators in case some nominators are not correctly enrolled
1542764 the pelorus community is looking forward keenly to having the medical centre open again
1542765 if you think about how remote people are in that area youve got a baby sick having someone to go to makes a big difference the phone services are very good but it doesnt replace someone who can touch and see
1542766 i was stunned the past several years i had wondered about the accident and about the coincidence that it had occured 2 months before my first episode that lasted the rest of my college career i was amazed that it was so obvious to him
1542767 when i first looked at your brain scans i said to myself that you would probably not be functioning very well
1542768 the meds and supplements today are so very good and specific with very few side effects that i am certain you will do very well
1542769 i wish i could get a new set of problems

1542771 events that cause head injury are the same ones that cause post traumatic stress disorder and some people have components of both
1542772 the challenge is to find out about those who are further from the centre of the explosion
1542773 a blast wave hits and a soldier may be knocked unconscious for two seconds then he gets up and says i feel great even a cat scan may be negative but the question is will he develop a problem in the future
1542774 did my symptoms start sometime shortly after a car accident
1542775 utterly failed to explain how cardinals alleged conduct could reasonably be regarded as violating any of the laws
1542776 cabot and one or more unknown principals agents servants or employees of rubinsohn were engaged in a scheme to obtain reimbursement from harvey pennington for airline tickets that were never purchased but which cabot fraudulently misrepresented to harvey pennington were for business related trips and had been pre paid by rubinsohn
1542777 cabot knew that harvey pennington was not receiving any service or benefit in exchange for the approximately 133 000 paid to rubinsohn
1542778 cabot knowingly misappropriated or knowingly allowed the monies paid by harvey pennington to be misappropriated either for his own benefit or for the benefit of others
1542779 he submits the within resignation because he knows that he could not successfully defend himself against the allegations of professional misconduct
1542780 he came with a whole pedigree of good things so we didnt really think there was anything to worry about
1542781 suffering from a disabling condition which makes it impossible for him to prepare an adequate defense
1542782 the stay of prosecution issued on may 8 2007 is vacated and the disciplinary prosecution shall resume to be consolidated with new charges arising from respondents unauthorized practice of law and false statements in connection with his purported disability and transfer to inactive status
1542783 a classic example of lawyers putting convenience over client loyalty
1542784 to turn someone into a typhoid mary early in their careers is unfair
1542785 its designed to assure that people are up front about what theyre doing and under what authority
1542786 the law world is becoming flat its got major global players
1542787 law students expectations are that by the time they graduate they can sit for the bar examination and pass
1542788 one of the fallouts of the blog is that it renewed my interest in patent litigation
1542789 i started to realize it really was my primary interest in patent law and thats really what made me interested in looking around and wilson sonsini is one of the most prestigious law firms in the bay area
1542790 voluntarily left cisco to pursue an opportunity with a prestigious silicon valley law firm
1542791 he came from cisco and he understands the patent litigation business as its currently practiced with a lot of what are now euphemistically called non practicing entities
1542792 i think its a win win it gives everybody a fresh start
1542793 i think wilson sonsini will be rewarded for hiring rick hes very bright hes an excellent lawyer
1542794 this was a great career opportunity for me and it was too good to pass up
1542795 its now admitted that he was an agent of cisco when all this occurred
1542796 by placing their own interest in securing fees and expectation of future profits from a continued relationship with the ima entities ahead of their professional judgment and duties
1542797 had goins reviewed the falsified account statements with even the slightest care it would have been obvious to him that there were serious discrepancies
1542798 the duty in my view is to conduct reasonable diligence on the issue and i dont think that includes analyzing financial statements or brokerage statements
1542799 there is a duty not to knowingly transmit information that you know is false thats a clear boundary another clear boundary is you dont have to do the work of the investigating government entity whether thats the sec or someone else in between those two boundaries the law is less clear
1542800 i dont think a court has gone that far yet
1542801 one or more statements that were knowingly false and materially misleading
1542802 goins and other persons at smith gambrell amp russell knew that none of the ima entities had ever been audited and that ima had no intention of having the financial statements of the funds audited
1542803 did the issuer have the present good faith intention to audit the financial statements now if goins advised them not to do the audit thats inconsistent with the offering memoranda but thats a factual issue i cant speak to
1542804 the lawyers question is who am i supposed to alert
1542805 if there isnt a board and i tell the ceo
1542806 thats like telling the fox that the fox is in the henhouse and some chickens are missing
1542807 we do not intend to continue at this stage with any discussions that we have had with nixon
1542808 they were vigorously opposed to the idea that management of the firm might enter into any agreement that would in any way limit their independence and professional freedom to work where they chose
1542809 treated in accord with their best interests in any dispute over their disposition
1542810 this is one of the biggest questions that we get asked on election days
1542811 hes got a public record a well documented public record on positions that he took as a state lawmaker and as a result he feels an obligation to at least acknowledge those positions
1542812 not announce any positions on matters that might come before the court of appeals or lead voters to believe that i will decide any issues or cases in a predetermined manner
1542813 to fully and intelligently participate in the judicial election process
1542814 any of these candidates could eventually run for the supreme court and i hate to see them having to recuse
1542815 these days you never know exactly what issues might come before the court of appeals
1542816 theyre trying to flesh out the candidates positions on certain issues that perhaps are questions that might be more appropriate for a candidate for the executive or legislative branch
1542817 it is true that voters have difficulty getting useful information about judicial candidates
1542818 and it is true that all judges have predispositions that affect their decisions so the desire to hear judicial candidates expound upon their predispositions is understandable
1542819 judges duty to be fair and impartial requires them to be skeptical of their own predispositions not to point to those predispositions as qualifications for office
1542820 i understand why interest groups distribute their surveys to candidates
1542821 however i do not believe that it would be appropriate for me to respond to that questionnaire or similar questionnaires that ask for responses to hypothetical issues that may come before me as a judge
1542822 while the georgia court of appeals may not have jurisdiction over some of the issues raised
1542823 i t is still possible that i might be asked to decide one of those issues if i sat by designation on the georgia supreme court when the issue arose or was faced with the issue as a member of that court if i later ran and was elected to it
1542824 i will take a look at it if they want to send it to me
1542825 its a balancing act because were going to be hearing cases with issues and i want to make sure i dont prejudge anything so im going to have to look at each one and take it as it comes
1542826 rather his becoming a partner would have been contingent upon the occurrence of an additional event over which the partners did not exercise control namely the executive committees approval and recommendation of hoeffner to orricks full partnership
1542827 your understanding is correct thank you for making the right decision
1542828 i dont see how they could make me partner this year but i am still going to make them go through the process
1542829 to maintain a lifestyle commensurate with that enjoyed by herself and the children throughout the course of the marriage
1542830 business and real estate interests the latter of which are allegedly worth in excess of 100 million
1542831 is attributable to his active management of the properties or rather the result of passive market forces
1542832 that by virtue of the active efforts of mr gordon all of the subject commercial properties have increased in value
1542833 numerous and uncounted indirect contributions that she made over the years which aided in the appreciation
1542834 the record as developed indicates that the children of this marriage enjoyed a high standard of living residing in a home in muttontown as well as attending exclusive summer camps and being lavished with bar bat mitzvahs costing in excess of 70 000
1542835 additionally the record herein clearly evidences a great disparity in income between the plaintiff and the defendant
1542836 protracted absence from the work force the large income disparity as exists between the parties and the complicated nature of the within litigation
1542837 see to it that the matrimonial scales are not unbalanced by the weight of the wealthier litigants wallet
1542838 the decision is a perfect example of how much more efficacious it would be if these awards were made at the conclusion of the case when the court has the power to direct the sale of the property
1542839 ill be back in an hour are you boys sure you know what youre doing
1542840 it is time in the west to defend not so much human rights as human obligations destructive and irresponsible freedom has been granted boundless space society appears to have little defense against the abyss of human decadence such as for example misuse of liberty for moral violence against young people motion pictures full of pornography crime and horror it is considered to be part of freedom and theoretically counter balanced by the young peoples right not to look or not to accept life organized legalistically has thus shown its inability to defend itself against the corrosion of evil
1542841 it was granted me to carry away from my prison years on my bent back which nearly broke beneath its load this essential experience how a human being becomes evil and how good in the intoxication of youthful successes i had felt myself to be infallible and i was therefore cruel in the surfeit of power i was a murderer and an oppressor in my most evil moments i was convinced that i was doing good and i was well supplied with systematic arguments and it was only when i lay there on rotting prison straw that i sensed within myself the first stirrings of good gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states nor between classes nor between political parties either but right through every human heart and through all human hearts this line shifts inside us it oscillates with the years and even within hearts overwhelmed by evil one small bridgehead of good is retained and even in the best of all hearts there remains an uprooted small corner of evil since then i have come to understand the truth of all the religions of the world they struggle with the evil inside a human being inside every human being it is impossible to expel evil from the world in its entirety but it is possible to constrict it within each person and since that time i have come to understand the falsehood of all the revolutions in history they destroy only those carriers of evil contemporary with them and also fail out of haste to discriminate the carriers of good as well and they then take to themselves as their heritage the actual evil itself magnified still more
1542842 another alliance at first glance a strange one a surprising one but if you think about it in fact one which is well grounded and easy to understand this is the alliance between our communist leaders and your capitalists
1542843 the very famous armand hammer who is flourishing here today laid the basis for this when he made the first exploratory trip into russia still in lenins time in the very first years of the revolution he was extremely successful in this intelligence mission and since that time for all these fifty years we observe continuous and steady support by the businessmen of the west of the soviet communist leaders
1542844 its important for yahoos board to understand there is still pressure on them
1542845 i thought yahoos board was kind of let off the hook last week when they didnt really deserve to be
1542846 en esta semana volvi a sentirse no ptimo en la parte superior del pubis
1542847 cuando iniciamos la pretemporada el jugador ten a una pubitis mejor en un 90 por ciento y en esta semana volvi a sentirse no ptimo en la parte superior del pubis esto ya lo platicamos con los doctores alfonso d az y joaqu n ledesma por lo que se ha decidido hacerle una serie de estudios y vamos a tomar un periodo de 15 a 20 d as para ponerlo de nuevo en condiciones
1542848 hay que ser justos con el rival nos meti en aprietos pero ya vamos cogiendo el ritmo de competici n estuvimos acertados a bal n parado pero tambi n encajamos goles as los entrenadores siempre estamos insatisfechos
1542849 en chivas estoy viendo ahorita por un fin de semana parece que lleg un hurac n por m s que pida paciencia y por m s que creo que debe ser un punto importante ahorita no es un punto de partida para lo que este equipo necesita la paciencia est siempre y cuando los resultados lleguen siempre tienen que llegar a la orden
1542850 lo nico que me pone nervioso es no tener a mis jugadores que tengo en la selecci n y siempre lo vamos a apoyar y lo estamos apoyando lo que me corresponde es trabajar es lo nico que me inquieta
1542851 yo no puedo pedirles nada s lo har el trabajo necesario para ganarle al monterrey estamos acostumbrados a estas situaciones y como encargado del equipo tengo que tener m s calma que nunca
1542852 sigo siendo igual en aquel tiempo les dije que era muy realista que estaba muy bien aqu y ahora sigo estando muy bien aqu y ese tipo de cosas son las que no me cuadran pero las respeto
1542853 hay cierta preocupaci n pero hay que manejarla con calma
1542854 s preocupa la falta de resultados pero tenemos que estar tranquilos no debemos de desesperarnos tenemos que tener la cabeza fr a para enfrentar el partido del s bado para de ah hacer buenos partidos y conseguir buenos resultados
1542855 hay cierta preocupaci n pero hay que manejarla con calma sabemos que debemos ganar el s bado pero lo debemos de hacer con una gran tranquilidad y sobre todo buen futbol puede venir una gran presi n pero el equipo est tranquilo y consciente de que debemos de sacar una victoria el s bado como d lugar para evitar que se nos despeguen los equipos de nuestro grupo
1542856 y si te vas m s atr s con vicente pereda y con todos eso es historia eso ya qued y no se puede cambiar el reconocimiento se les da todos los d as pero eso ya pas ya no puedo hacer nada con eso entonces la gente tiene que ser consciente de que estamos buscando una forma de jugar y una forma de ser ofensivos para redituar en resultados y tambi n para que sea agradable con el p blico
1542857 la gente le ha exigido porque no resiste m s que los goles no lleguen hay que preguntarle al argentino christian gim nez como le fue cada tarde en la cancha del nemesio diez la afici n no perdona pero con todo y abucheos se le debe de dar m s oportunidad a mancilla quien por lo pronto ya se estren como goleador
1542858 no me preocupa en lo m s m nimo porque igual mancilla meti goles en pretemporada nadie dijo nada es m s porque as es la gente no me molesta al contrario vamos a hacer ver a la gente que esto es de grupo que no porque sea el centro delantero tiene que ser a fuerzas el goleador pero s es parte importante en el ataque como puede ser santiago fern ndez como pueden ser todos ya les coment a los jugadores que en nuestro ataque el principal delantero es la porter a y el principal defensa es el delantero entonces esto es de conjunto
1542859 mira en todos los equipos est la gente que aprieta fuerte como es normal entonces vamos a buscar que la gente apoye de todas todas porque es la necesidad que tiene el equipo y es lo que buscamos que esta plaza sea imbatible y en eso la gente tiene su parte
1542860 nos da mucho gusto por edgar due as nos gustar a que estuvieran mucho m s jugadores de toluca eso hablar a bien de toda la instituci n del grupo humano del grupo profesional y bueno estamos muy contentos

1542871 i firmly believe that long term coal will be a key component to global energy supply
1542872 i am confident we will earn a sufficient economic return on the investment
1542873 drax is now facing higher prices for co2 while receiving less free credits following the start of phase 2 of the eu ets however the outlook for drax has improved substantially over the last 6 12 months with higher oil prices more than offsetting the impact of higher coal prices and leading to higher forward margins for drax
1542874 yes in the past i have always believed a reduced number 11 is fine nine may be better should be seriously considered
1542875 whilst i dont have a problem with free enterprise i dont support the idea of a nightclub from a policing perspective
1542876 given the amount of noise that could from a nightclub there are a range of residents who live nearby
1542877 there are some key issues which have to be considered but that is not my task
1542878 i believe it would be beneficial for busseltons younger population to have a place to go specifically to have a night out
1542879 one of my daughters is getting married here later in the year and two grandchildren are on the way one shortly after i close so i am going to turn my attention to those events
1542880 i needed an income from the property as old buildings are very expensive to restore and decided to convert the cottage into a cafe as a source of income as i had owned and operated one in perth previously
1542881 while i was feeding people so to speak the income i received from the cafe fed the mortgages on the buildings which were restored in three stages
1542882 it has been a lot of hard work but extremely rewarding to be able to enjoy my two loves in life gardening and baking cakes
1542883 ive met some really wonderful people who from the comments in the visitors books have really enjoyed coming here and i am very appreciative of their support over the years
1542884 as to the future who knows but for the time being im going to be hanging out the gone fishing sign as it is something i enjoy doing but have rarely had the opportunity to do since i started the cafe
1542885 the gardens are about to have a revamp with a red theme throughout to suit the mood of our familys last wedding in november so that will also occupy my time
1542886 troy has picked up on some key points one could hardly blame him however for viewing things in a negative light given his own recent situation
1542887 the shire wants to partner with its kindred community groups in positioning the districts governance and key service provision for the future as such it is vitally important to strive to dovetail the creation of a well supported community resource centre with the shire headquarters
1542888 having a plan and being committed to it is the first step in making it happen
1542889 the community civic precinct is all about the community the shire is just one of the many businesses that will be operating from our future meeting place
1542890 we only need to look at the many other shires in wa that have gone down the path of listening to the community and fearful of building a community civic precinct not take the calculated risk of doing it once and doing it properly for the community
1542891 the city of mandurah is a prime example of where the council listened to the community and like the south west experienced exponential growth
1542892 the shire makes no apology in having the vision for our community groups and in seeking to position the districts biggest employer responsible for transacting and approving business worth hundreds of millions of dollars right in the middle of the primary towns cbd
1542893 furthermore this demonstration of investment confidence is expected to generate a high level of civic pride and a valuable community asset twenty years down the track the community will be proud and thankful for the community civic precinct project
1542894 a strongly positive culture is paramount in recruiting and retaining excellent staff attracting other business investment and engendering innovative thinking so as to produce tomorrows business and community leaders
1542895 what theyve done here is to try and piggyback or link it with the development of the community resource centre
1542896 when you actually read the business plan for the civic precinct you understand that the community resource centre is a completely separate project for which the funding has yet to be committed
1542897 and no one has tested the proposition that you can still provide the community resource centre which is needed in busselton without having the new shire office and library built next to it
1542898 i think it has been a clever bit of manoeuvring to try and offset the traditional opposition of ratepayers to have money spent on civic infrastructure
1542899 what does it say about the culture of the organisation and the insecurity of an organisation to have the facility right in the middle of the cbd in such an imposing way
1542900 to me it paints an interesting picture of where the council sees itself the centre around which the community revolves
1542901 i dont think its a positive or good message for a service organisation to be promoting effectively they are there to provide a service to the ratepayers in the community i think it is an interesting indicator of the current culture in the council
1542902 to continually promote that the 41 million plan will deliver to busselton this community resource centre is bordering on well its deceptive using that as leverage for community support
1542903 everybody understands that building a new administrative block for a local government is not a popular move
1542904 a good example of local governments not necessarily being smack bang in the middle of town is the administrative block at the city of stirling which is strategically located its designed to provide a good level of service to its ratepayers not dominate them
1542905 most people reasonably understand that building an administrative centre for any level of government is not popular
1542906 i think 41 million is a significant spend on what is effectively an upgraded library and a new administrative centre for the shire there wasnt enough effort applied to utilising the current footprint better
1542907 when you read the business plan and it says the objectives of the civic precinct project among other things are to develop a commanding civic facility to create an intellectual hub to signify the coming of age of the shire to a cosmopolitan mindset and for the council to physically articulate tangible leadership through an icon project it is an embarrassment that a local government would use terminology like that to attempt to justify a 41 million investment
1542908 nowhere does it say how the precinct will service ratepayers
1542909 why would you put that in a document what a nonsense statement how can you justify it this is all being very orwellian what it indicates is that this is not about service delivery its about stamping your authority on the community
1542910 this appears to have been written by someone who has watched one too many episodes of yes minister
1542911 its nonsensical and the other aspect is the unknown aspects of the financial deal how can it be that the value of the land at ambergate can change so dramatically in such a short period of time
1542912 what are the safeguards put in place to protect ratepayers from massive increases in debt and the subsequent massive increases in rates

1542922 saint clair was given a huge amount of support by its neighbours who cleaned up a bit of a mess very quickly and efficiently
1542923 this should have been in the public arena long before now the decision has to be in by september thats only four weeks away
1542924 this is a major constitutional issue and its never been discussed and now its coming up at full council they dont know what the public feel
1542925 its up to councillors to make the decision and theyve got three options my personal view is i dont see a need to change
1542926 im reluctant to poll the community on things like this i think the council should decide theres an extra cost and i dont know how much of the community is concerned i think as long as they can vote theyre happy
1542927 when he was elected on under 30 percent of the vote in 2001 i think thats why the council thought it should change the council decided stv was a more fair system
1542928 we crossed a number of scientific barriers in this case

1542935 after one president in the pocket of the oil companies we cant afford another
1542936 remember that when george bush took office he had an energy policy he turned to dick cheney and he told cheney go take care of this
1542937 obama told a crowd at a gym in youngstown ohio
1542938 john mccains taking a page out of the bush cheney playbook
1542939 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it senator obama voted for it
1542940 people care not only what you say but how you vote

1543020 those who have gone before me to defend freedom and democracy around the world
1543021 the military protects your freedom from those who would take it
1543022 i disagree more and more of my freedoms are disappearing through actions initiated by the government that claims to represent me
1543023 i stay very well informed on such matters and i agree many areas of the government have overstepped their constitutional authority and damaged or taken some of your freedoms however the military did not take those illegal actions other areas of the government did
1543024 agreed but earlier you claimed unequivocally that the military protects my freedom you have agreed with my assertion that my freedoms are quickly disappearing therefore i can conclude that the military despite their claims to the contrary is not protecting my freedom the military may not have the authority to counter other rogue elements of the government that threaten my freedom but that fact is irrelevant what is relevant is the fact that my freedom is not being protected and you claim the military is protecting my freedom im not so much upset that the military cant through legal restrictions defend my freedom as i am that they claim they do protect my freedom when the military claims to protect my freedom they do so without listing any qualifiers or exceptions therefore the military and its supporters are promoting a lie
1543025 the military protects and defends the us constitution in obedience to its members pledge to defend it
1543026 i disagree many areas of the government have damaged taken and continue to threaten my liberties guaranteed under the us constitution you have previously agreed to this claim but the military makes no effort to protect or rectify these abuses it cannot do so because it lacks the legal authority to interfere in the activities of other areas of the government yet the military claims it does protect the us constitution and therefore protects the individuals safeguarded by that document clearly as these examples prove the military does not and can not the military is telling a lie
1543027 in addition the military continues to execute acts of war against other states without the declaration of by doing so the military actively participates in an illegal unconstitutional action how can the military be defending the constitution at the same time it is actively violating it the military may be excused for not having the authority to question or refuse participation in such illegal actions it is in effect impotent but by not having this authority to refuse participation it is clearly unable to take steps that would stop such an action the military claims to defend the constitution without offering any qualifiers or exceptions therefore this unequivocal categorical claim is a lie
1543028 the military protects your freedom when it is legally allowed to do so
1543029 you think you can lie and get away with it
1543030 maybe you can at the cato institute but not here on hnn
1543031 does the cato institute endorse it the book he asked in disbelief bully boy have written to solicit such a reaction
1543032 the more violence was involved in the emancipation process the worse the outcomes were making a provocative case for peaceful antislavery strategies
1543033 were to inspire abolitionists in the united states and abroad and they helped change history
1543034 an estimated 50 000 slaves were also brought into the u s between 1807 and 1860
1543035 republicans promoted government spending schemes that resulted in skyrocketing taxes
1543036 tax rates in the region in 1870 were three or four times what they had been in 1860
1543037 although the war brought the end of chattel slavery the resulting death and destruction intensified the determination of former slaveholders and their allies to suppress blacks
1543038 the military strategy for abolishing slavery was no short cut
1543039 the idea that the federal government would protect blacks was an illusion because they were a minority and a minority isnt likely to control government in a democracy
1543040 some people have objected that the united states couldnt have bought the freedom of all the slaves because this would have cost too much but buying the freedom of slaves was not more expensive than war nothing is more costly than war the costs include people killed or disabled destroyed property high taxes inflation military expenditures shortages war related famines and epidemics the billions of dollars of union military expenditures during the civil war would have been better spent reducing the number of slaveholders and slaves accelerating progress toward total emancipation
1543041 s lavery was being eroded throughout the west by political trends and relentless agitation the process would have continued and perhaps accelerated without the civil war
1543042 there would have come a time much sooner than most people might expect when the combined effects of multiple antislavery strategies would have brought about the fairly peaceful collapse of confederate slavery if this seems doubtful just recall how a combination of pressures led the mighty soviet union to collapse and vanish from the map without a nuclear war

1543048 creo que cada vez hay una conciencia mayor en el sentido de que es preciso pasar a una fase de negociaciones sobre la reforma y salir de la mera discusi n
1543049 estamos muy preocupados porque vemos que hay noticias que no informan
1543050 la informaci n nos aparta de la realidad y en vez de generar certezas est creando desconciertos

1543054 se ha hecho justicia y los sectores de oposici n sab an perfectamente que eso era lo que aplicaba porque en ning n momento quienes han sido inhabilitados han manifestado o demostrado su inocencia
1543055 ella no puede hablar en nombre del mercosur en todo caso apoyamos a sa l ortega para que haga la denuncia formal ante el parlamento del mercosur y a esta se ora la llamen a bot n
1543056 aqu tenemos una democracia plena y un estado de derecho donde las instituciones funcionan completamente como es el caso del tsj que ha tomado una decisi n
1543057 esa es la decisi n que todos los venezolanos y venezolanas acatamos la que emana de nuestro rgano juridiccional en este caso el tsj es una decisi n aut noma soberana e independiente

1543063 eso qued atr s porque incluso estaba mal formulada la ley ahora se sancionan faltas leves graves y muy graves y por otra parte las sanciones se miden en t rminos de unidades tributarias ut
1543064 con esto se est persiguiendo disciplinar al universo que convive en el marco de la ley fundamentalmente a los empresarios porque los obligan a mantener informado al ivss en relaci n a cambios que se han hecho y a entregar los recursos retenidos de los ingresos de los trabajadores en el tiempo debido
1543065 es obvio que a medida que el ivss tenga mayores recursos se va a expandir el radio de acci n de los beneficios del seguro social a los venezolanos sobre todo a los sectores de la poblaci n m s vulnerables

1543070 the very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies to secret oaths and to secret proceedings
1543071 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but morally treasonable to the american public

1543076 men occasionally stumble over the truth but most of them pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing ever happened
1543077 the notion that the church the press and the universitiesshould serve the state is essentially a communist notion in a free society these institutions must be wholly free which is to say that their function is to serve as checks upon the state

1543082 the illusion of freedom in america will continue as long as its profitable to continue the illusion at the point where the illusion becomes too expensive to maintain they will just take down the scenery they will pull back the curtains they will move the tables and chairs out of the way and you will see the brick wall at the back of the theater

1543088 the attitude passengers have taken is unfortunate but also that of bus companies that never respected the agreement made in the region where it was agreed that an average fare and one that was within peoples reach was 35 soles
1543089 we dont know how to solve the problem because laws in peru dont allow us to punish an excessive increase in the cost of bus fares

1543107 the world will note that the first atomic bomb was dropped on hiroshima a military base that was because we wished in this first attack to avoid insofar as possible the killing of civilians

1543119 is far worse than gas and biological warfare because it affects the civilian population and murders them wholesale
1543120 seizing the contested terrain of early nuclear history stimson conant and their allies explain the decision to use the bomb
1543121 the potsdam proclamation offered the military die hards in the japanese government more ammunition to continue the war than it offered their opponents to end it
1543122 it does seem very likely though certainly not definite that a synergistic combination of guaranteeing the emperor awaiting soviet entry and continuing the siege strategy would have ended the war in time to avoid the november invasion
1543123 they are where we want them to be maybe even a little ahead of that
1543124 of course you have your ups and downs during fall camp but tonight was a real good look at what this football team could be once we get everything in and if the enthusiasm stays the way it is i was real pleased with the work tonight
1543125 obviously they are still learning and have a lot to think about from the time they break the huddle and run a play on offense or defense we have some good athletes in that group that will really come around once they get more comfortable settle down some and get the nervousness out of them
1543126 most students who are going into music i encourage them to go into a music education program so that they can have a degree that will work for them when they graduate
1543127 it takes an exceptional talent and someone that is exceptionally driven to want to purse that its a difficult road
1543128 both of them are not even close to tapping their potential
1543129 every time i came to rehearsal they were playing better and i know for both of them practicing three hours a day was not uncommon

1543141 went back to his capitol office and shut the door so we could talk about what i needed to do in the campaign
1543142 after the caucus scandals of recent years it is well known that it is unethical to campaign on the states dime and with the states resources
1543143 candidate hoppers actions show that he either doesnt understand the law or that he doesnt care either way the voters of the 18th district deserve better from their candidates
1543144 we need to know immediately what other taxpayer supported public resources were used to convince candidate hopper to run for the state senate
1543145 we do not need more of the dirty back room politics that clouded madison in the jensen years candidate hopper seems to be enthusiastically jumping into the old boys gop club
1543146 are there any areas in which you break with the core republican values
1543147 whether it is using big special interest money to finance his campaign taxpayer resources to plan it or tired republican talking points rejected by voters across the district candidate hopper has shown himself to be out of touch with the needs of the 18th district and quite possibly on the wrong side of campaign amp ethics laws
1543148 hopper needs to understand that this type of back room politics might be acceptable in his home state of illinois but voters here in wisconsin wont stand for it
1543149 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot

1543151 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1543152 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan

1543156 security was tight and was a bit over controlling which is par for the course at these events and as par for the course i tried to get near the candidate when i saw another reporter there alex leary security tried to throw me out but i found a mccain staffer i knew and the person vouched for me
1543157 race played absolutely no role in any actions taken by our employees or anybody else in this case
1543158 i definitely wish i was never singled out i came up there to do a story thats all i wanted to do is write a story
1543159 its the right thing for the mccain campaign to do
1543160 our issue remains with the his actions are still a problem the senators campaign has done the right thing and we appreciate that
1543161 what we have seen over the past few days has been a mix of improper disclosures of partial information mixed with inaccurate information and then drawn into unfounded conclusions none of that serves the victims their families or the public
1543162 always moves aggressively to get to the bottom of the facts but that does not include mistreatment of anybody and i dont know of any case where thats happened
1543163 that doesnt mean that from time to time people dont make mistakes
1543164 the fbi had asked everybody to sign these nondisclosure things
1543165 i think im the only person at usamriid who didnt get polygraphed
1543166 one person said hed sit at his desk and weep
1543167 the reason she got challenged on that was her own doing
1543168 if she had not been out publicly defending his behavior it wouldnt have happened in the first place
1543169 raise whatever he needs for his defense as any mother in this room would do
1543170 i understand texans want thats fine with me off florida they dont i think that we should allow these decisions to some degree to be made significant degree to be made by the people who are directly affected by them
1543171 aggressively pursue an agreement with the republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election
1543172 american businesses and investors need a stable and predictable tax policy to continue contributing to the growth of our economy these considerations lead me to the conclusion that we should not reverse course by letting higher tax rates take effect

1543176 i dont think im really grasping the depths of it
1543177 its a little strange its not just a stan herd story its more about this ensemble piece with all of these different people and im just one of the guys
1543178 were going to try and get it out the best way we can its coming together nicely
1543179 i feel like gary cooper in high noon i dont care if everyone else runs off the street and im the only one left standing
1543180 if the fiscal situation changes then my assessment will change
1543181 but that was my assessment last week thats my assessment this week and i will stand on that principle well find out who is right
1543182 what should be noted today is whether you violate the federal law today tomorrow or 20 years ago the fbi and its law enforcement partners will pursue the matter to its logical conclusions
1543183 i love hanging out with the guy but it cant help but make us a mentally tougher team knowing that we cant count on him for automatic points it falls on the rest of us to pull together and pick up the slack
1543184 i dont see how losing your best player makes you a better team
1543185 without tiger we become the clear underdogs now again im not sure how thats an advantage

1543188 im sure he thought he was ready to run for a championship the first year he came in
1543189 but in reality i think this is the first year he can go head to head with jimmie johnson or anyone else thats there and i think he can close the deal
1543190 i feel like im better as a racecar driver than ive ever been
1543191 i dont know if i wasnt ready to win a championship or something like that but i do understand things better than i ever have
1543192 the championship normally winds up being determined by how well you do when things go bad and carls going to be ready to do that this year
1543193 the difference between second and 20th doesnt matter at all towards our season right now
1543194 its pretty much just time to go for wins the bonus points are key any points are the championship can be won by one point
1543195 we really messed ourselves up with some things this season
1543196 we had a little bit of bad luck thats kept us from winning some races
1543197 but my confidence level is really high right now this is the best season ive had so far and the best ive felt
1543198 as long as we recognize the power within us we will continue to have choices and we will continue to lead
1543199 you have to know what youre talking about you cant grandstand
1543200 theyll have to use their imagination as to how they can get a vote
1543201 i knew id like it here but i didnt know id like it this much
1543202 a lot of these guys are going to be around for a while and ill be one of them i just couldnt be happier
1543203 i didnt realize what an intense competitor he is and what a big game pitcher he is
1543204 the better the opponent the tougher the game the more excited he is about pitching
1543205 when you reach home youre patted on the back and guys that cant reach your back are reaching across and hitting you in the head
1543206 if you throw the helmet off theyre not going to hit you in the head it eases cerebral damage
1543207 both the jury and judge sleet have recognized and upheld our fundamental right to set and make changes to the atp tour calendar changes that are necessary if we are to unlock the full potential of our sport
1543208 their decision also supports atps position that this process of change was undertaken in a transparent vigorous and good faith manner
1543209 the misty air is not a factor of pollution primarily but a feature of evaporation and humidity
1543210 that the torch is finally in beijing is a realization of a dream weve had for a hundred years
1543211 its our torch and its in beijing its a chance of a hundred years and its finally here
1543212 so they can say they welcome me back but come on the way theyve treated me tells you the truth they dont want me back so lets move on
1543213 after two weeks when i lost in the second and first rounds and against an opponent like isner who is not easy to play i was pretty solid
1543214 ive always been a player who prepares for tournaments by playing matches and this time of year ive always done really well thats why this year and next week are important they will give a proper read on how my form is going in there
1543215 its pretty amazing whats happened to me since ive been called up
1543216 ive tried to look back and see whats happened but it is all a blur i dont know how it has happened ill have time to think about it later the team is the most important thing right now
1543217 its weird because when i came up i saw the overall leaders had seven home runs and i wondered how am i ever going to get that many
1543218 offensively you are going to see a lot more we havent seen him get hot for an extended period of time hes the type of player that can carry a team for a while hes going to hit for average hes going to hit for power hes going to be a force for a long time
1543219 i didnt know what to do my parents had no idea of what to do either because they hadnt been to college
1543220 our league was horrendous just horrible pitchers werent throwing 93 mph but no jcs even looked at evan so we picked rio hondo because we wanted to go where we could play
1543221 it says a lot about a guy when he wants to come to a team that already has a shortstop
1543222 i was shocked that i got an f and i apologized it taught me that if i wanted to be a team leader i couldnt take things like that for granted that translates to the big leagues if you do things at half speed you arent going to be around long
1543223 it is a life lesson and im glad he remembers it
1543224 two months before the draft we were going to take a pitcher but from all we could gather evan had a combination of things we wanted
1543225 and that includes brooks robinson graig nettles and mike schmidt
1543226 looking down the road i dont want this to be a one year thing
1543227 we have the right players to contend in the east every year i was with montgomery when we won the southern league championship things got crazy speeded up i can only imagine what it is like in the big league playoffs

1543231 the churchs leader pastor tom castor said on sunday that there had been nothing in lis behaviour to cause concern
1543232 he seemed like a person who was happy to have a job was committed to doing it well and didnt stand out in any way in terms of having anger issues or having any other issues castor was quoted by the associated press as saying

1543262 if you go to the report you will see for yourself how communication was done from the top leadership in paris to the embassy in kigali and how different people who had a role in the genocide were housed at the embassy residence
1543263 this should be clear that this report will not go lie down put in store somewhere this report will be used it will help in bringing to justice making very serious attempts to bring to justice people who were involved in committing genocide in this country

1543277 desert storm they expected the hornets nest could quickly spread to the entire middle east so they included the embassies all over that area of the world in their planning their goal was to sucker saddam hussein into invading kuwait to collect what the iraqi people were legitimately due
1543278 saddam is not like the saudi princes who spend the bulk of their lives outside of their country and who fritter away the kingdoms oil profits on prostitutes and bottles of champagne in paris no saddam is building railways creating electrical networks highways and other important elements of a serious state infrastructure after eights years of war against the iranian regime of khomeini he desperately needs to demobilize his republican guard which incorporates so many of this technical elite in order to rebuild his war devastated country these people are his technicians his engineers if they are put to work in the way saddam wishes they will rapidly make iraq the most advanced power in the region and we cannot allow this to happen
1543279 now we can see a new world coming into view a world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order
1543280 are these medical need cases from the military bases bush has put in the caspian basin area or combat related injuries
1543281 they are both need for general medical treatment and combat related vehicle accidents non combat injuries major illness combat injuries etc
1543282 interesting i do not seem to recall reading in the news that the us is involved in combat operations in those nations are we talking about black ops
1543283 yes it is almost all black ops in those nations
1543284 how did you know that these troops had been injured in those nations and not say in afghanistan
1543285 because they were angry at what they had been sent to do and they wanted someone to talk to about it as their care providers safe in the hospital late at night they cried they talked they confessed to us what they had been sent to do we are all under orders to shut up not tell the truth but soldier to soldier we talked a lot i heard more than i was prepared to hear due to the horrid extent of the injuries i saw more than i was prepared to see
1543286 why would a tough special ops soldier be crying loss of a fellow soldier loss of a leg or limb or god forbid his genitals or face unrecognizable anymore
1543287 because of what they were sent to do once they figured out what the real mission was
1543288 no they were sent to be the terrorists and it is why they were sent that had them crying some of them were afraid that god would never forgive them and i think they might be right at times there were some attacks on the us soldiers by people who do not want us there and some pay back attacks after us forces had attacked them but for the most part what i was being told about was the us conducting intimidation and terrorism operations against civilians to get their oil and gas
1543289 many of the people in those areas do not like america do not trust america many are competing to get control of areas of land that have or are thought to have vast amounts of oil or natural gas some of it is oil and gas leases some of it pipeline right of way to get it to a port and ship it all over the world
1543290 i know the caspian basin mother lode the idiotic grand chessboard that is why i have been reporting on and researching the caspian basin and the real reasons we attacked afghanistan to steal a pipeline deal from an argentina company have these soldiers been sent in to strong arm threaten terrorize etc with these big oil thugs and things got too hot shooting started
1543291 some times yes but that is not what had many of them upset unless they did lose a fellow soldier or yes they lost a future because of their injuries
1543292 exactly and that is exactly why i contacted you japan china russia and others are over there to sign up the oil and gas leases but the us is the only one i know of that is going in there and terrorizing or killing people to get its way they are using us soldiers to try to force people to sign a contract or kill them and take it from them anyway the truth has to get out about what bush has done and used 9 11 as the excuse to do it these black ops started way before 9 11 they had to get oil and gas leases signed then they had to get the pipeline under control
1543293 many of our soldiers have already figured out that 9 11 was just to get the pipeline they need across afghanistan many of these soldiers know they were used to get the oil and gas leases nailed down so there would be something to put through that pipeline
1543294 the us army or marines cannot tell you the truth lest they want to face court martial and spend the rest of their life in leavenworth as for me i am no longer concerned about making grade to colonel or general i am resigning my commission and getting out of this web of lies and evil i can no longer serve this nation and what it really stands for and what is does and will not tell america im finished
1543295 were you able to determine from any of these special ops soldiers how long such covert operations had been going on prior to 9 11
1543296 yes according to some of them these operations had been going on for up to a year before 9 11 and possibly even longer they had to nail down those oil and gas leases pipeline right of ways because many other nations were after the same oil and gas deals
1543297 the thought just occurred to me how do they explain these injuries or kia of these soldiers who are waging black ops against civilians in nations we supposedly have no ongoing military operations afghanistan
1543298 afghanistan some times if after october 7 2001 or they list them as victims of terrorists without explaining that they were killed or injured conducting acts of terrorism against civilians and a fire fight broke out innocent humans except they were sitting on land with oil and gas under it there were some attacks on us troops as pay back
1543299 did any of these soldiers admit to you how they figured out that someone had ordered them on an illegal mission an illegal order to go process a death warrant on civilians who would not sign a contract

1543306 we need to know what happened with this this is exactly the sort of primary information that we need to know if it was followed up properly by the police
1543307 if that hasnt been done that is exactly the kind of information that the private investigators are going to follow up

1543310 the average pay differential between the public and private sector was between 17 percent and 21 percent
1543311 in addition public sector workers appear to benefit much more from a warm glow belief that in their job they can help others and that their job is useful to society
1543312 in competitive labour markets people would be willing to work for less to feel so good about themselves and their jobs
1543313 so the fact that public sector workers actually get paid 20 percent more is evidence of how out of line wage setting has been in the public sector
1543314 some job factors like stress may be worse in the public sector but others like the work not being physically demanding and not being viewed by the worker as boring are better than for private sector workers

1543324 thats the team that we think we have a shot to compete against the rest of the time is just a learning experience for us

1543339 into being in this universe some 43 000 years ago moved around and then was ordered to this planet earth by the higher forces for the purpose of serving my duty as a music messenger
1543340 well there are a lot of ancient egyptians in america
1543341 thats right people from all over africa are there you gotta have some kind of identity
1543342 knowing about ancient egypt makes me feel better as a person cause those were black people our race dont know very much about ourselves in america education and the mass media tell you black people got nothing to offer but weve done many beautiful things sun ra made me aware of this
1543343 i looked at the condition of black people in american and i judged the tree by the fruit
1543344 i left my family i left my friends i left for real i left everything to be me cause i knew i was not like them not like black or white not like americans im not like nobody else im alone on this planet
1543345 i know exactly how to colour music in such a way i need maybe two or three thousand pieces to interest me

1543351 we possess sound vibrations with much richer volumes but on your planet your ear frequencies can not receive these sound waves if these waves could reach you your brains would become liquid
1543352 the predestination of your planet has been designed till the year 2000 there are many difficulties and obstacles in front of you which you will have to overcome

1543354 go for it if you can with him working in your mouth
1543355 how much would it suck to have a nose this long like pinochio
1543356 humanly speaking it is impossible but with god everything is possible
1543357 jesus said that we are to render to god the things that are gods and to caesar those that are caesars our caesar is a government of the people by the people and for the people in order for us to render to caesar the things that are due him we should indeed participate in our government our lord would have it so

1543367 is it also the case that as a good writer you make it a point of honor to explain your thesis in one single perfect sentence
1543368 we need to remember that the 147 price was essentially stuck there for just a few days
1543369 its on the slide down where they sometimes can make up the difference
1543370 i would not lay the blame with individual gas stations
1543371 theyll say theyre just restoring last years margins but last years margins were excessive
1543372 mild illness that resolves on its own among children and adults who are otherwise healthy
1543373 were trying to be as cautious and as transparent as possible
1543374 the best medicine is communication and information thats why were so proactive in trying to let people know even though we believe the risk of transmission is low
1543375 its likely many hundreds of thousands of cases occur every year
1543376 citi field will serve as a fantastic new home for the mets for decades to come but fans will always remember shea stadium and its magical moments from the amazins world series triumph in 1969 to game 6 in 86 to hopefully a long sweet october in 2008
1543377 the seat sale and subsequent memorabilia sale will provide fans a chance to own a part of that shea stadium lore
1543378 with your lack of technical dance background you shouldnt be able to do this but here you are
1543379 no having dessert until you ate all of your dinner
1543380 no one is bad or good there is no good or bad but there was only me as i am working toward my vision of the fully evolved me
1543381 only choices actions or thoughts that will or wont get me closer toward being that evolved version of who i dream of being
1543382 always make bad choices but to simply recognize that the choice turned out not to help you evolve and now you know
1543383 go on and try a new choice and keep trying
1543384 there is no score there is no judgment or evaluation and that shame aint worth as much as you think
1543385 melbourne is the most exciting audience its not bullshit im not just saying that
1543386 i dont have any doubts that on the whole and i think this is a belief universally shared on the team that fallout is a better game but were also not oblivious to the fact that we have a lot of extra baggage that were carrying being the guys picking up this franchise that are re imagining this series from 10 years ago and theres something that comes along with that were very well aware of what were up against
1543387 i have no doubts in my mind that at its core and for everything that it provides that fallout 3 is a better game than oblivion was for sure
1543388 mobil saya sudah tidak muat lagi coba saya tanya kepada anak anak saya apakah mereka mau duduk berdesakan
1543389 biar kan saja harta masuk ayah nantikan dengannya kita bisa membeli mainan yang banyak biar nanti adik aku yang pangku
1543390 sesungguhnya harta dan jabatan tidak ada gunanya sekarang karena mereka tidak dapat menolong anda saat ini maka silakan anda sekeluarga melanjutkan perjalanan anda keneraka untuk selama lamanya
1543391 wahai hamba ku jika engkau datang dengan dosa sepenuh bumi aku akan mengampunimu sepenuh bumi ini pula

1543394 dovremo scorgere tra poco i monti dallows che separano lean e dall
1543395 una veggente scorbutica che va e viene per la contea da prima che io nascessi
1543396 salve a te veggente kathy mi stato detto che quando aspetti qualcuno che hai qualcosa da dirgli e che sia spiacevole stai forse aspettando il sottoscritto o uno dei suoi compagni e quanto da noi vorrai
1543397 salute a te mastro nano unico sopravissuto della sua compagnia ed alla traversata del maledetto egnos nessun premio mi dato di chiedere solo ci che voi stessi vorrete darmi in libera scelta
1543398 si ho da parlare anche con te ma non detto che ci che di piacevole vedo non possa condividerlo con te
1543399 le parole uscirono in un suono simile a foglie morte di chi probabilmente aveva raramente visione di cose piacevoli
1543400 coraggioso ed un po avventato augurati che ci che mi dato di vedere possa esserti di aiuto allora e non dintralcio tu temi quel tesoro e fai bene cercherai di uccidere i tuoi compagni per di esso tale il potere e la maledizione del guardiano di ci che la tua fatica ed il tuo premio
1543401 e lo farai usando un ascia che in quel luogo troverai scegliere tale arma sar lunico atto che sar dato di compiere alla tua coscienza
1543402 non desideri sentire ci che su di te mi stato dato di vedere
1543403 non provarci ragazza voglio proprio sbarazzarmi della visione che ti riguarda
1543404 eppure io ti posso dire che incontrerai qualcuno che da immemorabile tempo stai cercando
1543405 lo incontrerai in parte prima di allora lo capirai ma non lo perdonerai augurati che questo sia abbastanza da salvare colei che ti stata promessa
1543406 credi di potermi fare qualcosa di pi brutto delle visioni che mi vengono imposte
1543407 non credo temi che dica chi o cosa tu non sia allora rasserenati non sar io a farlo seppure non devi avere speranza di tenere per te quel segreto ancora per molto
1543408 e poi a te devo portare liete notizie tua sorella non ha compiuto il rito c ancora speranza per lei speranza di vita e redenzione le vostre braccia possono ugualmente essere guarite dal male che vi stato confinato
1543409 non puoi pretendere che non ti faccia domande dopo questo
1543410 non sono io a pretenderlo sono le visioni se io non vedo altro altro non posso dirti
1543411 brutto vedere le proprie certezze crollare ed il proprio mondo sparire ma il tuo dolore non finito ragazza
1543412 the montecassino passion and the origin of the latin passion play
1543413 i admire his tolerance he was blindly devoted to his ideals and was killed because of it but that beautiful quality of his of being able to pacify a slap in the face i love it and hate it
1543414 no i dont think christ was god i think jesus was an incredibly intelligent philosopher of his time he was a man who had the guts to stand up for what he believed in as far as being god on earth nobody knows that but he was definitely a rebel he was a religious politician
1543415 to me jesus was a great charismatic leader theologian and thinker but not god he was a man who got beyond himself and went too far
1543416 actor who plays christ in movie tells why he quit church at 13
1543417 honestly i never thought anybody would see this show i figured theyve seen the movie but people come up to me and say the film changed my life or when i looked into your face i thought i was looking into the face of god ministers ask me if ill speak to their congregations and ive gotta tell you it scares the hell out of me
1543418 no one had a clue who jesus was he was a rabbi with a radical view a man who could speak in parables and connect and that thing we call charisma well he had a big bag of that me i eat cheerios for breakfast
1543419 i was born and raised southern baptist and to an extent i guess i still am i havent been to church in years except for weddings and funerals or when i am invited to speak to a congregation isnt that wild i guess i believe in god in whatever form is in us in that sense i guess i am religious
1543420 superstar shines more brightly this time around lead actors say
1543421 we celebrate all forms of religion we believe that all religious philosophies embrace the same thing
1543422 do you consider jesus as a wise man as a prophet as the son of god or all of the above
1543423 all of the above yes i do i still have my beliefs my christian beliefs i believe in christ as the son of god and i believe that so deeply that that is so deeply set in my spirit that no one else can challenge that
1543424 being jesus christ has changed you its had a huge impact on you in what way
1543425 it has deepened my faith it has deepened my faith beyond recognition without even trying i have become in the minds of many a minister because i am so committed to that which i do during the performance
1543426 the show will take you where youre supposed to go if you just allow it to
1543427 everybody who sees this show comes into the theater with their own interpretation of jesus they project that up onto the stage and onto me because of that i do everything i can physically spiritually bodily mentally emotionally to project what i feel is the true biblical essence of the character they are in essence using me as a palette upon which theyre painting their opinion of who jesus might be
1543428 most of the people in the audience have seen the film or heard the music or seen the show on tour before they bring such positive energy into the building and they sit there and focus that energy onto the stage i walk out on that stage every night surrounded by the most positive energy ive ever felt in my life quite frankly i just float around on the stage every single night
1543429 to be able to touch humanity anywhere as a result of being able to sing each night what could be better than that
1543430 ive read so much in the press weve gotten about judass strength and jesuss frailty but i can kick judass ass anytime thats not the point betrayal is a metaphor for love jesus as i understand him is not weak the essence of christ is to say whats mine is yours but where i come from is primal an animal world you can be christ like and also be tough
1543431 the sorrow in my heart is so great that it almost crushes me
1543432 in great anguish he prayed even more fervently his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground
1543433 god thy will is hard but you hold every card i will drink your cup of poison nail me to your cross and break me bleed me beat me kill me take me now before i change my mind
1543434 its absolutely epiphanous for the character he realizes theres no turning back
1543435 ive obviously done this song many times since this moment in the film but when i sang it at andersons funeral on april 9 2004 that was the first moment that even anywhere nearly touched this experience i wish you could feel from within me what you norman jewison helped me achieve in these moments it was so on my mind the complete spiritual connection at this moment one man representing all of humanity in his conversation with god
1543436 did it ever occur to you ted when you were playing this remarkable spiritual leader jesus of nazareth and having to do this that it would affect your life the rest of your life
1543437 no and i must tell you that just the opportunity to step into those shoes was not something i pursued cause i initially went out to do the role of judas i was afraid of what youre talking about but once you made that casting decision and you had faith in my ability to maybe deliver something i was so committed to it and im telling you talk about an effect on my life my life completely changed as a result of that not only in my spiritual element but also having met leeyan neeleys wife as a result of it everything in my life was different from that moment on to be able to do this right there in israel with that intensity and have ourselves surrounded by that olive grove the authenticity of that created such a magnificent experience for us he and anderson and it lasted forever
1543438 the film works because of the strength of the music and the brilliance of the lyrics but its also in the performances but it also goes much deeper than that because what were dealing here with is a religious aspect of the film which keeps creeping in and grabbing a hold of your heart
1543439 se dice que m xico existe libertad y aqu les demostramos que es pura falsedad

1543467 a large part of the challenge was to figure out how to maintain his character and his animation through something as ridged as terracotta
1543468 he could have certain amount of flex so that his face could represent the animation well but would have to crack and be believable as a hard surface
1543469 we went down an entire development path of realizing this and at some late stage of the film director rob cohen wanted to make it a little scarier by having a creature that was kind of a burnt version of jet li trapped encased inside
1543470 those pieces went into an rbd sim that was constrained to the deforming face underneath so you would have this dynamic rbd system of pieces rubbing up against each other but still trying to maintain the deformation of the character underneath which was actually a really tricky challenge to figure out
1543471 i hope the siggraph experience will help me better propel myself into the industry and hopefully help me be fully employed
1543472 i had a scholarship to vfs last year but couldnt make it up to canada this year siggraph is a great step forward for me
1543473 siggraph is honored to host this special advance screening at the festival
1543474 the star wars films have always been stellar examples of visionary visual effects seeing these effects paired with computer animation and the behind the scenes knowledge from dave filoni will be an incredible experience for fans and film professionals alike
1543475 as the field of computer graphics matures we will continue to see graphics practitioners take on novel challenges that were not even considered just a few years ago
1543476 the modeling and animation techniques used in spore will inspire others to think more creatively about user created content in computer games
1543477 i started with the soundtrack by mixing and re pitching various abstract sounds that i recorded
1543478 the idea being to create music from noises then i procedurally animated numerous abstract 3d objects to the track these animations are then used as source imagery to my 3d noise shaders which have parameters that animate to the soundtrack as well the camera travels through the resulting animated evolving volume i went back and forth between the sound and visuals as i would stumble upon cool moments in each and wanted to tie them together so that every sound event had a visual event and vice versa
1543479 one of the really interesting sets of papers are on what i characterize as gradient based illustration techniques
1543480 they offer very powerful techniques for image creation and editing the applications are as compelling as painting i expect these ideas to move from academia to the artist within a couple years
1543481 who would have guessed that face manipulation would be a trend this year
1543482 we look for novelty technical advancements the highest quality results
1543483 and the wow factor some people do things youd never think of like the bizarre self animating image

1543486 someone could come in cold not knowing anything about stereo 3d and come out with an appreciation for the history and technical challenges
1543487 a fairly large group of us were having lunch during the jury meeting for the content of siggraph 08 and one person lamented that at the conference we go absorb information sit passively and listen and then leave were not creating anything we in this case refers to the research community so we talked about it
1543488 its totally freeform but i imagine people will exchange information at the meeting arrange to meet and in the meantime think about the problem
1543489 well give them problems that are grand in nature not something you could solve by writing a paper
1543490 this is a process that starts four years in advance and requires macro and micro management skills
1543491 also the roles that the chair has to fill are mind bogglingly vast
1543492 she has to be a visionary a strategist and a hands on implementer as well as a leader a manager a mentor and a friend all while holding down a day job thankfully the amazing conference team of volunteers and contractors makes meeting that impossibly tall order a possibility
1543493 we have an excellent collection of robotics demos and of course takeo kanade is a featured speaker presenting
1543494 its programmed as a true festival with not only screenings but also production sessions festival talks an entire 3d stereo cinematography track production studio evenings and a festival awards session
1543495 los angeles is really an incredibly popular city with attendees
1543496 that would be like saying the people who contribute and attend could grow to have too much passion and enthusiasm for their work
1543497 when i started my research position less than two years ago i was already deep into the conference planning cycle for 2008 and my managers have been extremely supportive
1543498 one of the exciting projects that they asked me to join within my first months was an academy of technology study on the future of research we interviewed researchers and lab directors both internal and external to ibm in industry and academia we asked them what they saw on the horizon for the next 10 years not just in terms of research topics but also in terms of the way people will be working in research environments our findings were very rich and we aim to publish our final report at the end of this year
1543499 we wanted to keep whats worked in the past but also push ourselves by making a more a festival environment for cg
1543500 it was really kinda supposed to be a quick peek
1543501 but as is the nature of a rabbitholes display once you turn the lights on well i warned him this place was going to go crazy
1543502 many of these cutting edge technologies exemplify how our past informs our future and how it affects the upcoming opportunities and challenges of computer graphics and interactive techniques
1543503 the technologies and installations in new tech demos encourage people to engage with the future as well as celebrate our past as we invigorate explore and define our potential
1543504 they woke up this morning and saw the chairs in the pool so that was pretty interesting

1543516 i am saddened not to be able to attend the games the olympic games represent something powerful that people can come together from around the world and do things that no one thought were possible however the denial of my visa is a part of a systemic effort by the chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of darfur

1543730 we remain on track with projects scheduled to come online over the next two years with expected contribution of 101 mw by years end and 73 mw in 2009
1543731 generating capacity for both the quarter and six months increased even as scheduled maintenance reduced production at several projects
1543732 the results confirm confidence in our growth goals we secured additional leases and raised approximately 246 million in capital by completing two stock placements and the second leg of our tax monetization transaction the funding received from these activities provides us with ample capital as we continue to advance our growth strategy
1543733 following our second quarter earnings results we expect our 2008 electricity segment revenues to be approximately 250 million we also expect additional revenues of approximately 9 million from our share of electricity revenues generated by mammoth that is accounted for under the equity method with regard to our products segment we maintain our guidance for 2008 revenues and expect them to be between 70 million and 80 million
1543734 the first half of 2008 yielded both top and bottom line growth that we expect will continue in the years to come ormat is well positioned to contribute to the mitigation of harmful effects of greenhouse gasses we are pleased at the way in which both of our business segments are prepared for future growth and look forward to the coming quarters

1543745 historically high crude oil prices have continued to pose significant challenges for calumet during the quarter we have implemented multiple rounds of specialty product price increases to customers during this volatile period we expect the recent reduction or termination of production of certain specialty products by other major suppliers will have a favorable impact on calumet placing additional specialty products volumes in the market from our shreveport refinery expansion project
1543746 the completion of the shreveport refinery expansion project in may 2008 the continued integration of penreco our increased hedging of specialty products input prices and working capital reductions all which were our previously announced second quarter initiatives had a positive impact on our results that being said this remains a very difficult operating environment for all refiners including calumet while we outline in this release and will discuss on our earnings conference call the continued actions we are taking to mitigate the adverse impact of this environment on our operating results we can provide no assurances as to the timing or magnitude of continued improvement in our operating results and to the extent we experience continued rapid escalation of crude oil prices our operating results could be adversely affected

1543759 it was a trial for them and a trial for us
1543760 we had to tell people this is really what a fresh local tomato looks like

1543776 it was people grandstanding 15 minutes to tell the board of ed its ok for you to study whether or not its ok for you to have astroturf or not thats it thats what it should have taken
1543777 why should i have to e mail the president to get my bags back what happens to everyone else
1543778 it makes the company know that people are paying attention
1543779 a company can put up with one angry customer but when an executive starts getting hundreds of e mails thats different
1543780 thinking that she had explosives and would attack them as a suicide bomber shot her and took her
1543781 her rape and torture is a crime beyond anything she was accused of
1543782 these concoctions just show how the americans will stop at nothing to subvert justice
1543783 they say that she is an al qaeda supporter and that shes very dangerous yet shes left alone in a room with a weapon this is pure fantasy
1543784 this woman stayed there until she lost her mind until she became insane hitting the door and screaming day and night
1543785 are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1543786 although downside risks to growth remain they appear to have diminished somewhat
1543787 the bias before was a hike in interest rates this year given this statement there is now more a bias to do nothing this year rather than a hike
1543788 youve got to go back to 1982 in the midst of the stagflation that followed the second opec oil shock to see the last time american inflation was clocked at that kind of pace for any sustained period
1543789 one of the things that abitibis working on is refinancing
1543790 we have experience with that weve gone through it ourselves and weve helped others through it as well so where we can assist we will but were not looking to be activists
1543791 getting calls from everywhere from people who make widgets for conveyer belts in the u s midwest to canadian companies that are name brands
1543792 the banks arent lending and generally the private equity folks arent there theres not many players in the space right now to go and help these folks
1543793 if we think we can get 1 for 50 cents if theres intrinsic value then were going to go for it its never going to be going in to try and change the way things are being done in the company
1543794 hes not looking around in awe like a rookie im pretty sure he probably did when he got to the hotel down in texas this past weekend because it was a pretty nice hotel a lot better than the ones they stay in at triple a
1543795 but this is the place to play no matter what when you come from the minor leagues and you see the facilities here look at our refurbished clubhouse thats enough right there to tell you hey this is where i want to play i hope he stays here a long time
1543796 there is nothing to indicate its anything other than a random and unprovoked attack
1543797 the whole time i seen him he never took off his sunglasses
1543798 he said there was something about this guy that made the hair on the back of his neck stand up
1543799 darrens a treaty indian when darren gets nervous about somebody i listen
1543800 i just thought he was a guy having a hard time
1543801 he seemed lost as i was talking to him about the laptop he muttered something about america he had a thick accent so it was hard to understand
1543802 he seemed really happy to get some money in his hand
1543803 we respect the pm and appreciate his sincere initiative as well as his gesture to build new bridges with the indo canadian community
1543804 we do not want to cause any embarrassment to our good leader the right honorable stephen harper i hope you take our recommendation very seriously
1543805 and we will work with you to highlight this fact in the community
1543806 im not into politics i dont understand why they did this in our e mails though we were very clear
1543807 for their own reasons have chosen to make controversy out of this which is unfortunate
1543808 we felt it would be most appropriate for this expression to be made in a venue where the broader community could participate which is what the prime minster did
1543809 this was a single incident that affected about 350 non canadians of some 90 years ago were mindful that each of these are different and unique historical experiences
1543810 on a mission to empower adults including those fortunate enough to be female
1543811 iphones for sale in beijing 1st gen 8 gig iphone usd 735 2nd gen 8 gig 3g iphone usd 1 176 the older iphones rose almost 42 since 3g
1543812 enmu roswell which is our branch campus down there of about 4 000 students has a very strong two year program in aviation
1543813 what we are offering is the next two years after they get their associate degree that would allow them to get their bachelors degree
1543814 thats what im really looking forward to in an online environment is having that additional face to face synchronous contact with the students because that does make a huge difference
1543815 one of our barriers though that we have to try to knock down the wall on is that fact that were going to have students in significantly different time zones
1543816 were pleased to have this be one of our three statewide televised debates
1543817 when we agreed to three televised debates our impression was that we would have three televised debates in new mexico
1543818 nuisance by its very nature is very hard to define you cant say all abandoned buildings or the blue flag or the straw house we have to define what it is we dont like about them weve probably killed a couple hundred trees working on this ordinance its a very difficult thing to put in black and white
1543819 i just hope you understand the very nature of a nuisance ordinance is not something myself or the commissioners can put in black and white
1543820 in my opinion laws are written to keep honest people honest
1543821 we do have to do something but after seven months of advertising and work we have to pass an ordinance and we have to trust that the honest people will abide by the ordinance
1543822 go beyond health and safety countywide and its a zoning ordinance the law has to be applied equally to all citizens
1543823 we knew all along that the right to farm act would exempt us but in reading this i have to say just a farm exemption is all well and good but theres a lot of definitions that arent defined whos going to define the comfortable enjoyment of life for each and everyone of us tires on a road that deposit litter or foreign material of any kind what does that mean property owners allowing trash to go into a bar ditch no person shall allow any nuisance i have no clue what that means at 500 a day your fine would bankrupt virtually anybody it appears to me that theres not a person in this county that couldnt be filed on and accused of causing a nuisance i ask that you table this this is awful its not enforceable
1543824 we recently built a home in the city because without an ordinance like this we didnt have guts enough to take what could happen with the lot next door i applaud you for this effort i sure do think that we need an ordinance of some sort to protect people like me
1543825 good law is definitive it is not subjective good law does not have force because of somebodys feelings and this thing is full of this section 2 2 c addresses trees and shrubs approaching intersections on county roads the weeds have grown up and are blocking traffic you guys the county are really liable under this ordinance
1543826 i have marked this thing up considerably please dont impose something that cant be enforced it just creates conflict if you ask people to do things a lot of action can take place this is strongly anti business the federal government tells me how tall to keep the weeds already some federal programs tell me not to cut weeds because theres a bird that likes it its a conflict
1543827 we strongly feel there needs to be some type of ordinance on the way to cannon theres a blue tarp in a tree thats been there for a while people call it the blue flag they say turn at the blue flag and youll find cannon personally to me thats a little embarrassing weve come this far and i dont want us to see it turn back theres a lot of growth coming i urge that we move forward on this in some way maybe tweak it a bit but we need to do something to correct the problem
1543828 children learn more from what they see than what they hear they see abandoned buildings and graffiti and they say why should i care if they dont care we already have a well intentioned ordinance though i do understand it needs to be adjusted or tweaked
1543829 weve got a problem ill agree with that but at 500 a lick what is offensive if i married an ugly woman are you going to fine me mr doerr how are you going to please patsy delk and me too she lives in a house thats like a doll house its meticulous i live on a section of ground thats not meticulous i have piles of junk beside my barn that i need
1543830 the value of our properties are going to be compromised if we dont clean up our property
1543831 i can hear music from cars when they drive by my house thats a nuisance to me but to the kids its where its at and thats the problem
1543832 if youre gonna pass this ordinance you have to be real careful im a criminal already
1543833 you have a segment of the community on my side of town and they dont participate in the political process and theres a reason for that have four town meetings one in each area of town they need to be part of the political process because its all tied together
1543834 a great writer is so to speak a secret government in his country
1543835 these errors did not affect the outcome of the election of directors
1543836 you ever had one of those really bad days that seems like everything is going wrong and is doomed like things have snow balled so much throughout the day that everything pisses you off no matter how inconsequential they might be when even something as benign as a papercut would set you off on a tyrad that would not end until every yuppy in the world was chemically sterilized to prevent them from ever having children again well its like that every day in nearly every moment
1543837 there is a 25 chance ill pass this on to my children should i even have kids
1543838 at what point in a dating relationship should i tell a woman about this
1543839 would a woman even want a man who was bipolar
1543840 hey remember that scene in silence of the lambs where they have hanibal strapped to a board with a mask over his face so he cant eat people
1543841 encouraged cindy to compete i told her with a little luck she could be the only person ever to serve as first lady and miss buffalo chip
1543842 go on honey suck that banana if it goes viral we can count on up to three whole polling points
1543843 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
1543844 i take it mike didnt tell you about the party

1543895 ahora le toca a la federaci n rusa determinar qu es lo que ha sucedido
1543896 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1543897 solving our national energy crisis requires an all of the above approach
1543898 thatll require aggressive development of alternative energies like wind solar tide and biofuels it also requires expanding traditional sources of energy such as offshore drilling
1543899 yo quiero jugar no me voy a internar si no es en river entonces me voy a jugar a otro lado
1543900 que un equipo como el bar a venga a trabajar a un lugar abierto p blico exige un amplio operativo de seguridad

1543920 is now scrambling to make up for his lack of judgment and experience for dealing with this energy crisis
1543921 i dont think he obama has a compass when it comes to these issues
1543922 so the production offset from inflating tires is more likely to approach 800 thousand barrels per day a tidy sum and a worthwhile target for savings but not equal to ocs output
1543923 finally without knowing what production volumes could be expected from lifting the ban on ocs drilling moratoria its impossible to assert that taking these fuel savings actions would exceed future offshore oil volumes and in fact one might argue that the combination of achieving these savings and developing new supply would doubly enhance us energy security

1543925 in stumping tuesday in this key battleground state obama sought to link the troubled economy with republican policies and offer his own energy plan in contrast he has tried to cast mccain as more concerned about oil company profits and drilling than an overall energy strategy

1544035 no to offshore drilling yes to a vacation for congress
1544036 while a very small band of your colleagues remain on the house floor to discuss gas prices their constituents deserve to know why their representatives in congress have failed to support serious responsible proposals
1544037 these proposals would increase supply reduce prices protect consumers and transition america to a clean renewable energy independent future americans deserve real solutions not rhetoric

1544042 there is a whole confluence of government policies tax spending regulatory and administrative that have subsidized sprawl
1544043 when people bought homes they punched the numbers and said can we afford the mortgage payment and taxes
1544044 this new paradigm is going to have families being more deliberate about the cost of transportation spending and energy costs thats a new phenomenon in the united states that will be the change that will change development patterns
1544045 we have to move to a new transit oriented development paradigm and concentrate development and avoid the sprawl that weve allowed in the past and undo some of the environmental damage
1544046 what were pluses of that lifestyle are now liabilities a big suv a big home to heat the energy needed to mow the lawn
1544047 and were only at the shallow end of the pool
1544048 longer term rising fuel prices produces a positive effect people living closer in and in smaller homes and close to transit
1544049 if government does something against the market it is going to fail
1544050 it is fatuous to believe that because fuel costs 4 a gallon today that we will all decide to live in apartment houses
1544051 the economic reality is that people get forced to the edge of metropolitan areas

1544067 what a mockery that after five years in detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
1544068 aafia was tortured for five years until one day us authorities announce that they have found her in afghanistan

1544071 the majority of the korean people have been eagerly waiting for your visit
1544072 and of course behind these people there were those who were sort of opposed
1544073 i admire your forthrightness your integrity and your deep love for the people of korea
1544074 i dont have anti u s sentiment im just anti bush and anti lee myung bak
1544075 the united states made sacrifices for south korea during the korean war and helped us live well
1544076 the united states is not our enemy without the u s we will die

1544078 when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the lord the priests in their vestments and with trumpets and the levites the sons of asaph with cymbals took their places to praise the lord as prescribed by david king of israel
1544079 listen to my prayer for mercy as i cry out to you for help as i lift my hands toward your holy sanctuary
1544080 a persons steps are directed by the lord how then can anyone understand his own way
1544081 whaddya mean i cant understand my own way that aint right i am in charge around here
1544082 trust in the lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding in all your ways acknowledge him and he will make your paths straight
1544083 this does not mean every believer has equal spiritual wisdom and it does not mean we will understand all spiritual mysteries it does mean every believer can understand the basics of the christian message which is unattainable and undesirable by human wisdom
1544084 paul is not saying that every christian is above every criticism after all much of this letter is criticism the point is clear no natural man is equipped to judge a spiritual man

1544086 my yoke is easy my burden is light matthew 11 30
1544087 im curious about this if you dont mind sharing in the comments section below do you periodically lift your hands in prayer do you kneel when you pray close your eyes bow your head what do you do to really signify your worship and praise of god do you think lifting our hands or doing other body movements can change the way we pray to god rather than doing nothing unique with our body
1544088 even so no one knows the things of god except the spirit of god now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit who is from god that we might know the things that have been freely given to us by god
1544089 these things we also speak not in words which mans wisdom teaches but which the holy spirit teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man does not receive the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness to him nor can he know them because they are spiritually discerned
1544090 we are prepared to deal with any kind of security threat and we are confident we will have a safe and peaceful olympic games
1544091 this is not a democratic issue or a republican issue it is an issue that affects all of us i am committed to working with all of my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to resolve the energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to act now
1544092 we have to drill here and drill now not wait and see whether theres areas to explore not wait and see whether theres a package that needs to be put together but drill here and drill now
1544093 it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1544094 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since theres so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil

1544098 well i didnt want to read this blog today but dangit this sounds interesting
1544099 when we come together on sunday morning week after week year after year and do the same religious stuff by rote that makes us feel good you know the singing listening to a gifted speaker tell us something in an entertaining manner that we already agree with or that affirms our worth as a person getting dressed up and going through the culturally acceptable actions for a sunday like going out to eat afterwards or visiting with our friends and having a generally good family friendly time emphasis added see note but if there is no fruit or life produced by our worship or our gift of service to the sovereign lord that created us then what we do on sunday and for the most part the rest of the week is akin to masturbation think about it we go through the motions and it feels good but it produces no life were just shootin spiritual blanks
1544100 they get the job done its definitely a struggle to get correct positioning but if theyre motivated they do what they need to do
1544101 paul has done a track about how he feels about heather and what was going on with the paparazzi because no one has heard his side of it at all so this will be the first time anyone hears a song relating to that subject
1544102 what the song shows is that rather than feeling embittered towards heather paul just feels sorry for her
1544103 he feels sorry that she was never able to tell him the full truth about her past life he feels that their romance happened so fast and so publicly that a lot never really got said
1544104 paul knows heather is a complex person and deeply misunderstood but that she has hardly helped herself by being less than transparent about her life

1544114 it was good to see the team in pads because you can start to see movement as far as positions and evaluation the emotion was good today and the players were excited to be in full contact jamie harper continues to impress he is 230 pounds and is capable of moving the pile daniel andrews looked good in many of the drills at safety as did walk on britton whetsell who might have had the best hit during middle drill
1544115 i would like to see the defense dominate championship teams have dominate defense
1544116 we had a competition where the offense goes against the defense and the object for the offense is to gain 3 5 yards if they dont the defense gets a win they go in five play sets and the loser has to do up downs
1544117 the defense won the first set by holding the offense under 3 5 yards in four of the first five plays but then the offense won the second set so we obviously have a lot of work to do on both sides of the ball
1544118 de onderlinge samenwerking bij dit toernooi is prima het toernooi is uitgegroeid tot een groots evenement dat een hele week duurt en waaraan jeugdteams van de kabouters tot de a junioren deelnemen
1544119 te weinig spelers en dat werkt door in de toekomst
1544120 de praktijk is gewoon dat beide clubs het komende seizoen geen a juniorenteam op de been zouden kunnen brengen en dat is natuurlijk funest
1544121 de voorbereidingen verliepen erg voortvarend en in een bijzonder goede sfeer
1544122 een zwarte broek zwarte sokken en een wit shirt waarin eveneens de kleur zwart is verwerkt
1544123 je vindt in de tenues niets terug van de clubkleuren van de beide verenigingen alleen in het logo vind je het blauw van t fean 58 en het oranje van de vv surhuisterveen terug
1544124 het geheel staat stevig in de steigers niets staat de samenwerking in de weg
1544125 het is allemaal bijzonder voortvarend gegaan dat zegt genoeg over de prima onderlinge verhoudingen wij zien de toekomst met veel vertrouwen tegemoet

1544128 every year in this country approximately 6 500 children are treated in emergency departments for diving related injury
1544129 more than 80 of the dive injuries were from a dive height of less than or equal to one meter so that is not the highest dive thats not a platform dive this is the lowest dive height available at the pool
1544130 there is a need for increased prevention efforts to lower the risks of diving related injuries among children and adolescents
1544131 the recent growth of the sport of diving coupled with the increasing complexity and difficulty of dives has resulted in a greater potential for both competitive and recreational diving related injuries
1544132 based on our findings the largest age group of injured divers was 10 to 14 year olds
1544133 although this group made up the largest number of injured divers 10 to 19 years olds were more at risk for an injury to the extremities boys were two times more likely to experience a head or neck injury or a fracture
1544134 parents pediatricians coaches lifeguards and trainers need to be aware of the types of injuries seen during recreational and competitive diving as well as the risk factors
1544135 dude like i went over the falls and totally pearled
1544136 the ventomobile is another proof of what can be done with renewable energies
1544137 based on these encouraging early results we conclude that the use of magnetic resonance temperature imaging and gold nanoshells hold the very real possibility of meeting the long sought goal of improving the precision of thermal ablation while sparing healthy tissue
1544138 temperature imaging and guidance is an invaluable tool furthering this approach as it moves from feasibility studies to future use in human clinical trials
1544139 our duck billed dinosaur grew three to five times faster than any potential predators that lived alongside it
1544140 by the time the duck billed dinosaur was fully grown the tyrannosaurs were only half grown it was a huge size difference
1544141 thats another added bonus when facing predators if you can keep reproducing youre set
1544142 we were shocked at how fast they grew if you look at a cross section of the bone of a nestling or even from within the egg there are huge spaces in which blood supply was going through the bone which means they were growing like crazy
1544143 this study is a stepping stone to a larger comparative study on community changes that impacted dinosaur evolution
1544144 data from our randomized placebo controlled trial involving a long duration of observation inject a note of caution into the debate regarding the use of gh therapy in the hiv population
1544145 low dose physiological gh is well tolerated and results in significant but more modest reduction in visceral adipose tissue vat abdominal fat but is nonetheless associated with increased glucose levels therefore the therapeutic window to achieve an optimal risk benefit ratio of gh in individuals with hiv abdominal fat accumulation and insulin resistance may be very narrow and difficult to achieve
1544146 growth hormone is not yet fda approved for the treatment of abdominal fat accumulation in patients with hiv other more potent strategies to safely increase gh and reduce vat including the use of gh releasing hormone ghrh may be more beneficial in addition strategies using diet exercise and lifestyle change may be more cost effective in the long run than gh particularly in patients with hiv visceral adiposity and insulin resistance in whom changes in glucose may be counterproductive
1544147 could be the result of the limited power of the latter analysis to detect a difference an alternative explanation however is a drug interaction mediated by rifampicin during the lead in dosing phase of nevirapine
1544148 given the continued reliance on nevirapine containing art regimens in africa together with the important role tuberculosis services play as an entry point for art further prospective studies exploring this outcome are warranted one of the most striking aspects of our study was the demonstration that 40 percent of patients starting art in recent years have concurrent tuberculosis underscoring the public health importance of improving affordable treatment options for patients infected with hiv and tuberculosis in this setting
1544149 this study tells us that a rationally dosed growth hormone regimen does a pretty good job of improving several risk factors for cardiovascular disease in patients who develop this syndrome while taking antiretroviral drugs but growth hormone therapy may be limited by its effects on glucose levels
1544150 low dose growth hormone may be an effective and safe treatment for those whose glucose tolerance is normal and not for individuals with impaired glucose tolerance
1544151 in an earlier study our group showed that treatment with a drug that induces the release of growth hormone significantly decreases abdominal fat without increasing glucose levels more work needs to be done to determine which strategy is appropriate for particular patients as well as clarifying the role of lifestyle changes and eventually identifying new antiretroviral drugs that do not cause these metabolic abnormalities
1544152 finding perchlorates is neither good nor bad for life but it does make us reassess how we think about life on mars
1544153 because different types of perchlorate salts have interesting properties that may bear on the way things work on mars if and thats a big if the results from our two teaspoons of soil are representative of all of mars or at least a significant portion of the planet
1544154 the phoenix project has decided to take an unusual step
1544155 we decided to show the public science in action because of the extreme interest in the phoenix mission which is searching for a habitable environment on the northern plains of mars
1544156 right now we dont know whether finding perchlorate is good news or bad news for possible life on mars
1544157 had we seen it the identification of perchlorate would be absolutely clear but in this run we did not see any chlorine gas we may have been analyzing a perchlorate salt that doesnt release chlorine gas upon heating
1544158 theres nothing in the tega data that contradicts mecas finding of perchlorates
1544159 given concerns about potential harmful effects and lack of evidence proving that these medications are effective in young children the fact that one in ten u s children is using one of these medications is striking
1544160 women diagnosed with breast cancer face an uphill emotional battle
1544161 at a time when they are forced to deal with their own vulnerabilities women with breast cancer must also navigate the vulnerabilities of loved ones as they react to the news
1544162 women who limit their emotions in discussing their breast cancer diagnosis often limit the possibilities for support they can receive
1544163 involving and including others in an illness increases intimacy among friends and family and opens the door to additional support

1544165 this new tool offers a google maps like view of integrative genomic data
1544166 it brings together different kinds of genomic data into a single holistic view im incredibly proud of our computational scientists for responding so rapidly and effectively to the critical needs of the growing genomics research community
1544167 other tools offer detailed localized views of genomic data and a few tools are equipped to provide a whole genome view
1544168 igv was designed to integrate both and to provide smooth zooming and panning across all resolution scales
1544169 most visualization tools are limited in their ability to handle multiple types of genomic data and are typically retrofitted to accommodate new data types as they have arisen
1544170 igv was designed from the ground up to integrate all of these data and to provide a strong platform for future growth and refinement
1544171 before i was introduced to igv i had to use three different programs to visually integrate my data
1544172 but now this one universal browser allows me to rapidly scan the entire genome and identify promising regions which has revolutionized my work
1544173 this tool is designed to enable researchers to view many types of genomic data especially those relevant to human disease
1544174 were particularly excited about its already groundbreaking use in ongoing studies of the cancer genome

1544176 this jump in incarceration rates represents a massive intervention in american families at a time when the federal government was making claims that it was less involved in their lives
1544177 these kinds of rates were not historically true 30 years ago today we are giving people custodial sentences that we wouldnt have in the past for victimless crimes our justice system has become more punitive
1544178 we usually dont think of the prison system as something that is a policy shift but the public health risks and the effects on migration and fertility show that it has had fundamental consequences for all of us
1544179 it is in our own self interest to be concerned and certainly from a fiscal standpoint we have an interest in times of financial difficulty we have a fixed amount of money and for every dollar we spend on incarceration we have one dollar less to spend on education and other things this is a challenging public policy question

1544186 deirdre back from belize mission trip august 17 th 2004
1544187 december 9 th 2007 twenty one year old female found murdered on w 124 th and weston in an abandoned retail area initial reports suggest she was severely beaten and raped prior to death she attended a local state school no suspects have been determined thus far
1544188 why are you reading me that this isnt our business if anything is our business its the fact that we should probably call for help this guy looks ready to drop any minute
1544189 december 16 th 2007 21 year old deirdre rawlings daughter of olivia rawlings deceased and anthony rawlings was found murdered by police on november 23 rd family and friends are shocked by the sheer brutality of the crime there are no leads in this case she was an active member of st judes episcopalian church monetary donations toward the funeral costs should be made out to the church any tips that may lead to the capture of the culprit should be directed at your local police office
1544190 yeah im at 3187 live oak theres a man here anthony rawlings i think hes ill hes not moving
1544191 im not sure i think they might be a little loose in the crotch
1544192 hey lossing all the ammuition and selling it all to the other team are two different things
1544193 first of all i think i realize now that there was a rather parochial zone of interest where all of my relationships maybe even my relationship with myself plus or minus were based on time warners destiny if something didnt touch on any of the businesses of time warner then i didnt have any interest the other thing is there wasnt a sufficient understanding that its o k to be open and vulnerable to ask for help to state it in different terms its probably helpful to invoke the feminine principle and be compassionate empathetic understanding give respect to everybody dont get deluded by the natural hierarchy and dont get too self satisfied that you have all the answers i believe the importance of the capitalist system the way its been structured but there is such a focus on delivering those returns almost without any understanding that there are deeper issues that management is also about humanism and respect for people in the company serving the public interest higher obligations to yourself and to the world very few mission statements take that into account

1544311 were still growing were still going to get better as each game goes on but i think tonight we learned something
1544312 the last two games the ball has been sticking a little bit so we have to get back to looking like the first game where everybody was touching the ball and we were playing like we should
1544313 were too talented of a team to take tough shots because theres always going to be someone open
1544314 in the third quarter they knocked down some big shots and i think that got them back in the ball game
1544315 and for us we have to understand that thats going to happen from time to time and its important to keep our poise keep our composure and buckle down
1544316 we just broke down we gambled a couple of times and allowed them to make the extra pass
1544317 we cant have those types of mental breakdowns because these teams can really shoot the ball

1544376 i did this before about eight years ago its certainly the most unusual wedding ive ever done the only hairy moment was when i thought my goggles were about to come off
1544377 ending the war is essential to meeting our broader strategic goals starting in afghanistan and pakistan where the taliban is resurgent and al qaeda has a safe haven irag is not the central front in the war on terrorism and it never has been as adm mike mullen the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff recently pointed out we wont have sufficient resources to finish the job in afghanistan until we reduce our commitment to iraq as president i would pursue a new strategy and begin by providing at least two additional combat brigades to support our effort in afghanistan
1544378 is not because there are too few american soldiers but because there are not enough afghans ready to fight and die for the kind of government we want
1544379 a troop increase is likely to inflame afghan nationalism because afghans are more anti foreign than we acknowledge and the support for our presence in the insurgency areas is declining
1544380 is because iraqis took the lead in confronting their own extremists the shiites in their areas the sunnis in theirs that is very good news
1544381 thanks to the surge whose effectiveness my opponent refuses to admit the iraqis now see a way forward to peace and democracy if they are correct iraq will set an example for the entire muslim world of a nation prosperous pious progressive and free this is an outcome my opponent was unable to imagine and cannot imagine yet for some reason hed rather fight in afghanistan a primitive collection of clans and warlords on the fringes of arabia that for centuries has defied every attempt to civilize and reform it chewing up and spitting out every invading army that tried osama bin laden is nowhere to be found in afghanistan and neither is the future of the arab muslim world my opponent is young and naive and doesnt understand any of this
1544382 the initial invasion in 2001 was easy because the taliban had alienated itself from the vast majority of afghans but the weight of occupation and the rising number of civilian deaths is shifting the resistance toward a war of national liberation no foreign power has ever won that battle in afghanistan
1544383 before he jumps into afghanistan with both feet russian officers caution that afghans cannot be conquered as the soviets attempted to do in the 1980s with nearly twice as many troops as nato and the u s now have in the country and with three times the number of afghan troops as president hamid karzai can deploy afghanistan never fell to the british or russian empires at the height of the age of colonialism conquering the tribal forces of a vast rugged thinly populated country proved beyond their powers it may also well prove beyond the powers even of the energetic and charismatic obama in iraq he is listening to what the iraqis want in pakistan he is simply dictating policy in a somewhat bellicose fashion
1544384 obama needs to ask himself honestly am i for sending more troops to afghanistan because i really think we can win there because i really think that that will bring an end to terrorism or am i just doing it because to get elected in america post 9 11 i have to be for winning some war
1544385 there are some very compelling reasons for doing this and its you know energy its carbon footprint its better servicing our customer base its employee morale

1544416 la derecha se prepara para frenar la ley habilitante consideraciones generales sobre el conjunto de leyes aprobadas
1544417 diferencias entre los partidos de la alianza patri tica fueron superados
1544418 recordemos que hubo una primera sentencia en el a o 2004 luego una segunda y aclaratoria en el a o 2005 en la cual se ratificaba la facultad de la contralor a para imponer sanciones en inhabilitaci n pero en aquellos casos en que el funcionario publico sancionado estuviese desempe ando un cargo producto de una elecci n de primer grado es decir universal directa y secreta no podr a de ipsofacto cumplirse la sanci n aplicada por la contralor a sino que era menester esperar que culminase el periodo para el que hubiese resultado electo y no podr a reelegirse
1544419 ahora esta sentencia pone punto final a lo que venia siendo controvertido por los sectores de oposici n
1544420 pre ados de buenas intenciones esa es la nica violaci n del marco constitucional estos 8 a os
1544421 ellos los abogados tienen suficiente conocimiento como para no quedarse callados pero eso no se corresponde con la verdad ellos tienen que admitir que en venezuela las cosas cambiaron y que los delitos contra la cosa p blica son sancionados y esta es una demostraci n de que no se puede seguir cabalgado sobre la impunidad en venezuela se est haciendo un esfuerzo serio y sostenido de las instituciones del estado por adecentar al pa s y ponerle punto final a la corrupci n y a la impunidad
1544422 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
1544423 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
1544424 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
1544425 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
1544426 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
1544427 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1544428 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
1544429 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
1544430 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
1544431 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
1544432 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
1544433 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
1544434 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
1544435 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
1544436 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
1544437 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
1544438 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
1544439 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
1544440 no to offshore drilling yes to a vacation for congress
1544441 while a very small band of your colleagues remain on the house floor to discuss gas prices their constituents deserve to know why their representatives in congress have failed to support serious responsible proposals
1544442 these proposals would increase supply reduce prices protect consumers and transition america to a clean renewable energy independent future americans deserve real solutions not rhetoric
1544443 perhaps our compassionate conservative in chief will bring our absent democrat congress some made in communist china souvenir t shirts bush went to beijing and all i got was this lousy five week paid vacation

1544447 its essentially a race between the attackers and the protectors
1544448 give a head start to software providers delivering security features to our mutual customers
1544449 it will save vendors the work of reverse engineering the patch and identifying where the vulnerability is and what triggers the exploitability
1544450 the goal is to give it to them so they can have updates available as close to 10am as possible
1544451 a year ago the board and investors made it very clear they felt that green design was the right direction for the corporation to take
1544452 well partner big to big companies and acquire big to small companies or big to medium companies
1544453 so you could see us partner with an ibm or a microsoft or an intel and well acquire more like a scientific atlanta or a webex my favorite kind of company to acquire is one with 100 engineers who have a hot product they are just about to release
1544454 web 2 0 and collaboration will be the biggest drivers for our business over the next five to 10 years
1544455 you dont have to win over everybody to gain from a campaign stop
1544456 the military is not monolithic it leans republican but it doesnt mean there arent people in the military and military spouses who might be persuaded to support obama
1544457 this taps into a side of the military that takes a beating when it comes to deployments but doesnt get a lot of media attention theres a good bit of frustration in that segment of the military and it might be possible to persuade them to support barack obama
1544458 a lot of environmental activists still have not come to accept that the humans are also part of the environment
1544459 we need your help to get this film into theatres and schools across the country to defeat al gores lies and exaggerations
1544460 not evil just wrong is the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
1544461 al gore has raised us 300 million to bombard the world with his message that all the energy in the us should be renewable in 10 years he is even running his ads during sponge bob square pants our children are watching this propaganda and are being forced to watch
1544462 please help us as much as you can to get this film out now
1544463 give me the money and ill be right back with the dope
1544464 chicka youre being silly you know thats not what you want youre doing that on a whim and you know it
1544465 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
1544466 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
1544467 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
1544468 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
1544469 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
1544470 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
1544471 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
1544472 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
1544473 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
1544474 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer

1544480 we need to be able to address a national energy strategy and then try to work on environmental efficiencies as part of that plan
1544481 we cant just start with things like emission standards at a time when were at a crisis with the entire national energy policy
1544482 there was not enough emphasis that if we move aggressively toward sustainable energy we will transform our energy costs
1544483 we were not as clear as we might have been
1544484 does this mean you endorse using gas hogs and large mansions
1544485 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
1544486 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw
1544487 10 thinks you didnt know about west virginia gov joe manchin
1544488 in my 31 years of social work i dont think ive seen a crime this heinous perpetrated against a social worker in the line of duty
1544489 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
1544490 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
1544491 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
1544492 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will cause in the future catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
1544493 an overwhelming number of scientists have determined that catastrophic manmade global warming is real and that any further debate over the science is pointless
1544494 marketed not on the basis of science its about what is known or what can be proved about the natural world rather than the number of scientists who are willing to publicly commit to a particular opinion
1544495 an overwhelming number of scientists they are referring to scientists working under the auspices of the u n s intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc that agrees man made greenhouse gas emissions are or will in the future wreak havoc on the climate
1544496 head counts of scientists seem to be the name of the global warming game
1544497 the white house has taken a beating over the years in the press on climate and facts no longer matter
1544498 the latest move was to list the polar bear as an endangered species
1544499 there are many more polar bears today than 40 years ago and predictions of the bears demise are entirely based on politically inspired speculation
1544500 we cant drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect other countries to say ok
1544501 regulate the pantries of america as well as thermostats and modes of personal transportation mccain and the bush administration are drinking the same kool aid the initial response from the bush administration to relevant new facts seems to be see no consensus hear no consensus speak no consensuses
1544502 the involvement of charities means that not only will the film inspire people to act but we can also give them a way to put this inspiration to use afterwards
1544503 we want people to realise that they have the power to resist
1544504 we hope that ngos will be able to tell their members about the project driving more people to the site when we make the film hopefully it will inspire more people to visit the site and join the resist network continuing the whole process
1544505 in most cases the support is not just financial we have worked with all sorts of films including features such as blood diamond in the past people came to us with completed projects and asked us for support but now we work in a more holistic way from script development and research onwards
1544506 if the film maker wants to tell both sides of the story they can do that
1544507 we support freedom of expression any storytelling is positive for us if it shines a light on what is happening in the world we get involved to tell our side of the story correctly documentaries can be overwhelming if they do not contain a solution to the problems they highlight ngos can give that al gores film ended with an example of what people can do people are ripe for that kind of activism
1544508 then we went to britdoc and its organisers supported us pitching for funding when people have seen what we have made we want them to feel inspired to act
1544509 we got involved with britdoc two years ago because we thought documentaries were an effective way of getting complicated issues which cant be summed up in a soundbite through to the public erasing david looks like it will be entertaining and this makes it more accessible which is perfect when trying to interest people in a debate
1544510 it is easy to see how these collaborations can work with subjects such as science if there is transparency
1544511 but i think that where for example a film maker wants to make a documentary on the international criminal court one needs to be particularly careful that both sides of the argument are properly analysed
1544512 i sense that film makers often want to make a film and they are not too concerned where they come from i am a journalist and i like to see things investigated with a critical eye when there is more than one view on a topic we need to be careful about where backing comes from
1544513 i cant think of subjective journalism that i have a problem with if it is marked as subjective and clear
1544514 most journalism is already subjective even if it is labelled as objective i am suspicious of all organisations including news organisations there always needs to be proper controls to protect editorial integrity for ngos collaboration wont work if they ask for something too specific but if say they want to fund increased reporting from congo it can work
1544515 there used to be five broadcasters paying high sums for documentaries now with for example the probability that itv will be able to reduce its public service commitments everything is different commercial and third sector brands can invest in documentaries if it is done sensibly
1544516 you need people who will email friends and walk the streets to talk about a project third sector people care enough to do that
1544517 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
1544518 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
1544519 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
1544520 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
1544521 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
1544522 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1544523 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
1544524 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
1544525 young gore sets out for his new home where the sky is clear the water is clean and there are no republicans
1544526 former vice president al gore who for the past three decades has unsuccessfully attempted to warn humanity of the coming destruction of our planet only to be mocked and derided by the very people he has tried to save launched his infant son into space monday in the faint hope that his only child would reach the safety of another world
1544527 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
1544528 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
1544529 this is no fantasy no careless product of wild imagination no my friends these indictments that i have brought to you today specific charges herein against the individuals their acts of treason their ultimate aim of sedition these are matters of undeniable fact i ask you now to pronounce judgment on those accused
1544530 washington cnn iraq is raking in more money from oil exports than it is spending amassing a projected four year budget surplus of up to 80 billion u s auditors reported tuesday
1544531 the united states has put about 48 billion toward reconstruction since the 2003 invasion of iraq auditors reported about 23 billion of that was spent on the oil and electricity industries water systems and security
1544532 iraq spent 3 9 billion on those sectors from 2005 through april 2008 according to the gao the investigative arm of congress
1544533 the issue raised the hackles of several members of congress earlier this year particularly because bush administration officials said on the eve of the war that iraqi oil money would pay for reconstruction
1544534 the harry potter alliance is trying to get people to host house parties during the olympics to raise awareness on the catastrophes happening all over the world
1544535 i liked it better when you were a real euro blonde
1544536 i dont think she got the two of you confused
1544537 the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket
1544538 that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1544539 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1544540 now if youll excuse me i have to pick out a vice president
1544541 im thinking rihanna ill see you at the white house oh and i might paint it pink i hope thats cool with you guys
1544542 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
1544543 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
1544544 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
1544545 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
1544546 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
1544547 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
1544548 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1544549 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
1544550 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1544551 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1544552 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
1544553 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
1544554 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
1544555 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
1544556 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
1544557 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
1544558 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
1544559 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
1544560 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
1544561 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
1544562 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
1544563 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
1544564 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
1544565 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
1544566 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
1544567 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
1544568 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
1544569 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
1544570 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
1544571 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
1544572 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
1544573 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
1544574 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
1544575 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
1544576 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
1544577 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
1544578 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
1544579 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
1544580 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
1544581 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
1544582 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
1544583 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
1544584 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
1544585 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
1544586 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
1544587 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
1544588 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
1544589 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
1544590 weve stopped thinking in terms of hillary people and obama people what was good about this was that we got everybody involved
1544591 as a great admirer of the royal family i was disgusted to see that two of the animals in
1544592 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
1544593 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
1544594 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
1544595 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
1544596 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
1544597 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
1544598 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
1544599 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
1544600 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
1544601 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
1544602 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
1544603 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
1544604 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
1544605 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
1544606 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
1544607 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
1544608 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
1544609 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1544610 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
1544611 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
1544612 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
1544613 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
1544614 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
1544615 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
1544616 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
1544617 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
1544618 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
1544619 a middle course between the republicans insistence on more drilling and democrats demands for more renewables and efficiency measures
1544620 educational levels tend to be higher among those who actually use the label yes
1544621 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1544622 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
1544623 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1544624 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1544625 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
1544626 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1544627 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
1544628 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
1544629 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
1544630 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
1544631 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
1544632 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
1544633 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
1544634 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
1544635 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
1544636 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
1544637 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
1544638 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
1544639 the chinese authorities have a right to protect the life and security of their law enforcement officials
1544640 however attacks such as these should not be used to justify the promotion or implementation of repressive or abusive security measures
1544641 we have said that it will be coming out this year
1544642 i can tell you its not coming in the july to september quarter

1544647 save and except where in the opinion of the general manager football operations there are exceptional and compelling circumstances that make it harsh and unconscionable for a player not to be exchanged no afl club shall exchange any player who has not completed at least one afl season under his current contract with the afl club or such lesser period as agreed between afl and aflpa

1544649 we may unearth chris dawes we may unearth john mccarthy they can come in and play cameo roles and they can galvanise the senior boys and get us over the line
1544650 the fundamental scheme provisions land uses and controls have not been amended in any significant way other than rural subdivision and land use issues
1544651 the documents require changes to bring them in line with current state planning policies
1544652 a very large number of submissions related to this issue and were all opposed to the proposed road
1544653 it is acknowledged the the greenway was never intended to become a through route and to impose a through route along it is directly in conflict to the wishes of the residents of the immediate area
1544654 children play in the streets this couldnt happen if the road went through
1544655 the area was designed as quiet residential with a traffic calming layout and child friendly playing park
1544656 would council compensate landowners for a massive drop in property values
1544657 this grant will allow us to purchase materials which will enable us to offer training and support to our small but dedicated team of community members who volunteer with bravehearts childrens charity in margaret river
1544658 our community and not for profit groups are the life blood of our area and hopefully these funds will go a small way to supporting their efforts
1544659 it was a very competitive round which shows how important access to funding is for local community groups
1544660 pubf and many other volunteers have done a fantastic job finding photographing documenting and drying fungi during recent years
1544661 although our environment contains many more fungi species than plant species only a little is known about the states fungi one estimate is that the south west has 25 000 fungi species of which fewer than 10 per cent have been discovered and named to date
1544662 the fungi were variously found underground on the ground on moss in litter on dead wood and on living trees and roots
1544663 fungal networks effectively bind soils plants and animals into a healthy cohesive system
1544664 fungi decompose litter and debris cycle precious nutrients and have mutually beneficial relationships with many plants
1544665 for instance small native marsupials such as woylies potoroos and bandicoots dig up and eat truffle fungi
1544666 in fact the gilberts potoroo australias most endangered mammal which is only found in a small area near albany is almost totally dependent on fungi as food all year round
1544667 the west bay bushland is highly significant because of its great diversity and strategic location at the main entrance to augusta
1544668 the wide ranging biodiversity studies carried out in the bushland since 2005 should prove to be invaluable to the augusta margaret river shire and the department of environment and conservation when a management plan is developed for the west bay area
1544669 that plan should give recognition to the areas very high potential for environmental education
1544670 capa consulting and tourism futures international have been appointed as the consultants to look at the viability of air services for the region
1544671 these companies have extensive experience in developing innovative and effective strategies for airports particularly in regional areas across australia
1544672 capa and tfi will join together to assess whether the region is capable of supporting regular passenger air services and what this means for infrastructure and route development
1544673 this buffer provides a better interface between residential activity and rural activity than just a fence line
1544674 five hectare lots are probably too big for buffer conservation lifestyle development and are of little farming use
1544675 very peculiar because location 1035 was endorsed into the original village strategy
1544676 this will provide certainty and fairness given the impact of urban residential development along my entire southern fenceline
1544677 i dont think this is the best option at the minute
1544678 i genuinely think this is a win for all concerned
1544679 it will add value to the area for future generations
1544680 development that has occurred in the shire is a way to benefit developers rather than land and community
1544681 a means to define and expand the development area of margaret river rather than increase public safety
1544682 we should go back to the east of margaret river structure plan
1544683 fabrication of false population growth figures to attempt to skew the outcomes of the process is appalling
1544684 members of the council responsible for pushing this agenda should apologise to the community and resign
1544685 clear failure on part of the shire to take account of relevant state and local planning policy documents
1544686 abs census shows a clear slow down in growth and strategy should reflect that
1544687 it would be positively detrimental to the future of margaret river
1544688 historically such a road as the bypass has never been the factor that has limited the suburban growth of any townsite
1544689 although i have not been involved it does seem that council has gone to great lengths to involve the residents and visitors in the consultative process
1544690 next phase of development in the region is very exciting and it would be a shame if the future direction were dictated by a vocal minority
1544691 the very high scenario can be seen as the final development scenario for the town of margaret river
1544692 expansion of the town can go no further over the lifetime of the strategy
1544693 it is very unlikely that this scenario will happen over the course of the next 15 years
1544694 the strategy simply shows a means by which the potential high demand scenario can be accommodated actual town expansion will be determined by future population growth and housing demand
1544695 linked to implementation of the eastern bypass road and new job provision
1544696 the lps and townsite strategies plan for the future of the region incorporating growth and statistics rather than by population projections alone
1544697 the department of planning and infrastructures wa tomorrow document the shires lps and townsite strategy use separate population projections
1544698 the variation is due to different growth rates based on different assumptions
1544699 the maximum total serviced population to be planned for by the shire in the lps and townsite strategies is about 13 000
1544700 wa tomorrow is based on the 2001 census data and has made projections for the region to 2031
1544701 to cater for a town with a 2026 planned capacity of 10 000 to 12 000 identification of more land for development is required
1544702 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
1544703 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
1544704 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
1544705 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
1544706 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
1544707 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
1544708 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
1544709 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1544710 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
1544711 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
1544712 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
1544713 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
1544714 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
1544715 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
1544716 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
1544717 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
1544718 this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
1544719 any time you pick up a newspaper and see the terms climate change or global warming just think jobs for michigan
1544720 believe me the production people can do it if they really try
1544721 we are not trying to cause the economic collapse of the roman catholic church but to illustrate to the court the magnitude of the plot against our order
1544722 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
1544723 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
1544724 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
1544725 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
1544726 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
1544727 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
1544728 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
1544729 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
1544730 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
1544731 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
1544732 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
1544733 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
1544734 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
1544735 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
1544736 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
1544737 guess what im the worst science fiction writer in the world
1544738 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1544739 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
1544740 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
1544741 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
1544742 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
1544743 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
1544744 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
1544745 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
1544746 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
1544747 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now

1544758 dont stop playing because you grow old you grow old because you stop playing
1544759 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
1544760 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
1544761 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
1544762 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
1544763 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1544764 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
1544765 we both wear rings and im giddy when i see all the pictures of people so happy standing there confirming the love they wish they could have expressed for a long time
1544766 im a big proponent of monogamous relationships regardless of sexuality and im proud of how the nation is steering toward that
1544767 i think if and when we do get married wed probably announce it after the fact as opposed to making any big announcement
1544768 im just glad it wasnt based on scandal i didnt want there to be some we got footage story where i have to make some sort of statement about some event that happened
1544769 im not that scandalous i dont have a lot of random sex ive never done cocaine im not a crazy partier i dont stay up and rent private jets and go on yachts and whoop it up in miami
1544770 i found a guy that im head over heels for and we have similar interests and we spend our time together
1544771 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
1544772 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
1544773 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
1544774 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
1544775 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
1544776 my heart goes out to the families of the victims as well as to the community and the whole u p i was raised in the up and i know how much we yoopers value the serenity and safety that goes with living there when i was a kid we didnt even have a lock on our front door it wasnt needed and were not talking that long ago this kind of senseless act will bring the community together but will also leave scars that will make people think twice about their safety
1544777 i demand to know where al gore is declaring that this rise in the lake levels is all just media bunk and that were all still doomed because of global warming
1544778 he wants to tax oil companies profits which will raise the price of gas and use the money to help motorist pay for the more expensive gas is this robbing peter to pay peter
1544779 like any dog this breed needs to be matched with the right owner i dont know much about this specific owner or the circumstances but pit bulls are often a thugged out status symbol and are not given the assertive leadership they require heck it may have to come to the point where one needs to be licensed to own certain breeds banning them may only increase their mystique and status amongst those ill equipped to care for them
1544780 one moment the quiet man near the back of the bus was minding his own business the man believed to be in his 30s hadnt talked to anyone around him and seemed to pay no attention to the younger fellow sitting next to him who was listening to music on headphones the next moment witnesses said the older man stood up still quiet and repeatedly stabbed and beheaded his seat mate
1544781 and when people make these sort of mistakes we need to hammer them and hold them accountable
1544782 i think we need to redouble our efforts in our hunter safety education courses
1544783 our sons have all been hunters we have a real respect for firearms theyve been a part of our lives
1544784 everyone is always looking for the quick legislative fix as if you can legislate against foolishness
1544785 sure the kid was 14 and some adult supervision might be a good idea for a hunter that age but again age doesnt necessarily guarantee that you dont have the wear with all to take a bad shot
1544786 you know it just keeps reminding me over and over and over again what i saw
1544787 i talked with rudy or something like that and he never called me back
1544788 weve got bio clean out here right now with all the paperwork
1544789 are you willing to let them sign it and let them do it
1544790 if you ever need picked up from somewhere or a ride some where call me
1544791 were deeply concerned and disturbed that our reporter of all of those in that area was asked to move my understanding is that stephen was the only reporter approached and asked to leave the area and the only reporter in that area who is black another reporter who stood up for stephen was then asked to leave
1544792 phew i dont see alot of black people on my tour and its good to know your last name isnt mccain like that last one you start thinking i wonder if he was my ancestors slave and he took the family name and its awkward ill tell you yuk yuk
1544793 the denver city council has passed an ordinance barring protesters from carrying buckets of feces during the democratic national convention three protest groups say theyve already promised not to toss smear or spray feces and they call the new ordinance insulting and excessive
1544794 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
1544795 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
1544796 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
1544797 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
1544798 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
1544799 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
1544800 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
1544801 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
1544802 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
1544803 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
1544804 wao como da vueltas la vida antes era un rockero empedernido y ahora un bachatero a escondidas
1544805 and i began to focus my aggression and energy back into music
1544806 it is impossible to imagine a more complete fusion with nature than that of the gypsy
1544807 be born anywhere little embyro novelist but do not be born under the shadow of a great creed not under the burden of original sin not under the doom of salvation go out and be born among the gypsies or thieves or among happy workaday people who live in the sun and do not think about their souls

1544812 stylish uncomplicated or convenient probably arent the first words that come to mind when you think of most surround sound receivers but this can be said about kenwood with technology like the kam 1 audio amplifier circuitry which generates more power with much less heat kenwood continues to garner a reputation for being an innovative audio specialty company with the vr405 enjoy dolby digital surround one of the most advanced surround sound formats on the market today plus get dolby pro logic the most popular surround sound system available used on hundreds of broadcast tv shows and on virtually every movie on video release since the early 1980s and with 80 watts per channel in both surround and stereo modes theres more than enough power to satisfy both the movie and music lover inside top it all off with features youd expect on more expensive units like auto select which chooses the correct digital format for you based on the input signal kenwood delivers more than you expect
1544813 que la vida iba en serio uno lo empieza a comprender m s tarde
1544814 as soon as a book enters our home it is guaranteed a permanent place in our lives because i have never been able to part with even one they have gradually accumulated like sediment
1544815 i try to vary my reading diet and ensure that i read more fiction than nonfiction i rarely read business books
1544816 my books are organized by topic and interest but in a manner that would make a librarian weep
1544817 there must exist a book which is the formula and the perfect compendium of all the rest
1544818 i remember the rage in my stomach later it burned down to a smoldering self pity
1544819 i heard it from rat kiley who swore up and down to its truth although in the end ill admit that doesnt amount to much of a warranty
1544820 increasing the overall number of higher degree scholarships and specifically increasing the number of targeted higher degree scholarships will help sustain and develop tertiary qualified professionals to meet australias needs
1544821 the job prospects for higher degree graduates choosing to focus on a research career are among the most insecure in the country living from three or five year contract to three or five year contract and having to effectively apply for their jobs again one or two years before the contract ends and so on
1544822 some of our best and brightest have among the worst job prospects making a research career unattractive in relation to other options
1544823 it is time to rethink this whole system and assist universities to give job security to those pursuing a research career
1544824 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi survivors
1544825 rwanda of course was a terrible human tragedy and one that the international community generally cant be proud of in terms of its response
1544826 its one of the reasons i think why there is an emerging discussion now about the notion of responsibility to protect that the international community does have an obligation to act much more quickly when we see these human tragedies occurring
1544827 very relieved and naturally extremely grateful to mr murray and mr morrison for being so responsible
1544828 that said the treo 700wx is a very powerful smartphone i have to say its the best pocket pc device that ive ever used to date windows mobile fans will find a lot to like with the treo palms customizations vastly improve the phone features and bring some cool and add some very useful functionality to windows mobile the combination of a multi tasking os and a high speed data connection really let you tap into the power of mobile computing

1544831 he is being moved to a regular room and he may be going home tomorrow his family is coming up from georgia tomorrow as well he has no work restrictions and can return to work when he feels like it everything is starting to look up
1544832 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
1544833 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
1544834 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
1544835 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
1544836 lean on trust in and be confident in the lord with all your heart and mind and do not rely on your own insight or understanding
1544837 trust god from the bottom of your heart dont try to figure out everything on your own listen for gods voice in everything you do everywhere you go hes the one who will keep you on track dont assume that you know it all

1544840 when ms karen hughes was appointed as undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs she set the tone to continue a disastrous policy of outreach with islamist partners
1544841 publicly challenged the designation of hezbollah and hamas as terrorist organizations
1544842 is suspected of being a pivotal cog in the muslim brotherhoods high command in america
1544843 as a homonym the number 8 sounds like good fortune in mandarin and cantonese
1544844 security was tight and was a bit over controlling which is par for the course at these events and as par for the course i tried to get near the candidate when i saw another reporter there alex leary
1544845 security tried to throw me out but i found a mccain staffer i knew and the person vouched for me
1544846 the campaign looked into this and found that no one from the campaign was involved
1544847 race played absolutely no role in any actions taken by our employees or anybody else in this case
1544848 it was just a really crazy situation we were being carted out of there and everyone was looking
1544849 im upset because my reporter was singled out for whatever reason that bothers me
1544850 were just trying to figure out what that reason was
1544851 i think it was about security and security acting overzealous and security singling out a black reporter to be removed
1544852 o great caesar but not yet gone the runoff will tell

1544885 you have to look in general at your school site we dont have that many districts or schools that have chronically underperformed

1544937 continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability
1544938 labour markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters over time the substantial easing of monetary policy combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate economic growth
1544939 we have selected an amount that we believe is comfortable for the whole period of temporary public ownership
1544940 we are clearly looking at a housing market which has deteriorated very considerably in recent months
1544941 we do think the economic climate and the housing market is going to be difficult for some considerable time
1544942 the future is going to be governed very considerably by what happens in the wider economy house prices in particular and what happens in terms of how house prices flow through to the loan book
1544943 we are a poor proxy for the industry we are different
1544944 there is short covering in a lot of places after this deal the oil price has only helped push it further
1544945 we have the lowest levels of consumer confidence and mortgage approvals since records began
1544946 the trading environment in the uk has become difficult and we can see this continuing for the rest of our financial year
1544947 the response of the share price has been fairly upbeat reflecting the markets current appetite for interest rate sensitive stocks and the feeling that there is some chance that lord harris will return to the table at some point

1544954 we are still looking to improve the salad we offer we are still committed to making them relevant and tasty for the customers who want them
1544955 the reality is that the sustained campaign in the media the government and health bodies message to eat more healthily has affected those brands
1544956 our uk business has not been as buoyant as it is now for four years
1544957 we are not recession resistant but we are recession resilient
1544958 people are searching out value for money and they are more demanding of what they want from their money

1544961 market conditions for the industry remain very difficult on the back of high oil prices and a weak economic environment
1544962 long haul premium remains broadly flat versus last year while non premium bookings remain most sensitive to price changes

1545009 adecco may believe that it had a once in a cycle opportunity to acquire michael page whilst a bid premium of up to 42 per cent may be attractive to some other investors may be unwilling to sell out at a depressed valuation when the shares were trading at 600p a year ago
1545010 the management of michael page are strongly independent and are unlikely to recommend a sale unless the offer is over 400p
1545011 it is clear that there has been a mispricing of risk that the market did not understand the value and importance of liquidity and that some banks did not fully understand the instruments they were dealing in
1545012 the industry should not reward excessive risk taking or reward failure boards and remuneration committees will have to reflect in future on whether the risks and rewards are appropriate
1545013 we are in the right markets and we are doing the right thing

1545033 two defeats is not the way i envisaged coming back with england i didnt wait 18 months to get beaten
1545034 it wasnt ideal but in a perverse way the first one at headingley i enjoyed in the sense of being back around the lads playing in front of a big crowd and playing for england
1545035 i just wish the outcome had been slightly different because for six months ive had to work so hard to get back in the side i am enjoying being there
1545036 ive had a start ive bowled some overs and ive batted okay but now i need to start performing properly
1545037 before this ankle operation i thought if i didnt think i could recapture the form of previously i wouldnt have put myself up for all of this

1545040 it is not a dead rubber maybe it is in the context of the series but we are playing for england and we are certainly playing for pride it is not measured by a trophy or a cheque there is a lot for us to play for as cricketers
1545041 for a start weve got to score more runs in the first innings of a test match than we have in the last two to give ourselves a decent chance

1545046 you shall not be afraid of the terrors of the night nor of the arrow the evil plots and slanders of the wicked that flies by day nor of the pestilence that stalks in darkness nor of the destruction and sudden death that surprise and lay waste at noonday
1545047 because you have made the lord your refuge and the most high your dwelling place
1545048 do not therefore fling away your fearless confidence for it carries a great and glorious compensation of reward
1545049 for i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which ive committed unto him against that day

1545056 se ha escapado al control de ron dennis su problema es que siempre tiene tendencia a mostrar m s simpat a por uno de sus pilotos y a protegerle ya lo hizo con senna hakkinen y ahora con hamilton
1545057 se es su modo de ser pero esto no significa que haya proporcionado ventajas t cnicas a su conductor preferido esto es simplemente su modo de comportarse comunicar su simpat a por un piloto
1545058 se ha ido contrariando conforme observaba que ron dennis dedicaba m s atenciones a hamilton que a l ron dennis ha cometido un error tremendo que es no haber establecido una jerarqu a desde el principio deber a haberle dado el papel de piloto n mero uno a alonso de una forma clara e indiscutible quedando hamilton como segundo piloto en carrera
1545059 probablemente alonso ya habr a ganado el mundial si la situaci n hubiera sido sa y hamilton habr a madurado sin tanta presi n llegando a 2008 en otra situaci n as todos los problemas que han tenido los dos pilotos se habr an evitado pero en estos momentos eso es mucho m s complicado
1545060 alonso ha exagerado un poco con las cr ticas y el modo en que l lo ha hecho pero todo comienza por la decisi n de dennis de tratar de convencer a sus pilotos de que dentro de su equipo hay una situaci n de igualdad perfecta
1545061 alonso ha perdido el t tulo quiz s no por culpa suya
1545062 hamilton cometi un error quiz por su juventud y nervios
1545063 massa es educado y combativo y raikkonen es un tipo nico
1545064 alonso es un fuera de clase en todos los sentidos es un piloto extraordinario he apreciado mucho su deportividad pues pese a perder el mundial por un solo punto y quiz s tambi n no por culpa suya y a lo mejor por mala gesti n de su escuder a nada m s llegar a la conferencia de prensa felicit a raikkonen
1545065 ha demostrado que es un campe n tambi n fuera de la pista
1545066 empec a verlo cuando hamilton al intentar adelantar a alonso se fue de la pista cometi un error quiz por su juventud y nervios pues manteni ndose detr s del espa ol era cuarto y con ese puesto era campe n hizo una imprudencia quiz s por los nervios
1545067 era como un espect culo de magos en f rmula 1 todo puede suceder pero esperaba que no sucediera nada o al m ximo como ya ha ocurrido en el pasado que le quitaran los puntos a la escuder a no a los pilotos
1545068 hay que reconocer que ha estado extraordinario pues tan joven y en su primera temporada en la f rmula 1 ha estado hasta el ltimo segundo con la posibilidad de ser el campe n del mundo y esto merece respeto y felicitaci n pero tambi n es verdad que no ha tenido durante la temporada ning n contratiempo por ejemplo tengo que reconocer que no me gust nada la maniobra que hizo en la calificaci n parando a raikkonen
1545069 es un piloto joven y seguro que esto le valdr de experiencia y llegar a ser un gran campe n
1545070 debo felicitar a ambos por todo lo realizado en la temporada y tengo que decir que si massa que es el piloto que m s poles ha logrado durante el a o no ha conseguido ser campe n mundial quiz sea porque no le hemos dado un coche con mayor fiabilidad
1545071 massa es educado combativo y trabaja siempre por el inter s de ferrari como se evidenci delante de su p blico
1545072 a veces hay que poner punto y final como sucedi con montoya a veces es necesario separarse
1545073 la situaci n es la misma tenemos un contrato por dos a os m s me gustar a que hubiera alguna noticia pero no las hay
1545074 s que ha sonado en estos ltimos d as no s por qu motivo ni qui n lo ha lanzado pero es un rumor que ha cogido fuerza a base de repetirlo pero no hay nada en absoluto de momento tengo contrato con mclaren es la realidad m s absoluta luego ya se ver si cambio de equipo renault no tiene por qu ser la primera opci n
1545075 no s nada sobre este asunto de mercedes y vuelvo a repetir que alonso es un piloto con contrato en mclaren nuestro inter s por fernando ni avanza ni retrocede simplemente nos mantenemos a la espera

1545080 la vuelta es la m s tradicional por la cantidad de ediciones y por el clima que se vive es una carrera linda con tramos r pidos y entretenidos y con algunos riesgos sin embargo los m s representativos siguen siendo los caminos de c rdoba

1545082 how i play in these games is going to determine who is going to be the starter
1545083 every one of these games is extremely important you get very limited reps so you got to take advantage of every rep that you have and every throw you have you got to do everything you can to win that job
1545084 i cant worry about people saying things because of where i was picked
1545085 it didnt bother me i just have to do the things i know i need to do to get better
1545086 now im more comfortable with the offense im not thinking as much and i am playing faster
1545087 hoe bent u een van de grootste reclamebureaus van europa geworden
1545088 na jarenlange ervaring bij mu reclamebureau heb ik besloten om afscheid te nemen van mu en op mijn eigen te werken met mijn partner
1545089 nee mijn partner werkte voor star dat is ook een reclamebureau
1545090 is het niet lastig dat u met u vrouw samenwerkt
1545091 ja soms wel maar we proberen werk en ons priveleven niet over elkaar lopen daar hebben we ook regels voor bijv thuis mag er niet over werk worden gesproken omdat soms meningsverschillen uitlopen tot ruzies en dat willen we niet
1545092 ik heb op het mbo sociaal juridisch gedaan ik kreeg bij mijn opleiding ook het vak marketing en public relationship ik vond het juist die vak een van de leukste vak van me opleiding omdat we naam bedrijf huisstijl en billboards moesten ontwerpen en sinds kinds af aan houw ik van tekenen en ontwerpen ik denk dat dat een van de grootste reden is waarom ik in de reclamewereld terecht ben gekomen
1545093 we willen eerst op vakantie gaan met vrouw partner en kinderen naar de alpen en daarna gaan we vol aan de slag om nog groter te worden we hebben al een paar grote bedrijven die willen dat we reclamen voor hun gaan maken we hebben volgend week 2 sollicitanten van het hogeschool van amsterdam die stage willen lopen wie weet zijn hun de ontwerpers van de toekomst
1545094 life is what happens while youre busy making other plans
1545095 based on the context of the entire label we agree that the phrase in question refers to the brand name of the product and does not mislead consumers
1545096 it is the clear sentiment of this board that more can and should be done to safeguard human life than has been the case to this point in the construction process
1545097 we believe these kind of measures just provide a false sense of security
1545098 the canal should not appear like a swimming pool that people can jump and swim across easily
1545099 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1545100 and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1545101 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised
1545102 todays indictments are a reminder of a growing threat that every american faces in the 21st century the fact that each individuals greatest asset is their names their identity
1545103 that was the first time ever that a computer system was wiretapped
1545104 obviously we werent happy that a person working for us as an informant was double dealing
1545105 regardless of the outcome of the election the negotiating committee stays as is until 2011 so it really doesnt matter what happens
1545106 the change was generated principally by the larger results of our holdings due to the impact a sharp increase in raw material prices had on inventories
1545107 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1545108 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1545109 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1545110 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1545111 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1545112 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs
1545113 here is a link to a great essay by lisa degroff about marilyns acting
1545114 i cant take you to the hospital now if you get a bruise theyll think i beat my wife
1545115 honey i cant take you to the hospital theyll think i beat my husband
1545116 so jeremy what did your wife get you for your birthday
1545117 i am awake i have a cramp in my calf

1545119 we dont sell any of the small turtles because they are the ones that usually carry the salmonella
1545120 they are illegal to be sold apparently weve seen them around in different places in the city here but the last two days magically theyve disappeared i dont know if the word got out that were looking for them or theyve run out of turtles
1545121 we know all the little areas where theyve been hanging out so thats not a mystery we had some on avenue b 24th and pacific highway 80
1545122 we want to get out a word to the public to let them know if you got them its really not a good idea to have them with your kids
1545123 but meanwhile were going to put a halt on their sales on yuma

1545127 its in our criminal justice system that everyone is innocent until theyre proven guilty but in all reality until you actually are proven your innocence you carry the scarlet letter of the accused

1545133 nemmeno io firmer perch sono il sindaco di venezia e non il segretario del pd della mia citt ma a parte questo mi sembra uniniziativa sballata
1545134 naturale e anche doveroso che le cariche istituzionali e soprattutto i presidenti delle regioni come antonio bassolino collaborino lealmente con il governo nazionale per risolvere i problemi delle loro comunit ma oltre ad un piano prettamente istituzionale c a mio avviso la libert politica di esprimersi sulle scelte generali e dannose che si stanno compiendo nel paese
1545135 to the best of our knowledge this line of research is the first to document these relationships
1545136 our initial studies conducted during the week of the six month anniversary of 9 11 had americans read a u s senators policy on intergroup relations during this period of national challenge americans endorsed multiculturalism more as a domestic policy and assimilation more as a foreign policy
1545137 most recently we discovered that americans primed with 9 11 a foreign threat revealed higher levels of national identity than those primed with the columbine massacre a domestic threat
1545138 during a period of national challenge embracing ones national identity can be highly adaptive
1545139 the healing power of embracing ones national identity was obvious among the 78 percent of americans who indicated in 2002 that 9 11 and its aftermath has changed america for the better perhaps the greatest tragedy of all is that calamity can unite people in a way that shared humanity cannot
1545140 you never asked us how many of us there were
1545141 these figures show that northern republic of congo contains the mother lode of gorillas
1545142 it also shows that conservation in the republic of congo is working this discovery should be a rallying cry for the world that we can protect other vulnerable and endangered species whether they be gorillas in africa tigers in india or lemurs in madagascar
1545143 we knew from our own observations that there were a lot of gorillas out there but we had no idea there were so many
1545144 we hope that the results of this survey will allow us to work with the congolese government to establish and protect the new ntokou pikounda protected area
1545145 we hope that these results will speed up the classification of the ntokou pikounda zone into a protected area
1545146 at first we had no idea what it was it could have been in our solar system or at the edge of the universe
1545147 we think that in the recent past the galaxy ic 2497 hosted an enormously bright quasar
1545148 because of the vast scale of the galaxy and the voorwerp light from that past still lights up the nearby voorwerp even though the quasar shut down sometime in the past 100 000 years and the galaxys black hole itself has gone quiet
1545149 from the point of view of the voorwerp the galaxy looks as bright as it would have before the black hole turned off its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe
1545150 its rather like examining the scene of a crime where although we cant see them we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows
1545151 the strange hannys voorwerp looks like it could be the nearest example of a luminous quasar
1545152 ic 2497 is so close that if the quasar was still shining today on a good night you could probably see it with a small telescope
1545153 the nearest active quasar called 3c 273 is 1 7 billion light years further away
1545154 this discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the internet world
1545155 hannys attentiveness alerted us not only to a peculiar object but to a window into the cosmic past which might have eluded us for a long time otherwise trying to understand the processes operating here has proven to be a fascinating challenge involving a whole range of astrophysical techniques and instruments around the world and beyond this has also been some of the most rewarding astronomy ive done in years
1545156 when we launched galaxy zoo we were overwhelmed as was the internet portal initially with the outpouring of public interest and volunteer input
1545157 its amazing to think that this object has been sitting in the archives for decades and that amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online
1545158 it was a fantastic present to find out on my 25th birthday that we will get observational time on the hubble space telescope to follow up this discovery
1545159 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
1545160 we are the lower gas prices weve been waiting for
1545161 this study demonstrates how remedial instruction can use the plasticity of the human brain to gain an educational improvement
1545162 focused instruction can help underperforming brain areas to increase their proficiency
1545163 any kind of education is a matter of training the brain when poor readers are learning to read a particular brain area is not performing as well as it might and remedial instruction helps to shape that area up
1545164 this finding shows that poor readers can be helped to develop buff brains a similar approach should apply to other skills

1545178 en suma lo que se ha invertido y lo que se invertir en 2008 2009 y 2010 representa una cifra superior a los 14 mil millones de pesos
1545179 hemos reiterado nuestra total disposici n y hemos asumido nuestro compromiso de poner esto como una de las m s altas prioridades en esta lucha que en conjunto se tiene que dar contra las bandas del crimen organizado
1545180 en el informe mensual de la secretar a de hacienda al cierre del mes de junio del total autorizado usted lleva un avance del17 9 por ciento y de los subsidios y transferencias con proyectos solventados casi en su totalidad usted ha liberado s lo un 12 9 por ciento
1545181 los procedimientos son complejos y requieren muchas veces de los convenios que toma mucho tiempo el estar requisitando y cumpliendo con cada uno de ellos esto no significa que se caiga en el sub ejercicio sino que hay un registro a una determinada fecha pero cuando se alude a ste puede haberse modificado el estado de cada cap tulo de gasto
1545182 en este sentido tenemos un ejercicio del 90 por ciento pero por supuesto que nos preocupa mucho dar mayor agilidad a todos los procesos administrativos que retrasan la entrega de los recursos
1545183 overall finance approvals are now down a quarter since its peak earlier in the year
1545184 this obviously has been a key part of the reserve bank thinking
1545185 they would have had this data on hand with their decision yesterday
1545186 the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1545187 falls in approvals are on a par with previous cycles
1545188 but it is much more concentrated in purchase for established dwellings
1545189 to have a 25 per cent fall in finance approvals in five months would have them a little bit worried
1545190 the deceleration is much more abrupt than they would like
1545191 as a leading indicator of building approvals and commencements the series suggest further weakness with housing likely to detract from activity in 2008 and into 2009
1545192 the construction sector is one of the largest employers accounting for around 10 per cent of total employment with the related property amp business services accounting for 12 per cent of total employment
1545193 todays data are supportive of the rbas newly adopted easing bias
1545194 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1545195 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory
1545196 its just silly because the way people are talking about it youd think it was a bertolucci movie or something
1545197 were just recently very recently engaged so you know were just taking it easy and no big plan yet but its a good time and were just enjoying our time to be young and engaged
1545198 the afl has come in with a very generous offer
1545199 but affliction has said they will match it or beat it
1545200 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it

1545207 its the strongest showing weve had since god knows how long
1545208 the market got excited because the us federal reserve said it would hold rates where they are which is a good thing
1545209 and now of course the reserve bank here has alluded to a cut at some stage in the future
1545210 clients have been battered and are still shaking their heads a little bit dazed and hoping there are better days around the corner
1545211 if we had some sunny days ahead of us then i think they will start to pay attention again
1545212 well he has bleeding in the eye a vitreous hemorrhage with no apparent retinal detachment
1545213 i checked with a pediatric colleague and he said we have 3 4 weeks until the brain starts shutting down on his right eye so id like to schedule you for a follow up in two weeks if theres no blood in his eye we dont need to schedule a surgery
1545214 youre pretty sure he told you right away when he first noticed vision problems
1545215 uh we have some questions like is his eye still bleeding
1545216 were finding that these sorts of market conditions can have a significant impact on a persons job security which in turn drives them to seek out employment with great long term stability
1545217 were also hearing about jobseekers looking for work closer to home to counteract rising petrol prices
1545218 minister mactiernan and the port hedland port authority ceo andre bush should be congratulated for their efforts to maximise access to the inner harbour for the benefit of the state
1545219 this is a very important step forward for the alliance and confirms our position within the governments long term vision for the continued development and expansion of the port at port hedland
1545220 the alliance has already received expressions of interest from engineering companies to conduct a detailed scoping study for the port development work required for the new berths and associated infrastructure
1545221 we expect to announce the appointment of the preferred project manager shortly
1545222 this is further excellent news for communities in the pilbara as increased diversity in the iron ore industry will bring real benefits to improve the lifestyles of pilbara residents

1545224 its important that businesses dont use social media to directly try to sell their products
1545225 clearly these tools are about being authentic and not selling
1545226 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again to a living hope through the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead
1545227 wow our hope is alive the bible says that god has brought us into a living hope something that moves interacts and carries us through whatever situation or circumstance that life bring to us we have it but are we tapping into it to tap into the hope we must understand who god is he is unchanging he is eternal he is holy he is creator he is sustainer of all that he creates he is good he is all knowing he is everywhere to tap into the hope we must remember what he has done his mighty acts in history and in our own lives he delivered the children of israel out of 450 years of slavery to egypt he parted the red sea he provided food and water and clothes that never wore out for 40 years and took the wall down around jericho by walking shouting and blowing their horns now remember all that he has done for you he does all of that because he wants us to know that today is secure and eternity is ours its his promise he wants us to know that our now is his and that we can trust him through it finally hope does not disappoint romans 5 3 5 but we also glory in trubulation knowing that tribulation produces perseverance and perseverance character and character hope now hope does not disappoint because the love of god has been poured out in our hearts by the holy spirit who was given to us
1545228 all i can do is be me whoever that is
1545229 remote viewer 001 of the military intelligence project stargate that researched and implemented a specific esp protocol called
1545230 few realize the extent to which the government will go to use paranormal abilities in solving problems with critical national implications we want to demonstrate this reality in authentic settings
1545231 the interesting developments going on in physics lately have brought us to where science fact is outstripping science fiction wormholes and warp drives quantum entanglement and teleportation multidimensional universes these are now standard fare in mainstream science journals
1545232 based on this phenomena that would have seemed outrageous even just a decade or two ago cannot now be rejected out of hand without careful scrutiny the playing field of reality has expanded
1545233 having people like joe mcmoneagle and hal puthoff involved in the development of the series helps to place the show in a context of realism that many episodic shows dealing with anomolous phenomena often lack
1545234 we feel it is important to strike a balance between challenging the audience with story questions while at the same time avoiding audience frustration which can sometimes set in when questions outweigh answers
1545235 it is important to give the audience a payoff when they are tuned in to the stories you are telling
1545236 one challenge for any contemporary series is to balance the more episodic oriented shows with those shows dealing with a longer term plot arc we want to satisfy both types of viewers and sometimes that is difficult to do
1545237 however by focusing on longer term plot elements that viewers are aware of in the real world it becomes much easier to tune in to an individual episode and understand what is going on despite the fact it may be a longer term plot arc
1545238 we envision a series that includes elements of several very successful programs yet is a distinctly new concept in the way these ideas are brought together
1545239 the series concept combines an exciting synergy involving u s military and intelligence people who show themselves to be very human with emerging and mysterious phenomena that fascinate millions of people around the world

1545251 id been a half hour late to one shift after being on time for a year then i was fired because i talked about my final warning with another worker
1545252 for every person i talked to about my firing i heard another story about someone they work with

1545260 if you looked at the information landscape prior to the internet it was manageable
1545261 but with the explosion of content you had a fire hose of data that is hard to digest and people needed a way to filter it
1545262 i call on yahoo to immediately appoint a third party to review and then report back to shareholders exactly how all the 1 4 billion shares outstanding on the june 3rd record date were voted during this election if the results truly indicate that this board was re elected shareholders can and will accept that but yahoo shareholders expect and deserve to know exactly how their shares were voted with accurate numbers
1545263 if capital researchs gordy crawford didnt complain would there be a review of the vote yahoo had five days of press that said the board had all sorts of support its a big big mistake
1545264 im in the business of taking a young man and building him into a responsible young man and obviously i feel like ive failed in this situation brooks said
1545265 sometimes for the better good of the whole some parts have to be sacrificed
1545266 there is basically a little more as i delved into it than i was aware of at the time brooks said
1545267 shock to hartline who will likely be the starter when the wildcats open the season at louisville on aug 31
1545268 i knew he was going to get in some playing time troubles hartline said
1545269 but in the end its all about what you have and how you plan to move on since hes not on our team anymore its tragic and everybody wants him on our team but we cant really dwell on it
1545270 i had hoped this wouldnt be the way that the starting quarterback would be named brooks said
1545271 i would have rather have done it on the field and without controversy

1545273 when you recruit a kid you get all these expectations of curtis being a great player and he is a great player we just never saw it at kentucky phillips said
1545274 curtis had improved it wasnt as bad as it was the year he lost his job to andre phillips said
1545275 we just thought that mike was the guy that was leading the guys the right way curtis was better but mike was ahead of him in the area as far as leading
1545276 id like to think we try to keep a fairly high standard here brooks said
1545277 i want to continue that but it still breaks my heart any time something like that happens
1545278 having golf an olympic sport is exponentially more important to the game of golf than the majors mickelson said tuesday from the site of the seasons final major the pga championship at oakland hills
1545279 the reason for that is it would bring in 168 different countries and their olympic foundation and all those revenues and that would be going towards the growth of the game
1545280 the majors are incredibly big as we know but we still capture the same audience that is already interested in the game he said
1545281 its for growing the game around the world and something we can all do together finchem said at the time
1545282 the value for the players is that the more people that play around the world the more people will be watching theyll be paid back eventually

1545303 you didnt have to do that much to feel financially secure in those communities today that is no longer the case the challenge is learning new ways to do more with less

1545305 you can get the internet here in rural places you can run your home based business
1545306 thats less than half of 1 of whats spent on farm programs annually
1545307 if policy is based on this assumption that rural is really about agriculture then the vast majority of rural america is left out
1545308 does that matter yes because it influences decision making in washington and its not very transparent to the american public generally
1545309 i cant imagine anyone gaining influence through working on a political convention
1545310 there has been no overlap for me whatsoever between my work for the host committee and my lobbying work

1545317 i would venture to say that if the management of the embassy and of the state departments iraq operation were judged by rules that govern business judgment and asset waste in the private sector the delays indecision and reorganizations over the past year would be considered willfully negligent if not criminal in light of the nations sacrifice what we have seen this past year in the embassy is incomprehensible most notable there is a near complete lack of strategic forethought or synchronization between embassy staffing and program initiatives and funding this is also true of prts only the military takes seriously the joint campaign and its metrics of achievement while state department leaders use it only when advantageous

1545356 after one president in the pocket of the oil companies we cant afford another
1545357 remember that when george bush took office he had an energy policy he turned to dick cheney and he told cheney go take care of this
1545358 obama told a crowd at a gym in youngstown ohio
1545359 john mccains taking a page out of the bush cheney playbook
1545360 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it senator obama voted for it
1545361 people care not only what you say but how you vote
1545362 his schedule hasnt been set for next week let alone next month
1545363 americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened
1545364 what gives you the right to make comments like that youre not published youre not a publisher
1545365 you know what this reminds me of the last three times lawrence tried starting trouble and hiding behind an alt and then started a thread on shocklines claiming he wasnt the alt after hed been found out
1545366 i cant believe the hostility and nastiness of the posts i deleted here while a couple of you being assholes was par for the course it was particularly disappointing to see others of you again diving in for no reason other than to humiliate or insult someone it makes me ill ive already banned one of you until he she can promise to behave like a mature adult but consider this a warning to anyone else the next post i see from any of you that are made on here that serves no other purpose than to insult someone or make them feel like shit gets you banned case closed take it elsewhere
1545367 of course it would be better if no one felt the need to set up blogs just for the purpose of making fun of other people i often look at those blogs and wonder how grown adults can somehow manage to reduce themselves to the antics of particularly immature 12 year olds but theres certainly nothing more immature about this blog than of the blogs its making fun of
1545368 otherwise you are being led on by the people whose books you normally buy

1545371 its a sluggish economy and its difficulties are felt all over
1545372 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook
1545373 consumer spending makes up 70 percent of gross domestic product and when one group accounts for a very substantial share of consumer spending they also account for a large share of the economic activity that creates jobs

1545378 people are examining do you keep the yacht do you go to the classic car auction do you take the private jet
1545379 those sound like nice problems to have but at the same time they are issues
1545380 the high end buyers out there are maybe more selective now but im willing to wait out the storm
1545381 yeah its about time they found out what its like
1545382 the problem is that when the wealthy get stingy it trickles down to the rest of us

1545386 the twelve tribes is up there with a textbook cult
1545387 they can dismiss me as a disgruntled former member but ive seen what goes on
1545388 if you dont tow the line you get cut off from your family
1545389 i have all three kids now because i demanded that when i left but their mother hasnt spoken to them for six years
1545390 you are not paid wages super or any workers compensation you work long hours six days per week sometimes doing dangerous work youre not qualified to do
1545391 they dont want to expose children to anything outside of the cult they dont get taught critical analysis and are disciplined for using their imagination
1545392 their child discipline manual is not handed out anymore but they still tell you how to follow it
1545393 the manual says stripes or marks from disciplining shows love the stripes are from hitting with a bamboo stick that leaves welts
1545394 i saw that going on in picton at the time
1545395 they are there to prey on vulnerable people and thats why they are in katoomba
1545396 i was hearing negative things about the twelve tribes around town and the only way to find out about it was to spend time there
1545397 im mightily impressed i intend to stay and im very open to the idea of joining
1545398 the kids here are happy and well adjusted i feel so at home and cared for
1545399 speaking for myself it is an incredibly worthwhile life and cause
1545400 as a high school teacher for 15 years and a widely travelled cultural explorer i am yet to see a better example than the twelve tribes community anywhere in the world
1545401 as far as im concerned people who join put in everything they make a commitment to the life they choose to do it
1545402 you get provided for all your needs you are told all this before you join they wont let me do it unless i understand what is involved

1545405 but residents must remain vigilant about maintaining their properties all year and not wait till the winds start blowing

1545410 limited number of economic measures available to gauge the financial sustainability of councils
1545411 the review of the infrastructure backlog at blue mountains city council was distorted because of the way in which the councils financial data was accounted for in the 2006 07 statements some other councils have adopted a less demanding approach in identifying a gap between the standard of current infrastructure and what would be considered a satisfactory level rather than an ideal standard
1545412 whereas blue mountains city council has been quite tough on itself in the process that is used to identify the gap between the current standard of infrastructure in the city and the ideal standard of our infrastructure
1545413 council has been acutely aware of the financial challenges it faces for some time now and has clearly communicated these financial challenges and planned responses to the community
1545414 weve always just said to him go and enjoy it and be the best you can be

1545417 its key that people know where our leaders stand stephane dion is the only one making this effort to get out and ask us all what kind of canada we want and how best to cope with the problems which need urgent solutions im encouraging everyone liberal supporters or critics to come and make up their own minds
1545418 dion has won the admiration of people across the country for meeting real voters face to face
1545419 hes not afraid of the tough questions we should all be asking of our politicians now that the economys turned sour and the federal government seems to be drifting this is a chance for everyone in the region to get out and make their voices heard so policy in ottawa can better mirror public wishes

1545446 we have still seen thousands of our families lose their homes and no state has been hit harder by the broader effects of the lending crisis wall streets woes have helped to drive new york into recession
1545447 we have the responsibility to protect new yorks families who are facing foreclosure and we need to reform banking regulations to ensure this does not happen again this law does both and spurred the federal government to do the same
1545448 this legislation successfully balances the need to help families who are facing foreclosure of their mortgages and the loss of their homes with concerns raised by the banking industry about protecting the ability of lenders to provide mortgages to future homeowners i applaud my colleagues particularly senator frank padavan and senator hugh farley who worked tirelessly to resolve this complicated issue i also want to thank governor paterson for his leadership in this matter and for signing this bill into law
1545449 by signing this legislation governor paterson and new york state take crucial action to address the national nightmare caused by the unethical practices of the mortgage industry through direct financial assistance and counseling and legal services our state will take the lead in preserving our communities and providing meaningful relief to thousands of new yorkers struggling to keep their homes we must remain committed to assisting those affected by subprime lending while preventing further abuses of homeowners
1545450 the subprime lending crisis has affected all new yorkers in some way or another we the senate democrats have held forums throughout the state pairing lenders with homeowners to help save homes in signing this legislation governor paterson ensures that all new yorkers will have a second chance at saving their homes the governors action will provide immediate help by stopping foreclosures and closing loopholes so this will never happen again
1545451 as we face difficult economic times governor patersons approval of this legislation is important for all new yorkers the bill strengthens mortgage lending rules helping homeowners and legitimate lenders and can lead to more stable neighborhoods it is an excellent example of the good results which come from the governor and the legislature working together just as i enjoyed working closely with governor paterson in developing this law i know that this type of cooperation will enable us to solve the many problems facing our state
1545452 subprime lending schemes have wrought havoc in communities throughout new york as hardworking residents have lost or are at risk of losing their homes by signing this legislation governor paterson takes an important step in addressing the crisis by providing assistance to homeowners affected by unscrupulous lending while putting in place safeguards to prevent against future abuses today new york leads the way in tackling this urgent national crisis
1545453 this comprehensive new law will provide vital relief and assistance for at risk homeowners throughout new york to help overcome an impending foreclosure on their home the enactment of this new law today once again reflects the strong commitment at all levels of state government to provide the legislative initiatives and tools to help halt the rise of home foreclosure in all reaches of our state i applaud governor paterson for working with the state legislature in advancing this important new law that will help protect and strengthen the dream of homeownership in new york
1545454 this is a broad comprehensive piece of legislation that both helps existing borrowers facing foreclosure and establishes strong underwriting standards and duties of care going forward to assure that this type of mortgage crisis doesnt happen again protecting borrowers lenders and investors this legislation which is one of the strongest in the nation builds on and complements our existing wide ranging efforts on multiple fronts including homeownership counseling enhanced enforcement and bringing borrowers and lenders face to face in an effort to avoid unnecessary foreclosures
1545455 this new law will undoubtedly help the tens of thousands of new yorkers who face losing their home to foreclosure and contains measures to help make sure this crisis does not happen again the governor and the legislature should be commended for their work on this issue and for making sure that one of the most valuable financial assets most people have their home is protected now and in the future

1545461 the cartoonist backed by a raft of fellow satirists writers and artists fiercely denies the latest accusation of anti semitism and is suing a fellow journalist for defamation for making the charge
1545462 the cartoonist was convicted of inciting racial hatred in 1985 over remarks made in 1982 after an attack in paris historic jewish quarter
1545463 i am anti semitic and i am no longer afraid to say so i want every jew to live in fear except if they are pro palestinian let them die
1545464 the satirical weekly made headlines in 2006 for re printing cartoons of the prophet mohammed which sparked a wave of violent protests around the world as well as an irreverent cartoon of its own
1545465 it later won a defamation suit brought by french muslim groups in a trial seen as a test case for freedom of expression and over which it received the support of the french media and political establishment
1545466 while free speech hurts and offends there is nothing wrong in this in almost no case is anyone entitled to restitution or protection the strictly limited exceptions are where there is clear and present danger incitement to crime or defamation by defamation i naturally mean a statement that is damaging and false i do not mean as one reader of this blog has rueful cause to recollect a statement that is damaging and true there is no speech more disreputable and fraudulent than holocaust denial but the reason its objectionable is that its false not that its offensive the only proper recourse to it is the discipline of historical scholarship and critical inquiry as opposed to the fakery practised by irving

1545487 we have to drill here and we have to drill now
1545488 the economy has been a sea of bad news for republicans and this is the first island of hope theyve found in a long time
1545489 i dont think the public view is we can solely drill our way out of this but clearly the republicans believe that they have a political advantage on this and they are determined to exploit it for all its worth
1545490 the question of offshore drilling along with expanded domestic energy production has suddenly become the biggest political and economic wedge issue of this election
1545491 there is some evidence to suggest that some poll numbers were moved by that because it is something tangible that non expert voters can see and appreciate
1545492 unless companies eliminate all hazardous chemicals from their waste products e waste dumping will continue to contaminate the environment and workers including young children will be exposed
1545493 native forest logging is the rudd governments biggest blind spot in tackling climate change it is three times worse for climate change than previous assessments estimated 640 units of carbon not 217 and in tall eucalypt forests like those of victorias central highlands or tasmanias styx weld and florentine valleys it is 10 times worse over 2 000 units of carbon
1545494 the rudd government should be leading the charge in copenhagen to ensure the green carbon in the natural forests of both developed and developing countries are recognised and protected

1545501 our job is to try and fulfil all the promise weve got in the squad because with everyone fit weve got a strong group of players
1545502 theres still some work to do but im really looking forward to the start of the season we might not do as well as we think we can but thats the fascination of a season
1545503 its a very tough league but were optimistic and at this stage the fans should be as well theres no reason why we cant have our dreams
1545504 i dont see why not the core of the team is still the same of course we had a little thing with cristiano ronaldo this summer but we have a good squad of players
1545505 during the season we are bound to suffer setbacks every team does
1545506 there will be injuries loss of form red cards and clearly we need luck at crucial times as well but hopefully we will end up in the right place
1545507 in the last three or four years it has been chelsea and manchester united going for the title
1545508 but liverpool won the champions league then lost the final a couple of years later arsenal have been in it as well
1545509 you can see from our results in europe how much quality there is in the premier league so i expect us all to be quite close to each other
1545510 a lot of people say that i should have gone to united instead but i had already had two meetings with juventus before united came in

1545537 all names which in the scriptures are applied to christ by virtue of which it is established that he is over the church all the same names are applied to the pope
1545538 the pope and god are the same so he has all power in heaven and earth
1545539 the pope takes the place of jesus christ on earth by divine right the pope has supreme and full power in faith in morals over each and every pastor and his flock he is the true vicar the head of the entire church the father and teacher of all christians he is the infallible ruler the founder of dogmas the author of and the judge of councils the universal ruler of truth the arbiter of the world the supreme judge of heaven and earth the judge of all being judged by no one god himself on earth
1545540 to believe that our lord god the pope has not the power to decree as he is decreed is to be deemed heretical
1545541 it is quite certain that popes have never approved or rejected this title lord god the pope for the passage in the gloss referred to appears in the edition of the canon law published in rome in 1580 by gregory xiii
1545542 the pope and god are the same so he has all power in heaven and earth
1545543 the appellation of god had been confirmed by constantine on the pope who being god cannot be judged by man
1545544 the pope is not only the representative of jesus christ he is jesus christ himself hidden under the veil of flesh
1545545 we hold upon this earth the place of god almighty

1545571 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
1545572 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
1545573 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
1545574 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
1545575 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
1545576 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
1545577 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally

1545605 but i wont be taking any calls from the nzru over the next couple of days
1545606 however if we are not part of it it will have a significant detrimental effect on rugby in the region
1545607 whether we are one of two unions after this they are going to lose a lot of talent because the talent wont want to stay to play just heartland rugby and it will perpetuate a vicious cycle
1545608 i guess there is that little bit of fear we will be dropped we are just trying to be positive and hoping like everyone else that we will be part of the 12
1545609 everyone can beat everyone on the day and its certainly making it really enthralling there are some really good match ups and its really fantastic for the game

1545615 i thought the provincial unions were working together in terms of looking at the air new zealand cup review and here we are hearing about nine unions wanting to go it alone in a competition that will see the demise of the franchises which is not in the interests of tasman thats for sure
1545616 im only hearing through the media that tasman doesnt have a place in the air new zealand cup in 2009 i havent heard that confirmed one way or the other by the new zealand rugby union so whether its media speculation or people reading into the comments of nzru chief executive steve tew as far as im concerned the decision hasnt been made
1545617 go back and spit some numbers out so that we can get a better idea of some of our costs outside of the competition
1545618 i felt a combination of joy relief and satisfaction in holding up the rugby world cup in 1987
1545619 its hard not to be nostalgic for the stand and especially the changing rooms because they carry so many great memories

1545621 new zealand needs at least one larger stadium and auckland is the right place for it
1545622 having eden park in the middle of a residential area has its problems not least parking but with good public transport that is manageable
1545623 to be honest a lot of people look at the park and dont have that emotional attachment because theyre not aucklanders or for other reasons
1545624 but at the same time you look at that patch where david kirk stood and its the only time we picked up the world cup
1545625 its one bit of the park thats actually disappearing it makes you think a bit more about how the new park could lay claim to the same thing

1545634 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1545635 if there is a subtle shift in the feds risk assessment it is that while acknowledging the downside risks to growth it notes the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern

1545707 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
1545708 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
1545709 i dont believe in momentum so much but i tell you what the confidence could lead to some momentum
1545710 seeing how happy my guys were to me thats the most important part because 10 points at the end of the day is great thats wonderful but i think the championship is probably going to be settled by more than that and i feel like my guys having that little step in their walk is good
1545711 i think it could be for certain teams but not ours
1545712 carl and i i dont know what the perception is but we argue on a regular basis its not out of the ordinary for us to argue we get mad at each other we walk away and then we walk back together and calmer heads prevail and we have a discussion we might argue again on the same subject and walk away and come back together but through the arguments and through the discussions and through the handshakes and the hugs we come to terms with what we want to do and when we want to do it and 99 percent of the time it works out for us
1545713 ill look at carl and ill say this and he may slap me and he can if he wants but he wasnt ready to win a championship i think until this year
1545714 i think this year he can go head to head with jimmie johnson or tony stewart or with anybody else thats there and i think he can close the deal
1545715 the championship ultimately winds up normally being determined by how well you do when things go bad when you have to say my cars not right
1545716 unless youve got that maturity of wisdom and presence and experience being able to win a lot of races is not going to do it because when things go bad youre going to disintegrate carls going to be ready to do that this year and im real confident
1545717 this is the 10th blog post since our new web site launched in early september and we still dont have any comments sad i know

1545719 that is not to say that museums are moving fast enough in the online world they arent but i firmly believe that sensible museums are both experimenting and ensuring that their online activities expand and extend their missions
1545720 a web application that combines data from more than one source to create a new tool
1545721 it is a web application that combines data from more than one source into a single integrated tool there by creating a new and distinct web service that was not originally envisaged by either source
1545722 unsure whether to celebrate its power to the people authenticity or mourn the end of quality and professionalism
1545723 according to a 2001 aam survey on public trust of various sources of information museums are the most trusted source of information ahead of books and television news museums are viewed as providers of independent and objective information
1545724 shift in the emphasis from the internet as a collection of pages to the internet as connections between people
1545725 learning is more likely when museums work with visitors to develop an approach that has realistic overlap with the audiences behavior attitude and expectations macarthur citing bitgood serrell amp thompson 2007 para 9 to do this we must allow visitors to be active participants from the beginning of the interpretive process not just passive recipients at the end

1545729 the redesigned pulseaudio automatically adjusts the way it feeds audio data to accommodate system load and ensure the audio data is always ready when needed

1545758 being able to provide great content like the barclays premier league matches completely quota free means our customers can now get more value out of their monthly quota
1545759 if you look at it from foxtels point of view they dont really care about how their content gets to the customer particularly if you have customers in areas like sydney with a lot of high density dwellings where customers cant get foxtel at all but they can get broadband and that is a market of maybe a million households that could potentially get the full range of foxtel content via their broadband connection
1545760 while you could watch it at 512kbps id say it would be a very uncomfortable experience realistically you want 1 5mbps or better
1545761 particularly with the time difference the barclays premier league offering through iinet is perfect for fans wishing to stay in touch with the season as it unfolds around the clock

1545768 i think riggs did a great job and im proud of what tony did he had a great qualifying run 18th this week
1545769 weve got a lot of evaluating to do over there right now
1545770 thats the hard part you know theres going to be some good people that have to go
1545771 its easy to let your emotions get caught up in making decisions
1545772 its tough because there are people you know and have relationships with but you have to sit down as a group and evaluate it together the hard thing about this is trying to figure out whats exactly the right thing to do
1545773 i had to do this with one of my best friends when i let danny lasoski go from our world of outlaws team
1545774 it wasnt easy but you have to think about whats best for the whole organization
1545775 im still worried about what im doing in my car too

1545778 ive had many nightmares about turn 1 at watkins glen
1545779 it was a really frustrating race but i dont know if we were going to win because tony stewart was a little better than us
1545780 i was pushing to stay ahead of him and i just pushed too hard
1545781 we went to road atlanta last week and i felt like we had a promising test
1545782 i feel like we learned some things that will gain us a little speed here
1545783 i love racing at watkins glen its fast and its a track that suits our cars very very well
1545784 i really enjoy where i am in the sport and am comfortable with how things are going

1545786 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
1545787 my deal was i felt like you left it to me a little bit
1545788 and then what got me was jimmie johnson theyd committed to coming so i was like well well go ahead and come but if bob would have said stay out thats what we would have done but i think we were both about 51 percent on the come in side and neither one of us were going to argue but the argument came when it started raining real hard then we were trying to blame one another for the idea of coming he said it was my idea and i really felt like it was his idea so thats where the argument came
1545789 we can be brutally honest with one another and thats really valuable
1545790 theres no beating around the bush if bob feels a certain way about something he tells me and i tell him and to me thats really valuable
1545791 carl and i i dont know what the perception is but we argue on a regular basis
1545792 yes sometimes it doesnt and when it doesnt we say ok we argued through it
1545793 ill look at carl and ill say this and he may slap me and he can if he wants but he wasnt ready to win a championship i think until this year
1545794 i think this year he can go head to head with jimmie johnson or tony stewart or with anybody else thats there and i think he can close the deal
1545795 matt kenseth and robbie reiser did a great job and matts doing a great job with chip bolin right now they and carl and bob are in the same place with the best of the best and unless youve got that maturity of wisdom and presence and experience gives you that within the organization and having a lot of speed in the car being able to win a lot of races is not going to do it because when things go bad youre going to disintegrate and carls going to be ready to do that this year and im real confident

1545840 but it is a logical way to get there you dont have to fight the traffic you dont have to sit in that massive traffic jam down on fall creek parkway trying to find a parking place and it is a novel thing to do
1545841 we dont know how it will affect us but were certainly hopeful that people will decide to come out and we think that we have some enticing offers for folks
1545842 so we think that if people really plan accordingly and maybe are a little disciplined especially in the food choices that theyll be able to have a real economical and yet great visit to the state fair

1545860 mangroves are carbon factories measurements suggest that mangroves may have the highest net productivity of carbon of any natural ecosystem about a hundred pounds per acre per day
1545861 assuming that only half of this will become oxidized over a period of 10 years we are looking at the return of 70 tons of carbon per hectare per year for ten years to the atmosphere
1545862 picture this woman who is very tiny and ask yourself how she engaged in armed conflict with six military men
1545863 its not plausible its not credible and theres nothing to support it
1545864 despite being shot siddiqui struggled with the officers when they tried to subdue her she struck and kicked them while shouting in english that she wanted to kill americans
1545865 what a mockery that after five years in detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
1545866 aafia was tortured for five years until one day us authorities announce that they have found her in afghanistan
1545867 shes very traumatized very fragile she doesnt know where her children are
1545868 theyve got test ranges in iran which are more than long enough to handle scud launches and even shahab 3 launches
1545869 why would they be launching from the surface of the caspian sea they obviously have not explained that to us
1545870 detonated the warhead near apogee not over the target area where the thing would eventually land but at altitude
1545871 the only plausible explanation we can find is that the iranians are figuring out how to launch a missile from a ship and get it up to altitude and then detonate it
1545872 and thats exactly what you would do if you had a nuclear weapon on a scud or a shahab 3 or other missile and you wanted to explode it over the united states
1545873 there are worrying signs appearing in the united states where some locals are beginning to hoard supplies
1545874 were told that the feds bought the entire container of canned butter when it hit the california docks somethings up
1545875 the government just came in and said theyre buying it they did pay for it
1545876 they took it and no one else could have it
1545877 we dont know why the feds then went to freeze dried companies and bought most of their canned stock
1545878 reaching agreement with the palestinians during the time he has left
1545879 we decided today that we are going to continue pursuing to reach an agreement before the end of the year
1545880 this government has reached an end and it doesnt matter who heads kadima they are all partners in this governments total failure
1545881 what horrifies me most are not radicals cheering terrorist samir kuntar but that most relative moderates feel compelled to do so at the airport to greet him were leaders of lebanons anti syrian anti iranian druze and christian groups as well as the ambassadors from egypt jordan the uae and morocco to avoid being discredited relative moderates must affirm that anyone who murders israeli children is a hero
1545882 in just a few months israel will be stronger and better prepared in its defenses against long range missiles
1545883 we view this as a serious and drastic move toward the fruition of extremist organizations to establish a temple in place of al aksa mosque
1545884 students in higher education are the future leaders of their communities yet significant numbers of them appear to hold beliefs which contravene liberal democratic values in addition there are signs of growing religious segregation on campus these results are deeply embarrassing for those who have said that there is no extremism in british universities
1545885 watch what you do because i know if you are lying
1545886 you can get gps technology when you are in a golf cart playing on a golf court but we are not utilizing gps technology to protect our children theres something seriously wrong here
1545887 i think if they knew that we have almost a thousand sexual predators where we have no idea where they are at we cant find them in pennsylvania they would be outraged
1545888 a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and timing of ones children
1545889 it seems that nothing not rising energy prices not sanctions aimed at its more unsavory business partners not even the prospect of a nuclear iran can curb its thirst for oil
1545890 of course i do but that doesnt mean that i cant be sad it would be unhealthy for me to not be

1545897 you know i was thinking of buying one of those really small cars i mean they probably do like 50 miles per gallon
1545898 you know i was thinking of lowering our military size you know to save money and put some of that money into education

1545901 he basically is not in the right mind set to play here because of all the things that went on
1545902 the football team has moved forward the train has left the station
1545903 he needs to jump on the train or if we cant get past all the things that have happened i have to keep the train moving he respects that he understands that
1545904 we talked about everything that has happened since this whole process has started we rehashed all the different things that went on we agreed we disagreed
1545905 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1545906 my view has been all along and it remains that the fed is going to be on hold for a good deal of time
1545907 we believe that the fed will be in a position to hold rates steady well into 2009
1545908 the committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain
1545909 my view is that unemployment is going to go to 6 5 percent and that will be new information for the fed that will force them to keep rates unchanged for the next 12 months
1545910 amid the aspirations and well wishes of the people of the entire city it will complete its harmonious journey welcoming the grand opening of the games
1545911 we havent started the season well at all its disappointing that we havent reached any sort of level we havent reached the right level so far this season
1545912 i think everyone who is involved with the club is extremely disappointed at what has happened so far
1545913 its a reasonable excuse to use that the effects of last season are still with the players but i dont think it is a relevant one
1545914 it seems fairly ridiculous that you can reach a european final and then get knocked out at the first game of the next season but thats the way it has happened
1545915 if it had been last season and you lose out in the first game because it is a new team that has been put together then fine you would have said to yourself that it was something you could have expected
1545916 but we have been a year into it now and we are a reasonably experienced team and we never really handled either game particularly well
1545917 i have heard many stories of failed access to services because of language issues
1545918 because no translators were provided the mans son was left with no choice but to try to interpret the consent form himself and it was sadly misinterpreted
1545919 her english proficiency was limited and the necessity of taking her medication was never explained to her thankfully she filed a lawsuit for wrongful imprisonment and won
1545920 these stories are not uncommon to asian american and pacific islanders and other minority communities in fact as appalling as these seem many of our families face this reality daily
1545921 more than a third of our population is limited in english proficient and a majority are foreign born
1545922 at a time when language is a proxy for culture we emphasize that learning english does not come at the expense of our identity or heritage
1545923 picture this woman who is very tiny and ask yourself how she engaged in armed conflict with six military men
1545924 its not plausible its not credible and theres nothing to support it
1545925 despite being shot siddiqui struggled with the officers when they tried to subdue her she struck and kicked them while shouting in english that she wanted to kill americans
1545926 what a mockery that after five years in detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
1545927 aafia was tortured for five years until one day us authorities announce that they have found her in afghanistan
1545928 shes very traumatized very fragile she doesnt know where her children are
1545929 all decisions and orders of the international court of justice must be respected by states
1545930 the united states should take every step to make sure the execution does not take place
1545931 we have an indisputable international law obligation that conflicts with state law
1545932 the supreme court has ruled the president has neither the constitutional power nor the legislative authority to overturn the state rules
1545933 should texas execute mr medellin before congress has a reasonable opportunity to convert the icj judgment into a justifiable federal right the state of texas will forever deprive mr medellin of his constitutionally protected right not to be deprived of his life without a due process of law
1545934 even president bush who signed scores of death warrants as texas governor concurred some time ago that the united states must honor its international obligations in this case
1545935 there will be no clearer sign that texas will have gone beyond the pale than if jose medellins execution goes forward

1545942 the rest of the world revolves around ball movement and continuity espn color analyst fran fraschilla said during tuesdays telecast
1545943 my problem with the schedule change is that money bought tradition in the sport
1545944 whether the finals are in the morning or the afternoon doesnt really matter to us our performance weve done everything we need to do to be prepared for that but i think in this day and age loyalty is very lacking in sport and i think that often money talks too loudly
1545945 and i think that after their trials theyre probably well im sure theyre the favorites in the mens 400 meter freestyle relay
1545946 we just enjoy competing against the australians because they just seem to be our natural rivals
1545947 when we have a chance to race them we always seem to just relish in it i think part of that has to do with how swimming is viewed in australia which for us were a little bit jealous of swimming getting that much attention
1545948 i like to think that i always tend to find a little bit more up my sleeve every time i swim and i think thats what got me to where i am today
1545949 i have no say in that its just whenever they feel im ready

1545994 i have seen many men are afraid of commitment of getting married
1545995 i know and this is nature of man man loves the unknown while woman loves the known man likes to discover and woman feels happy with the discovered
1545996 to be honest i am not but i was waiting for the girl i can fall in love with from very first sight
1545997 listen man i will be honest with you if you go ahead with her knowing your condition this relationship will not be based on honesty if you tell her the truth she may not leave but that might be out of sympathy not love it is hard to say anything but i might have stopped the contact with her at once but again this is something only you can decide no one else will decide it for you

1546006 this study provides the first indication that mindfulness meditation stress management training can have a direct impact on slowing hiv disease progression
1546007 the mindfulness program is a group based and low cost treatment and if this initial finding is replicated in larger samples its possible that such training can be used as a powerful complementary treatment for hiv disease alongside medications
1546008 the more mindfulness meditation classes people attended the higher the cd4 t cells at the studys conclusion
1546009 given the stress reduction benefits of mindfulness meditation training these findings indicate there can be health protective effects not just in people with hiv but in folks who suffer from daily stress

1546074 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction
1546075 our research shows the rough has become less of a challenge for the highly skilled pro and driving accuracy is now less of a key factor for success
1546076 we believe these changes will increase the challenge of the game at the tour level while having a very small effect on the play of most golfers
1546077 they cant keep making courses longer and they cant keep us from hitting the ball far so if you can limit the amount of spin on the ball and make guys play from the fairway thats probably a good avenue
1546078 because i feel like it will be more challenging for a player to judge shots out of the rough is the ball going to spin how is it going to come out i like that challenge and feel like it gives me a better chance

1546136 perchlorates will tell us quite a bit about the history of water
1546137 not just at the phoenix site but in other parts of mars
1546138 its a very effective agent for soaking up water like a silica gel packet
1546139 when its very wet it forms a sticky substance at very low temperature like antifreeze
1546140 there are microbes that live on the energy contained by this oxidant
1546141 in itself it is neither good nor bad for life
1546142 there were reports over the weekend that indicated that nasa had a major discovery that nasa was withholding from the public todays teleconference is going to set the record straight
1546143 we have substantial evidence that our soil samples has perchlorates
1546144 they are highly stable and do not destroy life under normal conditions in fact there are microbes that live on the energy contained by this oxidant in itself it is neither good nor bad for life
1546145 we dont know what mixture of perchlorate salts we have in our solution sodium perchlorate ammonium perchlorate magnesium perchlorate lets take magnesium perchlorate its a very effective agent for soaking up water like silica gel packet when its very wet it forms a sticky substance at very low temperature like antifreeze weve only begun to think about what this might mean but they could keep a lot of graduate students busy for a long time
1546146 its a stable molecule and it doesnt preclude life on earth in fact it could be an energy source
1546147 there were some initial reports in the the scientific literature that the atacama was very mars like they couldnt find organics or culture microbes but as research continued we found organics and then when we looked closer we found microbes so it turned around microbes can exist quite happily in oxidizing conditions and the story could be the same for mars we dont know for sure
1546148 the other probes had different focuses than the meca wet chem which is looking for soluble salt and perchlorate is a very soluble salt
1546149 because perchlorates are chemically inert they move through the soil very quickly in the presence of water this ties back to mars perchlorates will tell us quite a bit about the history of water not just at the phoenix site but in other parts of mars
1546150 nasa is investigating whether the substance could have gotten there by contamination before launch
1546151 even the scientists admitted to having to hit the textbooks on how it works perhaps the most intriguing suggestion was that magnesium perchlorate can act as a sort of anti freeze in the presence of water

1546156 but one thing i was looking for out of that conversation was is he ready and committed to play football for the green bay packers and his answer frankly throughout the conversation was his mind set based on the things that have happened throughout this whole course was thats not where he was he wasnt in the right mind set to play here
1546157 they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 percent committed
1546158 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it
1546159 weve got great fans i hope i can win them over
1546160 all i can control is how i practice i just know we were at practice today and he wasnt there and im the starter
1546161 the fact was he was not in the proper mind set moving forward to be part of the football team we talked about competing for the starting quarterback position but we really didnt get much into it because we kept talking about all the things that happened
1546162 im coaching the football team the football team is moving forward the train has left the station use any analogy you want he needs to jump on the train or if he cant get past all the things that have happened i have to keep the train moving its emotional for him very personal i dont want to speak for brett i respect the way he feels hes in a tough spot the path to get to where we are has done some damage
1546163 its not our business to know his legacy is what his legacy was he holds numerous records hell always be in the hearts of green bay packers fans if he moves on
1546164 we believe the commercial is exceptional and hits the mark for secret obsession
1546165 we meet at a moment when this country is facing a set of challenges greater than any that we have seen in generations and for too long our leaders in washington have been unable or unwilling to do anything about it
1546166 we should sell 70 million barrels of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve for less expensive crude which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks
1546167 we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves
1546168 tapping the strategic oil reserve is not a substitute for a real plan to increase supply through additional drilling and nuclear power the strategic oil reserve exists for americas national security strategy not barack obamas election strategy
1546169 the last release of oil from the strategic reserve came in response to hurricane katrina but the only crisis that has developed since barack obama last rejected this idea 28 days ago is a slide in his poll numbers
1546170 as more economic quackery history shows it only decreases production at home and only makes us more dependent on foreign oil
1546171 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1546172 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets
1546173 barack obamas latest attack ads shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy
1546174 after all it was senator obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
1546175 given their checkered past and the difficulty that they had in getting to this point the bungling of the hatfill part of the investigation leads me to be very skeptical
1546176 ive been completely left out with regard to any understanding of the progress of the investigation or what these latest developments may mean
1546177 the labs were not equipped for instance with a lot of the equipment that would have been required to supposedly dry this material down and create the highly refined state that it was in
1546178 he seemed quite conversant and he was his old self
1546179 those of us who have known bruce have never seen that side of him
1546180 up to 40 of patients beginning antiretroviral therapy in this region have concurrent tuberculosis
1546181 patients starting nevirapine with concurrent tuberculosis were at higher risk of elevated viral load most notably at 6 months 16 3 than those without tuberculosis 8 3
1546182 patients starting nevirapine with concurrent tuberculosis developed virologic failure sooner adjusted hazard ratio 2 2 there were no differences between patients starting efavirenz with and without concurrent tuberculosis
1546183 the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket
1546184 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1546185 that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1546186 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1546187 now if youll excuse me i have to pick out a vice president
1546188 im thinking rihanna ill see you at the white house oh and i might paint it pink i hope thats cool with you guys
1546189 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1546190 older women would come up and ask me why arent you voting for a woman
1546191 im not voting for her because i dont agree with her views
1546192 creating a new system that promotes women at any stage of their lives with men right there beside us
1546193 think a lot about process theyre real practical they want to learn how to write r sum s meet deans of graduate schools intern on the hill
1546194 we brought them up to believe they can do anything
1546195 until i hear from dr andrews thats all ive got
1546196 i hope we dont miss him for very long but you think of a guy of jobas caliber and you know hes going to miss a start that doesnt mean the guy who replaces him cant pitch well
1546197 you dont want to jeopardize their long term health and were talking about a 22 year old kid here
1546198 while i was staying in the valley i often visited stanford university to attend tech conferences networking events toastmasters club lee emerson bassett chapter chartered in 1935 or just made a casual visit to the campus with friends and families who were visiting me
1546199 this is the place where i need to kneel down and say few prayers
1546200 a noble ambition is among the most helpful influences of student life and the higher this ambition is the better no man can work well unless he can speak as the great master did of the joy set before him
1546201 multiple new guitar hero skus and an all new call of duty due to our leapfrog studio strategy
1546202 the complicated love and affection shared by two straight males
1546203 how many more people do you think youll sleep with before you get married
1546204 the purpose of marriage is to help each other identify and carry out gods will for their life with joy
1546205 the ultimate purpose of marriage is the greater glory of god and god is most greatly glorified when his gifts are rightly celebrated and received and his covenants are rightly honored and pledged
1546206 in order to provide congress with the time needed to consider this situation
1546207 establish binding rules of decision that pre empt contrary state law
1546208 the executives narrow and strictly limited authority to settle international claims disputes pursuant to an executive agreement cannot stretch so far as to support the current presidential memorandum
1546209 the united states will discharge its international obligations by having state courts give effect to the decision in accordance with general principles of comity in cases filed by the 51 mexican nationals addressed in that decision
1546210 after one president in the pocket of the oil companies we cant afford another
1546211 remember that when george bush took office he had an energy policy he turned to dick cheney and he told cheney go take care of this
1546212 obama told a crowd at a gym in youngstown ohio
1546213 john mccains taking a page out of the bush cheney playbook
1546214 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it senator obama voted for it
1546215 people care not only what you say but how you vote
1546216 his schedule hasnt been set for next week let alone next month
1546217 americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened
1546218 i enjoy coming to a free society where people are able to express their opinions and your country is a free society
1546219 the majority of the korean people have been eagerly waiting for your visit
1546220 and of course behind these people there were those who were sort of opposed
1546221 i admire your forthrightness your integrity and your deep love for the people of korea
1546222 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1546223 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1546224 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1546225 top down bottom up methodology was proven again and again we have gained respect and credibility with the powerful the implementers and the ultimate receivers relational diplomacy is key an approach proven by what we have been able to accomplish
1546226 whites stunning second crime novel to feature ex cop and ex pi jackson donne fulfills the promise of his debut
1546227 intricate plotting and nonstop action make this a nail biting read from start to finish white is a writer to watch
1546228 scenes of donnes mothers decline however are knowing and movingly written and the gritty new jersey locale seems an ideal setting for portraying the evil that men do
1546229 white has learned early the art of the hard boiled
1546230 white has created an appealing character in donne and the plot flies between the events in the 1940s and explosions kidnappings and murders in the present
1546231 an engrossing evocative debut novel that will grab most readers from its opening sentences fans of hard hitting uncompromising private investigators will hope that donne ditches his college dreams and continues to pound the pavement
1546232 white manages the neat trick of respecting the genres traditions while daring to nudge it toward something new and unexpected
1546233 a unique and artful blend of the pi novel and the police procedural with a story as deceptively simple as your first love and as fatal as your last car wreck a terrific novel
1546234 its the great american private eye novel reborn for the 21st century with a fast moving spare style that punches you in the gut at the same time it squeezes your heart
1546235 when one man dies barrels straight out of the old school and swerves onto the highway that will take detective fiction where its going next dave white has one hand on the wheel the other on the gear shift and his foot on the floor

1546237 when one man dies heralds the introduction of two astonishing new figures in the crime fiction world new jersey pi jackson donne whose emotional journey will break your heart and author dave white whose voice has the confidence and assurance many more established writers would kill for
1546238 pressures for higher rates are likely to linger on the committee
1546239 overall we cannot entirely rule out the risk that the committee will sanction higher rates this time
1546240 centricas 35 percent increase in domestic tariffs suggests that inflation will hit 5 0 percent
1546241 inflationary pressures continue to prevent the mpc from cutting rates in response to the deteriorating real economy
1546242 in fact if interest rates change this month they are more likely to go up than down
1546243 we suspect that most mpc members are still firmly in wait and see mode and in no hurry to move interest rates given the current major uncertainties surrounding both the medium term inflation and growth outlooks
1546244 more powerful than a nintendo ds and sony psp combined
1546245 we could be in a world of trouble in five years when this plays out
1546246 unfortunately poor minority and low achieving students are far more likely to be taught by an under qualified teacher than their more affluent white and high achieving peers
1546247 the students most in need of the most qualified teachers are the least likely to be taught by them
1546248 otherwise we will continue to have the inequity its not going to go away
1546249 its been shown that the most important factor in closing the achievement gaps is the work of an effective teacher we need to get as many as we can in the right places
1546250 how to make your teachers quit they would look at what the state of texas does
1546251 we place brand new teachers in very hard to teach schools we dont have strong mentoring programs and they get very frustrated
1546252 where they have a fighting chance that at least three quarters of the student body will pass the test
1546253 you know those things that make electricity to get the engine going
1546254 ill look at them but they are going to cost a lot of money
1546255 you dumb foreigner im not going to do a bloody thing the car looks tip top but im going to charge you a fortune
1546256 you mean a control technique that must be done every two years
1546257 you want a control technique why didnt you say so
1546258 i know they can say that but its not accurate and its not fair
1546259 will be offering refunds for those with windows specific gold subscriptions
1546260 few believe that the discovery of extraterrestrial life is imminent
1546261 however just as scientists long theorized that there were planets orbiting other stars but could not prove it until new technologies and insights broke the field wide open many astrobiologists now see their job as to develop new ways to search for the life they are sure is out there
1546262 we feel online gaming is not just about skills vs skills anymore but also about personal connection so we are set out to complete the other half of the equation
1546263 why would you do this stupid work ive assigned you when you have fun internet things to look at
1546264 if we apply to the new testament as we should the same sort of criteria as we should apply to
1546265 the conception of christianity as somehow judeo eastern is beyond anything i can comprehend
1546266 ships officers recorded air pressure wind strength air and sea temperatures and other weather conditions from these records scientists can build a detailed picture of past weather and climate
1546267 british archives contain more than 100 000 royal navy logbooks from around 1670 to 1850 alone they are a stunning resource
1546268 global warming is a reality but our data show climate science is complex it is wrong to take particular events and link them to carbon dioxide emissions these records will give us a much clearer picture of what is really happening
1546269 oh my gosh you have the new harry potter application i have the new harry potter application
1546270 hey you know that really sketchy guy who doesnt have a network omg he friended me too
1546271 thanks to everyone who has been reading for the last two months i plan on keeping
1546272 dont you think that god wants all the different races and all the different cultures to live together in peace and harmony
1546273 dont you think that god wants all the different races and all the different cultures to live together in peace and harmony
1546274 were all one mystical body so why are you trying to divide the body of christ
1546275 these problems arent the result of ethnic conflict but an outgrowth of the sinful heart of man
1546276 a person who believes their own race to be superior to other races
1546277 red and yellow black and white theyre all precious in his sight
1546278 if we apply to the new testament as we should the same sort of criteria as we should apply to
1546279 the conception of christianity as somehow judeo eastern is beyond anything i can comprehend
1546280 to whom it may concern i guess if youre reading this that means you
1546281 the basic idea rights antecede governments they are not created by governments
1546282 the us flag he goes on to argue has become a
1546283 it should not fly over any state property at all it should fly only over federal property
1546284 i got a stern talking to last time i went down that road
1546285 you hear all kinds of stuff but im not thinking about anything but helping to get him elected
1546286 beyond the fact that hes the candidate of my party hes a very good friend
1546287 as a native iowan and excellent customer of the internal revenue service i am writing to ask for your assistance i have contacted the department of homeland security in an effort to determine the process for becoming an illegal alien and they referred me to you my primary reason for wishing to change my status from u s citizen to illegal alien stems from the bill which was recently passed by the senate and for which you voted if my understanding of this bills provisions is accurate as an illegal alien who has been in the united states for five years all i need to do to become a citizen is to pay a 2 000 fine and income taxes for three of the last five years i know a good deal when i see one and i am anxious to get the process started before everyone figures it out
1546288 the repetitive nature of a sacred echo gives me confidence that god is really prompting guiding or leading it reminds me to pay close attention something important may be going on here the sacred echo challenges me to prayerfully consider how god is at work in my own life as well as the lives of those around me the sacred echo is an invitation to spiritual awakening
1546289 i want a relationship with god where prayer is as natural as breathing
1546290 theres no other place to put it where people will see it
1546291 the majority of the korean people have been eagerly waiting
1546292 we love you god because you are so good to us
1546293 its pretty upsetting to know we have people who will target anyone anywhere anytime
1546294 o ne lie leads to another lie so we want to stop that domino effect thats why we want to say goodbye to crime
1546295 they stole two tvs two dvd players all my cds and movies and all that
1546296 and the thief broke in through a window last month
1546297 if you move just because you heard of a burglary
1546298 i believe its going to come to a screeching halt
1546299 they should pull theyd be better and get a job go to work and earn your own money
1546300 what should we be looking for in our next president
1546301 i have the courage the wisdom the experience and most importantly the oldness necessary
1546302 the oldness it takes to protect america to honor her love her and tell her about what cute things the cat did
1546303 its about being able to look your children in the eye or in my case my children grandchildren great grandchildren great great grandchildren and great great great grandchildren the youngest of whom are nearing retirement
1546304 together our portfolio of companies viisage identix integrated biometric technology securimetrics iridian spectal comnetix mcclendon advanced concepts inc and bioscrypt inc deliver the full range of offerings required for solving the problems associated with managing human identity
1546305 i will vote to increase u s oil production to lower gas prices for americans
1546306 not representative of the type of campaign he wants to run in nc or the country
1546307 the 46 year old first term senator will face sen john mccain of arizona in the fall campaign to become the 44th president
1546308 take it from me and from the election of 2000 you know that elections matter
1546309 after the last eight years even our dogs and cats know that election matters

1546311 every really good venture fund i have been involved in or have witnessed has had one or more investments that paid off so large that one deal single handedly returned the entire fund
1546312 wow it sucks to be broke in l a i can imagine what its like in fucking pittsburgh its way worse i knew eventually i would do a movie involving porn laughs
1546313 like kevin smiths clerks spaced captures perfectly where i was when i was in my mid 20s
1546314 at first it was something i had never really intended on doing id always intended on teaching in the states like most of my fellow graduates
1546315 their goal at the school is to have the students have a good global perspective when theyre done with their education in japan they feel the way to do that is to have a japanese teacher so they keep their japanese culture and an english speaking teacher in every classroom
1546316 i feel confident i will gain a lot of insight into good practices and good techniques and hopefully its an opportunity that can set me apart from other teachers
1546317 we met ricky nixon because we got a request from adrian anderson the operations director of the australian football league afl he asked us would we meet and we said we would
1546318 what we wanted to get out of that meeting was to find out what he was about wed never met him before and wed been reading reports about him so we met him and he went through what he plans to do and we had a good frank discussion about it
1546319 obviously we expressed concerns in various areas he explained to us what he was all about and he agreed to prepare a detailed report on exactly what he plans to do and that he would submit that report to us hes gone back to australia now but wed expect to get something back from him in about three weeks
1546320 when his report comes in well be able to use that to have a chat in house here when we go to australia in october we will meet with him nixon again in the presence of the afl
1546321 i dont know who will attend that meeting with the afl but wed certainly be looking to have senior officials there wed be hoping to sit down with andrew demetriou afl chief and adrian anderson and ricky and just see exactly whats going on and see whether they the afl are comfortable with whats going on as well as what we should be doing as an organization
1546322 in the past couple of days another afl agent gerard sholly has been over here and if i can put it this way he has been misbehaving himself by going into gaa grounds and holding training sessions without permission
1546323 he has incurred the wrath of a number of people here and that has got plenty of publicity as well that really isnt helping the image of afl recruitment at the moment
1546324 we cant stop these lads from going theyre free agents theyre not contracted to us and theyre not professional players so they can come and go as they please
1546325 we cant tie them down but obviously we have major concerns if they go they need to be adequately told whats actually going on and that their welfare education accommodation and those kinds of things are being looked after
1546326 its a long distance to go to australia and its a completely different lifestyle and a different culture its important to be in good surroundings because its such a long way from home some players who have gone over have gotten quite lonesome and havent been able to stick it out there
1546327 from our point of view wed prefer that they didnt go at all because theyre a loss to their counties and to their clubs but if they do choose to go its important that they be properly looked after
1546328 it may well be that somebody else may want to take on the brief of keeping in touch with these young lads and how theyre getting on and that maybe they can keep us updated on any concerns they may have
1546329 absolutely not theres no prospect of that happening thats a complete non runner and anyone whos suggesting that has absolutely no appreciation of what the gaa is all about theres not a snowballs chance of that happening its not on the agenda and its not going to be on the agenda
1546330 its really not true to say that australia has been left out
1546331 there has also been a successful twinning operation between leinster gaa and the gaa in australia and a significant amount of equipment is sent out every year from ireland to australia
1546332 weve formally committed to playing a game in sydney in november itll be a selection of all stars against a local selection well use our few days there in either melbourne or sydney whichever suits them to talk to the australian gaa people and see how things are going out there and what issues need to be addressed
1546333 we will definitely be doing something where we get the players together prior to the games in perth and in melbourne thats all been agreed with the afl
1546334 i didnt know that to be honest that surprises me
1546335 i just assumed someone would show it live but ill check into that

1546367 with the enormous success of past mica runway events we decided to meet the growing needs of our supporters by adding two programs teen mica and mica art
1546368 its really exciting for us to see mica runway expand and create new opportunities
1546369 mica runway 2008 will entail a fashion showcase of wardrobes by renowned designers and sponsoring boutiques also visual performing and literary artworks will be displayed by various artists who are deaf and hard of hearing this is always an exciting event that brings together people from all corners of the world
1546370 its also a great opportunity to see new work network and have a great time
1546371 what id like to see accomplished at the mica runway 2008 event is that we see a significant improvement or change within the deaf hard of hearing and hearing communities to learn to support each other
1546372 id also like to see the building of a bridge where entrepreneurship network and leadership are developed since these are crucial factors of success we need not be too segregated when people especially those who are artists turn to each other for support
1546373 this is a not to be missed red carpet appeal for the fashion aficionados supporter of the arts film enthusiasts or those with an appreciation for our young and emerging talent if youre any of the above this is the place for you
1546374 if you have a passion for something then keep doing what you love doing you need to believe

1546378 its like this book tells everything about me its amazing oh and paul wants to start using his money for god would buying bibles to give to house churches be ok even though he might not always believe yet oh and would you tell all of those people who are praying for me that their prayers are being answered and that it might be good if they prayed for paul too

1546419 women in america try to begin their life again from zero in this country women cant start their life from zero the society doesnt respect her and doesnt talk with her and a married womans husband divorces her if the girl was a virgin she cant continue to live she cant never never never get married who would marry her nobody how she can say it to her family she has to choose one way i mean she has to kill herself if she has sisters men would never marry her sisters because of her even though it was her not her sisters we have the universal problem but no one talks ever
1546420 please dont be angry with me lauren please dont think im being selfish when i want to leave i just want to begin again
1546421 we had to break up i cant see him like that any more
1546422 phoebe i think youre missing something you see you cant divide god the father and god the son that way
1546423 its like a family that really loves each other remember god made people in his image and people are male and female so god must be a man and a woman god the father loves god the mother and they can never be separated from god the son jesus is the son and the holy spirit is the mother
1546424 maybe we should look at what the bible says about this
1546425 you need to be better than you are right now
1546426 i user nome i login login i pass pass i
1546427 im wondering why a neighborhood with fifty percent unemployment needs a 24 hour internet caf
1546428 the same reason anyone needs it americans dont work at two in the morning either do they its for porn
1546429 so all these internet caf s that were started with u s grant money in the last few years
1546430 oh people do email and research and things but 99 of thats in normal day hours its funny isnt it we got millions of dollars of educational and business development grants in the last ten years and the only thing that got easier is seeing naked people
1546431 once i had my niche i started visiting other cafes and offering to share software or help them with their networks that way i got to know their systems and find ways to get past whatever protection they were using i wasnt planning to attack but you need to be able to defend yourself like when those people
1546432 sent me a virus i could remove it because id worked on their systems and knew what viruses they had access to and i knew what protection they had
1546433 sellers know when youre serious they come to you most of the normal viruses are probably twenty to fifty dollars the funny thing is i wasnt really that serious about closing these people down i only sent them a five dollar virus thats just a bug too bad it took them four days to remove it in that time i ran a sale and their customers switched to me
1546434 it was this if they see it they think youre ready for business that guy hes the main guy a lot of people dont want to pay what he asks so they spend all their time paying off every thug who comes by i pay more but then i have time for other business one stop shopping

1546450 i fear no man when ive got truth on my side
1546451 a newspaper has asked john mccains campaign why a black reporter assigned to cover a rally was singled out by security and told to leave a backstage area
1546452 the only thing ive heard him say is that we should inflate our tires
1546453 so he has no plan for addressing the energy challenges that we face
1546454 we found out that the plant that was processing our meat was going to shut down and so it was either find a way to keep it open or buy it ourselves to keep it open and we ended up buying it ourselves

1546472 our ceiling collapsed and we have to have a few ceilings replaced and it crushed chucks desk and broke his computer and then his car battery died so we had a million things to fix as well as a house full of contractors
1546473 i dont accept the notion that people are going to vote first and foremost with identity politics
1546474 theres a lot of people for whom identity politics will be a secondary factor

1546477 bill i think has went along to get along more than i was hoping he would do because i considered him when i first came in to the council as a progressive like me
1546478 but ive been very disappointed in a lot of decisions hes made
1546479 im really really focused on trying to not make this a campaign of people making allegations and then responding to other peoples allegations
1546480 obviously hillarys senate bid might have led to a whole expansion of the consultant side of me
1546481 as i went into adulthood i just felt like issue activism was more productive and didnt come with the kind of traps inherent in the electoral path
1546482 i got ruth messinger on board i got everybody on board
1546483 and frankly once i got the civics involvement there was very little opposition and we ended up getting 6 000 units plus commercial space
1546484 the only thing thats constant is change and this is just at the beginning so there will be a lot of change going on
1546485 theyre asking for unbelievably 2 300 more parking spaces in an area that is just so overwhelmed with traffic
1546486 and what theyre asking is for an even higher density and obviously its going to have to be scaled back

1546498 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
1546499 that is the internal struggle that i and a lot of women have you listen to the outside which says you have an obligation because youre smart and well educated to do this and its like yeah but i also have these kids and if barack is fully into the policy

1546502 she s got a sense of humor a thoughtful energy policy and nearly as much federal legislative experience as barry o if grotesque overexposure and grandiose ego are now prerequisites for the presidency then the choice is actually the choice still isn t clear is it

1546504 we tell this to aundrae all of the time he is his own worst enemy
1546505 i feel like the more and more you prove yourself in this league the more creative you can be with what you do starting out you have to master the fundamentals and the small things once you do that and establish yourself you can start using your creativity
1546506 when youre thinking about assignments only youre thinking about that pass route and youre not taking in what the defense is doing or the creativity you have based on what the defense presents
1546507 the big thing at the end of it is you may be creative but youre not creating something that the quarterback hasnt seen before
1546508 i would love to be in hollywood and get my ideas out there
1546509 i feel like im a peoples person and i have a sense of humor i have a big imagination i love to be creative
1546510 its all about believing in the guys that are blocking for you
1546511 i know those guys are going to do their jobs
1546512 its mildly akin to the use of aluminum bats in the amateur or college baseball ranks versus the wooden bats of the pros its the same game sort of but it sure sounds different
1546513 i think post storm is the time communities really need to come together and people need to be surrounded by their peers
1546514 thats what im trying to allow here allow people to tell a good story or a bad story but everybody has a story that has to be told
1546515 weve been so dry flooding hasnt been much of an issue

1546525 that intersection has flooded all my life but with the new drainage project kicked in it didnt flood
1546526 in terms of feedstock we do have a supply of crude in tanks that will enable us to continue running for the foreseeable future
1546527 we had very little rain and a breeze of 5 to 10 mph
1546528 weve had worse thunderstorms than this like the squall that came through sunday night
1546529 its just now starting to recede at one point it was up to four feet in the front yard
1546530 the van is going to be one of those insurance cases
1546531 they woke up this morning and saw the chairs in the pool so that was pretty interesting
1546532 he said wed be ok once the storm passed over
1546533 but when we got here and saw people boarding up the windows my wife got a little nervous
1546534 the winds were blowing too hard out of the north
1546535 we crossed a number of scientific barriers in this case
1546536 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1546537 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
1546538 the era of u s funded major infrastructure projects is over
1546539 accurately highlights that iraqs revenues have grown substantially in recent years
1546540 still needs to improve the speed and effectiveness of its budget execution and the transparency of its budgeting and accounting practices
1546541 we estimate that the iraqi government could spend between 35 3 billion and 35 9 billion of its overall 49 9 billion budget
1546542 there does not seem to me to be any realistic chance that any of the strong clinton supporters are going to hold back by the time the election comes
1546543 one i love campaigning theres something the matter with you if you like political campaigning for yourself the other is we ran against each other but were good friends
1546544 after one president in the pocket of the oil companies we cant afford another
1546545 remember that when george bush took office he had an energy policy he turned to dick cheney and he told cheney go take care of this
1546546 obama told a crowd at a gym in youngstown ohio
1546547 john mccains taking a page out of the bush cheney playbook
1546548 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it senator obama voted for it
1546549 people care not only what you say but how you vote
1546550 his schedule hasnt been set for next week let alone next month
1546551 americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened
1546552 i came to join the candlelight protest to send a message to bush that he cannot push around weaker nations like a bully
1546553 as koreans have more and more beef on the market i think theyll become more and more comfortable
1546554 hes still the most important figure in global politics and president lee needs support from such an important figure right now
1546555 will come and go and there will be no change in the situation
1546556 we are hopeful that we will be able to reach an understanding with the north koreans but were not at that juncture yet
1546557 i was not surprised but i certainly was grateful for his and his familys efforts
1546558 i have a lot of arab business partners i do a lot of business in the middle east ive got a lot of friends
1546559 i ask my friends to support candidates that i think are worthy of supporting they usually come through for me
1546560 a new type of toner used in printers and copiers significantly reduces the amount of energy used in toner manufacture and also roughly halves the amount of toner needed to print a page toner fine black or coloured powder that gets bonded to the page during the printing process used to be made by grinding larger pieces of material to dust a nanotechnology technique called emulsion aggregation builds up toner particles out of molecules developed at the xerox research centre of canada in mississauga ont emulsion aggregation is how the toner for most of xeroxs colour office printers is made today and the company plans to implement the method across its product line within five years says patricia burns laboratory manager for materials synthesis and characterization at xrcc building up the particles this way uses 25 per cent less energy she says and because the particles are smaller it takes half as much toner to print a page besides reducing energy consumption this means less waste toner going into the garbage burns notes
1546561 we are going to be fighting for every vote here in missouri
1546562 dont let the other side scare you from what you know in your gut you know in your gut we have to bring about change
1546563 people all over the state need to have a sense that a candidate cares about them and if you dont bother to show up in rural missouri if you dont bother to ask for peoples votes all over the state then youre not going to win statewide in missouri
1546564 southwest missourians are much more focused on substance at the end of the day than style
1546565 no question he has style he gives a great speech but theres a reason missouri has been called for years the show me state
1546566 call back thursday or friday and i should give you a more definitive answer
1546567 what rural missourians dont like is a candidate who dismisses whole communities out of hand
1546568 a lot of people in this state would think nobody would show up for barack obama
1546569 we have lost all confidence in stephen johnsons ability to carry out epas mission under the law
1546570 the american people are asking us to do something about the price of gas at the pump
1546571 you tell voters that i wanted to get out of washington i didnt have time to do it
1546572 we dont do that in this city we just conveniently charge it to our grandchildren
1546573 i couldnt let him go not after seeing how far hed come
1546574 consumers will get to enjoy the best of the programming on both services
1546575 theyll also be able to pick and choose channels at a lower price
1546576 john mccain is still in striking distance thanks to his own character biography and memories of the mccain of previous election cycles but he cannot afford another week like this one
1546577 i think voters see this difference between the two men
1546578 john mccain is complete barack obama is completing himself the question is will he finish that job by november
1546579 im not sure theres any short term political gain and i know that seems strange since obviously we put a lot of work into it
1546580 i dont think that well see a bump in the polls i think we might even lose some points people back home are worried about gas prices theyre worried about jobs
1546581 the value to me of this trip is hopefully it gives voters a sense that i can in fact and do operate effectively on the international stage
1546582 that may not be decisive for the average voter right now given our economic troubles but its knowledge they can store in the back of their minds for when they go into the polling place later
1546583 we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states but a broad federal moratorium stands in the way of energy exploration and production
1546584 it is time for the federal government to lift these restrictions
1546585 this is a case study of how a candidate can change a policy position in the interest of raising money
1546586 john mccain takes positions because he thinks its the right thing to do for america
1546587 he has a long track record of doing that and hes often made decisions that hurt with his fundraising base
1546588 about needing to tax the hell out of the oil companies
1546589 its for those reasons that the oil industry has always tried to be a substantial contributor
1546590 becoming a smartwaysm partner further confirms our dedication to environmental sustainability

1546635 this is the second phase of our planned restructuring which began in march when we announced the reduction in number of films well finance and produce as well as discontinuation of marketing our own pictures
1546636 while we stand by our choices its clear that the market is changing and that accelerating costs to distribute films and the urgency to find an audience in a short window demand that we cast our net wider
1546637 while my experience as an executive at ske has been rewarding on so many levels my first love and goal has always been to return to producing films personally

1546652 the good thing about this is after the tax increase ends the money gets automatically rebated to the taxpayer
1546653 im glad the governor has come around to saying publicly what weve known all along we have to have a tax in order to correct the problem that were in right now so i say its a start
1546654 he will be criticized for breaking his pledge on taxes and that will hurt him with a number of voters on the other hand hell look like he was a problem solver too which will help offset some of the damage that will cause

1546661 it was very instantaneous that the cabin filled up with smoke
1546662 we were told to put on our oxygen masks which the entire left side of the plane dropped but the right side did not at all which was the side that we were sitting on so it was really nerve wracking
1546663 my assumption was the plane was going to go down and hit the runway and basically burst into flames the way they were making it seem how serious it was the flight attendant actually scared me because i had been on a few planes that had problems and ive never had them lose their composure like they did and it was just very nerve wracking because it felt like they were panicking so we should be too
1546664 for sure well have a story to tell for the rest of our lives
1546665 to be honest for the whole first part of it when everything first started i was asleep i passed out before we took off but my mom woke me up when the oxygen masks actually deployed and so at that point wide awake
1546666 it smelled like some kind of machine oil maybe like a hydraulic fluid that had maybe been burning at a very low level enough to create some smoke
1546667 just kind of just like on a world war ii tv show they you know jump jump jump and everybody was jumping down the slides to the bottom and then they casually walked us over to buses and a holding area
1546668 we have not identified a cause however we sometimes find that the air conditioning system pulls in smells from the engine especially after servicing the aircraft odors can be generated from excess oil or other fluid on hot equipment
1546669 we were scared it was very obviously so unusual to sense that the plane had something burning
1546670 lets see if she can actually figure this thing without catching herself on fire
1546671 i cant wait to do it again sorry i had to rush off to work thanks for the towlette
1546672 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1546673 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers
1546674 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results consumers companies and governments from around the world must further develop ways to protect our sensitive personal and business information and detect those whether here or abroad that conspire to exploit technology for criminal gain
1546675 these prosecutions demonstrate that through coordinated commitment the united states secret service and the department of justice will penetrate and prosecute hacker organizations wherever based and however sophisticated the united states attorneys office for the southern district of california is especially gratified that the work of the san diego field office of the secret service contributed to an unprecedented effort to dismantle this international criminal enterprise
1546676 computer hacking and identity theft pose serious risks to our commercial personal and financial security
1546677 hackers who reach into our country from abroad will find no refuge from the reach of u s criminal justice
1546678 technology has forever changed the way commerce is conducted virtually erasing geographic boundaries
1546679 while these advances and the global nature of cyber crime continue to have a profound impact on our financial crimes investigations this case demonstrates how combining law enforcement resources throughout the world sends a strong message to criminals that they will be pursued and prosecuted no matter where they reside
1546680 the internal revenue service criminal investigation division recommends charges in numerous types of financial crimes
1546681 todays indictment is the result of a strong law enforcement partnership that brings together the necessary skills to follow alleged criminal activity from cyberspace to bank accounts we are committed to the governments efforts to stop this type of corruptive activity

1546685 well for now i think i am just going to put this down as ubos for now
1546686 i am not afraid i was born to do this
1546687 we should not allow it to be expanded to higher and higher income levels and to adults this is about poor children

1546696 when my husband was diagnosed with myelodyoplastic syndrome mds in 1995 the disease that took his life there was a very limited bone marrow donor base and limited resources to help mds patients and their families

1546702 were thrilled fsn detroit is offering the game in spanish language and joining us in honoring the contributions of hispanic players past and present
1546703 there is no doubt that with gasoline prices dipping below 3 90 a gallon we have a bit of a reprieve on the energy front
1546704 but the reality is that this is a chicken and egg game because the decline is reflecting the consumer recession
1546705 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports

1546710 the loss of integral jewish community has meant that jewish commitment is a matter of choice that is nowhere more true than in contemporary america where the freedom to participate fully in the life of the larger society is in every respect greater than has ever been before indeed is nearly absolute we are living moreover in what is very likely the most mobile society that has ever existed on the face of the earth it is no wonder that the jewish community in this situation has to argue for every single jewish soul compete for every pledge of allegiance against and ever increasing wealth of beckoning possibilities and must do so not once in a persons life but repeatedly year in and year out because each of us not only decides where to live but with who and how
1546711 why we hate us american discontent in the new millennium

1546717 the marsh has lost its ability to hold itself together
1546718 theres basically been a snowball rolling downhill and now its an avalanche
1546719 when plants get enough nutrients they dont produce as many roots
1546720 when the storms come they dont have enough roots to hold the soil
1546721 that hydrogen sulfide is toxic to marsh plants in high concentrations
1546722 if you exceed the limits of its tolerance it will die
1546723 the next step is can we get them to reproduce
1546724 if the wars of the last century were fought over oil the wars of the next century will be fought over water
1546725 is an effective and important means of reducing tobacco consumption by various segments of the population in particular young persons
1546726 we all looked at each other and these guys have worked together for maybe six or ten years all the senior creative guys on bioshock and asked what do we want to do do we want to do something a little more straightforward next time or do we want to swing for the fences again to paraphrase we decided to swing for the fences
1546727 the goal for our next project is something very very different so its a little scary because we dont know what it is exactly were getting a much clearer sense every single day in terms of what were doing deciding whats in and out of the game but its
1546728 unless you read the paper you arent exactly aware of the foreclosures in your area
1546729 most of what happens is once they find out there is a vacant home and they steal the copper out of it or they go and steal the fixtures out of it
1546730 were seeing lot of people who are losing jobs and or are cutting back on the hours they used to get they used to rely on overtime and no longer have overtime to rely on

1546733 today it may seem old history but south africa was a very important political issue back in the 80s and so it nurtured many cultural projects
1546734 the concert for bangladesh may have been the start of benefit albums and for a worthy cause
1546735 nothing casual about dying nothing casual about standing for freedom
1546736 it doesnt take long to realise that shampoo victims by grand popo fc is a slightly bonkers proposition
1546737 this album is fresh funky a touch weird and i love it some of the tracks are real upbeat electro pop dancy tunes that some how manage to make you turn it up full blast and dance about your bedroom giving it all you have got others are more relaxed and chilled but equally as good if you like original electronica it may be your cup of tea
1546738 this album is worth the dosh if just for the sparks collaborations on it the other tracks are still worth a listen though
1546739 sounds like an astonishing around the world electro voyage somewhere around 1985
1546740 this electro pop duo are french and their sound is suitably sophisticated but this song which was their debut single in the uk in 2003 still manages to be catchy and fun with great lyrics there is plenty of female fronted electro pop music around at the moment but these songs are always popular especially with me so discovering a new band although this song is taken from their 2000 album fabulously titled shampoo victims they are entirely new to me who make this type of music with an emphasis on the pop is rather exciting im not sure who the singer is as both the band members are male despite one of them being called ariel and having a fondness for pink cowboy boots those of you who know a bit about french tv may recognise him as the presenter of lappartement which i believe is similar to big brother i would specifically recommend this to fans of annie and bertine zetlitz but the chorus is almost alcazar esque so really anyone with taste should like it
1546741 we said to ourselves that there had to be a football club in this town and that if not wed have to do something about it urgently
1546742 if you want to know about my influences you have to go way back to 1980 in north london england when as a starry eyed 17 year old singer percussionist i started a jazz funk band called second image with my brother junior bromfield and friend frank burke
1546743 one of the funkiest r amp b bands in the uk
1546744 very 80s synth inspired and hints of depeche mode erasure and the like
1546745 without doubt the best thing ive heard on the uk electronic music scene for ages
1546746 this debut album of south yorkshires electro due delivers upbeat intelligent and poppy music to appeal a wide audience
1546747 some great songs on this debut modern synthpop but with a retro touch
1546748 northern kinds debut fifty degrees north is heaven sent if you like your pop pure and analogue its like a previously undiscovered vince clarke session from january 1982 before he hooked up with alison moyet this album contains eternally lovable synth sounds that most of us will never tire of and the second track on amp on proceeded by a very enticing instrumental is without doubt an electro gem that will more than likely make the proposed electronically yours cd compilation along with the illustrious likes of marsheaux rachel car schmoof beauty skool dropout dead dog cassette electrik and mighty necroluxe its all beginning to take shape its another tale of unrequited love to some relentless synth programming and topped with femme fatale vocals you cant really ask for a better combination northern kind is a guilty pleasure youll have it blasting out before a night out on the pull or a night of endless wine consumption whatever takes your fancy wine doesnt answer back this collection of 12 tracks is immediately agreeable track 5 thoughts of you is a very curious affair lead singer sarah heeley is a sheffield lass born and bred so during the verses you may be reminded of the leagues susan sulley there is a definite accent in there but as soon as the chorus kicks in sarah sounds like a cross between very early madonna and current sophie ellis bextor and thats a bloody good vocal trio if you step back and think about it track 7 home could be from madonnas ray of light if she had speak and spell on repeat in william orbits studio with just a hint of early 80s abba the next track seen the light is more erasure circa 1987s the circus and its a nice throwback to a very good pop album a great analogue hook here reminiscent of its leading single it doesnt have to be you belong is pure mid 80s true blue madonna intertwined again with erasure only this time its their career defining 88 classic the innocents on this track northern kind bare their soul with this dreamy slow burner with orbit like production and the chorus has a fantastic vocal hook we think this should be the next digital single download one of our most repeated northern kind tracks is the album finale the other side there is a bit of 88 inner city in here in terms of the bassline whilst 90 of it is made up of madonnas 1983 debut and we should all still be celebrating that album sarahs vocals are really warm and inviting on this hook laden finale her vocal range is spot on throughout extra mention must be made in honour of the production and programming it will hit you once you rip the album to your desired mp3 player you wont find any mention of this on northern kinds myspace page but sarahs musical companion matt culpin has actually done some programming for depeche mode in the past so that gives you an idea of just how polished some of these tracks are on this shiny happy debut fifty degrees north contains solid little pop nuggets all with a sweet and seductive analogue center if you swooned over marsheauxs peek a boo than ey can safely deliver to your ears another classy cd with factory inspired sleeve design
1546749 these guys were in first place before i got here
1546750 i feel like usually im probably the loud one before the game but in no way shape or form am i on this team
1546751 i came up as a second hitter so i really wasnt thinking about home runs it just happened
1546752 even now the main thing is getting guys over and getting them in its not hitting the ball out of the ballpark but that is what people are fascinated with is the home runs
1546753 when i had the initial conversation with him i explained we were not asking you to be our everyday center fielder were only asking you to go out there when you feel great
1546754 i dont think id rather do something else at this point in my life
1546755 i played with or against three of the coaches here so theyve been giving it to me a little bit about that
1546756 this is actually a compilation of two complete albums by french electronic musician richard vimal
1546757 barclay label the a side je vous salue leu france was a satirical glance at french history a quite uptempo piece which received many airplays on french radio but commercially was a flop between 1973 and 76 where lean years for richard living for short spells in madrid london amp paris working in vineyards selling wine and as a travelling salesman for a short period of time then came the big break in 1976 getting a contract with polydor his first album transparences came out in early 1977 it never sold well around 800 copies possibly because it was only distributed in france the albums 10 tracks were very laid back romantic and melodic most were songs with french lyrics with restrained synth arrangements the following year saw migrations a completely instrumental album more electronic with guitar and drums on one track this time the album was distributed in 19 countries and sold 6 7000 copies an amount newer em artists would die for 1980 saw the best from richard with aquarythmies which was recorded at his home on a mobile studio and mixed later in paris another totally instrumental album with infectious sounds the rhythmic tracks such as elixir and itinerarire are free flowing the later has jarre type rhythms its hard to believe that the sequences were played by hand pavane has quite strong classical overtones with a romantic touch then theres the 3 parter called arcanes with stirring church organ chords again showing classical tendencies considering the limited equipment at his disposal the korg polyphonic ps3300 and roland monophonic keyboards echo box guitars and 4 track teac tape recorder the music flows like a good wine funny enough in an interview in the early eighties richard described the album as flowing all down to healthy consumption of wine at that time jokingly saying it could have been called vinerythmies the bonus track metamorphose recorded in 2001 on the album reminds me of electronic chamber classical music if you can image that and certainly doesnt sound out of place with the older stuff after this classic release nothing was heard from richard although on the sleeve notes of this re release it mentions that over the last twenty years he has made music for 100 film amp tv productions and is currently at the early stages of producing a symphony in 4 movements for synths amp orchestra expect other releases in the future from a musician whose music in the 70 80 s was like a breath of fresh air welcome back richard
1546758 today richard vimal works as a composer of music for movies and television as well as advertisements for companies like peugeot michelin and shell to name but a few after having played piano and guitar for some time vimal first discovered the synthesizer in 1974 fascinated by its seemingly unlimited sonic possibilities he acquired a roland sh3 a period of fanatic experimentation finally led to a recording contract with polydor and the release of his first album entitled transparences in 1977 on which he also took over the lead vocals however his first effort did not prove to be a success his second entirely instrumental album migration fared slightly better in 1980 he released aquarythmies which delighted fans everywhere however as polydor and vimal could not reach an agreement about a follow up project vimal cancelled the contract and began to focus on working for the film industry in 1981 he composed his first soundtrack for a short film for aeronava now both instrumental studio albums have been released on one cd which also includes one track from transparences certainly not too bad a choice as well as a brand new and previously unreleased bonus track with some classical overtones vimals current activities include the composition of a symphony in four movements for synths and orchestra for the future other releases of vimals music are in preparation the liner notes mention composers like bach or schubert as sources for his inspiration amongst others and particularly stress the fact that vimal only listens to the works of classical composers as this strictly prevents him from inadvertently copying contemporary musical styles thereby following the example of fellow musicians like vangelis tomita and larry fast however upon listening to this album i cannot shake off the feeling that a certain jean michel jarre did bring his influence to bear as a matter of fact jarre released his oxygene a little earlier he also had a record deal with polydor at the time and is said to be french too anyway these 73 minutes of music are definitely worth a listen after all these years anyone who likes music of contemporaries like jarre baffo banfi and michael cretu should listen to this cd or just buy it right away by referring to electronic classics deimos music seems to refer to future releases i for one am looking forward to that
1546759 we sent him back for an mri cat scan and hes all clean and good as far as thats concerned
1546760 just a little bit of pressing on the nerve right now weve got to alleviate that before we can get him back out into rehab on one hand theres a delay in the process but the prognosis is good and well go from there
1546761 his last speech that he gave a couple days ago about how he was going to move us away from dependency on foreign oil was the first time i really heard him define anything specifically what he was going to do and he really wasnt very specific about some of that
1546762 i think everyone should be given the opportunity for a good education
1546763 what if youre a young kid out here and your folks have been working blue collar jobs for minimum wage you cant afford it
1546764 there are a lot of scholarships out there if people would go after them
1546765 ive studied in prague and ive gone through what free education in europe has to offer and its bad
1546766 i went in the military back in the 60s got out and got the gi bill
1546767 i dont think it should be free you gotta pay somethin for it
1546768 in my adult business life i have never had to make a choice of trading between professional and personal i tap dance to work and when i get there its tremendous fun
1546769 i am committed to giving the police the tools they need to get crime off our streets tasers are making a real difference on our streets not only keeping the public safe but also protecting our police officers
1546770 tasers have contributed to resolving incidents without injury where otherwise there would have been a real possibility of someone being seriously injured or killed in a significant proportion of cases they have not needed to be fired drawing or aiming the taser has been enough of a deterrent
1546771 as a result of your work as a result of this website the patients will now be informed they do have a right to know
1546772 i took care of difficult cases and desperate people and if the people are desperate and its a litigious society what do you expect
1546773 we need to know who we are trusting with our lives and our children our loved ones
1546774 again dont look into any of these decisions weve made right now
1546775 its just a starting spot theres no rhyme or reason why were doing this in this direction its the way i want to go right now
1546776 we want both guys to get an equal opportunity and thats what were going to do
1546777 no coin flip we didnt want to do that again no rock paper scissors
1546778 im excited i wanted to get out there and start out the preseason
1546779 its the battle certainly intensified in the preseason games theres a lot riding on it but the reality remains its just one more chance to get better
1546780 any time you have injuries thats going to have an influence on what happens changing guys around a little bit but its training camp and some of those things happen and you just have to work through it
1546781 i have a great veteran line that im following im a blip on the radar when it comes to years with some of these guys and they just tell you follow your technique and trust yourself and just go out there and play
1546782 my main goal is getting money getting an apartment and getting out of here
1546783 they have the same rights we do no matter where they live even if they choose to live outside in a tent or they choose not a tent at all
1546784 this is going to be a very interesting election year cause you got the war going on gas prices the cost of living
1546785 its because of the situation hard times and lifestyles addictions
1546786 they dont respect themselves as being worthy of helping to make a change
1546787 somehow finding their way to getting a debut album down despite chronic lineup instability the three members of the darkside this time around create a good but honestly not great record in all that noise
1546788 amazing psychedelia from the blistering opening track to the closer this album is amazing and was correctly heralded when it came out too bad for these guys that it all came to a close early on still this album is pretty amazing in its guitar work and drenched psychedelic acid musings great melomania is not worth getting its a piss poor album full of partial sloppy tunes
1546789 an overlooked gem of an album this first and best effort by the darkside will go down a treat with all those who like mellow and sultry 60s influenced psychedelia
1546790 the first darkside release was its most atypical if only because the original highrise love ep is the only recording featuring the bands actual founder nick hadyn on vocals
1546791 taken from two separate dates in early 1991 the wonderfully titled psychedelicise suburbia only appeared in a limited edition run and on vinyl only no less making it possibly the obscurest of the darksides major releases
1546792 when did you become disillusioned with what the music media was offering you
1546793 the bands second and seemingly final album though a third is still stuck somewhere in record company vaults expands on the best points of all that noise with considerably less of the drawbacks making for a much better effort all around
1546794 the darksides second and last album this continues in the vein of 60s influenced psychedelia where their previous release left off
1546795 this is the third offering by the darkside and they continue to ride the psychedelic wave of some distant planet bringing back a taste of mystery and splendor for us to sample leaving me to wonder what they actually hear in their own heads theyve progressed by bringing up the voices and smoothing things out a bit but theres nothing repeated redundant or even reminiscent of their previous releases other then more of the finest psychedelic music you are ever going to hear on this side of the galaxie
1546796 the darkside was not really me sure i was a member of the band and wrote all the lyrics and a large proportion of the music but i felt little empathy with the other members
1546797 the darkside was a lot more money but a lot more money was embezzled and stolen the split between the members was unfair too i began to resent the fact that i wasnt getting paid for writing any songs so i stopped writing songs for the band
1546798 hey guys great gig do you fancy signing a contract
1546799 our partnership with brussels airlines is particularly good for the clients of both airline companies as our route networks essentially are complementary as opposed to overlapping airbaltic has an excellent range of products in terms of flights to cis countries baltic countries and regional centres in scandinavia while brussels airlines offers attractive destinations in africa
1546800 they couldnt have picked a worse time to get into the automobile business domestically
1546801 the strongest steel comes from the hottest fire and while this is like dancing on the sun were making significant improvements in our business
1546802 the impatient money has become even more impatient and cerberus is an impatient money company how long can they tolerate negative cash flow
1546803 i wish i could be more optimistic but i dont see any daylight here
1546804 i doubt seriously as an outsider that they were planning a quick spin here
1546805 it may be that they sold chrysler as possibly the best moment they could for their own health
1546806 barack obamas latest negative attack ad shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy
1546807 obamas energy plan a stunt meant to mock a obama suggestion last week that americans improve air gas mileage by keeping all tires properly fully inflated
1546808 energy prices are not going back to a good old days
1546809 at least once a month amp before every road trip
1546810 with escalating fuel prices a time is now for drivers to focus on simple things like proper tire pressure to maximize tire performance amp increased fuel economy
1546811 were not at a point where we can give specifics but of course were working on it
1546812 terry halls understated evocative vocals has continued to be one of the most distinctive and recognizable voices in all rock music
1546813 genius my hero since he was in the specials brilliant song writer brilliantly dead pan vocalist deserves far more success than hes had lately
1546814 terry hall is a very modest man hes had an enormous influence on many artists today
1546815 when it was initially released in the mid 80s the colourfields virgins and philistines had little in common with most of the albums recorded during that decade
1546816 terry hall split up the specials in 1981 taking neville staples and lynval golding with him to form fun boy three by 1983 he had again become restless and split up fb3 with toby lyons from their touring band and forming the colour field with the like minded karl shale due to terrys pedigree expectations where high for the new group and i remember spending an evening listening to the janice long radio one show awaiting the premiere of their debut single also called the colour field second single take is included on this album and it is no doubt one of terry halls greatest songs that it failed to make the top forty beggars belief follow up thinking of you again showcases halls spot on song writing and this time the song went top twenty with a momentum carrying this album into the charts the next song taken from the album castles in the air again failed to chart despite a similar approach to thinking of you the song writing and arrangements of the remainder of the album perhaps do not rise to the dizzy heights of its 45s but it is a satisfying collection of indie pop gems that this album is currently out of print is criminal
1546817 it is not often you see so many 5 stars for an album buy it and totally agree like others i heard this when i was a kiddo and today it still sounds as fresh as a daisy this really is timeless pop with songs both your grandma and punk cousin will find acceptable it is hard to say which singles are the best cos there really isnt a bad track on it but my personal favourite is sorry i know this is a lot of money but i promise that it is a worth while investment i dont know if terry hall is making any money from this asian release but in my opinion he should be given a knighthood the best album of the 80s
1546818 fantastically under rated album with some of terry halls best song writing poetic yet humorous
1546819 deception isnt just the name of the colourfields second album its also vocalist terry halls modus operandi
1546820 oh how i wish i love the human race oh how i wish i had a pretty face
1546821 this was the colour fields second and unfortunately final album marred by an acrimonious split in the band toby lyons left during the recording of the album the album was released in 1987 and i was fortunate enough to buy the album at the time and to see the remainder of the band raquel welchs band i am led to believe live in manchester just after the release of this ten splendid tunes including the sublime miss texas 1967 the poignant goodbye sun valley and the brilliant confession give this album a try terry hall is one of the best singer songwriters of the last twenty odd years buy it
1546822 after the colourfield imploded terry hall formed a trio with an american actress called blair booth and a jeweler called anouchka groce
1546823 one of the most overlooked and forgotten gems from the splendor of the terry hall tongue this outing with blair booth and anouchka is truly a great find they blend whimsical lyrics catchy hooks and uplifting rhythms think of mamas amp papas meets lighting seeds
1546824 terry hall was thinking when he decided teaming up with an actress and a jeweller and coming up with this fantastic album but whatever he was thinking that time im glad he did it sadly no one practically took notice when this great piece of work came out hall is a master of conveying the deepest emotions one can have from timely things like the ruins of a divorce he can also get away with doing covers like captain amp tenilles staple love will keep us together ok lets give blair amp anouchka equal credit as they are parts of the album as well ultra modern nursery rhyme err the song is a happy song cleverly done by the trio equally good is beautiful people but the real knockout here is missing missing has a real honesty in it lyrics wise anyways quite seldom for a man to be admitting he misses a separated wife and hall just does it with utmost truth in it still very visible are the traces of his prior group the colourfield which also mastered melo dramatic tunes this is probably one of the forgotten chapters of terry halls discography but if you liked him eversince add a dash of influence from mamas amp papas then maybe just maybe youll like this album
1546825 after the colourfield split up chrysalis slit had enough faith in terry hall to come up with the goods they allowed him to credit this album terry blair and anoushta when issuing it as a solo venture by cash cow terry hall may have appealed more to their accountants with the two part harmony backing vocals the album is more attuned to fun boy three than any other of the hall canon and the feminine touch makes this a very light and poppy collection this is most apparent on with jazz standard three cool catz which is very reminiscent of fb3 45 t aint what you do its the way that you do it which was lifted by the backing singing of the then unknown bananarama title song ultra modern nursery rhyme sets the standard for the album with its child like naivety being thrown into sharp contrast by the cynical and deadpan lead vocals these work especially well on missing a song on divorce which would dove tail nicely into any west end musical climax and the fantastic fishbones and scaredy cats which still makes me laugh nearly twenty years after i first heard it the arrangements on this album are perhaps a little samey however it is a fantastic listen highly recommended
1546826 the first album by halls new trio with blair booth vocals keyboards and anouchka groce guitar vocals drapes his usual lyrical dyspepsia in superficially simple light pop music thats too subtle for its own good while several songs recall the fun boys old partnership with bananarama minus the rhythmic intensity there are fewer echoes of halls subsequent adventures the faint accents here are dixieland swing and latin booth who shares songwriting and lead vocals is a versatile sympathetic collaborator but the album is a bit down the middle dull lacking any strong stylistic personality after years of making music neck deep in atmosphere hall isnt served well by such understatement as pleasant as these tunes are none of them has the memorable mettle of his best
1546827 home terry halls first solo album is a surprisingly polished collection of mainstream pop rock produced by the lightning seeds ian broudie theoretically the setting is entirely too smooth for halls limited vocal skills but the results are quite enjoyable since he and broudie have cleverly arranged each song to emphasize the strengths of terrys detached vocals while there is a bit of filler scattered throughout the album the record is supported by pleasantly jangling pop songs that help make home halls strongest effort since the colourfield
1546828 i just found this album when looking to replace my much loved copy of the excellent virgins amp philistines and bought it on trust the music has progressed from those heady days in the early 1980s but remains distinctively terry hall bouncing guitar cynical humourous lyrics some brilliant phrasing if you liked the other stuff youll enjoy this from track one on my favourite tracks so far forever j i drew a lemon fools garden meets the kinks whats wrong with me but as usual all the songs are strong
1546829 terry halls career is the perfect example of the law of diminishing returns after breaking up the specials to form the fun boy three it was apparent fb3 could never eclipse its parent group the colourfield failed to capitalise on the hit single thinking of you and by the time the vegas album had drifted effortlessly into the remaindered bin it was looking like terry would never again trouble the pop world again not to be discouraged terry recruited ex smiths sideman craig gannon lightening seed ian broudie xtc front man andy partridge and ex haircut one hundred singer nick haywood as writing partners and began creating one of the most accomplished albums of his career terry and craig put together a band and in contrast to most of terrys previous vehicles went on the road with ian broudie back in the producers chair he had occupied back in the colourfield days the album was launched with 45 forever j which put terry back in the music press if not the charts the album which followed lived up to all exceptions with the fantastic you and sense the later of which became a hit for the lightening seeds over highlights would be i drew a lemon moon on your dress and no no no which was going to be issued as a single but inexplicably deleted prior to issue if not a perfect return to form this album was at least a precursor as to the heights terry would later achieve with his next album to paraphrase the song if ifs and ands were pots and pans terry would be a kitchen
1546830 a sadly neglected pop classic sprinkled with sarcastic fairy dust
1546831 in 1995 terry released a new ep called rainbows this was released on two cd singles the first single featured the main track chasing a rainbow which was co written by blurs damon albarn the second track mistakes was co written by ian broudie lightning seeds who also produced the first two tracks the third track was a live recording of see no evil taken from a 1994 manchester university gig this recording together with two live recordings on the second cd single also appeared on the promo version of the unreleased single no no no the final track of the first cd single was a live recording of the specials ghost town performed with tricky during a 1995 gig the second cd single also featured chasing a rainbow and ghost town but with two live versions of terrys best remembered songs the fun boy threes our lips are sealed and the colourfields thinking of you a promo video for the single was produced featuring terry with a bevy of female musicians both damon albarn and tricky had cited terry as a major influence in their own careers
1546832 a fantastically stylish collaboration between dave stewart ex eurythmics and terry hall
1546833 in 1992 i predicted this would be the hit album of the year ive been wrong before and will no doubt be wrong again it seemed the perfect duo dave steward from electro pop band the eurythmics and terry hall journeyman singer of the specials pedigree first single and album opener possessed b w the day it rained forever was the perfect fanfare for this new group and it ticked all the boxes that it failed to chart was a surprise not only to me but also to bmg who had put there whole corporate muscle behind the release securing the possessed video being played on heavy rotation on all tv stations charles aznavours she was chosen as the second single to showcase the bands commercial side and again it failed to chart allowing the album to stagger uncertainly into woolworths where i got my copy still expecting to be the first to hear the next big thing it is a great album with classic tracks as shes alright take me for what i am and the brilliant the trouble with lovers but it turned out i was into a great underground band rather than the world beating act i was anticipating by the time the third single walk into the wind was released the band had done just that even so the occasional detour into vegas is always welcome
1546834 so now the place lies in ruin the way you lied and ruined me
1546835 this album is so special it was apparently written as a response to the breakdown of terry s marriage and this is some result touching beautiful songs wonderful harmonies i still havent stopped playing it yet a song for every bitter sweet mood essential
1546836 having adored terrys earlier album home another five star release i bought laugh the day it came out and loved it too but today i listened to it all the way through for the first time in a while and it really struck me all over again what a total work of melancholy genius it is the melodies are enchanting the lyrics heart wrenching and beautiful i was blubbing by the first chorus of the first track again the production wonderful i really cant understand why laugh is such a little known gem as its so lovely honest and truly superb
1546837 this album is beautiful and moving terry s vocals are exquisite the lyrics touching and the production is great
1546838 terry has always blended perfect sweet pop with wit and honesty
1546839 actually a good album from this both loved and hated singer former of the specials fun boy three the colourfield and featured in various collaborations not one annoying song and lots of very nice ones feels like good old terry hall and a perfect album to have playing in the background on a good busy day
1546840 terry hall iconic former specials fun boy three colourfield frontman and also a seriously talented singer songwriter in his own right incredibly influential eg blur quote him as a major influence responsible for some of the finest musical moments of the last 25plus years and some of them are on this album of course most people already know and love ghost town the song was a final bow before terry lynval and neville left the specials to form the fun boy three what a way to go but some of the songs here are taken from albums and whilst not exactly mainstream the craftmanship and sheer brilliance is clear throughout even with the fun boy three numbers a band who admitted they didnt know what they were doing when they started out this album takes you from his early days in the late seventies through to the early nineties unfortunately it has never been updated to include any of his more recent songs however the quality of the songs shine through and you are left admiring the man for his diversity and willingness to try new things give this album a go i promise you that you will love this and hope that this is a stepping stone to buy more albums by terry hall fb3 specials the colourfield buy it
1546841 the complete terry hall like its predecessor terry hall the collection is a collection of the work terry hall put out with the specials fun boy three the colourfield and terry blair and anoushta from 1979 to 1989 when he was signed to chrysalis records
1546842 it seems like every few years terry hall pops up in some new outfit puts out an album or two then moves on to the next project
1546843 this is one of the most infectious things hall has ever appeared on
1546844 in 1995 terry dueted with marijine from the pop band salad on help the war child album to raise money and awareness for the plight of children in the former yugoslavia they covered the mama and papas song dream a little dream its likely that terry was introduced to salad by ian broudie who had produced some of their records later terry worked with salads paul kennedy on the track bang went forever the 20 track album was recorded mixed and released within record time the final track listing was not even available to be printed on the cd sleeve the album featured a range of artists including oasis blur suede the charlatans sinead oconnor and neneh cherry an accompanying tv programme was also produced showing terry and marijine in the studio recording the song
1546845 nearly god is the first of trickys own releases in 1996 tricky has already appeared on terry halls rainbows ep released in 1995 with a live version that they did together of the specials song ghost town the specials were one of trickys biggest early musical influences
1546846 in 1996 terry appeared along with a number of other artists on trickys nearly god project
1546847 and if thats not enough proof check out the stoney goodness of
1546848 the original 2 tone hero returns to his ska roots for the first time since his all conquering heyday with the specials
1546849 with terry i thought it would be a great mix to do something with dance music but also have that ska vibe
1546850 the first time he listened to the track he really had to prevent himself singing the specials gangsters
1546851 lautrec is simon rogers of slacker fame and the following song features the vocal of none other than terry hall of the specials and fun boy three
1546852 another familiar figure from sin ads roster of collaborations is former specials singer terry hall
1546853 in 1998 terry dueted with sinead oconnor on a cover of danas all kinds of everything for an album of eurovision covers the project was tied in with channel 4s eurotrash programme with a special programme showing promo videos for most of the album tracks the album sleeve notes suggest terry had a organisation role in the album as well he gave a short interview to the times promoting the album as well as going to japan to promote it the album features a number of artists including kenickie dubstar edwyn collins st etienne and a special one off reformation of the original bananarama line up no singles were released from the album on the eurotrash programme terry was shown claiming that if the lyrics to all kinds of everything were copyrighted leonard cohen they would be seen as a work of genius as opposed to being denigrated and overlooked due to the eurovision connection viewers of the eurotrash programme were asked to phone in and vote for their favourite track off the album and terry and sinead came second behind bananarama terry had performed with sinead before on a version of terrys monkey in winter which was on the 12
1546854 i met ian in a field in somerset in 1982 or 1983
1546855 i vaguely recall seeing terry at womad but id met him before that too
1546856 if it was just luck you wouldnt have got to the final would you
1546857 there was a period after i produced colourfield when i didnt see terry for a while but i still thought of him as a mate then he phoned up out of the blue and we decided to do a bit of writing together people always think my stuffs really happy and terrys is glum but hes got this wry sense of humour and an odd take on life which makes you chuckle the truth is that some of the lightning seeds most positive and up tempo songs are the ones terry and i co wrote i think our friendship developed because we both had a family and we knew what it was like to try and gain some balance between home and work four or five years ago we did some gigs together in greece and our families came with us it was a bit like a nineties version of the grateful dead but fun i also remember that when i first started gigging with the lightning seeds terry would sing the odd song with me and that was a real confidence booster it would have been a lot harder for me to make the transition from producer to performer without him when youre in a band and your face is known there arent that many people you can go out with knowing that it will be off the record but with terry i can its always seemed like hes been a few steps ahead of me and thats been very useful he knows the score and he has an amazing ability to plough his own furrow both as an artist and as a person
1546858 since the early 1990s terrys name has been increasingly linked to the lightning seeds
1546859 1991 also saw broudies first song writing collaboration with terry hall
1546860 in 1994 before the release of the album later to be titled
1546861 however the album was recorded in much the same way as sense except in a studio and it was taken more seriously most of the same cast were enlisted too such as simon rogers for co production work clive layton for organ terry hall made his appearances by co writing and singing backing vocals as did ian mcnabb much of the album was finished by the end of 1993
1546862 terry also featured on the lightning seeds third album jollification he co wrote and appeared on the song lucky you which was the first single released prior to the album however the single failed to make the top 40 it is a great song however it does need time to grow on you and therefore after the success of other singles on the album lucky you was re released as the final single off the album to much greater success
1546863 of course terry hall has co writing credits on this album
1546864 in 1996 terrys fans could also look towards the lightning seeds for the release of new songs the single what if was released to significant chart success the single was co written by terry shortly after what if came the fourth lightning seeds album dizzy heights along with what if terry co wrote two other album highlights the deliciously cynical imaginary friends and the sublime like you do which would have made a great single indeed the title was used for the seeds greatest hits collection
1546865 the album reached 11 in the uk album charts with the singles
1546866 ready for the 1997 christmas market the lightning seeds released a greatest hits collection which featured nearly 1 of the tracks co written by terry
1546867 i get to do what i love doing which is writing songs but then hand the responsibility of promoting it to someone else
1546868 the album tilt features ian collaborating with a few of his old mates namely terry hall and steven jones from babybird plus some new friends to work with
1546869 ian he annouced that they would play a final lightning seeds gig at liverpool to mark this and so they played at liverpools l2 plus a small series of university graduation balls terry hall joined them at the end of the l2 concert by singing a song called our lips are sealed originally written for fun boy three
1546870 it aint what you do its the way that you do it
1546871 as long as i know tangerine dream and peter baumann some fans and collectors are thinking this is a peter baumann solo recording
1546872 oh its nice you say this because its my own production i did together with my close friend eta koek
1546873 the music is in a style similar to early 1970s tangerine dream and contains a track called td mem
1546874 independent 1980s synth pop that layers synthesizers guitars and textured vocals into tight driving arrangements
1546875 beyond the parade ep is an excellent minimal wave from the us midwest and highly established and sought after by minimal synth fans the world over
1546876 the synth pop brainchild of steve simenic system 56 released as many records as they played shows three
1546877 long ago and far away in a decade known as the 80s there once was a band from cleveland called system 56
1546878 to the extent that we were finding inspiration in those artists i just mentioned system 56 made music which occupied the same musical spectrum it was the rise of the whole do it yourself system so we set out to blend all those notions into our music and mold them into four minute pop songs how well we succeeded in that goal could be best be measured by the fact we were the only independent cleveland based band that managed to chart three singles on commercial fm radio in the three years of our existance without compromising our music objectives
1546879 is it a man is it a woman no this is ronny a french singer who briefly worked with vangelis another one of
1546880 around this time i did some recording at the towlouse studios with pete townshend and an androgynous woman in a trouser suit called ronny she recorded her own single if you want me to stay and then we did a cover version together of the lady is a tramp i thought she was great but a lot of people thought she was just a copy of grace jones i think maybe she had a bit too much attitude she was very parisian very stuck up but actually a very nice person in the video i wore a specially made corset and dress by anthony price and a white wig from savile row because ronny looked like a man i had to play the part of the woman in the end the project was shelved but i not sure if working with pete was such a good idea he had a heroin problem and if i m completly honest i suppose i started dabbling in heroin more regularly around then
1546881 one of the most emblematic groups of the spanish pop
1546882 nukleon picks up the torch from legacy bands like new order and erasure in the electronica dance alternative genre using deep sequenced layers strong phrasing and excellent vocals earth rising evokes motifs and themes of 80s dance alternative with fresh perspectives and well used clich s
1546883 throughout the cds entirety you find yourself teleported from morrissey esque vocals in lucky and infidel to the alphaville melting pot of escort and the unmistakeable tinge of new order in lines do the smooth vocals in sometimes sound like camouflage can i hear the fusion of echo amp the bunnymen and new order in reason and jane the cunfusion i dont know what to do except to put the cd back in and do it all over again and again then a cloud breaks unearthing the epiphany that earth rising stands alone the musical influences are unmistakebly there but it is completely nukleon and a shining example of why electronic music is a drug it drags you back ever willingly for more of its hypnotic pulsing and your quench is never thirsted um your thirst is never quenched breaking with traditional reviews ill continue with artist comparisons simply because it is easy for most people to understand comparisons the album storms out with mars a seering synth anthem infused with vocal cuts of travel to mars it hits with the intensity of an anvil dropping on your head the only possible flaw is that it is probably a little longer than it should be but thats just a personal preference of mine otherwise an outstanding example of modern synthpop lucky bounces in with a throbbing synth bassline as morrisseys ghost lends a hand in the vocals oh thats dan burke not morrissey sorry i can be forgiven for getting lost in the lush smith like vocals because the song is as flowing as some of their best work and their influences are lavishly strong that said the song is otherwise completely nukleon in every way a thoroughly damned good song escort sees nukleon changing direction with a simple bassline and a percussion track a little out of tune with the rest of the album is this bad noooooo the song has that old traditional hook that keeps you coming back for more but without a catchy melodic synth in sight weird but dan pulls it off anyway one can be forgiven for thinking this song belongs somewhere else the vocal style is sometimes freakishly close to alphaville but the similarity ends there once again dan manages to resurrect the ghost of an old favourite alphaville in this song while still managing to pull off a completely original hit i wont even attempt to explain what i mean by that so you figure it out yourself infidel starts out with a completely fake marching drum which i personally dont enjoy it might have sounded better with the real thing but then that just wouldnt be in keeping with the album which is everything electronic a driving bassline chimes in and the song is on the move and doesnt stop spurred on by 9 11 its no wonder this songs keeps driving forward without a break in sight very catchy with a seering synth lead that annoyingly stays in your head after several listens okay annoyingly is the wrong word but i think you get the picture you wont forget this song quickly the album moves along with sometimes and this is where nukleon explodes into the stratosphere emotional deep saddening depressing hopefulness hopelessness pick an adjective and youll find it somewhere in this song an extremely moving track somewhere between ballad and dance yes ballad and dance it is a completely unforgettable masterpiece this is definitely a favourite on the album out jumps homewrecker in a revamped version of the original a throbbing bassline with driving synths keep the song intense throughout my only gripe is perhaps the vocal snippets at the beginning which dont seem to fit in with the song at least not for me the volume control is a little off in places and is noticeable where the kick drum comes in at the beginning not a huge gripe and for the most part very tame but sometimes i get picky this version is immeasurably better than the original so kudos for that and morrissey pops his head in again near the end lines slides away a little from the rest of the album and you feel an air of new order creeping in both in the vocals and song structure its not immediately catchy in much the same way as a new order song usually isnt but quickly grabs hold after a few spins reasons sounds like something i have heard somewhere before by the doors or echo well the vocals have this doorsey feeling to them so i cant help saying that the music in this song departs completely from the rest of the album but still manages to fit in i loathe to say that it sounds orchestral in parts because that would probably throw a few people off so let me say that the song is completely synthpop in every way and then go on to contradict myself by saying that it sounds orchestral if youve ever heard blancmanges waves youll probably understand what i mean excellent jane is another reworked nukleon song which although very enjoyable is difficult for me to give an objective opinion on the original version is so ingrained in my head that an objective opinion is almost impossible for me i simply prefer the originals endearing untamed rawness one thing that carried over from the original is the missing bassline it seems a little weak leaving the driving beat to carry the momentum on its own that said the song is still enjoyable one more day surpasses the majesty of sometimes beautiful melodic and completely immersive with lyrics that many can identify with the message of complete hopelessness depression and darkness is contrasted by the pleads of spurious hope and light at the end of the tunnel that silver lining that often needs to be blatantly thrust into ones face the song is melodic flowing and absolutely amazing majestic 7 minutes into one more day a hidden instrumental gem appears a few vocal snippets burble everyday terms in a robotic tone but otherwise the song is an imaginative instrumental done in an alphaville style ahhh the secret to those vocals i do know but will never tell then just as you start enjoying the song it ends oh well nothing a quick stop play on the deck cant sort out if nukleon is not in the minds of every lover of electronic music out there it will be a crime truly enjoyable truly memorable and worth every cent

1546885 its here at last earth rising is the long awaited hugely anticipated debut album from nukleon one of synthpops brightest talents and what a cracker it is 10 stunning tracks including lucky the huge dance floor hit debuts rarely come bigger or better than this one i have been following nukleon alias dan burke since his appearance on the first electricity compilation and with so many different samplers and downloads its great to have everything together on one cd at long last just so that things dont get boring though there are new versions of some of the songs you may have heard before keeping everything fresh and up to date as i said nukleon is one of synthpops brightest talents and listening to this cd you will see why all the songs have a real dance floor quality to them while the vocals are delivered with strength and a touch of morrisey the lyrics go from playful on songs like homewrecker to powerful on lucky and infidel while the closing one more day has an epic feel to it every tune on earth rising is as catchy as can be but with an originality that makes the album stand out from the rest cohaagen music have given us yet another quality synthpop cd earth rising is sure to be going round and round on your cd player for some time to come this is perfection so go on and enjoy it

1546903 i bought this because i had heard steve miller sing
1546904 this is the most different miller album of all his career seems like steve wanted to create a bookmark in his constant style album list and change just for a moment the direction of his creativity process the only way to do it was to make a cover album and what a cover album he recorded all the songs are very good jazzy and full of a soul ballad style rarely listened on steve ben sidran on keyboards supports stevie guitar miller in songs played with a lot of heart god bless the child just a little mary ann the finest moments occurs when miller croons ooooooh and strums his guitar very very patiently recommendable when youre happy and need to share your happiness with the one you love
1546905 this ones timeless his choice of covers and the fabulous renditions of them will always be among my favorites its the only steve miller i own so maybe this isnt one for the hard core steve miller band fans but it is for anyone who likes a soulful jazzy smooth as caramel take on some great songs
1546906 i had like so many other people forgot about this 1988 release from miller
1546907 zip a dee doo dah and breathes life in the old lee dorsey tune
1546908 red top pull the album back up and make the album worth having
1546909 more like low end fusion and smooth jazz it contains electric drums and basically just programed music with ben on vocals his words in the songs seem more like poetry that jazz i do not recommend it
1546910 this cd is great i buy copies of this to give to my friends
1546911 ben sidrans musical persona has always been one of cool cat hipster talk singing his songs in a style reminiscent of his mentor mose allison
1546912 low end jazz a wonderful cd for those with very basic and uninformed ear simplistic and sutle
1546913 the follow up to the popular on the cool side this recording captures ben sidran live in concert with his working band and a couple of guests alto saxophonist phil woods and longtime pal guitarist steve miller
1546914 wide river is a great latter day album from the steve miller band even though it was recorded in 1993 it still sounds like 1977 never ended when you listen to it anything on this album would have been right at home on greatest hits 1974 1978 with the music still sounding like a pop version of the allman brothers bands brothers and sisters the fact that miller like most 70s rockers advocates sanctions on indonesia in retaliation for that countrys trumped up drug smuggling conviction of a young australian tourist makes this cd cassette an essential purchase for both your ears and your conscience
1546915 i think this album is what people expected as a follow up to book of dreams it has the fat guitar tones and mix of fly like an eagle and book of dreams it is also the same songwriting style of those albums the only thing different from fly like an eagle is that the experimental synth intros are not there if cds held 150 minutes of music i would have book of dreams fly like an eagle and wide river all on one cd
1546916 we are evaluating internal and external candidates for the role and both blitz the league ii and mortal kombat vs dc universe as well as other projects in the chicago studio are on track for successful launches
1546917 no longer with midway and will be pursuing other opportunities
1546918 there is no doubt as to whether the current administration committed war crimes
1546919 my elbow really hurts i guess i should see a doctor
1546920 dont do that theres a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything quicker an cheaper than a doctor simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it it only costs 10
1546921 well son let me try to explain it this way im the breadwinner of the family so lets call me capitalism your mom shes the administrator of the money so well call her the government were here to take care of your needs so well call you the people the nanny well consider her the working class and your baby brother well call him the future now think about that and see if that makes sense
1546922 dad i think i understand the concept of politics now
1546923 good son tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about
1546924 well while capitalism is screwing the working class the government is sound asleep the people are being ignored and the future is in deep shit
1546925 when i am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit i put a glass of vodka next to the water glass if i start to get nervous i take a sip

1546928 ive just got one more dream that i need to fulfil before i move on

1546930 i cant really answer any questions about retirement until the seasons over and work through it with the coaches and partner olivia and the family as well
1546931 its just at a stage where its very inflamed and it just needs to be carefully managed
1546932 i guess i havent really sat down and reflected on it i havent had the opportunity
1546933 im just excited because ive got some family and some friends who are going to come and watch the game that has probably got in the way of me thinking about what it actually means
1546934 i might reflect on it on sunday night with a quiet ale
1546935 hey this would have awesome potential as a point and click adventure game
1546936 an outsider navigating the criminal underworld of a major city
1546937 a young gang soldier involved in the internal power struggle for control of his gang
1546938 such as assembling a sniper rifle to complete an assassination mission and smashing locks and hotwiring cars to steal them
1546939 an outsider navigating the criminal underworld of a major city
1546940 a young gang soldier involved in the internal power struggle for control of his gang
1546941 while the graphical plummet from grand theft auto iv to whatever the nintendo ds can spit out will certainly make it a strain on the eyes
1546942 you can hang on the dock till they get back in
1546943 having to stay still whiile firing in first person mode
1546944 game a has better controls and camera than game b therefore game b is inferior as a whole and vastly overrated
1546945 to keep dick clark looking the same every year the camera crew moves the camera back three feet so this year dick clark will be in times sqare while the camera will be positioned in bermuda
1546946 t lex was one of the most famous bands of the
1546947 making techno in the late 70s and early 80s telexs sound was extememly ahead of its time and the group laid one of the foundations upon which techno and house music stand check out
1546948 telex is a rare crew that really didnt get much fame in the 80s the music of telex was mostly played in underground disco clubs
1546949 i grew up a big telex fax while living in belgium and seeing the original albums reissued with obvious immense care is very satisfying
1546950 if you are buying this cd i suspect that you are probably one of 1 of all music listeners in the world who ever heard of this band and i dont need to tell you about this band
1546951 belgian electronic music group telex issued its second album in 1980 and with it created its lasting legacy
1546952 their bizarre sense of humour led them to meet the sparks without any doubt the other contenders for the weirdness prize of the year and they fell in love with each other in fact the sparks stayed in brussels for two years working on telex productions this album was in fact their only true collaboration and the last telex pop album ron and russell mael wrote all the lyrics on this one filling the album with strange and hilarious stories of alienation hazy love sigmund freud dancing at a party and other crazy pieces while telex tried to go new wave and wrote classic structured pop songs with complex production and arrangements the result worked fine they even had a minor hit in england with havent we met somewhere before and zz top became their ultimate fans they would go back to minimalistic arrangements and typical electro sound three years later on wonderful world so this album stands alone in their discography but it is worth investigating for its pop side and nicely written lyrics and melodies
1546953 a reissue and remaster of the third album of telex which first came out in 1981
1546954 this is telex at their best kraftwerk with warmth humor amp a stronger pop sensibility telex were fresh and inventive when they first came into the music world and they sound as vital and unique close to 20 years later this and wonderful world were their creative peak and should not be missed too bad they dont have more then 5 stars
1546955 this reissue is a straight compilation no bonus tracks of telexs last 2 cds wonderful world 1984 and looney tunes 1988
1546956 telex looney tunes atlantic these disco mad belgian technopoppers take off like a computer run amuck
1546957 i am about as big a telex fan as you will ever find anywhere
1546958 this collection is great if you want to discover telex in their original sound well actually some song have been highly remastered but this is still the original instrumentation a must have for 80s music lover who want to know what have been done outside british pop music also a great choice for techno lover who wants to learn about electronic music avant gard music of the 80s
1546959 telex one of the true electronic music pioneers along with kraftwerk comes from my home country belgium
1546960 the first song i ever heard by telex was peanuts rock rock when i was about 15 in a dance club and i loved them for their off beat deep grooves innovative sequencing and funky samples this album introduced me to many song that i had never heard before but have grown to love especially raised by snakes if you like groovy old electronic music like kraftwerk or yellow magic orchestras first album then you will love this album ill never sell it back to the used cd store its classic
1546961 i cant believe that i am just now getting into telex this stuff is awesome for the electronic muzic snobs that have heard it all you have to have these telex albums if you love kraftwerk then its on to telex its really a sham that nobody turned me onto this i thought i heard it all and had it all now i have collect these albums pure electronics
1546962 the series instigated by carl craig continues with this slightly superior volume compared to volume 1 on this cd others legends of detroit have their chance to shine juan atkins does most weighing in with two great remixes but the best track by far here is by new jersey based morgan geist his wonderful remix of rendevous dans le spacs really sounds way ahead of all the other songs on this album despite this album being the better of the two volumes his mix is brilliantly 80s sounding with that touch of 90s thrown in for good measure
1546963 telex is along with kraftwerk one of the most influential electro bands around
1546964 after nearly a decade of either banishment or preparation to take over the world depending on your perspective telex is back with a new release
1546965 telex is back with their first real material since 1985 and with a cover
1546966 making something really european different from rock without guitar and the idea was electronic music
1546967 we had hoped to finish last but portugal decided otherwise we got ten points from them and finished on the 19th spot
1546968 before joining marc moulin to become the man behind the synth knobs of telex lacksman recorded a couple moog lps a bit in the style of roger roger silly fun but also groovy at times or just plain beautiful when adding wordles vocals
1546969 the freshly founded musique belgique archive a lowlands records subdivision dedicated to long lost forgotten treasures in the history of belgian music is proud to present the re release of electronic systems disco machine on cd and lp its an album of seven original compositions from dan lacksman whos better known as being part of the group telex impressively this material was recorded way back 1977 pre dating his involvement with the aforementioned electronic pioneers listening to disco machine not only challenges you to move that body in the direction of the disco floor but more importantly also suggests that dan lacksmans influence for the later telex sound was indeed decisive a perfect example of this is rock machine extremely comparable to twist st tropez the track that was later recorded by telex into one of the craziest cover versions of the french twist hit and also telex first single picture an evening down studio 54 with the kraftwerk guys shaking a leg on the floor with giorgio moroder tangerine dream and klaus schulze and youre not far off the sound and vibe of this project
1546970 this is a cd release from a very rare album that was shortly available in 1977
1546971 dan lacksman who produced and engineered the debut deep forest album wanted to get even more into the studio side of things while eric and michel wanted to make deep forest more of a live thing
1546972 pangea is the second project from dan lacksman the man behind the new age studio dance troupe deep forest like deep forest pangea attempts to fuse danceable polyrhythms with worldbeat textures and synthesizers on the whole pangea has a stronger world music influence than deep forest which means it isnt quite as accessible nevertheless lacksmans knack is for making foreign musics palatable to western tastes and at its best pangea fulfills that promise quite effectively
1546973 deep forest did for african tribal melodies what enigma did for gregorian chants
1546974 often mistakenly credited as a deep forest album it has even been issued as a bootleg under that bands name the confusion comes from the fact that pangea is partly a dan lacksman project after producing deep forests first album he parted company with eric mouquet and michel sanchez when the two wanted to play their music live lacksman claiming that such a project was strictly a studio affair he then recruited two belgian musicians and a musicologist to record what sounds like the second deep forest album he had in mind using hours of original ethnic tapes deep forests sounds were all extracted from commercial cds the band came out with a very good set of ambient soundscapes and tunes and lacksmans meticulous production is faultless clearly better than anything deep forest has came up with since and the artwork colourful and brilliant is the work of michel moers from lacksmans former band telex
1546975 from the producer of deep forest dan lacksman this is a must for any deep forest fan
1546976 i love this album it is my favorite one each song is a carefully crafted experience of the sounds of africa from the fantastic intro lulling you into the experiance to the wonderful interweaving of human voices both male and female included you will listen to thunder showers the animals and insects and rhythms from the prehistorical world of pangea even the sound of the african foriegn words is beautiful to listen to
1546977 born to be alive plastic bertrand and thijs van leer from the band focus
1546978 some of the heaviest keyboard funk recorded in europe during the early 70s all the work of the jazz rock combo placebo headed up by the legendary marc moulin
1546979 after years of neglecting a much in demand for placebo vinyls mostly due to acid jazz and techno artists frequent sampling from his albums some label finally took to interest to release at least parts of the placebo records that are becoming scarce on the market by issuing this compilation of the best tracks of the three vinyls
1546980 best of xxx this album is really out for the best tracks of an album which is actually rarely the case usually being the
1546981 a crucial bit of keyboard funk from the 70s a wild album of many moods recorded in 1974 and featuring the talents of keyboard whiz marc moulin
1546982 the gradual demise of placebo was a slow process the group playing its last concerts during 76 but by that time their leader marc moulin was already working on different project often messing about with cos but also released his first solo album in early 75 which would like placebos albums become highly influential especially in acid jazz and trip hop circles around the millennium change
1546983 in short the masterplan although never commited to either memory or paper was for tackhead to take dub funk on a journey through leftfield and into the unknown to god knows where and then for fats comet to pilot the mothership smoothly back from this alternative dimension to a safe earthly landing with sounds that you would recognise instantly without ever having heard before

1546985 i think im one of those people who just isnt at home because i moved around a lot as a kid there isnt any place that i can really go back to
1546986 having previously heard anna domino i was expecting something more polished more smooth more like sade but much cooler
1546987 recordings at crepescule with luc van acker and virginia astley resulted in this 4 tracker issued as a 12
1546988 after relocating from new york to brussels in 1985 anna domino cut this magical album with the aid of two top flight producers alan rankine associates and marc moulin telex the record proved a major independent success thanks largely to annas confessional lyrics and reflective vocals combined with sophisticated songs and sharp rhythmic styles in particular check out not right now the crystalline proto trip hop of caught and the near hit singles rhythm summer and take that the album also includes a smart cover of the smokey robinson miracles classic hunter gets captured by the game comparisons have ranged from suzanne vega to julee cruise the five bonus cuts include all the non album tracks from the 1984 ep rhythm plus the outstanding single remix of summer by legendary new york producer arthur baker and also zanna a collaboration with onetime revolting cock luc van acker
1546989 a state of resigned half awareness lifts these uncensored confessionals beyond the precipice this is the sound of dusk seasons sublime elegance and supernatural light
1546990 though recorded for an indy label in the damp north of england anna dominos self titled full length feels like the soundtrack to a summer holiday on the mediterranean coast of france its really a fusion combining the snap your fingers coolness of cocktail jazz with relaxing after party synthetics and electronic beats as a vocalist domino shows a lot of finesse she lacks the range and richness of a singer like tracey thorn but this gives her voice a chic listless appeal had she been born thirty years earlier domino would undoubtedly have been an infamous lounge chanteuse a few of the overproduced tracks on this album do skirt dangerously close to the adult contemporary genre but most of the music feels just right and as you would expect ltm does their usual first class job with the liner notes and bonus tracks when the gray winter comes this cd will help you remember the warm sunshine
1546991 although born in tokyo anna has pretty much lived everywhere from ottawa to nyc and it seems like shes picked up a little of her style from every place shes touched
1546992 ive really come to be a big fan of ms
1546993 a consistently melodic album with several standouts notably the ambitious baroque kate bush stylings of the title track the serene ballad lake and the excellent single tempting a triumph of understated infectious pop
1546994 her best and most enduring collection of songs this time displays an impressive range of moods and styles and represents that ultra rarity the glossy but memorable album from 1987 that you will still want to own quite a result
1546995 on her first american album anna domino showed flashes of considerable promise setting her delicate guitar and voice amidst keyboard heavy backdrops created with co writer michel delory
1546996 i find that this time is rather tedious it has some good stuff on it including the song
1546997 i have speak up in defense of this time though i agree that its not as good as colouring in the edge and the outline
1546998 im being produced by flood so i might as well try to sound like yaz
1546999 this is a 6 song ep it begins sounding mainstream and forgettable but later songs are more individual and interesting it grew on me unlike her previous albums
1547000 i like this ep very much it could well be my favourite anna domino album even though i probably agree mysteries of america is a better album i guess i just havent listened to that one enough yet
1547001 neither of her albums has gotten to second base with me and not because im unwilling all three eps score here she croons about metaphysical sounding stuff like luck and joy over the snaky electrorhythms that in her past work were all too metaphysical themselves and never sounds like staminas her long suit
1547002 i wish you were here in this afternoon under a sulphur and stiffing sky until stones and tumble will light this room and the storm finally will burst into my eyes
1547003 i can be cruel and gentle depending on my mood
1547004 youll never know how fun i would have should you see me when im really mad
1547005 to anna the biggest mystery was why america had never noticed
1547006 my personal favorite is mysteries of america which is better than everything before it and worth paying expensive prices for unfortunately unlike her previous work it was never released in north america and is not easy to find mysteries of america is brilliant
1547007 mysteries of america was produced by anton sanko who used to play with suzanne vega and also co produced her album days of open hand
1547008 when anna domino left the ottawa that was her adolescent home she left for good
1547009 i think im one of those people who just isnt at home
1547010 because i moved around a lot as a kid there isnt any place that i can really go back to this is a place that ive landed in and its as at home as its ever going to be
1547011 it feels so strange to be going up there to play now
1547012 im so happy about it but at the same it seems like it should have happened a decade ago
1547013 an earlier collection of anna dominos work favorite songs from the twilight years surfaced in canada in 1996 but dreamback takes the one otherwise unavailable song from there the twangy
1547014 years of research have led me to the obvious when i was twelve i took guitar lessons above a shop called the blue note from an old looking man who sat and smoked and had me listen to the classics scratchy old blues and folk records songs of drunk wives and trains and murder and trains and jail and heroes on trains michel and i arranged it and invited a band called lazy boy to play on it as well as other old friends we arent quite done early 1997 id say
1547015 ive been trying to figure out what exactly snakefarm is since i first came up with the idea
1547016 these things i have done you can do as well
1547017 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss it is the result of careful precautions
1547018 the undoubtedly very good first half result should not allow us to lose sight of the major challenges that lie ahead our company has the great opportunity to emerge relatively stronger from the increasingly difficult market and competition situation that we find ourselves in we have laid the foundations and will not jeopardize our future we have shown in the past that we are prepared for these kinds of situations and are capable of reacting to them our financial strength and operating adaptability will grant us the opportunity to remain profitable and strong and to continue to make our company more attractive for our shareholders customers and employees
1547019 keep an eye out for more littlebignews in a few days
1547020 mark can the psn have sackboy avators that would be so cool since there hasnt been any new ones in a while i know i would rock it
1547021 i dont get this game and im the only one
1547022 theyre talking about december because it is the best event of the year
1547023 she wanted it really to be kept a secret for a long time
1547024 i think there have been enough boobs in the fbi agents have reportedly seized diaries belonging to actress anne hathaway in relation to her fraud case
1547025 i hated him racing when he crashed in 2001 i never wanted him to race again
1547026 but he said to me mum you might as well cut off my arms and legs if you say i cant race
1547027 it was what he loved he died doing what he loved best we do take comfort from that the word
1547028 i think my overall reaction is that its really sad that in 2008 i have people watching every single move i make
1547029 when theres a big game between the cubs and brewers going on its sad that thats what their focus is on and the last thing i had heard is that when you want to do a story on someone you contact them
1547030 the university is committed to diversity as evidenced by the development of the onewvu program our coaches and staff also are committed to an atmosphere of community for our student athletes i look forward to speaking with pat more about his thoughts
1547031 weenie greenie espn radios mike greenberg gives us all a lesson in arrogance
1547032 after two weeks when i lost in the second and first rounds and against an opponent like isner who is not easy to play i was pretty solid
1547033 i have a chance to be seeded and thats my goal its a huge difference if you are seeded at the u s open or not because you can play rafael nadal in the first round
1547034 i think i am playing pretty well for this first match it was a pretty good performance i just need to stay aggressive and move on from here
1547035 its not just about the sport its about the image of china
1547036 weve waited and waited so long for the olympics to start
1547037 i feel proud i just hope nothing more goes wrong
1547038 i think having golf an olympic sport is exponentially more important to the game of golf than the majors
1547039 it would bring in 168 different countries and their olympic foundation and all those revenues and that would be going towards the growth of the game of golf
1547040 the majors are incredibly big as we know but we still capture the same audience that are already interested in the game
1547041 the olympics brings us to new markets on a worldwide scale and i cant imagine how big the game can become in countries like china and india that has so many more people than the united states does
1547042 the first opportunity for it to be an olympic sport would be 2016
1547043 our tv contracts and sponsor contracts typically end in 2012
1547044 there would be plenty of time to factor that into the equation its only once every four years its not a big disruption by any means
1547045 i dont think that golf should be an olympic sport at all
1547046 i dont think basketball should be an olympic sport i dont think tennis should be an olympic sport
1547047 if i was running the olympics i would go back to the way it was originally gymnastics weight lifting swimming track and field marathons
1547048 ive always been a player who prepares for tournaments by playing matches and this time of year ive always done really well thats why this year and next week are important they will give a proper read on how my form is going in there
1547049 i dont feel like ive got a foot forward in the last four months
1547050 losing and not playing well for a stretch is a lot easier because you feel responsible for it to not be able to play is frustrating and something i havent really had to deal with before
1547051 the ranking i am not too concerned about because its not like i have been out there playing and not getting the results when i have been healthy through april and even the start of the claycourt season i was playing well
1547052 i am sure that when i am watching the events ill certainly miss it and theres going to be a part of me that wishes i was there
1547053 but as far as tennis goes this is probably the best scenario
1547054 at this point in my career i am trying to focus on making runs at grand slams i didnt feel like flying across the world and back and then starting a grand slam four days later was the ideal preparation
1547055 he is the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember that dancing was a sin and the beer was served in a bucket but is he ready to lead
1547056 hay america i am paris hilton and i am a celebrity too only i am not from the olden days and i am not promising change like that other guy i am just hot
1547057 meanwhile the mccain campaign revealing that it had received an
1547058 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1547059 but i think the captaincy might curb his flair as a player
1547060 youve got to look at who will make a difference in the dressing room i thought they might appoint a younger bloke like alastair cook and build him up thats what happened to me
1547061 i am not going to be a wimp and say im not going to do it
1547062 im going to accept this challenge and im going to give it a real good go like i give everything in my life a go
1547063 too much money that i can better spend someplace else
1547064 even the ancient navajos added sheep fat to turquoise to enrich the colors he says
1547065 me mia samantha the girl with the hannah montana bandaid and jasmine not the disney princess
1547066 hunter who is very wild and zach who is very nice

1547070 without om shanti bath salts i simply refuse to bathe

1547072 there is a difference between visual thinking and the process of visualization the former is a random attempt to think about some future event or situation when left to chance these thoughts may take the form of negative worry about all of the catastrophic possibilities such negative images can create anxiety and fear wasting your nervous energy jeopardizing your focus and thus increasing the probability of undesirable outcomes

1547102 you think about it think about it forget about it
1547103 hey lets separate everything into separate layers since thats the only way to keep shapes separate except hey lets make it so that editing operations sometimes affect everything the cursor touches oh you didnt want to change the background layer too bad you forgot to lock it
1547104 plus how can you rearrange scenes afterwards it seems that you have to create them in order
1547105 okay theres also movie clips but when you use those you cant actually see them in action until youve exported the movie
1547106 and is there a way to at least hint to flash how to tween two shapes for a shape tween
1547107 there seems to be no rhyme or reason to it
1547108 so what would your recommendation be for complex things which involve lots of little mini scenes with a couple of overarching graphical things which cant be easily split up into the separate scenes should i turn each mini scene into a separate graphic
1547109 say is there a way to label frames with different colors
1547110 can you actually zoom out on the timeline so that you can fit more frames on the screen
1547111 this is a huge first step this will fundamentally change the landscape in mississippi death investigation which for 20 years has been tainted by steven haynes misconduct and shoddy work while this is an important beginning there are other steps the state needs to take
1547112 the department of public safety has given steve hayne 90 days to compile pending autopsy reports and turn them over to the state the state should also have him submit a detailed list of all cases he has handled in mississippi over the last 20 years along with documentation from those cases and the state should take immediate action to prevent any documents on haynes work from being destroyed

1547139 she heard footsteps and when she turned around she was knocked over the head and knocked unconscious when she woke up she was being violated
1547140 i know a number of the neighbors have responded if there is anything they can do they are there for her

1547143 what this means is that were going to see some more relief at the pump were probably looking at another 10 cents of downside in retail gas prices
1547144 that has taken a lot of pressure off the market it looks like the thinking is that we dodged another bullet
1547145 any market that really doesnt respond to seemingly bullish news is often a tip off that were going lower
1547146 they still have expensive gas to feed into the system so theyre reluctant to drop prices
1547147 prices never come down as fast as they go up
1547148 the market is increasing the odds now that the drilling deal will get done and we will see more production coming out of the gulf of mexico
1547149 hell just be a little tropical storm tike compared to big mammas that rip things up and spike gas prices

1547155 gives tennant the chance to show the world that he has the range to tackle the most demanding classical role of all and praise be he seizes it ive seen bolder hamlets and more moving hamlets but few who kept me so riveted throughout
1547156 is at his best though when he dares with his emotions and lets rip
1547157 its pure snobbery to suppose that doctor who fans and people who can appreciate hamlet are mutually exclusive groups
1547158 tennant is adept at most aspects of the role but he excels when the prince becomes a prankish provocateur
1547159 one of the most richly textured best acted versions of the play we have seen in years
1547160 has no difficulty in making the transition from the bbcs time lord to a man who could be bounded in a nutshell and count himself a king of infinite space
1547161 undoubtedly mesmerising what he lacks in emotional intensity he makes up for with wit humour and stirring energy
1547162 people love writing the story of independent bookstores being foolhardy and failing
1547163 people love that story and thats almost the only thing i get called about a bookstore closes somewhere in manhattan or in new jersey and someone calls and wants a quote about you know how grim it is to be an independent bookstore and i just say i wont talk to you im sick of this story its not even a valid story
1547164 the idea was always to do a store that was a reliable destination bookstore in exactly the same way that barnes amp noble is with a lot less stock
1547165 the idea is that in a lot of sections theres a lot of dross so you can you know take the sections you have and hone them until theyre perfect so take the business section and instead of having it sprawling over an entire wall a total mess and you dont know whats good and whats bad actually focus on the books that people want and have wanted for years and focus on the books that are new that are actually good to have in all of the practical sections a careful deliberate inventory
1547166 it has an image of a rough and tumble industry where you have to be street smart to make deals
1547167 it feels still more like a business that you cant just master going back to business school inherently maybe thats intimidating to women
1547168 you sit in a meeting with all these guys and everybody is just like screaming yelling cursing
1547169 you must never cry if you cry in front of them you lose all credibility
1547170 certainly into the 1980s and 1990s there was a lot more screaming and posturing men didnt think twice about making a woman cry
1547171 he said to me you know faith your competitors company he takes me to vegas he sets me up with girls
1547172 the one and only time i went to the icsc in las vegas it was so gross
1547173 youre staying at these big gambling casinos and at night wed get together for dinner and then theyd go to a strip club im not going to do that what the fuck im not going to watch people humiliate themselves most of my female friends dont go to icsc its a big boys club
1547174 whatever name he announces the goal is for that name to be met with ooooh i didnt think he could get that person oh interesting as opposed to you know weird choice or something
1547175 thats what they need in order to stop once and for all this holt is the fat kid in dodgeball and everyone is calling it names and throwing stuff at it thing
1547176 even if its worn as an undergarment people can totally see that you have one on
1547177 part of being sexy is being edgy and being the bad boy so even if youre not a bad boy wearing a wifebeater gives you that implication
1547178 for the more fashion forward crowd its about the layering effect
1547179 then theres the group that wears the classic hanes beater underneath a polo shirt or a button up both are coming back simultaneously
1547180 that was like 50 years ago and were just not you know him
1547181 you know maybe if i had arms like his then id wear one
1547182 its probably one of the most unforgiving pieces in mens clothing
1547183 you almost have to have the perfect body to pull it off
1547184 it kind of accents the chest a little its more of a mans undergarment equivalent to the womans bra

1547188 sounds like paris is taking the all of the above energy approach that john mccain has advocated both alternatives and drilling
1547189 i have no problem with the color of barack obamas skin but the thinness of it is starting to get to me
1547190 what we have seen over thepast few days has been a mix of improper disclosures of partial information mixed with inaccurate information and then drawn into unfounded conclusions none of that serves the victims their families or the public
1547191 always moves aggressively to get to the bottom of the facts but that does not include mistreatment of anybody and i dont know of any case where thats happened
1547192 that doesnt mean that from time to time people dont make mistakes
1547193 i think im the only person at usamriid who didnt getpolygraphed
1547194 one person said hed sit at his desk and weep
1547195 and the heavens opened and saved me from then on they have been my biggest influence
1547196 but were not going to go back to the old way of doing things of just letting kids pass from grade to grade without having any kind of a proficiency standard
1547197 and when people with influence see that its happening to them theyre going to put some influence and pressure on the political system to change it
1547198 and they keep raising the bar no matter how hard we try we end up having more schools look like theyre not making it
1547199 we take the test seriously but its a challenge because all of the bars keep getting raised
1547200 were going much deeper into the data to track students
1547201 if you have a sizable special education or limited english program its very challenging to make those targets
1547202 sometimes it takes more than a year to get traction with these programs
1547203 the challenge for us is we must go faster and further than any other district in the state
1547204 we know we have to really move up our game
1547205 a trigger point that says your school is a high priority

1547208 so basically what youre saying is that texas law outweighs the federal government and the rest of the world i can live with that
1547209 league officials and myself have concluded that rams fans have in multiple instances been in violation of the leagues personal fan conduct policy
1547210 rather than a more lenient penalty which might promote a perception of permissiveness among the leagues fanbases i have decided to levy a particularly harsh ruling in this case in the hopes that it will send a message to the rest of the league
1547211 i can impose my will as far as my army can reach and my army can reach anywhere you hear anywhere you will obey or be crushed underfoot
1547212 thats just the sort of unacceptable behavior that were trying to stamp out
1547213 breathing im not familiar anyway i find it distasteful please stop
1547214 cardinals seasonll still be going on then right ah okay well then fuck the rams
1547215 its over with gardenhire said after his relievers gave up six runs in the seventh inning on monday
1547216 they have to go back out there and get after it again they may have to be called upon to get outs again that is the life of a bullpen you come in sometimes and get it done and sometimes you dont its just like anything else
1547217 i didnt know they were as big until last week at home
1547218 i dont know if one guy can handle it gardenhire said
1547219 the other guy bass is more resilient he can bounce back i dont know if im going to be able to do it i may have to find out gotta do something
1547220 it would be nice at some point in the year to catch a run he said
1547221 the thing is i didnt get word until the fifth inning that his son was fine kubel said

1547226 and we eventually realized that the program thats really in control is our dna it determines so many areas of life biologically as well as culturally so in that sense dna is the enemy of our freedom we have to fight it
1547227 we only need to fluoridate 40 per cent of the country greater manchester is currently considering it and there are many other areas that are looking at it

1547241 it would then tie in with some of the larger bus routes then taking the moc express and tweaking the route with that and make sure it connects with carta bus routes
1547242 we have food and we have prizes we have school supplies
1547243 we also want to rid the blight of the vacant houses and duplexes because that houses a lot of negative activity
1547244 youth not having a whole lot to do just hanging out as always drug activity gang activity
1547245 theyre our eyes and ears so without them we cant do our job effectively so its team work we need them as much as they need us
1547246 to tell the citizens that are participating in illegal activities that we are taking our neighborhoods back
1547247 we have a very culturally diverse neighborhood we have a lot of ethnicities within our neighborhood and were a very close knit community
1547248 for the neighbors to meet one another and get to know one another and to keep continually looking out for one another and their homes and let everybody know if something is going on

1547253 ive been thinking about it the last three or four years and after this season i decided its time to move on
1547254 that was the most rewarding season ive ever had in coaching because we were down early in the year but were able to come back
1547255 but every year at catholic is rewarding its the best high school in the state of kentucky with great kids to work with
1547256 you would have to be crazy who would want to turn themselves in
1547257 are people actually doing it i really find it hard to believe
1547258 gives you time to make arrangements and take care of your personal matters
1547259 it is a way for you to plan your return home
1547260 we understand the impact it has on them when we knock on their doors early in the morning and take them out of their homes
1547261 they dont want their children to go through the trauma of being arrested in the morning
1547262 noted by ice as a factor in your immigration records
1547263 for anyone to say no one will do it thats absolutely wrong
1547264 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1547265 and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1547266 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised
1547267 todays indictments are a reminder of a growing threat that every american faces in the 21st century the fact that each individuals greatest asset is their names their identity
1547268 that was the first time ever that a computer system was wiretapped
1547269 obviously we werent happy that a person working for us as an informant was double dealing
1547270 omfg you have water damage i cant do anything for you
1547271 we are taking many steps to learn from this experience so that we can grow
1547272 back when i was tomev at microsoft 1992 1994 billg managed to a large degree by bullying
1547273 thats the dumbest idea ive heard since ive been at microsoft
1547274 i know you made a billion dollars yesterday i know youre on the cover of fortune i know you can probably code this whole application in visual basic over the weekend but youre wrong
1547275 hey guys just got the new album and i listen to it everyday i wouldnt think your music would put me in the right mindset to do what i do over here but it does and you guys are awesome keep it up fellas later
1547276 when you have a chance to win and you dont win its always frustrating
1547277 weve had a rough week it would have been a big one to win and get us going
1547278 ive got to put it behind myself its going to be difficult sleeping tonight no doubt but when i wake up in the morning its over and thats how im going to approach it
1547279 it seems like were scratching any way we can to try and get a win
1547280 that was a base running mistake that cost us an out
1547281 what does the bible say about dating nothing and everything our challenge is to think biblically about an activity that isnt in the bible
1547282 even if dating is a worldly notion with which some christians will be uncomfortable it is nonetheless something that most of us cant simply kiss goodbye
1547283 i really believe there are things nobody would see if i didnt photograph them
1547284 she wanted it really to be kept a secret for a long time and i think women should because they should be able to announce what theyre having and when its time to make the announcement
1547285 we just need to make sure that we do things right and give ourselves a chance of staying in the game if we do that anything can happen
1547286 im more than comfortable with the fact that well do particularly well
1547287 its going to be difficult theyre going to be playing in front of their home crowd so theyll be very fired up for the first 20 or 30 minutes well be absorbing pressure no matter what
1547288 theyll all be good players theres not going to be a mug
1547289 once you get a foothold in the game its how we can express ourselves
1547290 the longer you stay in games the more confident new zealand teams get with 20 minutes to go if youre still in the game anything can happen were not there just to defend
1547291 you can talk until youre blue in the face but until you experience it its something pretty different
1547292 were not silly were going to be without the ball for long periods but its defence hasnt been the sole focus on the training pitch weve got players who are potentially very good with the ball and well have a right go at china
1547293 i can agree with steven and i can agree with some of the nay sayers you will never know if
1547294 hey so i saw a news article about this product and found your blog through a google search my question
1547295 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1547296 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1547297 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1547298 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1547299 a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
1547300 personal tax cuts and higher spending on health and education programmes will lead to modest deficits over the next few years
1547301 a weakening economy may also pressure the governments fiscal position however ongoing fiscal discipline is likely to remain the norm even if there is a change of government at the upcoming election
1547302 new zealands high net external indebtedness leaves the banking system very reliant on non resident funding it remains profitable adequately capitalised and demonstrates good asset quality by international standards
1547303 everyone can beat everyone on the day and its certainly making it really enthralling there are some really good match ups and its really fantastic for the game
1547304 we never fired a shot and we couldnt carry out our game plan
1547305 all in all everyone is pretty gutted with what happened
1547306 this is not a novel to be tossed lightly aside it should be thrown with great force
1547307 i was certainly out of my comfort zone id never seen snow before its not as warm as youd want
1547308 weightlifting new zealand hired some for their competitions wed go along and set it up and one time i stayed behind to see what guys my age were lifting i thought i could do that
1547309 my dad met him once or twice before and knew he lived in the area
1547310 that opened my eyes to the future i could have
1547311 i soon started breaking records and went for strength to strength really
1547312 you know drugs are out there you just have to forget about what theyre doing and concentrate on your own training and hope they get caught
1547313 they guys ask what are you on that sort of thing
1547314 if philip roth had gotten his way one scene cut from the film but present in the novel might have been notorious
1547315 its a terrible waste of mana that at a time when maori have a real chance to determine who is in government we are losing people off the roll
1547316 theres a minimum of 120 000 maori in australia he said
1547317 its a terrible indictment on this country that people dont want to stay here its a terrible loss to families iwi and the country
1547318 we are sending contractors up to work the east coast and to the polytech and the wananga weve got electoral stands outside the warehouse and at burger king and were sending all the information to maori media
1547319 this is not a novel to be tossed lightly aside it should be thrown with great force
1547320 you dont know you love them until there really gone
1547321 it only lasted a day you just have to batten down for 24 hours
1547322 this is not a novel to be tossed lightly aside it should be thrown with great force
1547323 this is not a novel to be tossed lightly aside it should be thrown with great force
1547324 our study shows that the efficiency of star cluster formation depends on the environment
1547325 dwarf galaxies closest to virgos crowded center contained more globular clusters than those farther away
1547326 we found few or no globular clusters in galaxies within 130 000 light years from m87 suggesting the giant galaxy stripped the smaller ones of their star clusters
1547327 these smaller galaxies are contributing to the buildup of m87
1547328 with hubble we were able to identify and study about 90 percent of the globular clusters in all our observed fields
1547329 this was crucial for dwarf galaxies that have only a handful of star clusters
1547330 in m87 there are three times as many globulars deficient in heavy elements such as iron than globulars rich in those elements
1547331 this suggests that many of these metal poor star clusters may have been stolen from nearby dwarf galaxies which also contain globulars deficient in heavy elements
1547332 star formation near the core of virgo is very intense and occurs in a small volume over a short amount of time
1547333 it may be more rapid and more efficient than star formation in the outskirts the high star formation rate may be driven by the gravitational collapse of dark matter an invisible form of matter which is denser and collapses sooner near the clusters center m87 sits at the center of a large concentration of dark matter and all of these globulars near the center probably formed early in the history of the virgo cluster
1547334 star formation farther away from the central region was not as robust which may have produced only less massive star clusters that dissipated over time
1547335 globular clusters like to be near the center of the action
1547336 the average pay differential between the public and private sector was between 17 percent and 21 percent
1547337 in addition public sector workers appear to benefit much more from a warm glow belief that in their job they can help others and that their job is useful to society
1547338 in competitive labour markets people would be willing to work for less to feel so good about themselves and their jobs
1547339 so the fact that public sector workers actually get paid 20 percent more is evidence of how out of line wage setting has been in the public sector
1547340 some job factors like stress may be worse in the public sector but others like the work not being physically demanding and not being viewed by the worker as boring are better than for private sector workers
1547341 but i wont be taking any calls from the nzru over the next couple of days
1547342 however if we are not part of it it will have a significant detrimental effect on rugby in the region
1547343 whether we are one of two unions after this they are going to lose a lot of talent because the talent wont want to stay to play just heartland rugby and it will perpetuate a vicious cycle
1547344 i guess there is that little bit of fear we will be dropped we are just trying to be positive and hoping like everyone else that we will be part of the 12

1547348 say there will be a response but that clarification is needed on certain points of the offer
1547349 theyve hit the ball back we must analyse whether its just another way to gain time or if its serious
1547350 the message delivered today is not irans response to the six countries
1547351 if we are not going to receive a clear response a clear message from them we are going to have no choice but to pursue additional measures
1547352 given the equipment our armed forces have an indefinite blockade of the strait of hormuz would be very easy
1547353 they have a very weak economy at this point which depends almost entirely on their oil revenue
1547354 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light

1547359 it is the smart answer to the flimsy wire saws found in many survival kits this tool packed in a can the size of a roll of electrical tape is a 28 inch linked saw which when used with included plastic handles or looped to a bow of wood makes your light back country woodcutting a snap i have been rough with this saw but i have kept it clean sharp and oiled it has never let me down after over ten years of use several times a year
1547360 i am the security officer whom len kiely sexually harassed
1547361 on being told the free government quota of alcohol had been reached mr kiely became upset and proceeded to sexually harass me and undermine my security position in a very loud and obnoxious way
1547362 im confident that len will continue to be a good local member for the people of sanderson
1547363 even now i struggle and its one day at a time
1547364 during a recent overseas jet fuel binge thousands of dollars of the stuff just went up in smoke i was seeing those trails dude and i thought that aint right barry you need help
1547365 the first step is to admit you have a problem that youre helpless to solve and that you need to turn your life over to the care of a higher power who can pass legislation and levy taxes
1547366 if it was madeleine it was a disgrace that it was not passed on we need to know what happened with this
1547367 she was three to four years old she had straight dark brown hair in a ponytail her hair reached her shoulders or possibly a little further she had a pallid face and huge eyes which were very noticeable
1547368 she had a dark look but i dont think she had dark brown eyes i think they were green brown what caught my attention was the fact that she showed little or no emotion
1547369 then the little girl stood before me and asked me in english do you know where my mummy is i answered that her mother was a little bit further back in the shop and she answered she is not my mummy
1547370 i asked her who the woman was and she said she is a stranger she took me from my mummy
1547371 i still remember that because i thought it was a rare name i then asked her where she had last seen her mother and she answered they took me from my holiday
1547372 as you heard i will be pleading not guilty and in due course the courts will make their decision
1547373 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi survivors
1547374 rwanda of course was a terrible human tragedy and one that the international community generally cant be proud of in terms of its response
1547375 its one of the reasons i think why there is an emerging discussion now about the notion of responsibility to protect that the international community does have an obligation to act much more quickly when we see these human tragedies occurring
1547376 the markets being buoyed by the 300 odd points in the us last night
1547377 but the market is still very nervous weve been caught before and had spikes about three or four times
1547378 people really need to see this break up past 5000 to maybe 5100 theyre trading mainly for the short term and i dont think this is fresh buying
1547379 team blue 2 opens at the stage do you remember back in february when team blues rally debut happened heres what the stage looked like back then
1547380 we would have thought he would have at least have had the courage to come and see the court
1547381 its been a frustrating process the whole time with delays that these things unfortunately do take time
1547382 we ourselves have spent weekends going through the sandhills at kurnell looking through the national park just in a failed attempt that we might find some news ourselves but of course to no avail

1547387 were finding that these sorts of market conditions can have a significant impact on a persons job security which in turn drives them to seek out employment with great long term stability
1547388 were also hearing about jobseekers looking for work closer to home to counteract rising petrol prices
1547389 based on the context of the entire label we agree that the phrase in question refers to the brand name of the product and does not mislead consumers
1547390 it is the clear sentiment of this board that more can and should be done to safeguard human life than has been the case to this point in the construction process
1547391 we believe these kind of measures just provide a false sense of security
1547392 the canal should not appear like a swimming pool that people can jump and swim across easily

1547394 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot

1547396 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1547397 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1547398 a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
1547399 the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket
1547400 by and large these are not run to identify spies they are run to thwart what the officer is trying to do to us and to learn more about what they are trying to do to us
1547401 it can also pay off enormously in intelligence as in football an offense can be the best defense
1547402 the change was generated principally by the larger results of our holdings due to the impact a sharp increase in raw material prices had on inventories

1547411 of course we believe education is very important so if you have to go for school we will support you again but you have to give us a formal paper from your college in china saying that your school is begining on a certain date
1547412 i am looking at a number of measures and i am not going to be drawn on that because we have not concluded what exactly we need to do it is helping people that is important i want to look at a range of options that will help people
1547413 while football is my first love music and film are a close 2nd
1547414 but the first businesses i started were the twenty 20 fat burger franchise licenses ive acquired throughout atlanta and cincinnati now that ive gotten a number of them up and running i can concentrate on making my dream come true by building a successful entertainment company
1547415 the night that biggie was killed the networks kept showing the scene of the crime and i noticed that think big posters were plastered all over the suv to commemorate him i thought it would be a great idea to name my new company that the thing is the company wouldnt start for another 4 years but the name stuck
1547416 energy gave me that spark i needed to go after my dream and make his dreams come true at the same time
1547417 g fiive is a natural entertainer and i wanted to hone in on his ability and perfect it
1547418 the goal is to saturate the internet as well as the streets with presence while gradually bringing awareness to the mainstream once this is established we will utilize the film arm of the company and give g fiive the visual affects he needs from video to short films

1547422 as one of the soldiers said i think weve got it right here but i think its messed up in washington well thats true for a lot of things
1547423 that puts an extra obligation on us not only leaders like colonel mangum but somebody in my position to make sure that we are serving those who sign up to serve us
1547424 we get more targeted relief to middle income people we want to double it and give full funding to low income heating programs which really help seniors and working people then we want to weatherize homes

1547429 the constitutional chamber declares that the mentioned article is constitutional
1547430 i dont know whether or not theyre going to give up their weapons
1547431 i really dont know i dont think either of us knows
1547432 i will be patient and i will be consistent i have faith we will be able to move to the verification process then to the next step
1547433 the human rights abuses inside the country still exist and persist the north korea leader has yet to fully verify the extent to which he has had a highly enriched uranium program theres still more steps to be done on the plutonium program
1547434 in order to get off the list the axis of evil list the north korean leader is going to have to make certain decisions
1547435 my hope is that the axis of evil list no longer exists thats my hope for the sake of peace thats my hope for the sake of our children
1547436 as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds to the extent that people arent able to do that people arent able to worship freely is you know i think is a mistake
1547437 i enjoy coming to a free society where people are able to express their opinions and your country is a free society
1547438 on august 8 it was not just one city or one area it was all over burma everywhere even the remote villages it was not just students or monks or workers everybody was there
1547439 we had high hopes that the situation could change high hopes that democracy could come to burma high hopes that our economic problems would be solved
1547440 now the military junta and their relatives and cronies this small group exploits our countrys riches there are great gaps between a handful of military troops and the masses of people
1547441 if the economic situation of the people is not improved there will be demonstrations again
1547442 we who seek the abolition of nuclear weapons are the majority
1547443 last year 170 countries voted in favor of japans u n resolution calling for the abolition of nuclear weapons only three countries the united states among them opposed this resolution
1547444 we need to pass that message on to our childrens generation
1547445 one of the greatest thinkers writers and humanists of the 20th century
1547446 im concerned about its uranium enrichment activities as well as its nuclear testing and proliferation its ballistic missile programs
1547447 the best way to approach and answer those concerns is for there to be strong verification measures
1547448 pressures for higher rates are likely to linger on the committee
1547449 overall we cannot entirely rule out the risk that the committee will sanction higher rates this time
1547450 centricas 35 percent increase in domestic tariffs suggests that inflation will hit 5 0 percent
1547451 inflationary pressures continue to prevent the mpc from cutting rates in response to the deteriorating real economy
1547452 in fact if interest rates change this month they are more likely to go up than down
1547453 we suspect that most mpc members are still firmly in wait and see mode and in no hurry to move interest rates given the current major uncertainties surrounding both the medium term inflation and growth outlooks
1547454 i have heard many stories of failed access to services because of language issues
1547455 because no translators were provided the mans son was left with no choice but to try to interpret the consent form himself and it was sadly misinterpreted
1547456 her english proficiency was limited and the necessity of taking her medication was never explained to her thankfully she filed a lawsuit for wrongful imprisonment and won
1547457 these stories are not uncommon to asian american and pacific islanders and other minority communities in fact as appalling as these seem many of our families face this reality daily
1547458 more than a third of our population is limited in english proficient and a majority are foreign born
1547459 at a time when language is a proxy for culture we emphasize that learning english does not come at the expense of our identity or heritage
1547460 we consider ourselves 100 percent american in our english proficiency and still consider ourselves 100 percent asian american as we celebrate and draw upon our heritage
1547461 we have to drill here and we have to drill now
1547462 the economy has been a sea of bad news for republicans and this is the first island of hope theyve found in a long time
1547463 i dont think the public view is we can solely drill our way out of this but clearly the republicans believe that they have a political advantage on this and they are determined to exploit it for all its worth
1547464 the question of offshore drilling along with expanded domestic energy production has suddenly become the biggest political and economic wedge issue of this election
1547465 the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1547466 there is some evidence to suggest that some poll numbers were moved by that because it is something tangible that non expert voters can see and appreciate
1547467 he is trying to have it both ways that takes the edge off mccains attack then they call him a flip flopper mccain of course flip flopped on that issue and 15 others like all politicians do
1547468 a factor also boosting tokyo stocks was the lower crude oil prices which resulted in the decline in investors wariness over risk to the world economy

1547708 the team is moving forward the train has left the station he needs to jump on the train if we cant get past the things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1547709 the packers paid him for his services and he delivered those services every single game since he got there in 1992 if youre a packers fan who makes you a better team brett favre or aaron rodgers there isnt any question that its brett favre thats why this whole thing is so ridiculous if theyre so convinced that aaron rodgers is the better player then why didnt he beat out brett favre before
1547710 it wasnt remotely close to what brett is going through but i got really mad when i was with the cardinals in 1996 i claimed they didnt start me for a game or two because they wouldnt have to pay a 400 000 bonus to me i basically told them i didnt want to come back unless they pay me the money and if they didnt pay me the money it would be in their best interests to release me
1547711 i understand where hes coming from especially if ted thompson is hostile to brett favre there is a disconnect between those two guys i dont think he ever wants to play for ted thompson again
1547712 in the short term his legacy will take a hit
1547713 but seven years from now all this nonsense will be put behind everyone and theyll talk about how he was the cal ripken of the nfl and did something no other player was able to do and everybody will celebrate a great career
1547714 either because theyve never played before or theyre completely miserable and they sit in judgment about somebody and they dont know how difficult its been to do what he has done
1547715 how the bible fails to answer our most important question why we suffer
1547716 normally based on my past experiences it has been the night before the game when we have quarterback meetings so we will find out then
1547717 as far as how much weight goes into it who knows youll have to ask the guy thats making the decision
1547718 its important to all of us to go out there and have a good showing
1547719 its going to be an overall evaluation and i dont know how games are weighted but they evaluated everything we do whether its in the classroom out here on the field one on ones routes versus error everything if its on film or they can film it coach evaluates it
1547720 i try not to pay attention to where chad is at i root for him just like i root for anybody but for myself i understand that there was a string of practices where there were some interceptions and they needed to be put to an end
1547721 i think as veterans once the preseason rolls around you know that the dog days of training camp are slowing winding down
1547722 we are excited to try to take what we have learned and practiced on the practice field and take it and apply it in a game situation
1547723 i am going to try and come back this year
1547724 citi field will serve as a fantastic new home for the mets for decades to come but fans will always remember shea stadium and its magical moments from the amazins world series triumph in 1969 to game 6 in 86 to hopefully a long sweet october in 2008
1547725 the seat sale and subsequent memorabilia sale will provide fans a chance to own a part of that shea stadium lore
1547726 every single game i do it at practice i almost do it too much sometimes im not paying attention when i should be but youll never ever have me at a football game and not just soaking it in
1547727 once we actually got to the real nitty gritty the game of football man i just picked it up and excelled
1547728 i hope that the same type of thing will happen here
1547729 maybe when i get there and see the crowd and my family itll be a different experience but coming from a school that played some real big games i dont think therell be much of a difference
1547730 you grow up watching games like this and its going to be so cool to be in it

1547746 you were supposed to appeal before last thursday and this was not done i am still not going to grant leave this application came before me with urgency and i dealt with it seeing how things have changed now i do not think this application is relevant

1547748 we hope to do it within the next 30 days its a process we have its a tendered process open competitive tender
1547749 i think we will require four months to complete it
1547750 we think now based on the price of oil heavy oil becomes an attractive proposition and that is what we are trying to determine what we have
1547751 the news spreading through laventille early that you could get money easy down there in chaguanas
1547752 we have to deal with them negotiate with them especially in light of their hoard of petrodollars but we cant sit by and watch a country murder people in england
1547753 what they did had reflected badly on the islamic community i hope they are caught and made to pay for damages
1547754 the congregation was leaving after fajr early morning prayers when they saw the two men who seemed to be muslims because they were wearing toupees head gear going into that direction no one ever saw them before and they are not members of my congregation
1547755 everybody is allowed to worship in their own way what those men did was un islamic and illegal the murtis were not on the masjids compound they went into the temple and desecrated them and that was wrong
1547756 we said nothing because this was the act of fools
1547757 the map is the most precise depiction yet of the limits and the future dividing lines that could be drawn across the arctic region
1547758 the results have huge implications for policy making as the rush to carve up the polar region continues
1547759 its a cartographic means of showing and an attempt to collate information and predict the way in which the arctic region may eventually be divided up
1547760 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving

1547763 the investigation shall be without prejudice and in addition to the investigation statutorily required by and under the occupational safety and health act and any other investigations and or inquiries required by and under the laws of trinidad and tobago
1547764 the other driver involved in the accident has spoken to the police and investigations are ongoing there is no suspicion of foul play attached to rameshwars death
1547765 to properly understand the implications it could have for all broadcasters inclusive of television and radio newsrooms
1547766 while matt always welcomes any measure that will help improve standards in broadcast journalism in particular matt will not support measures that designed to infringe on the constitutional rights of freedom of thought and expression and freedom of the press

1547768 rose hall declaration on regional governance and integrated development and has played a key role in the shaping of the caricom development fund chose the platform of a group of experts meeting in port of spain to reveal his own exasperation over the reluctance by most of the regions governments to a review of the epa before hastening to sign it only to live thereafter in his judgement
1547769 reliance on the good faith and honour of any gorilla is misplaced and stupid
1547770 heads of government before they took the decision in december 2007 to sign off on the epa used to articulate a policy on every appropriate occasion that the caricom single market and economy csme was to serve as a more controlled predictable and self determined transitional process towards integration into the world economy
1547771 the free trade regime common external tariff services regime regional investment policy competition policy intellectual property rights government procurement and csme governance mechanisms
1547772 effectively renders the csme redundant overtaken by events since the standards and norms policies and actions and timing of implementation in all these respects as listed above have now been
1547773 governments preference if they have found that there is a good case for this policy shift the epa signing would also be a good occasion to wind up the csme project
1547774 i think these two games are in good timing for us because we must see how the team progresses before cuba
1547775 i want to see these players and then of course we will have our players from overseas come in to join us for cuba there will not be major changes but same time i think the squad now will be very keen to do well again versus haiti and el salvador and it will give us a good idea of our position for our first semi final round match
1547776 i still have some progress to make but im also starting to feel like my old self and thats always a positive sign when youve been injured or away for some time i have had a lot of bad injuries and hopefully thats something of the past
1547777 i was at work when she came home and no one saw who brought her apparently the person she was with dropped her off nearby and she walked home
1547778 some of these girls are not happy in their homes they are experiencing a lot of problems there but running away is not the answer you may run off to something worse i want to urge young people to come to the police and talk to us
1547779 if the broadcasting community had a self regulatory framework that was acceptable to everyone then there would be no need for a code there is no common code that exists that seeks to guide the broadcasting industry as whole

1547781 republic bank working in tandem with the programmes coordinators michelle amoroso in trinidad and anthony moore in tobago has taken positive steps to ensure that our nations young people have the skills and the confidence to successfully pursue a life of music

1547784 im convinced hell run 9 8 this year and would not be totally surprised if he runs 9 7
1547785 to win olympic gold the 100 world title and break the world record all the things i left on the table im convinced hes the next person who can run 9 7 he has the body of asafa powell but not the strength if richards body was displayed youd think hes a distance runner he knows he needs to get stronger
1547786 well in excess of three years this is the highest paid contract ever for someone from the caribbean coming out of college at his age we know the deal asafa got when he first started is nowhere close to richards deal
1547787 that nike didnt treat caribbean athletes well that upset richard very much because he felt nike treated him very well
1547788 richard in my opinion will surpass both ato boldon and 1976 olympic 100m champion hasely crawford he is the new standard my belief is richard will become one of the best athletes in the world based on his stature and performance
1547789 he has a very good family we were approached by walter dix as well but we never spoke to the gentleman never spoke to his family our eyes have always been on richard and the way he handles himself he has much more in store we have nothing but great hope for this kid
1547790 it does not matter to him or to me what my official title is confidant mentor co manager richard sees a need to have somebody who has been there before and i have wanted for a long time to be involved with t amp t sprinters
1547791 i came and met it so and i am not going to rock any boat

1547796 puncheon rum drinkers have a look you know you could tell a man if he is a heineken beer drinker or carib well usually a barman like me as soon as a man walk in if is puncheon he want they have a look
1547797 but these days i kinda losing meh touch is some young young fellas drinking puncheon every time they come in for a drink i ask if they sure
1547798 long time is when a drinker reach a level of experience with the bottle then he go call for a nip of puncheon now these days these young fellas starting off with the fire water they say if you want real head then drink a real rum
1547799 a few years ago when a young fella come in a bar and ask for puncheon people use to turn around well not now they calling for puncheon like the calling for a round of beers
1547800 i think its just the kick of drinking puncheon you know the rum has a certain mystique a certain unmistakeable reputation as being for the hardcore so when you see these well dressed professionals come in and order puncheon i think its an adventurous thing for them a kind of bragging right that i drank puncheon

1547811 needs to stay behind the athletes it is really significant that they have reached this level people are shocked that with a population of 1 3 million we have a team of 30 athletes they believe 30 is the whole delegation sometimes we have to tell them in chinese we have excellent representation
1547812 the decision is that the team will go to korea rather than the opening ceremony some athletes want to be at the opening but are willing to sacrifice for the overall goal the track team administrators are making the decisions that are best thats what you need
1547813 richard is young and relatively inexperienced but believes nothing can stop him if he takes that onto the track you dont know what can happen
1547814 in 1999 i told depositors at a meeting that the credit union should have ownership in assets
1547815 we started by acquiring bankers insurance then we decided to invest in real estate and properties we also started a security firm
1547816 the idea would be to rebrand and stay out of deposits
1547817 i feel strongly that we have to rebuild and rebrand
1547818 we have to pick up the pieces but once people get back their money they will be interested in another venture
1547819 with all that is happening all that im seeing around me i believe that a new east indian conglomerate can rise when the dust settles

1547928 among the institutions that have taken in charge the financing of our project are the british old house institution the issam fares foundation the national cement company the hariri foundation and sidons school network in addition to byblos bank

1547946 you do that and it says a lot about the character of your team the character of the guys in the locker room that really appealed to me knowing that you got guys who care about their performance about winning and when those are the top priorities winning and performing well you can fix all the other things
1547947 youre getting a free education you might as well make the most of it
1547948 i could tell that the first time i talked to him
1547949 i feel fortunate for us to be in a position to bring in a guy like that and its not a huge risk
1547950 everybody knows the kind of production he had on the field in the past and everyones excited about that
1547951 if anybody on the jets ever saw me take a day off they were like uh oh whats wrong they knew thats not my style

1548000 my understanding that the iraiq parliament did not convene on sunday however it has not yet recessed and lawmakers remain ready to reconvene once a new bill is ready for them to consider the iraqi political leaders are continuing to discuss the elections law ambassador crocker and us embassy officials continue to encourage iraqis to work towards compromise and consensus and to develop an elections law that will allow for provincial elections this year
1548001 after the long talks we held it was clear for us that what happened on july 22 was a big conspiracy and very dangerous for the democratic and constitutional process of iraq in particular against the kurds
1548002 a walkout by kurdish lawmakers over how to deal with the disputed oil city of kirkuk
1548003 we cannot have a vote with an absence of a whole faction the vote is useless it will be rejected by the represenatives of this bloc and by the presidency council
1548004 many observers believe talabani would stand with his kurdish compatriots and vote against the measure bringing it back to square one
1548005 the draft of the provinical elections law will be referred to the presidential council which will definitely not approve it so the elections will be postponed until next year
1548006 a vote had been planned for sunday but it was scrapped when lawmakers failed to agree on how the elections would affect kirkuk which minority kurds want to make part of their semi autonomous northern region turkeys nationalist movement party mhp leader devlet bahceli called on the countrys ruling justice and development party akp in a written statement to warn iraqi kurdish groups in kirkuk more openly and take the necessary measures in order to protect turkmens rights turkey who has historical ties with kirkuk has been monitoring the situation very closely and calls on all parties to reach consensus for a solution
1548007 i think we said something about that last week i believe and our position is that we believe that this now is not the time to be making such a decision we believe that the parties need to leave themselves open to all appropriate or all options in order to come to an understanding so that they can proceed with provincial elections this fall
1548008 the iraqi parliament adjourned its tuesday session without reaching an agreement on provisions in the election law regarding the status of the city of kirkuk shahied al jaberi with the shiite united iraqi alliance said lawmakers opted to postpone the issue until the wednesday session because lawmakers could not agree on the kirkuk issue voices of iraq reported
1548009 elections in kirkuk would also be postponed until no later than december 2009
1548010 a turkmen representative said a delay in kirkuk voting was unacceptable
1548011 the parliament session to approve the provincial election law has been delayed until tomorrow
1548012 the deadlock also prevented a vote by parliament on a 21 billion supplemental budget the crisis has marked the first time that elements of one of the most prominent shiite muslim parties the supreme islamic iraqi council have broken with the kurds their traditional allies

1548021 had met with economic advisers and business leaders in washington last week and they had advised him to call for tapping the government reserve
1548022 team obama cast the proposal as a refinement rather than a flip flop on obamas previous opposition to tapping the 770 million barrel reserve
1548023 energy policy is offering more flip flops than a lake tahoe souvenir stand

1548060 the military is working on this but nobody has an oral vaccine
1548061 while it is rather rash to make detailed prophecies it is i think fairly clear that in future a human body from the moment of conception will not be regarded merely as something which must be left to grow in accordance with natural forces with no human interference beyond what is required for the preservation of health the tendency of scientific technique is to cause everything to be regarded as not just a brute datum but raw material for the carrying out of some human purpose the child and even the embryo will come to be viewed more and more in this way as the mentality connected with scientific technique becomes more dominant in this as in all other forms of scientific power there are possibilities of good and possibilities of evil science alone will not decide which is to prevail
1548062 science when it has once acquired a firm hold upon social organization is hardly likely to stop short at those biological aspects of human life which have hitherto been left to the joint guidance of religion and instinct we may i think assume that both the quantity and the quality of the population will be carefully regulated by the state but that sexual intercourse apart from children will be regarded as a private matter so long as it is not allowed to interfere with work as regards quantity the state statisticians will determine as carefully as they can whether the population of the world at the moment is above or below the number which leads to the greatest material comfort per head they will also take account of all such changes of technique as can be foreseen no doubt the usual rule will be to aim at a stationary population but if some important invention such as artificial food should greatly cheapen the production of necessaries an increase of population might for a time be thought wise i shall however assume that in normal times the world government will decree a stationary population if we were right in supposing that the scientific society will have different social grades according to the kind of work to be performed we may assume also that it will have uses for human beings who are not of the highest grade of intelligence it is probable that there will be certain kinds of labour mainly performed by negroes and that manual workers in general will be bred for patience and muscle rather than for brains the governors and experts on the contrary will be bred chiefly for their intellectual powers and their strength of character assuming that both kinds of breeding are scientifically carried out there will come to be an increasing divergence between the two types making them in the end almost different species scientific breeding in any truly scientific form would at present encounter insuperable obstacles both from religion and from sentiment to carry it out scientifically it would be necessary as among domestic animals to employ only a small percentage of males for purposes of breeding it may be thought that religion and sentiment will always succeed in opposing an immovable veto to such a system i wish i could think so but i believe that sentiment is quite extraordinarily plastic and that the individualistic religion to which we have been accustomed is likely to be increasingly replaced by a religion of devotion to the state among russian communists this has already happened in any case what is demanded is scarcely as difficult a control of natural impulses as is involved in the celibacy of the catholic priesthood wherever remarkable achievements are possible and are at the same time such as to satisfy mens moral idealism the love of power is capable of swallowing up the instinctive life of the affections especially if an outlet is permitted to purely physical sexual impulses traditional religion which has been violently dispossessed in russia will suffer a setback everywhere if the russian experiment proves successful in any case its outlook is difficult to reconcile with that of industrialism and scientific technique traditional religion was based upon a sense of mans impotence in the face of natural forces whereas scientific technique induces a sense of the impotence of natural forces in the face of mans intelligence combined with this sense of power a certain degree of austerity in regard to the softer pleasures is quite natural one sees it already in many of those who are creating the mechanistic society of the future in america this austerity has taken the form of protestant piety in russia of devotion to communism i think therefore that there is hardly any limit to the departures from traditional sentiment which science may introduce into the question of reproduction if the simultaneous regulation of quantity and quality is taken seriously in the future we may expect that in each generation some 25 per cent of women and some 5 per cent of men will be selected to be the parents of the next generation while the remainder of the population will be sterilized which will in no way interfere with their sexual pleasures but will merely render these pleasures destitute of social importance the women who are selected for breeding will have to have eight or nine children each but will not be expected to perform any other work except the suckling of the children for a suitable number of months no obstacles will be placed upon their relations with sterile men or upon the relations of sterile men and women with each other but reproduction will be regarded as a matter which concerns the state and will not be left to the free choice of the persons concerned perhaps it will be found that artificial impregnation is more certain and less embarrassing since it will obviate the need of any personal contact between the father and mother of the prospective child sentiments of personal affection may still be connected with intercourse not intended to be fruitful while impregnation will be regarded in an entirely different manner more in the light of a surgical operation so that it will be thought not ladylike to have it performed in the natural manner the qualities for which parents will be chosen will differ greatly according to the status which it is hoped the child will occupy in the governing class a considerable degree of intelligence will be demanded of parents perfect health will of course be indispensable so long as gestation is allowed to persist to its natural period mothers will also have to be selected by their capacity for easy delivery and will therefore have to be free from an unduly narrow pelvis it is probable however that as time goes on the period of gestation will be shortened and that later months of foetal development will take place in an incubator this would also free mothers from the need of suckling their children and would thus make maternity a not very onerous matter the care of infants intended to belong to the governing class would seldom be left to the mothers mothers would be selected by their eugenic qualities and these would not necessarily be the qualities required in a nurse on the other hand the early months of pregnancy might be more burdensome than at present since the foetus would be subjected to various kinds of scientific treatment intended to affect beneficially not only its own characteristics but those of its possible descendants fathers would of course have nothing to do with their own children there would be in general only one father to every five mothers and it is quite likely that he would never have even seen the mothers of his children the sentiment of paternity would thus disappear completely probably in time the same thing would happen though to a slightly less degree in regard to mothers if birth were prematurely induced and the child separated from its mother at birth maternal sentiment would have little chance to develop
1548063 among the workers it is probable that less elaborate care would be taken since it is easier to breed for muscle than to breed for brains and it is not unlikely that women would be allowed to bring up their own children in the old fashioned natural manner there would not be among the workers the same need as among the governors for fanatical devotion to the state and there would not be therefore on the part of the government the same jealousy of the private affections among the governors one must suppose all private sentiments would be viewed with suspicion a man and woman who showed any ardent devotion to each other would be regarded as they are at present regarded by moralists when they are not married there would be professional nurses in cr ches and professional teachers in nursery schools but they would be considered to be failing in their duty if they felt any special affection for special children children who showed any special affection for a particular adult would be separated form that adult ideas of this kind are already widespread they will be found suggested for example in dr john b watsons book on education the tendency of the scientific manipulator is to regard all private affections as unfortunate freudians have shown us that they are the sources of complexes administrators realize that they stand in the way of a whole hearted devotion to business the church sanctioned certain kinds of love while condemning others but the modern ascetic is more thoroughgoing and condemns all kinds of love equally as mere folly and waste of time
1548064 what should we expect of the mental make up of people in such a world the manual workers may i think be fairly happy one may assume that the rulers will be successful in making the manual workers foolish and frivolous work will not be too severe and there will be endless amusements of a trivial sort owing to sterilization love affairs need not have awkward consequences so long as they are not between a man and woman who are both of them unsterilized in this way a life of easygoing and frivolous pleasure may be provided for the manual workers combined of course with a superstitious reverence for the governors instilled in childhood and prolonged by the propaganda to which adults will be exposed the psychology of the governors will be a more difficult matter they will be expected to display an arduous and hard working devotion to the ideal of the scientific state and to sacrifice to this ideal all the softer sentiments such as love of wife and children friendships between fellow workers whether of the same or of different sexes will tend to become ardent and will not infrequently overstep the limits which the public moralists will have fixed in such a case the authorities will separate the friends unless in doing so they will interrupt some important research or administrative undertaking when for some such public reason friends are not separated they will be admonished by means of governmental microphones the censors will listen in to their conversations and if these should at any time become tinged with sentiment disciplinary measures will be adopted all the deeper feelings will be frustrated with the sole exception of devotion to science and the state the governors will of course have their amusements for leisure hours i do not see how art or literature could flourish in such a world nor do i think that the emotions from which they spring and to which they appeal would meet with governmental approval but athletics of a strenuous kind will be encouraged among the young of the governing class and dangerous sports will be considered valuable as a training in those habits of mind and body by which authority over the manual workers will be maintained love making among the sterilized will be subjected to no restrictions either of law or of public opinion but it will be casual and temporary involving none of the deeper feelings and no serious affection persons suffering from unendurable boredom will be encouraged to ascend mount everest or fly over the south pole but the need for such distractions will be regarded as a sign of mental or physical ill health in such a world though there may be pleasure there will be no joy the result will be a type displaying the usual characteristics of vigorous ascetics they will be harsh and unbending tending towards cruelty in their ideals and their readiness to consider that the infliction of pain is necessary for he public good i do not imagine that pain will be much inflicted as punishment for sin since no sin will be recognized except insubordination and failure to carry out the purposes of the state it is more probable that the sadistic impulses which the asceticism will generate will find their outlet in scientific experiment the advancement of knowledge will be held to justify much torture of individuals by surgeons biochemists and experimental psychologist as time goes on the amount of added knowledge required to justify a given amount of pain will diminish and the number of governors attracted to the kinds of research necessitating cruel experiments will increase just as the sun worship of the aztecs demanded the painful death of thousands of human beings annually so the new scientific religion will demand its holocausts of sacred victims gradually the world will grow more dark and more terrible strange perversions of instinct will first lurk in the dark corners and then gradually overwhelm the men in high places sadistic pleasures will not suffer the moral condemnation that will be meted out to the softer joys since like the persecutions of the inquisition they will be found in harmony with the prevailing asceticism in the end such a system must break down either in an orgy of bloodshed or in the rediscovery of joy such at least is the only ray of hope to lighten the darkness of these visions of cassandra but perhaps in permitting this ray of hope we have allowed ourselves to yield to a foolish optimism perhaps by means of injections and drugs and chemicals the population could be induced to bear whatever its scientific masters may decide to be for its good new forms of drunkenness involving no subsequent headache may be discovered and new forms of intoxication may be invented so delicious that for their sakes these are possibilities in a world governed by knowledge without love and power without delight the man drunk with power is destitute of wisdom and so long as he rules the world the world will be a place devoid of beauty and of joy
1548065 take again such a matter as housing in england individualism leads most families to prefer a small house of their own rather than an apartment in a large house the result is that the suburbs of london are spread out through mile after mile of dreariness to the immense detriment of the women and children each housewife cooks an abominable dinner at great expenditure of labour for an infuriated husband the children when they come home from school or while they are too young to go to school find themselves cooped up in small stuffy premises where either they are a nuisance to their parents or their parents are a nuisance to them in a more sensible community each family would occupy a part of an immense building with a courtyard in the middle there would be no individual cooking but only communal meals children as soon as they were no longer at the breast would spend their day in large airy halls under the care of women possessing the knowledge the training and the temperament required for making young children happy the wives who at present drudge all day doing wasteful work badly would be set free to earn their living outside the home the benefit of such a system to the mothers and still more to the children would be incalculable at the rachel macmillan nursery school it was found that about 90 per cent of the children had rickets when they first came and almost all were cured at the end of the first year in the school in the ordinary home the necessary modicum of light and air and good food cannot be provided whereas all these things can be provided quite cheaply if they are provided for many children at once the freedom to cause ones children to grow up stunted and crippled on the ground that one is too fond of them to part with them is a freedom which is certainly not in the public interest

1548090 it is not credible however to promise thousands more new police when the capacity of the police college and the labour market conditions in a strong economy mean that such numbers could not be recruited and trained without seriously compromising standards and quality

1548095 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
1548096 we should require that u s taxpayers be reimbursed for the cost of large projects
1548097 despite iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue in the past five years u s taxpayer money has been the overwhelming source of iraq reconstruction funds
1548098 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1548099 the report shows iraqs budget surplus is likely to grow significantly over the course of 2008 but it is equally important to realize that spending in iraq is also increasing
1548100 were dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon
1548101 is going to make a lot of american families very angry

1548114 we ask that the government undertake the obligation above all of providing citizens with adequate opportunity for employment and earning a living the activities of the individual must not be allowed to clash with the interests of the community but must take place within its confines and be for the good of all therefore we demand an end to the power of the financial interests we demand profit sharing in big business we demand a broad extension of care for the aged we demand the greatest possible consideration of small business in the purchases of national state and municipal governments in order to make possible to every capable and industrious citizen the attainment of higher education and thus the achievement of a post of leadership the government must provide an all around enlargement of our entire system of public education we demand the education at government expense of gifted children of poor parents the government must undertake the improvement of public health by protecting mother and child by prohibiting child labor by the greatest possible support for all clubs concerned with the physical education of youth we combat the materialistic spirit within and without us and are convinced that a permanent recovery of our people can only proceed from within on the foundation of the common go od before the individual good

1548124 pressures for higher rates are likely to linger on the committee
1548125 overall we cannot entirely rule out the risk that the committee will sanction higher rates this time
1548126 centricas 35 percent increase in domestic tariffs suggests that inflation will hit 5 0 percent
1548127 inflationary pressures continue to prevent the mpc from cutting rates in response to the deteriorating real economy
1548128 in fact if interest rates change this month they are more likely to go up than down
1548129 we suspect that most mpc members are still firmly in wait and see mode and in no hurry to move interest rates given the current major uncertainties surrounding both the medium term inflation and growth outlooks
1548130 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1548131 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1548132 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results consumers companies and governments from around the world must further develop ways to protect our sensitive personal and business information
1548133 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1548134 my view has been all along and it remains that the fed is going to be on hold for a good deal of time
1548135 we believe that the fed will be in a position to hold rates steady well into 2009
1548136 the committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain
1548137 my view is that unemployment is going to go to 6 5 percent and that will be new information for the fed that will force them to keep rates unchanged for the next 12 months
1548138 it was all part of dick cheneys master plan create such an outrageous transparent lie that people would be distracted from the bullshit over iraq
1548139 we have to drill here and we have to drill now
1548140 the economy has been a sea of bad news for republicans and this is the first island of hope theyve found in a long time
1548141 i dont think the public view is we can solely drill our way out of this but clearly the republicans believe that they have a political advantage on this and they are determined to exploit it for all its worth
1548142 the question of offshore drilling along with expanded domestic energy production has suddenly become the biggest political and economic wedge issue of this election
1548143 the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1548144 there is some evidence to suggest that some poll numbers were moved by that because it is something tangible that non expert voters can see and appreciate
1548145 he is trying to have it both ways that takes the edge off mccains attack then they call him a flip flopper mccain of course flip flopped on that issue and 15 others like all politicians do

1548148 many important policy issues have been raised over the past decade about fannie mae and freddie mac should the federal government have a policy to encourage housing production and subsidize homeownership and affordable rental housing should that support and subsidy be delivered in part by the gses with the implicit backing of the government should the gses be investor owned should they have on balance sheet portfolios should the only limit on growth of the companies be meeting regulatory capital requirements should the companies have a new bank like separate regulator would congress act in a timely manner if the viability of the gses were ever threatened
1548149 while the gses opponents would answer no to most if not all of these questions congress has now resoundingly answered

1548174 with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1548175 the rba needs demand to slow below trend for an extended period an easing strategy would be about reducing the downside risks to growth rather than looking to revive demand all this argues for a cautious start to the easing cycle if a further 25 basis point cut is needed they can go again in short order

1548186 het aantal moorden op journalisten is inderdaad afgenomen maar het journalistieke klimaat is er ondertussen helemaal niet vrijer op geworden sterker nog het aantal bedreigingen is juist toegenomen dat er niet meer journalisten zijn vermoord komt omdat ze zich vaak al op voorhand censureren
1548187 in kleinere gemeenschappen zijn de banden nauwer en op het platteland speelt het conflict tussen guerilla leger en gedemobiliseerde paramilitairen
1548188 veel journalisten branden hun vingers daarom liever niet aan verhalen over drugssmokkel paramilitaire activiteiten en corruptie veruit de gevaarlijkste onderwerpen om over te berichten

1548217 it sends a warning whether it is justified or not that potential purchasers need to look more deeply at these properties the planning authorities are sending a message that there is going to be intervention perhaps increasingly in this type of development in this topography
1548218 the fact of the matter is that the properties may never be affected but sentiment may cause a fall in value for similar properties
1548219 properties with the same type of amenities but that are elevated may attract far greater demand

1548234 in thyolo district malawi one nurse keeps 400 patients alive by following up their essential treatment but her basic salary amounts to just 3 a day
1548235 it is intolerable to then be told by governments and donor countries that it is unsustainable to raise her wages even though she is responsible for 7 500 worth of drugs a month for her patients those willing to support funding for medicines must find ways to cover recurrent costs like salaries for health workers
1548236 it is devastating to stand by and watch people growing sicker and sometimes dying as they wait weeks and even months before being treated simply because there are not enough healthcare workers
1548237 overworked underpaid and undervalued healthcare workers in southern africa are increasingly scarce just as the number of hiv patients is rising antiretrovirals may be present on more hospital and clinic shelves but without the health staff to administer them a deadly gap will only grow wider

1548259 i would tell you that it is our assessment that it we have not had the level of expertise in terms of plants and the complex processes required to run such a select agent program and were putting that in place with new personnel
1548260 it was obviously a serious flood that happened unfortunately we dont have a lot of information but what we know was that on the twenty second of february a biosafety level bsl 3 lab that was handling biological weapons agents flooded at the university it flooded so badly the water came from above that the integrity of the lab was clearly compromised a number of seals were broken water infiltrated into the lab from outside whats really perplexing about this is that although the flood occurred on the twenty second of february theres no record of any safety inspection of the lab until seven weeks later the 16th of april which probably not co incidentally was the same day that federal agents arrived on the texas a amp m campus to probe their research program so we have this nearly two month delay between a flood that compromised the integrity of a laboratory handling biological weapons agents and any apparent action to assess the damage and get about the business of fixing it
1548261 this is both a national problem and a specific problem at livermore lab
1548262 historically the manager for livermore labs has been the university of california and historically the university of california has known very little about what actually goes on at the laboratory i would not be surprised at all to find out in the future that the new uc bechtel management is in the same position vis a vis the livermore biofacility that the texas a amp m president was in respect to the texas a amp m lab which is they dont know
1548263 a s part of the select agent rules labs or entities that are certified are required to immediately report any potential lab exposures releases or loss of a select agent historically the entities in the program have alerted the cdc to these
1548264 i think its fair to say that the review that was done at texas a amp m in july was very intense very thorough and very deep my expectation is that other institutions under that same level of review would probably have findings that could be reportable to the cdc
1548265 this country is building way too much biowarfare agent research capacity at other sites in addition to livermore lab tri valley cares believes that what is needed is an overarching national assessment of our biodefense capabilities to look at whether in fact we have any deficiencies in our capabilities the bush administration has thrown about 36 billion on the table and initiated what is in fact a multiagency feeding frenzy to get part of this 36 billion to build all these facilities willy nilly across the country

1548320 we went to road atlanta last week and i felt like we had a promising test
1548321 i feel like we learned some things that will gain us a little speed here
1548322 i love racing at watkins glen its fast and its a track that suits our cars very very well
1548323 i really enjoy where i am in the sport and am comfortable with how things are going i like the amount of respect that i have in the garage area and the experience that ive gained over the years and how that pays off
1548324 i certainly have no regrets and have accomplished more than i ever thought i would im not wishing i was 21 again im pretty happy with how things are

1548344 sure they look great heaving with the support of a quality undergarment i actually dig the jiggle but unleash those bad girls and all hell breaks loose like a broken levy
1548345 first of all nascar from an officiating point of view did a great job you look at what happens in an average race when youve got a wreck or an inclement situation youve got pending rain and the prospect of having rain stop and start theyve got a lot of experience with that they know how to predict whats going to happen nobody in the tower there that im aware of had any experience from nascars side dealing with a rain event like that they made really great judgments they worked through it it would have been nice if they could have run the full measure of laps but they got through it and called a great race it was great that ron fellows won for the canadian interest that was there so it was not an unhappy result even though we would have liked to have seen a ford product prevail
1548346 it turned out to be a great tire that was extraordinarily durable it went through the dry period without getting hurt and still had enough edge on it and enough groove in it that when the track got wetter again they still worked pretty good it was possible to run the number of laps that were run on one set of rain tires and that was my biggest surprise i figured as much effort that was being made to dry the track before they put the rain tires on that the rain tires would last just a few laps and everybody would be in to put on either a second set of rain tires or dries as it turned out the tire was right for the circumstance and nascar made great decisions and the result was good
1548347 the thing that was clear is that the drivers for the most part were lacking in confidence of how to deal with the rain there were a lot of missteps just based on a lack of respect for the rain and the conditions that went with it there were a number of cars that got caught up in things jacques villeneuve for one got caught up in a wreck under caution which surprised me joey logano got caught up in a wreck under caution it didnt surprise me with joey because hes so young and inexperienced generally it surprised me on jacques that he let himself get caught up in that but the thing that was most glaring that puts me to work this week is something like scott pruetts car it was a disaster because it steamed up on the inside if your car steams up on the inside you cant see out some people had windshield wipers and some people didnt there were various strategies on that i think a wiper generally is a good thing it was a surprise to me that carls car didnt have a wiper on it but if you had a wiper as a for instance like marcos ambrose had that at 50 miles an hour the wiper didnt touch the windshield anymore thats also not right the idea of configuring the car so that it performs as it needs to and the systems work adequately in the wet condition is something that requires attention that the teams dont have experience with im saying my teams dont have it either and without having a baseline of having to run a race that says heres a system that works weve used this system forever without having that baseline in systems theres great jeopardy of having a car that will let a driver down on a day when he could do his business otherwise
1548348 i dont think well see racing in the rain on oval tracks and i think were pretty good at sears point for the time of year were out there it doesnt rain much out there watkins glen is not likely to have rain although it is a possibility i think theyd rather wait a day at watkins glen than to go through it but for what we had going on in canada where the race was there wasnt the prospect of going back there and doing it over so a rain date was not a possibility as much as it would be at watkins glen or even sears point so i dont think youll see nascar with any enthusiasm looking forward to rain and i think by and large it will be a really dire circumstance when theyll run another rain race theyll try not to i believe
1548349 i hope boris is right boris is an unbelievable guy hes taught me a lot of stuff and to this day thats still the guy i go to for road course advice last year at watkins glen we were really fast and i had a really good time we were in a position where we were in the chase and a win was all we were after so i did a bonsai move the last lap running second and hit the fence but we still finished eighth and i feel really good about going to watkins glen
1548350 yeah i think were 300 points or so ahead of 13 th and with six races left its pretty much time to just go for wins i was a little nervous about indy and real nervous after the first run or two just trying to get a good points day but now we can just go for it
1548351 bonus points are key any points you can get i mean the championship can be won by one point so bonus points are the deal for us right now
1548352 yeah i hope so there are a lot of unknowns in road course racing but drew blickensderfer crew chief had been doing a really good job with the race strategy and i think that will be good i just really like road course racing its become one of the things i look forward to the most
1548353 yeah i wanted to win a race in mexico so badly this year we had a screaming fast race car just unbelievably good and we gambled and lost with our pit strategy ive been so close to winning there and i might have to go run something down there so i can try to get a win eventually i just really like going there a lot im sad about that
1548354 the championship is the reason we made the change and swapped all the people around and took the big gamble we know that its go time and its now or never for that championship clint is doing such a good job we have made up some points on him though and thats the goal is to win both championships that would be the unbelievable season
1548355 i thought the new car ran pretty well on the road course the more and more we work with this car the less and less it seems any different to me it handles a lot like the old car it doesnt have as much grip at some places so you slide around more but i think thats kind of fun at watkins glen last year we had the issue where the leaders were spinning out and wheel hopping when you see jeff gordon and tony stewart having trouble that shows you how hard they are to drive because those guys are the best in the world but its the same for everyone and i think when something is a little more difficult it kind of makes it a little more fun
1548356 these two races here feel like im on a mediterranean holiday because the stress and strains of an oval track for me where i feel like i havent quite mastered the trade where here on a road course i feel comfortable in my surroundings i know that if i do my job as i should that we should have a decent day
1548357 well thats right but i know road racing and i have a confidence in myself that i should do okay if i could just do what i do well its nice to have that feeling of security going into qualifying its a pressure deal you only get one lap in the cup deal but its as easy as its going to get when youre trying to do it they way were doing it it feels good i enjoy it for the experience i like watkins glen its a good fun place to be hopefully the weekend goes well
1548358 its just a flowing track its got a lot of history to it its known as one of americas finest race tracks as far as road racing goes its got a lot of character the corners have good banking on most of them the track is in a beautiful location in america its just a nice place to be the fans by the looks of it they have a history of going there they really know what theyre doing when the get there and who theyre following theyre fairly well educated fans too watkins glen is a unique race track and the people go there to watch road racing which is nice too
1548359 at watkins glen youve got to have a really good car to make it work i feel like car handling plays more a part of watkins glen than it does at canada or mexico just because its a handling style race track so brakes arent an issue there at watkins glen its not as technical it just really comes down to really being able to run the high speed corners without getting yourself in trouble and carrying momentum its a handling race track i think the fastest car will probably win the race where as in canada and mexico sometimes its not the case strategy comes more into play at those other two venues
1548360 oh yeah youre loose all the time youve got to set them up loose to be able to run its no different from oval racing to road course racing youve got to let the car do the work for you if youre putting a steering wheel into it its not as fast its easy to make the car too loose for sure
1548361 each corner is unique and different youve just got to get a balance out of the whole lap some corners youre going to be tight even when you complain about being loose there are some corners that youre still not going to have enough front grip on its a compromise on how you want it its a very personal thing setting up a road course what some drivers call loose someone else might call balanced its different driving style and how you want go about it
1548362 yeah i try to drift the car as much as i can i generally set the car up to be a little tighter than most and a little stiffer than most so i can have the confidence to drift in the corner well i try to get a nice forward slide going if i can i feel like thats the best way i get around a road course
1548363 no it plays no part really what you gain in draft you loose by being conservative on the brakes trying to stay off of them its not going to come into play
1548364 i like racing at nashville its actually a track that ive raced at a few times before the truck series race i ran an arca race and a couple of the southeast tour races its a place that ive been going to since 2002 its concrete its fun its a cool track i like racing there
1548365 its different than some of the other places we go to the concrete surface makes it a little bit different as far as race adjustments it tends to be like dover and tightens up a lot the more rubber you get down on the track
1548366 yeah we actually had a really good truck last year our northern tool equipment ford was fast during the race we ended having a bad set of tires and the truck was just junk so we had to come in the pits and put a set of our scuffs back on and we ended up with a lot more laps on our tires than some of the other guys at the end that kind of hurt us a little bit we still finished in the top 10 so hopefully well go there this year and have another good run our trucks have been really good lately everything has been falling into place weve been having really good runs and weve been running up front hopefully well do the same thing in nashville
1548367 yeah if you take kentucky out which we should have finished in the top five there wed have five in a row but four out of the last five is not bad as far as top five finishes go everything has just been going our way we finally have some luck on our side pit stops have been going good matt puccia and all the guys on the crew have been doing a really great job its been going good hopefully we can keep it up
1548368 i dont know what id do with it id probably put it with my other trophies thats definitely one of the ones that ive always wanted to get ive been really close in the southeast series i finished second there before even at the fairgrounds they run some late model races out there and ive been close in some of the big races out there and didnt get it its been kind of disappointing its definitely one of the coolest trophies in the business everybody knows about the nashville guitar hopefully i can add one to my collection this weekend
1548369 weve had a decent season for the most part weve had fast trucks every week there have just been some unfortunate circumstances that happened earlier in the year and it took us out of some races we didnt get the finishes that i think we should have gotten if you take that kind of stuff out weve had a pretty good year weve had good trucks and everybodys been getting along very well on the crew and matts been doing a really good job if we had some better luck to go along with the way we had been running wed be in really shape right now were 225 points out with 11 races to go weve got our work cut out for us but were still very much in this championship chase and were just going to go out there and keep finishing in the top five and winning races hopefully we can put ourselves up there and be in contention at the end of the season
1548370 i hope so before kentucky we were only 130 out and i thought we were in pretty good shape but 29 th there and johnny benson winning the race didnt help any then we went to orp and finished third and still lost 25 points to johnny hes just been really strong lately him and ron hornaday jr both were just going to really have to be on our game to beat those guys its going to be hard to make up points but with the way the season has been going bad luck can happen to anybody weve seen it with just about everybody in the top 10 in points at one point or another if we can keep our heads up and stay out of trouble hopefully we can get some luck on our side and maybe those guys will have something happen to them and well put ourselves right back in it
1548371 well its our one year anniversary since crew chief todd okuhara took over the helm of the mopar oakley dodge team
1548372 and were excited about that the brainerd race was todds first race with us last year we made it to the semifinals and had a real good shot at winning the race
1548373 getting into the countdown would be great but weve had a lot of fumbles this year weve had some chances to make some moves and nothing happened so were just going to do all we need to do and try to execute if it works great if it doesnt then its not meant to be
1548374 were going into brainerd with no pressure hopefully todd will make the right calls i will do my job driving and i know the mopar oakley dodge crew is always on top of things i dont worry about them at all well just see what happens
1548375 the fans save up all year to come to this event and to see us race
1548376 the suzuki im riding set the track record there last year 6 959 seconds by angelle sampey so maybe we can go out there and break the track record this year and get another win wed love to keep our momentum going
1548377 i thought going into the last six races that we were going to win 10 or 11 rounds to have a shot at staying in the top 10
1548378 weve won five rounds so far in the last three races i still am kind of sticking to that concept i think were going to need a minimum of 10 round wins
1548379 i think if we can win brainerd well put ourselves in pretty good shape to stay in the top 10
1548380 maybe even more important we won the second race of the year and then we went into a slump for seven or eight races it seems like were coming out of that slump but the reality is youre never out of a slump until you win a race
1548381 if we can stay in the countdown i think it would send a message to all the guys who have been busting their butts on the valvoline mts dodge team that we really can contend for this championship were legitimate were here and there isnt any reason that we cant be mixing it up to be no
1548382 but i really think that were going to need to win one of these next three and id just as soon do it in brainerd and get it over with and then we can work on the other two
1548383 ill give it my best and theres nothing more that you can do
1548384 im really excited about the opportunity to drive the 28
1548385 its a good deal for me nowadays its hard to find a ride thats free without having to bring anything to the table i work hard in the shop for don so its cool to be rewarded hes willing to give me a shot so i really appreciate that
1548386 im excited about going back to mansfield ohio because thats where i got my best finish a third in the 79 and dons car won there last year we should be pretty good there so im excited about that thompson next week is a good one because the team always runs well there and i run well there too martinsville is a good race just because its such a big deal to run there id like to go to loudon new hampshire motor speedway in september theres nothing set in stone there but if the cars are okay don may have no problem going there with two cars
1548387 when we do the setups on the 28 dons the one thats doing it with me he tells me what to put for shocks and springs and when we scale it its me and him doing it together its going to be a big benefit knowing the cars im driving they seemed pretty happy when i practiced their car at loudon for them and gave them some pretty good feedback with how the car was im really excited
1548388 even though im eighth in points at thompson its only by 44 points so i think both track championships is still attainable
1548389 in the 28 i just want to qualify good and run as best i can to prove i can run in the tour
1548390 she wants to help kids with brain cancer like shannon
1548391 i would definitely say that its harder with every corner theres a different rhythm to it even on an oval but its repetitive indy might be one of the hardest ovals because each corner is so different id put pocono maybe second most intense mentally but when you get to a road course youve got to turn left turn right hard braking zones and intermediate braking zones down shifts and up shifts there is a lot of stuff going on over the course of a lap on a road course

1548405 st rze passieren sehr oft wenn die treppe nicht an die bed rfnisse der benutzer angepasst ist das hei t wenn sie nicht dem nat rlichen bewegungsrhythmus des menschen entspricht so ist es sehr gef hrlich wenn die treppe zu steil ist oder wenn die stufen nicht tief genug sind dann ger t der mensch aus dem tritt es kommt zu unsicherheiten und zu st rzen
1548406 das gel nder sollte am besten senkrechte gitterst be aufweisen die maximal zw lf zentimeter auseinander liegen damit kinder den kopf dort nicht hindurchstecken k nnen waagerechte streben sollte man nicht verwenden denn diese verleiten zum dar berklettern und man muss sagen kinder sind wirklich wahre kletterk nstler
1548407 zum einen sollte man schon bei ganz wenigen stufen einen handlauf anbringen zum beispiel wenn man eine kleine gartentreppe hat oder den hauseingang der handlauf als solcher sollte so sein dass er weder zu dick noch zu d nn ist man muss ihn mit der hand gut umgreifen k nnen das probiert man am besten schon im gesch ft aus bevor man den handlauf kauft der dritte tipp ist dass der handlauf als solcher ein gutes st ck ber die treppe hinausragen sollte damit man wirklich sicher steht zu ebener erde und dann weitergehen kann
1548408 die pendlerpauschale ist ordnungspolitisch ein fehler denn mit der gleichen logik m ssten alle bewohner teurer innenst dte auch einen staatlichen mietzuschuss bekommen

1548410 even though its a road course there are some places where you can really drop the hammer
1548411 the backstraight is a perfect example you come flying down through there and hit the inner loop
1548412 if were going to make a move it has to start this weekend
1548413 weve got five more races before the chase starts so we cant afford to finish outside the top five in any of those races even then its going to be a long shot so we might as well go for broke
1548414 we looked back at the western swing with the knowledge that we went past the first round at every race we held our own in the points and maintained no
1548415 i look forward to this part of the season im geared back up to go on the road
1548416 the real challenge is going to come at the u s nationals we all know that when the points get close there youd better be on your game but i feel pretty good going into brainerd and the rest of the season
1548417 the track is pretty neat although its tough place to pass
1548418 it is also a special place for toyota being they are the title sponsor so that give all their drivers more incentive to win i would love nothing more than to bring our toyota certified used vehicles tundra to victory lane on saturday night
1548419 chase for the abc additionally espn2 is the home of the nascar nationwide series all season all programming is produced totally in high definition espns comprehensive multimedia espn deportes radio sportscenter
1548420 we turned the corner in terms of performance several races ago
1548421 the rockstar energy drink dodge is running better and qualifying better and were starting to go rounds
1548422 i look at the situation and i approach it professionally
1548423 were going into brainerd with our eyes wide open with the attitude that if we can have a couple of good races well be good to go brainerd is a lot of fun especially their campground the zoo its legendary brainerd has always been a good stop good fans a good facility and everyone enjoys going there
1548424 were still kind of on the tail end of our family including wife shelley daughter taylor and son caden vacation that weve spent in our monaco coach traveling around the country since norwalk ohio june 29 we just left pismo beach in california
1548425 we were there for a week and were all back in the motor home heading to brainerd
1548426 its been very relaxing and fun but you have to balance that with showing up at the race track to race
1548427 however especially with three races left in this countdown chase were not completely safe in the top 10
1548428 its a lot fun being in brainerd a lot of us racers get on the golf carts and go to the zoo brainerds famous campground and see the fans at night and we have a great time but then you have to be focused to show up on sunday and race
1548429 right now we are also focused on moving ourselves up in the top 10
1548430 if we can stay on course and keep running as well as we have been lately we can fight into the top five come indianapolis you do not want to be teetering on the no 9 or 10 spot because we also have the showdown bonus event at indy for 100 000 wed like to win again
1548431 also now that were running to 1000 feet its completely changed everybodys mindset i really believe the racing has been better obviously its been safer but i think the fans are now understanding that changing the racing to 1000 feet was a great choice for the time being
1548432 there are a lot of things at this time of the season that can provide distractions if you let them so we dont want to have to go into indianapolis fighting to stay in the top 10 wed like to go in there fighting to stay in the top five and then be able to be a cheerleader and help our don schumacher racing teammates gary scelzi jack beckman clinging to no 10 and jerry toliver fight their way into the top 10
1548433 ill be honest it was a little weird to sit at home and watch the charter dodge race at pocono last week but i did what i felt was best for gillett evernham motorsports we had a great chance of winning the nationwide race at montreal and we were so busy last week even without doing double duty
1548434 you just need to have an open mind and follow some simple rules about road racing for me i try to do much of my braking in a straight line that gets the car slowed up enough to rotate through the corner for good power off

1548490 each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others faithfully administering gods grace in its various forms
1548491 but to each one of us grace has been given as christ apportioned it
1548492 when he ascended on high he led captives in his train and gave gifts to men
1548493 and that is what some of you were but you were washed you were sanctified you were justified in the name of the lord jesus christ and by the spirit of our god
1548494 then he jesus said to them follow me and i will make you fishers of men
1548495 they didnt ask questions but simply dropped their nets and followed
1548496 and we who with unveiled faces all reflect the lords glory are being transformed into his likeness with ever increasing glory which comes from the lord who is the spirit
1548497 do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind then you will be able to test and approve what gods will is his good pleasing and perfect will

1548511 an artists career is a two way street and i am grateful for my fans help in navigating me through this adventure
1548512 tom wood and i very excited to see jonathan behind the wheel again for us in these upcoming oval events jonathan is one of the few up and coming young americans who in my opinion completely masters the art of high speed oval racing he will be a serious contender in the final rounds of the 2008 indy lights championship
1548513 i am ecstatic to be back in the indy lights series and working with team moore racing again i know what its like to work with co owner mark and crew chief norm lessard
1548514 john roof is also a great addition to team john was my crew chief in 2006 when i finished 2nd in the championship as a driver in 2006 this is the best the team has ever been with a great crew and resources
1548515 i am so thankful for this opportunity and for tom wood and mark moore going out on a limb to help make this happen i just cant thank them enough
1548516 i think the best way to say thank you to them is to go out there and try to give tmr their first win im looking forward to going to a track where i know how to produce a stout performance
1548517 pablo is an amazing talent it was very unfortunate that we were not able to run him in the last two oval events we hope to produce great results at infineon and have pablo in our car for the full 2009 season
1548518 jeff is the second winningest driver in the indy lights series there are still four of sixteen races left in the season
1548519 it is not mathematically impossible for jeff to win the championship with a driver of his caliber he could make it happen
1548520 i was looking at the sturgis schedule and noticed that you have a beauty pageant and so i encouraged cindy to compete

1548526 what is amazing this year is how many people have bought the fundamentally childish notion that if you dont like the way things are going the answer is to write a blank check for generic change empowering someone chosen not on the basis of any track record but on the basis of his skill with words
1548527 re for those of you who have moved to a different state when my parents had to move due to my dads job he moved first while mom stayed to
1548528 what is amazing this year is how many people have bought the fundamentally childish notion that if you dont like the way things are going the answer is to write a blank check for generic change empowering someone chosen not on the basis of any track record but on the basis of his skill with words
1548529 a government big enough to give you everything you want is strong enough to take everything you have

1548531 what is amazing this year is how many people have bought the fundamentally childish notion that if you dont like the way things are going the answer is to write a blank check for generic change empowering someone chosen not on the basis of any track record but on the basis of his skill with words

1548533 do i stay good or do i give in to revenge
1548534 i knew what i wanted to do with the end of the film before we wrote the story i wanted the film to feel very complete which isnt the same as having a feeling of finality in the ending
1548535 there was a particular emotion from the ending and a particular thing we were after in terms of expressing something about batman and bringing the entire story back to him so that it becomes once again batmans film at the very end he dealt with a very wide number of characters interacting in all kinds of extraordinary ways at the end of the day we just wanted to nail the relevance of hero our core character
1548536 i dont know what id do next or what would happen next
1548537 i felt in doing a sequel that it would be a big mistake to try to hold anything back for future films you have to put everything you can into this movie and try and make it as great as it can be
1548538 laid the foundations for what we can begin to recognize as the modern presidency
1548539 more elected representatives there were the more likely the popular will would be frustrated
1548540 no longer compatible with our dignity and our oath of making the constitution respected
1548541 that we may secure the permanent enjoyment of the former is it wise in such a moment to sacrifice the spirit of the laws to the letter and by adhering too strictly to the letter lose the substance forever in order that we may for an instant preserve the shadow
1548542 are all the laws but one to go unexecuted and the government itself go to pieces lest that one be violated
1548543 no law of the united states authorizing a trial before a military court for offences such as are alleged
1548544 contrary of the forms and usages of the army and without regard to the finding of that court which had been instituted as a guide for himself
1548545 was never before received against the accused in any court of this country
1548546 was unwilling to move forward with annexation because he worried that sectional divisions over slavery would complicate the election of his chosen successor martin van buren
1548547 left the matter to congress to decide as under the constitution it controlled the acquisition of new territory and the admission of states
1548548 part of the executive power over foreign relations jackson was no different
1548549 he alone negotiates into the field of negotiation the senate cannot intrude and congress itself is powerless to invade it
1548550 on this important and delicate branch of our future negotiations would enable the president to act much more effectively in the exercise of his particular functions there is also the best reason to believe that measures in this respect emanating from the united counsel of the treaty making power would be more satisfactory to the american people and to the indians
1548551 the opinion of the judges has no more authority over congress than the opinion of congress has over the judges and on that point the president is independent of both
1548552 such influence as the force of their reasoning may deserve
1548553 the first president to make use of the pocket veto
1548554 unless the congress by their adjournment prevent its return in which case it shall not be a law
1548555 because of jackson any modern president with the support of thirty four senators can completely stall any proposed legislation
1548556 believed it was his constitutional right to decide how to carry out federal law such as the statute on the deposit of federal funds in order to execute the law he had to control subordinate officials in the executive branch
1548557 one of the most forceful declarations of presidential power in american history
1548558 did not restore the office by breaking its constitutional limits

1548563 i want them to change their plans and to put forward a similar business plan to paraparaumus
1548564 i am investing a substantial amount myself to bring the parties together to have a discussion and take this venture along a different path
1548565 i am not representing any parties here i am just in the fortunate position to be able to see a possibility and be able to facilitate it
1548566 its important for the community that every airport stays open thats an underlying non negotiable fact
1548567 with wigram ngai tahu can achieve exactly what they want to do but on a more commercial model where commercial activities are carried out which complement the airport
1548568 our strength in new zealand is our natural beauty and tourism is going to be one of the most important aspects of our future we need to have good transport systems in place for that
1548569 in that case it might be worth looking at i will read mr lords letter when it comes
1548570 one thing you would need for the scheme is people to invest in it at the moment ngai tahu is not convinced the scheme would work
1548571 the only thing that will stop us going down the track we are on is if there is a better financial solution and no one has produced that to date

1548585 but one of the things you want to teach them is a sense of responsibility
1548586 affects the financial future and the financial stability of the city
1548587 maybe if they hadnt paid people that hadnt worked they wouldnt need so much additional money
1548588 were not going to let the kids not get paid
1548589 you would think maybe summer spencer head of the department of employment services would have made us aware
1548590 up to 20 100 000 due to several factors including the tremendous increase in program registration
1548591 highly unusual especially given the high visibility and profile of this program
1548592 did not believe her complaint and felt she may be attempting to gain attention
1548593 was not aware that he was required to make such a report
1548594 for several years the availability of library services in charles county has not kept pace with growth
1548595 this new library in the urban core of waldorf will correct that imbalance
1548596 i see them wanting to be on the cutting edge of initiatives innovation and i think thats really accelerating i didnt always see that
1548597 i know every single school administrator on a personal scale and thats a huge advantage
1548598 theyre being put on buses and sent all around the city no consent from the parents absolutely nothing
1548599 theres a limit in a summer program as to how much due process you can give
1548600 by the time you do the due process the program is over and youve spent a lot of taxpayer money
1548601 the goal of the summer jobs program is to give young people a meaningful work experience

1548824 but digital strategies are important these days and morris has become entangled in them whether he wants to be or not
1548825 and in november 2006 morris parlayed microsofts desperation to establish a true alternative to the ipod into a 1 ransom to universal for every zune music player sold and thats on top of the licensing fees microsoft pays to have universals songs in its zune marketplace online store
1548826 last summer though morris seemed to change direction after years of tightening controls on his companys content he agreed to let amazon com and other online retailers sell unprotected mp3s of universal songs these contain none of the digital rights management software that media companies usually embed in digital files to prevent piracy universal wasnt the first big label to offer unprotected tracks the emi group had begun selling drm free songs in may but with its small market share emis decision seemed unlikely to have much effect on the market universal on the other hand was setting out to change things in particular it hoped to end apples near monopoly on legal digital downloads
1548827 it was in lil abner the shmoo was a nice animal a nice fella but if you were hungry you cut off a piece of him and put onions on it and if you wanted to play football you just made him like a football you could do anything to him thats what was happening to the music business everyone was treating the music business like it was a shmoo
1548828 morris goes on to rail against criminal minded college students and low life punks who steal the music that his artists work so hard to create he admits to being fairly ignorant about technology and insists that his job is to nurture the creative side of the business work thats being threatened by all of this other nonsense
1548829 the problem is that a strategy based on quick returns is unlikely to pull the music industry out of its morass after all it was a reluctance to look farther down the road that got the labels in trouble in the first place but morris is much less interested in figuring out how to make digital music work for everyone than he is in not being the shmoo
1548830 the hardest thing was to get something that somebody wanted to buy to make a product that anybody liked
1548831 morris insists there wasnt a thing he or anyone else could have done differently
1548832 theres no one in the record company thats a technologist
1548833 thats a misconception writers make all the time that the record industry missed this
1548834 and its current moves drm free songs and the total music subscription service arent about serving consumers at least not principally theyre aimed at taking on steve jobs and specifically limiting the power of itunes
1548835 with the record companies on board jobs did something remarkable he turned the labels demand for bulletproof drm into a way of locking up the retail end of the online market jobs argued that in order to make apples drm software called fairplay effective it had to be proprietary and since jobs wont license fairplay tracks sold on itunes can be played only on ipods similarly the ipod wont play drm encoded files purchased through other retailers this lack of interoperability combined with the ipods overwhelming dominance gave apple a stranglehold on the digital music marketplace and jobs got to be the good guy with consumers blaming the mess on the music industrys pigheaded insistence on drm
1548836 when i suggest to morris that the labels gave jobs license to create what was in effect an apple walkman that played only apple cassettes its caraeff who answers
1548837 looking back the best thing we could have done would have been to mandate one format
1548838 total music is designed to unify apples competitors in what amounts to a coordinated attack on the ipod the details are far from finalized but in morris conception a total music subscription would come pre installed on devices like the zune the sony playstation or a mobile phone universal is well aware of the difficulty of convincing consumers to pay for music subscriptions so morris wants the devicemakers to pony up the cash themselves either by shelling out for a six month introductory offer or by assuming the cost forever
1548839 unfortunately total music will almost certainly require some form of drm which in the end will perpetuate the interoperability problem
1548840 our strategy is to have the people who create great music be paid properly
1548841 the irony is that if he decides to base his plans around drm morris will be missing the larger truth that has propelled his business for the past 30 years
1548842 theres sympathy for the consumer and the record industry is the shmoo
1548843 for more than a decade now ive listened to the debate about where the macintosh user interface came from
1548844 smalltalk has no finder and no need for one really drag and drop file manipulation came from the mac group along with many other unique concepts resources and dual fork files for storing layout and international information apart from code definition procedures drag and drop system extension and configuration types and creators for files direct manipulation editing of document disk and application names redundant typed data for the clipboard multiple views of the file system desk accessories and control panels among others the lisa group invented some fundamental concepts as well pull down menus the imaging and windowing models based on quickdraw the clipboard and cleanly internationalizable software
1548845 horn makes it seem that the selection based editor came with tesler from parc it may have been a case of convergent evolution since we already had that paradigm at the mac project in this case it dates at least back to an editor i designed much earlier while at bannister amp crun in 73 i discussed my editor concepts with many people at parc so i do not know whether teslers design was influenced by my work i know it was not the other way around
1548846 my thesis in computer science published in 1967 argued that computers should be all graphic that we should eliminate character generators and create characters graphically and in various fonts that what you see on the screen should be what you get and that the human interface was more important than mere considerations of algorithmic efficiency and compactness
1548847 back in 1976 my design of the apple iis high resolution graphics system utilized a characteristic of the ntsc color video signal called the color subcarrier that creates a left to right horizontal distribution of available colors by coincidence this is exactly analogous to the r g b distribution of colored sub pixels used by modern lcd display panels so more than twenty years ago apple ii graphics programmers were using this sub pixel technology to effectively increase the horizontal resolution of their apple ii displays
1548848 apple generally believes that the goal of the algorithm should be to preserve the design of the typeface as much as possible even at the cost of a little bit of blurriness microsoft generally believes that the shape of each letter should be hammered into pixel boundaries to prevent blur and improve readability even at the cost of not being true to the typeface
1548849 windows does not scale fonts linearly as the rough line points out windows scales the height and width but not the weight of the font
1548850 my anecdotal evidence also indicates that people who prefer cleartype are generally less knowledgeable about fonts in general
1548851 speaking at the gsma mobile asia congress in macau edgar bronfman told mobile operators that they must not make the same mistake that the music industry made
1548852 we used to think our content was perfect just exactly as it was
1548853 we inadvertently went to war with consumers by denying them what they wanted and could otherwise find and as a result of course consumers won
1548854 bronfman suggested that mobile companies have much to learn from apple despite being critical of and itunes in the past
1548855 i dont think theyre equally flawed i think leopard is a much better system
1548856 but os x in some ways is actually worse than windows to program for their file system is complete and utter crap which is scary
1548857 to microsoft and apple it is a way to control the whole environment to force people to upgrade their applications and hardware
1548858 as for his own operating system linus said the most exciting developments were linuxs improving green credentials and a push into mobile devices such as the one laptop per child project and asuss new ultra cheap eee pc
1548859 the linux kernel is already being used in things like cell phones but the problems have been in the ui user interface
1548860 morris and his allies hope to move digital music beyond the ipod itunes universe by nurturing the likes of microsofts zune media player
1548861 the service which is one of several initiatives the music majors are considering to help reverse sliding sales will be called total music morris was unavailable for comment this isnt only about jobs morris badly needs to boost his business and apple is the one to beat the itunes store has grabbed about 70 of downloads in the u s and the ipod well whats left to say about that juggernaut plus music companies have been here before a few years ago they launched services with the aim of defeating napster style file sharing and failed miserably and lets not forget that existing subscription services have signed up only a few million people vs hundreds of millions of itunes software downloads
1548862 while the details are in flux insiders say morris amp co
1548863 doug is doing the right thing taking on steve jobs
1548864 radioheads contract with emi capitol expired after its last record hail to the thief was released in 2003 shortly before the band started writing new songs singer thom yorke told time
1548865 even under the most lucrative record deals the ones reserved for repeat multi platinum superstars the artists can end up with less than 30 of overall sales revenue which often is then split among several band members meanwhile as record sales decline the concert business is booming
1548866 if the best band in the world doesnt want a part of us im not sure whats left for this business
1548867 today as gates prepares to step down from day to day management of the company another fact is clear the modern microsoft remains a company in search of a second act true it remains one of the worlds most profitable enterprises raking in more dough in its 2007 fiscal year than apple google yahoo oracle and adobe combined but the cracks in the microsoft hegemony arent just showing theyre growing
1548868 the marketing message from redmond would have you believe that microsoft and innovation are practically synonymous
1548869 long term the world needs a fundamentally new version of windows
1548870 ms dos was a simple unglamorous piece of software that focused on being a solid platform for applications from microsoft and other companies
1548871 microsoft should concentrate on making the os more reliable secure and easy to use rather than adding features to a paint program
1548872 as windows has added tools for digital photography entertainment and communications its become more complex and less satisfying
1548873 then microsoft earned much of its dominance of the office market the old fashioned way by building better software
1548874 while the apple hype machine and its fanatical followers would have you believe that mac os x 10
1548875 but let me get one huge misunderstanding out of the way immediately thats not a dig at leopard at all indeed if anything apple is in an enviable position os x is so solid so secure and so functionally excellent that it must be getting difficult figuring out how to massage another 129 out even the most ardent fans folks leopard is good stuff but then thats been true of mac os x for quite a while now
1548876 both leopard and vista were horribly late vista even more so than leopard
1548877 the feature must actually be new i e have not appeared in any form in a previous version of the product and must actually be something that impacts end users in a practical way
1548878 new to leopard time machine is apples version of microsofts previous versions feature which first appeared in windows server 2003 over four years ago
1548879 what makes time machine truly interesting is that it works with certain applications in addition to files and thats something apple should stress more in its discussions about this feature
1548880 unfortunately the company mucked up time machine with a truly juvenile user interface one that is horribly out of place in its otherwise staid and professional looking os x
1548881 apple also blows it by requiring a second hard drive this makes time machine less useful for mobile users which apple says represent over 50 percent of its sales way to ignore your own trends apple
1548882 after years of deemphasizing unnecessary translucency effects in mac os x apple takes a big step back in leopard now not only are menus more translucent than ever in leopard but so is the system wide menu bar at the top of the screen meaning that it will rarely be solid white as its been in all mac os releases since the original version in 1984 the effect is ugly and i wish you could at least turn it off
1548883 apples file manager application the finder has always been adequate but this time around its been upgraded with a number of vista like features including a new look and feel based go figure on itunes and a semi customizable sidebar this i like quite a bit
1548884 search for as you might expect is os xs answer to vistas searches folder here youll see links to prebuilt searches such as today yesterday last week and links for searching for images or documents and as like vista you can create your own saved searches these will automatically show up in the search for list in the finder when saved
1548885 in another nod towards reducing steps and thus increasing efficiency leopard includes a new feature called quick look which lets you view the contents of most document types without opening them in the application that created them this feature apparently modeled after the preview feature in windows desktop search augments leopards finder based icon views which like those in vista use thumbnails to reflect the contents of documents
1548886 when apple copied microsofts instant search feature to create spotlight it only got it partially right so the leopard version addresses some of the missing features from tiger
1548887 spotlight now supports boolean operators like and or and not which should be familiar to database gurus and google fans as with vistas start menu search feature you can now use spotlight to quickly find and launch applications
1548888 apples lackluster safari web browser is updated to version 3 in leopard and it features some improvements that will be familiar to user of firefox
1548889 its not like os x which has had no real world viruses or malware attacks over the year has gotten any more secure in a realistic sense
1548890 if apple is seriously about slowing that growth it needs to offer an os that is obviously better than vista leopard is not that system
1548891 another problem with leopard is the unmet expectations apple like microsoft with windows vista promised more than it delivered with leopard and even went so far as to promise secret new features that never materialized
1548892 leopard is also incomplete if you purchase this product on october 26 youll be getting pre release quality software that apple will update early and often as theyve done so often in the past with virtually all of its software products in the past several years while your garden variety mac zealot may bristle at this suggestion people who actually beta tested leopard know what im talking about it will get better over time it always does
1548893 leopard was apples chance to once again leapfrog windows and given the five years of delays microsoft put us through it should have been a slam dunk that apple was only able to come up with something thats roughly as good as vista is both surprising and telling i think leopard just isnt better than vista and it should be
1548894 while the apple hype machine and its fanatical followers would have you believe that mac os x 10

1548901 jagalah dirimu dari api neraka walaupun hanya dengan sebiji kurma jagalah dirimu dari api neraka walaupun hanya dengan seteguk air
1548902 ya abal hasan amal yang paling utama di bulan ini adalah menjaga diri dari apa yang diharamkan allah
1548903 barangsiapa mendekatkan diri kepada allah dengan suatu pekerjaan kebajikan di dalamnya samalah dia dengan orang yang menunaikan suatu fardhu di dalam bulan yang lain
1548904 ramadhan itu adalah bulan sabar sedangkan sabar itu adalah pahalanya surga ramadhan itu adalah bulan memberi pertolongan syahrul muwasah dan bulan allah memberikan rizqi kepada mukmin di dalamnya
1548905 barangsiapa memberikan makanan berbuka seseorang yang berpuasa adalah yang demikian itu merupakan pengampunan bagi dosanya dan kemerdekaan dirinya dari neraka orang yang memberikan makanan itu memperoleh pahala seperti orang yang berpuasa tanpa sedikitpun berkurang
1548906 dialah bulan yang permulaannya rahmat pertengahannya ampunan dan akhirnya pembebasan dari neraka barangsiapa meringankan beban dari budak sahaya termasuk di sini para pembantu rumah niscaya allah mengampuni dosanya dan memerdekakannya dari neraka
1548907 oleh karena itu banyakkanlah yang empat perkara di bulan ramadhan dua perkara untuk mendatangkan keridhaan tuhanmu dan dua perkara lagi kamu sangat menghajatinya
1548908 dua perkara yang pertama ialah mengakui dengan sesungguhnya bahwa tidak ada tuhan selain allah dan mohon ampun kepada nya dua perkara yang kamu sangat memerlukannya ialah mohon surga dan perlindungan dari neraka
1548909 barangsiapa memberi minum kepada orang yang berbuka puasa niscaya allah memberi minum kepadanya dari air kolam ku dengan suatu minuman yang dia tidak merasakan haus lagi sesudahnya sehingga dia masuk ke dalam surga
1548910 jika tuhan menciptakan segalanya berarti tuhan menciptakan kejahatan karena kejahatan itu ada dan menurut prinsip kita bahwa pekerjaan kita menjelaskan siapa kita jadi kita bisa berasumsi bahwa tuhan itu adalah kejahatan
1548911 pertanyaan macam apa itu tentu saja dingin itu ada kamu tidak pernah sakit flu
1548912 kenyataannya pak dingin itu tidak ada menurut hukum fisika yang kita anggap dingin itu adalah ketiadaan panas suhu 460f adalah ketiadaan panas sama sekali dan semua partikel menjadi diam dan tidak bisa bereaksi pada suhu tersebut kita menciptakan kata dingin untuk mendeskripsikan ketiadaan panas
1548913 sekali lagi anda salah pak gelap itu juga tidak ada gelap adalah keadaan dimana tidak ada cahaya cahaya bisa kita pelajari gelap tidak kita bisa menggunakan prisma newton untuk memecahkan cahaya menjadi beberapa warna dan mempelajari berbagai panjang gelombang setiap warna tapi anda tidak bisa mengukur gelap seberapa gelap suatu ruangan diukur dengan berapa intensitas cahaya di ruangan tersebut kata gelap dipakai manusia untuk mendeskripsikan ketiadaan cahaya
1548914 tentu saja seperti yang telah kukatakan sebelumnya kita melihat setiap hari di koran dan tv banyak perkara kriminal dan kekerasan di antara manusia perkara perkara tersebut adalah manifestasi dari kejahatan
1548915 sekali lagi anda salah pak kajahatan itu tidak ada kejahatan adalah ketiadaan tuhan seperti dingin atau gelap kajahatan adalah kata yang dipakai manusia untuk mendeskripsikan ketiadaan tuhan tuhan tidak menciptakan kajahatan kejahatan adalah hasil dari tidak adanya kasih tuhan dihati manusia seperti dingin yang timbul dari ketiadaan panas dan gelap yang timbul dari ketiadaan cahaya

1548920 mereka telah menyegerakan kesenangannya sekarang juga sebuah kesenangan yang akan cepat berakhir kita adalah kaum yang menangguhkan kesenangan kita untuk hari akhir perumpamaan hubunganku dengan dunia seperti orang yang bepergian pada musim panas ia berlindung sejenak di bawah pohon kemudian berangkat dan meninggalkannya

1548939 by not sure 2 hr 5 min ago 13 20 its been proven that obama has taken money from oil companies why dont you libs go and inflate your tires
1548940 as happens every year republican sen john mccain shows up as having sponsored zero such projects mccain has long positioned himself as a staunch opponent of pork
1548941 sen barack obama is listed as having sponsored 53 projects in fiscal year 2008 for a total of 97 4 million

1548943 i ts like these guys the republicans take pride in being ignorant
1548944 maybe john mccain can afford to laugh about inflating your tires i guess once you marry a hundred million bucks you dont have to worry about your gas mileage but there are lots of us out there who are really hurting and we dont think its funny at all just shows how out of touch he is not only that he wants to charge you 25 for a tire gauge you can get for 2 99 at ace hardware who knows maybe he thinks thats a good deal but hes not getting my 25 let him ask his oil company buddies
1548945 why are we surprised that the gop is against stuff that reduces oil consumption republicans have always been against rules that encourage conservation conservation is bad for oil profits and those oil profits turn into campaign contributions
1548946 honestly i just am at a loss for words at this point at least i understood the idiotic caricatures and false memes they spread about gore and kerry but im increasingly feeling like john mccain would at defcon 16 i just cant keep up with what the kids are doing these days
1548947 theres a bigger fight going on here its an article of faith among greens that there is no silver bullet what we need is silver buckshot in other words were not going to be able to replace the big highly concentrated brute force industrial energy system that fossils built were going to have to produce distribute and use energy in a much smarter way and that means doing thousands of little things these things will buffer our shift to a system with new sources clean electricity and new techniques plug in hybrids public transit and transit oriented development obama understand s the energy efficiency and conservation approach and actually try to present it to the american people republicans want to nip it in the bud thats why they are so aggressively jumping on the tire gauge thing they want to make it seem like a small and silly response to a very big problem but all the things we need to do will seem small and silly in isolation its the portfolio approach that will work

1548997 so the production offset is more likely to approach 800 thousand barrels per day a tidy sum and a worthwhile target for savings but not equal to ocs output

1549049 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
1549050 we should require that u s taxpayers be reimbursed for the cost of large projects
1549051 despite iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue in the past five years u s taxpayer money has been the overwhelming source of iraq reconstruction funds
1549052 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1549053 the report shows iraqs budget surplus is likely to grow significantly over the course of 2008 but it is equally important to realize that spending in iraq is also increasing

1549080 en wat denk je dat je boven dan aan de koning gaat laten zien
1549081 dan mag je wel eerst eens goed bedenken of je het wel echt wil
1549082 toch is het een wonder dat de ladder er is
1549083 laten we dat maar eens goed tot ons doordringen broeders
1549084 we willen samen nadenken over wat de ladder ons te zeggen heeft we hebben hem allemaal gezien en we hebben ook gezien wat de mensen ervan maken ons past voorzichtigheid en eerbied daarom heb ik wat dingen opgeschreven toen ik de woorden op het briefje vannacht in mijn gedachten liet wegen laten we beginnen bij het woord iedereen broeders er wordt daar buiten
1549085 er wordt daar buiten vooral gehamerd op dat iedereen koste wat het kost worden mensen aangemoedigd om toch vooral die ladder op te gaan maar wij horen beter te weten broeders het is niet iedereen maar iedereen die wil iedereen die wil en wat is nu dat willen weten we dat eigenlijk wel ik zou zeggen en u moet mij maar corrigeren als ik het verkeerd heb wij hebben diep in ons hart helemaal geen zin om die ladder op te gaan
1549086 ben ik ervan overtuigd dat we niet zomaar die ladder op mogen gaan als we die ladder op gingen zonder dat we het echt willen wat moet dan de koning wel niet tegen ons zeggen
1549087 ik heb nog wat te zeggen en ik zal het voorlezen
1549088 dat broeders is de boodschap die tot ons is gekomen niet meer en niet minder en dat alles betekent dat wie de koning wil zien nu de kans heeft om hem te ontmoeten
1549089 broeders om het eens heel eerlijk te zeggen heb ik nog liever dat de mensen een stuk de trap af gaan dan dat ze de ladder zomaar beklimmen
1549090 het zal duidelijk zijn dat deze trap een list van de onderkoning is om de aandacht van de ladder af te leiden we weten allemaal dat hij en de koning vanaf het begin strijden om de eerste plaats en daarom moeten we er duidelijk tegen waarschuwen laten we toch vooral de regels van de koning in acht nemen
1549091 broeders om het eens heel eerlijk te zeggen heb ik nog liever dat de mensen een stuk de trap af gaan dan dat ze de ladder zomaar beklimmen
1549092 kijk de wil van de koning is dat we de mensen vertellen dat ze bij hem mogen komen maar en dat moeten we ze ook vertellen alleen als ze dat cht willen en ten diepste wil niemand dat en denk erom dat de koning het hun en ons zeer kwalijk neemt als er mensen zonder echt te willen toch bij hem komen welnu de mensen die de trap afgaan beklimmen in elk geval niet zomaar de ladder ze geven door hun gedrag zelf al min of meer aan dat ze dat niet willen en dat zie ik liever dan dat men

1549124 while this is not a bullet proof way to stop idb disbursements it certainly will put a few more large rocks in the road
1549125 after several years of investigating the withholding of these loans we now have clear and detailed evidence of egregious intervention by the us government and the idb to stop life saving funds to haiti
1549126 with their transgressions now public they must heed the call for monitoring and transparency we urge them to implement the necessary oversight mechanisms to prevent a reoccurrence of behind the scenes malfeasance and above all to fulfill their obligations to the haitian people

1549154 from that which is known to everyone who has the slightest bit of common sense is that hijacking airplanes and kidnapping children and the like are extremely great crimes the world over their evil effects are far and wide as is the great harm and inconvenience caused to the innocent the total effect of which none can comprehend except allaah likewise from that which is known is that these crimes are not specific to any particular country over and above another country nor any specific group over and above another group rather it encompasses the whole world there is no doubt about the effect of these crimes so it is obligatory upon the governments and those responsible from amongst the scholars and other than them to afford these issues great concern and to exert themselves as much as possible in ending this evil
1549155 question there are some people who hijack a plane or a ship and do so to apply pressure upon the country to which this plane or ship is headed it is possible they threaten to kill the passengers and in some cases actually kill some of them until their demands are met so what is the ruling about such actions especially since such actions terrify the passengers response it is upon every country to provide sufficient security to prevent the likes of these rebels from taking over planes or ships it is upon the respective country to provide every airline with security whilst on their land which is sufficient to resist any hijack attempts by the aggressors just as they should also co ordinate a full passenger inspection prior to their boarding thus they should not permit anyone to proceed to board until after they have ascertained that no one is in possession of weapons even if it be a piece of metal bar or the like in addition to this some gangs force the aircraft to divert to another destination so if there are amongst the crew or passengers anyone with sufficient physical training to overpower them then the rebels plans will be destroyed so there is no doubt that hijacking is a mistake ignorance and falsehood further it is a transgression beyond the limits causing terror to the passengers and threatening them with that which they have no power to carry out and allaah knows best

1549157 all who contradict and oppose the messenger after the right path has been clearly shown to them have followed other than the path of the believers and all who follow other than the path of the believers have contradicted and opposed the messenger after the right path has been shown to them if one thinks that he is following the path of the faithful believers and is mistaken he is in the same position as one who thinks he is following the messenger and is mistaken
1549158 there shall not cease to remain a single group from my community upon the truth victorious they are unharmed by those who abandon them and those who oppose them they will remain in my community and in such a state until they fight the liar i e the anti christ dajjal
1549159 verily those before you from among the people of the book split into seventy two sects and verily this religion
1549160 this ummah will split into seventy three sects seventy two will be in the fire and one in paradise and that is the jamaaah
1549161 and this ummah will divide into seventy three sects all of which except one will go to hell and they i
1549162 the best of people is my generation then those who come after them then those who come after them i e the first three generations of muslims
1549163 i am leaving you two things and you will never go astray as long as you cling to them they are the book of allah and my sunnah
1549164 if you differ in anything among yourselves refer it to allah and his messenger if you do believe in allah and the last day that is more better and more suitable for final determination
1549165 o you who believe do not put yourselves forward in the presence of allah and his prophet and fear allah verily allah is all hearing and all knowing
1549166 islam began as a stranger and shall return as a stranger as it began so give glad tidings to the strangers
1549167 so give glad tidings to the few those who purify correct what the people have corrupted of my sunnah
1549168 their limbs do forsake their beds the while they call upon their lord out of fear and hope and they spend in charity out of the sustenance which we have bestowed upon them
1549169 yet there are men who take for worship others besides allah as equal with allah they love them as they should love allah but the believers are overflowing in their love for allah
1549170 whoever worships allah with love only is indeed a zindeeq heretic and whoever worships him with hope only is indeed a murji one who believes that sins impart no harm as long there is faith and he who worships him with fear only is indeed a haruri one of those who deserted from the army of ali and fought against him
1549171 say o muhammed he is allah the one allah the self sufficient master whom all creatures need he begets not nor was he begotten and there is nothing comparable to him
1549172 there is nothing like unto him and he is the all hearer the all seer
1549173 and the mosques are for allah alone so do not invoke anyone along with allah
1549174 whoever has hopes in the meeting with his lord let him work righteous actions and in the worship of his lord admit no one as partner
1549175 say if you men really do love allah then follow me allah will love you and forgive you your sins and allah is oft forgiving most merciful
1549176 i have indeed been given the quran and something along with it
1549177 as long as you hold fast to two things which i have left among you you will never go astray allahs book i e the quran and the sunnah of his messenger
1549178 none of you believes until i become more beloved to him than his father child and all mankind
1549179 allah did confer a great favour upon the believers when he sent a messenger from amongst themselves reciting unto them his verses i e the quran and purifying them from sins and pagan ignorance by their adoption of his way and instructing them in the book i e the quran and the wisdom i e the sunnah while before they had been in manifest error
1549180 indeed in the messenger of allah is a beautiful pattern of conduct to follow for anyone whose hopes lie in allah and the last day and who remembers allah abundantly
1549181 if anyone introduces into this affair of ours i e the religion of islam anything which does not belong to it he will have it rejected
1549182 whoever does an action which we allah and his messenger have not commanded it will be rejected
1549183 o you who believe enter into islam wholeheartedly i e obey all the regulations of allah and his messenger and follow not the footsteps of shaytaan verily he is to you an open enemy
1549184 they i e the believers are those who if we give them the authority in the land establish the prayer give the obligatory charity i e zakat and enjoin what is good i e to worship allah in his oneness and to obey all of his commandments and to forbid wrong i e to join others in worship with allah and to disobey any of his orders and with allah rests the decisions of all affairs
1549185 we have sent messengers as bearers of good news and as warners in order that mankind shall have no plea against allah after the messengers and allah is ever powerful all wise
1549186 and when a community amongst them said why do you preach to a people whom allah is about to destroy and punish with a severe torment
1549187 worship allah alone and join none with him in worship
1549188 and hold fast all of you together to the rope of allah i
1549189 the best of people is my generation then those who come after them then those who come after them
1549190 then there will come a people who give witness and their witness is not asked for
1549191 a group of my ummah will not cease to be upon the truth
1549192 the jews split into seventy one sects and the christians into seventy two and my ummah will split into seventy three sects all of them are in the fire except one
1549193 that it is upon us to make islaam take practical shape upon the earth
1549194 what is it with you that you always focus on tawheed and you talk so much about it and you dont take into consideration the condition of the muslims in our day and time those who are being killed and caused to flee all over the earth those being persecuted by the empires of disbelief in every place
1549195 o messenger of allaah is jihaad binding upon the women
1549196 jihaad is binding up them that which entails no fighting hajj and umrah
1549197 the best rows for the men are the first ones and the worst rows are the last ones and the best rows for the women are the last ones and the worst rows for them are the first ones
1549198 and those who accuse chaste women and produce not four witnesses flog them with eighty stripes

1549271 coupled with an increase in the basic speeding fine this means speeding tickets are now raising over 100 million a year for the government
1549272 ministers need to tell us what they are doing with this 100 million a year taken from motorists
1549273 how much is actually put back into practical road safety that does not involve speed cameras
1549274 ministers failure to answer that question confirms the view that for this government the british motorist is
1549275 is labour using speeding tickets just to raise revenue rather than making our roads safer
1549276 using speed cameras as a cash cow undermines public confidence the government needs to rethink ways of improving road safety including cracking down on uninsured drivers
1549277 safety cameras are there to save lives not make money
1549278 independent research has shown that there are 1 745 fewer deaths and serious injuries at camera sites each year the government is clear that the best safety camera is one which takes no fines at all but succeeds in deterring drivers from speeding

1549280 pharmacologic concentrations of ascorbate decreased tumour volumes 41 53 in diverse cancer types known for both their aggressive growth and limited treatment options
1549281 a regimen of daily pharmacologic ascorbate treatment significantly decreased growth rates of ovarian pancreatic and glioblastoma tumours established in mice
1549282 similar pharmacologic concentrations were readily achieved in humans given ascorbate intravenously these data suggest that ascorbate as a prodrug may have benefits in cancers with poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options
1549283 this is encouraging work but its at a very early stage because it involves cells grown in the lab and mice much more research is needed before well know whether vitamin c could be a viable cancer treatment in the future
1549284 there is currently no evidence from clinical trials in humans that injecting or consuming vitamin c is an effective way to treat cancer some research even suggests that high doses of antioxidants can make cancer treatment less effective reducing the benefits of radiotherapy and chemotherapy

1549292 they vote in greater proportions than any other ethnic or religious grouping ninety two percent of all jews vote in national elections compared to only 54 percent of the people as a whole jews may only be 10 6 percent of new york state but they are between 16 percent and 20 percent of the voters

1549318 this book is full of innuendos misstatements lies he says mr corsi says its 300 pages 600 footnotes and i stand by every statement in this book let me see if you stand by some of these statements doctor obama never revealed if or when he stopped using drugs thats a lie the truth is that he said in his own book dreams from my father that he stopped when he got into college
1549319 barack obama admitted using drugs in his autobiography but never revealed if or when he stopped
1549320 he fully admitted his drug use both marijuana and cocaine he says it continued through college
1549321 you said that barack obama supported a bill that allowed mothers to kill their babies even after they were born now were they gonna use knives guns or how were they gonna do that and do you actually believe that to be true
1549322 obama on the floor of the illinois state senate said that woman had an absolute right to abortion to kill the baby even if it survived that abortion

1549327 i f youre holding yourself out here to be an expert on barack obama and say the kinds of things youve said you have to understand why some of us question not only your standing not only the accuracy of your book but also your history

1549351 science when it has once acquired a firm hold upon social organization is hardly likely to stop short at those biological aspects of human life which have hitherto been left to the joint guidance of religion and instinct we may i think assume that both the quantity and the quality of the population will be carefully regulated by the state but that sexual intercourse apart from children will be regarded as a private matter so long as it is not allowed to interfere with work as regards quantity the state statisticians will determine as carefully as they can whether the population of the world at the moment is above or below the number which leads to the greatest material comfort per head they will also take account of all such changes of technique as can be foreseen no doubt the usual rule will be to aim at a stationary population but if some important invention such as artificial food should greatly cheapen the production of necessaries an increase of population might for a time be thought wise i shall however assume that in normal times the world government will decree a stationary population if we were right in supposing that the scientific society will have different social grades according to the kind of work to be performed we may assume also that it will have uses for human beings who are not of the highest grade of intelligence it is probable that there will be certain kinds of labour mainly performed by negroes and that manual workers in general will be bred for patience and muscle rather than for brains the governors and experts on the contrary will be bred chiefly for their intellectual powers and their strength of character assuming that both kinds of breeding are scientifically carried out there will come to be an increasing divergence between the two types making them in the end almost different species scientific breeding in any truly scientific form would at present encounter insuperable obstacles both from religion and from sentiment to carry it out scientifically it would be necessary as among domestic animals to employ only a small percentage of males for purposes of breeding it may be thought that religion and sentiment will always succeed in opposing an immovable veto to such a system i wish i could think so but i believe that sentiment is quite extraordinarily plastic and that the individualistic religion to which we have been accustomed is likely to be increasingly replaced by a religion of devotion to the state among russian communists this has already happened in any case what is demanded is scarcely as difficult a control of natural impulses as is involved in the celibacy of the catholic priesthood wherever remarkable achievements are possible and are at the same time such as to satisfy mens moral idealism the love of power is capable of swallowing up the instinctive life of the affections especially if an outlet is permitted to purely physical sexual impulses traditional religion which has been violently dispossessed in russia will suffer a setback everywhere if the russian experiment proves successful in any case its outlook is difficult to reconcile with that of industrialism and scientific technique traditional religion was based upon a sense of mans impotence in the face of natural forces whereas scientific technique induces a sense of the impotence of natural forces in the face of mans intelligence combined with this sense of power a certain degree of austerity in regard to the softer pleasures is quite natural one sees it already in many of those who are creating the mechanistic society of the future in america this austerity has taken the form of protestant piety in russia of devotion to communism i think therefore that there is hardly any limit to the departures from traditional sentiment which science may introduce into the question of reproduction if the simultaneous regulation of quantity and quality is taken seriously in the future we may expect that in each generation some 25 per cent of women and some 5 per cent of men will be selected to be the parents of the next generation while the remainder of the population will be sterilized which will in no way interfere with their sexual pleasures but will merely render these pleasures destitute of social importance the women who are selected for breeding will have to have eight or nine children each but will not be expected to perform any other work except the suckling of the children for a suitable number of months no obstacles will be placed upon their relations with sterile men or upon the relations of sterile men and women with each other but reproduction will be regarded as a matter which concerns the state and will not be left to the free choice of the persons concerned perhaps it will be found that artificial impregnation is more certain and less embarrassing since it will obviate the need of any personal contact between the father and mother of the prospective child sentiments of personal affection may still be connected with intercourse not intended to be fruitful while impregnation will be regarded in an entirely different manner more in the light of a surgical operation so that it will be thought not ladylike to have it performed in the natural manner the qualities for which parents will be chosen will differ greatly according to the status which it is hoped the child will occupy in the governing class a considerable degree of intelligence will be demanded of parents perfect health will of course be indispensable so long as gestation is allowed to persist to its natural period mothers will also have to be selected by their capacity for easy delivery and will therefore have to be free from an unduly narrow pelvis it is probable however that as time goes on the period of gestation will be shortened and that later months of foetal development will take place in an incubator this would also free mothers from the need of suckling their children and would thus make maternity a not very onerous matter the care of infants intended to belong to the governing class would seldom be left to the mothers mothers would be selected by their eugenic qualities and these would not necessarily be the qualities required in a nurse on the other hand the early months of pregnancy might be more burdensome than at present since the foetus would be subjected to various kinds of scientific treatment intended to affect beneficially not only its own characteristics but those of its possible descendants fathers would of course have nothing to do with their own children there would be in general only one father to every five mothers and it is quite likely that he would never have even seen the mothers of his children the sentiment of paternity would thus disappear completely probably in time the same thing would happen though to a slightly less degree in regard to mothers if birth were prematurely induced and the child separated from its mother at birth maternal sentiment would have little chance to develop
1549352 among the workers it is probable that less elaborate care would be taken since it is easier to breed for muscle than to breed for brains and it is not unlikely that women would be allowed to bring up their own children in the old fashioned natural manner there would not be among the workers the same need as among the governors for fanatical devotion to the state and there would not be therefore on the part of the government the same jealousy of the private affections among the governors one must suppose all private sentiments would be viewed with suspicion a man and woman who showed any ardent devotion to each other would be regarded as they are at present regarded by moralists when they are not married there would be professional nurses in cr ches and professional teachers in nursery schools but they would be considered to be failing in their duty if they felt any special affection for special children children who showed any special affection for a particular adult would be separated form that adult ideas of this kind are already widespread they will be found suggested for example in dr john b watsons book on education the tendency of the scientific manipulator is to regard all private affections as unfortunate freudians have shown us that they are the sources of complexes administrators realize that they stand in the way of a whole hearted devotion to business the church sanctioned certain kinds of love while condemning others but the modern ascetic is more thoroughgoing and condemns all kinds of love equally as mere folly and waste of time
1549353 what should we expect of the mental make up of people in such a world the manual workers may i think be fairly happy one may assume that the rulers will be successful in making the manual workers foolish and frivolous work will not be too severe and there will be endless amusements of a trivial sort owing to sterilization love affairs need not have awkward consequences so long as they are not between a man and woman who are both of them unsterilized in this way a life of easygoing and frivolous pleasure may be provided for the manual workers combined of course with a superstitious reverence for the governors instilled in childhood and prolonged by the propaganda to which adults will be exposed the psychology of the governors will be a more difficult matter they will be expected to display an arduous and hard working devotion to the ideal of the scientific state and to sacrifice to this ideal all the softer sentiments such as love of wife and children friendships between fellow workers whether of the same or of different sexes will tend to become ardent and will not infrequently overstep the limits which the public moralists will have fixed in such a case the authorities will separate the friends unless in doing so they will interrupt some important research or administrative undertaking when for some such public reason friends are not separated they will be admonished by means of governmental microphones the censors will listen in to their conversations and if these should at any time become tinged with sentiment disciplinary measures will be adopted all the deeper feelings will be frustrated with the sole exception of devotion to science and the state the governors will of course have their amusements for leisure hours i do not see how art or literature could flourish in such a world nor do i think that the emotions from which they spring and to which they appeal would meet with governmental approval but athletics of a strenuous kind will be encouraged among the young of the governing class and dangerous sports will be considered valuable as a training in those habits of mind and body by which authority over the manual workers will be maintained love making among the sterilized will be subjected to no restrictions either of law or of public opinion but it will be casual and temporary involving none of the deeper feelings and no serious affection persons suffering from unendurable boredom will be encouraged to ascend mount everest or fly over the south pole but the need for such distractions will be regarded as a sign of mental or physical ill health in such a world though there may be pleasure there will be no joy the result will be a type displaying the usual characteristics of vigorous ascetics they will be harsh and unbending tending towards cruelty in their ideals and their readiness to consider that the infliction of pain is necessary for he public good i do not imagine that pain will be much inflicted as punishment for sin since no sin will be recognized except insubordination and failure to carry out the purposes of the state it is more probable that the sadistic impulses which the asceticism will generate will find their outlet in scientific experiment the advancement of knowledge will be held to justify much torture of individuals by surgeons biochemists and experimental psychologist as time goes on the amount of added knowledge required to justify a given amount of pain will diminish and the number of governors attracted to the kinds of research necessitating cruel experiments will increase just as the sun worship of the aztecs demanded the painful death of thousands of human beings annually so the new scientific religion will demand its holocausts of sacred victims gradually the world will grow more dark and more terrible strange perversions of instinct will first lurk in the dark corners and then gradually overwhelm the men in high places sadistic pleasures will not suffer the moral condemnation that will be meted out to the softer joys since like the persecutions of the inquisition they will be found in harmony with the prevailing asceticism in the end such a system must break down either in an orgy of bloodshed or in the rediscovery of joy such at least is the only ray of hope to lighten the darkness of these visions of cassandra but perhaps in permitting this ray of hope we have allowed ourselves to yield to a foolish optimism perhaps by means of injections and drugs and chemicals the population could be induced to bear whatever its scientific masters may decide to be for its good new forms of drunkenness involving no subsequent headache may be discovered and new forms of intoxication may be invented so delicious that for their sakes these are possibilities in a world governed by knowledge without love and power without delight the man drunk with power is destitute of wisdom and so long as he rules the world the world will be a place devoid of beauty and of joy
1549354 take again such a matter as housing in england individualism leads most families to prefer a small house of their own rather than an apartment in a large house the result is that the suburbs of london are spread out through mile after mile of dreariness to the immense detriment of the women and children each housewife cooks an abominable dinner at great expenditure of labour for an infuriated husband the children when they come home from school or while they are too young to go to school find themselves cooped up in small stuffy premises where either they are a nuisance to their parents or their parents are a nuisance to them in a more sensible community each family would occupy a part of an immense building with a courtyard in the middle there would be no individual cooking but only communal meals children as soon as they were no longer at the breast would spend their day in large airy halls under the care of women possessing the knowledge the training and the temperament required for making young children happy the wives who at present drudge all day doing wasteful work badly would be set free to earn their living outside the home the benefit of such a system to the mothers and still more to the children would be incalculable at the rachel macmillan nursery school it was found that about 90 per cent of the children had rickets when they first came and almost all were cured at the end of the first year in the school in the ordinary home the necessary modicum of light and air and good food cannot be provided whereas all these things can be provided quite cheaply if they are provided for many children at once the freedom to cause ones children to grow up stunted and crippled on the ground that one is too fond of them to part with them is a freedom which is certainly not in the public interest

1549357 what i would want to do is to have my justice department and my attorney general immediately review the information thats already there emphasis mine and to find out are there inquiries that need to be pursued i cant prejudge that because we dont have access to all the material right now i think that you are right if crimes have been committed they should be investigated youre also right that i would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of republicans as a partisan witch hunt emphasis mine because i think weve got too many problems weve got to solve
1549358 so this is an area where i would want to exercise judgment i would want to find out directly from my attorney general having pursued having looked at whats out there right now emphasis mine are there possibilities of genuine crimes as opposed to really bad policies and i think its important one of the things weve got to figure out in our political culture generally is distinguishing between really dumb policies and policies that rise to the level of criminal activity you know i often get questions about impeachment at town hall meetings and ive said that is not something i think would be fruitful to pursue because i think that impeachment is something that should be reserved for exceptional circumstances now if i found that there were high officials who knowingly consciously broke existing laws engaged in coverups of those crimes with knowledge forefront then i think a basic principle of our constitution is nobody above the law and i think thats roughly how i would look at it
1549359 so i guess im saying that emotions play an important role in thinking about what the legal system should be doing but under our constitutional order we go back and forth between the emotions and the legal requirements and thats a way of guaranteeing fairness and as i say very important to have a degree of bipartisanship with respect to subsequent investigations all emphasis mine

1549364 students who complete algebra ii are more than twice as likely to graduate from college compared with students with less mathematical preparation
1549365 we are ending up with kids in upper level math courses who do not know how to add subtract or divide unless they use a calculator and who are lost when it comes to fractions
1549366 theres a myth that if they are not in algebra by seventh grade they wont get into a good college
1549367 for a small number of middle school kids algebra may be fine but its not for 90 of the kids developmentally most of them are at a stage where they cant think abstractly
1549368 looking back i realize i was too young to grasp the concepts you learn everything quickly so you can spit it out on a test and then pass on to the next thing without really grasping the concepts
1549369 you can break it down in a grammatical sense so it is not just numbers there is something beautiful about all those signs

1549373 he just wants to be good hes not afraid to ask questions at all hes always asking me something on the sidelines well come off the field and a lot of times well talk about something he or i saw that can help us
1549374 this is the preseason so i would rather see him later on down the road like in week 20

1549380 im a complex coward little girl who thinks that the world simply revolves around her a girl who dreams of becoming a princess and thinks that the world is a like a fairy tale thats always too good to be true a runaway princess attention seeking spoiled brat a stupid girl unintentionally i break hearts and then feel guilty afterwards and i would wallow in self pity and hate myself for eternity id give credit to that someone who could successfully break my heart into tiny bits and hurt me inside and out a harsh reality i guess thats me and anyone who has the courage to deal with that i salute to you boss go ahead and give yourself a round of applause for taking the time to get to know me and dive into my fucked up world

1549387 i thought he was extremely emotional last spring i thought his decision to un retire was emotional he told me that wasnt the case so i have to respect that
1549388 i never thought through this whole process that he was going to play this year if im wrong then im wrong
1549389 i just know we were at practice today and favre wasnt there and im the starter
1549390 i think weve been pretty united throughout this whole thing its definitely been difficult for all parties involved but weve tried to stay focused as a team
1549391 its gone on long enough the franchise needs to say one way or another we want brett or we dont want brett if they dont do it then brett needs to say he wants to be here or not be here
1549392 for them to keep us in the dark and have us answering a bunch of questions we cant possibly have a good answer for that isnt fair to us something needs to be said yea or nay for brett favre
1549393 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction

1549411 for the most part the league considers the players to be fungible products
1549412 but lebron is one of the three or four players the league would definitely hate to lose if a team lost him or kobe bryant to europe it would lose its mind it would be devastating
1549413 it would be disappointing to lose one of our star players but i have no concern at all about the best players playing anywhere but in the nba for a long time to come
1549414 id be surprised if one of our top players chose to go to europe but if it did happen there are many players who would step up and fill the void

1549431 this new asic is able to deliver the right combination of performance power and price combined with low up front cost we find the power reduction especially important as we look to add more functionality to our ict infrastructure products

1549447 for the second half of the year we expect sales in the third quarter to be more than the second quarter results but only moderately as both motorola and lg issued warnings for a sequential drop in sales as well as an economic environment that remains challenging

1549463 my understanding that the iraiq parliament did not convene on sunday however it has not yet recessed and lawmakers remain ready to reconvene once a new bill is ready for them to consider the iraqi political leaders are continuing to discuss the elections law ambassador crocker and us embassy officials continue to encourage iraqis to work towards compromise and consensus and to develop an elections law that will allow for provincial elections this year
1549464 after the long talks we held it was clear for us that what happened on july 22 was a big conspiracy and very dangerous for the democratic and constitutional process of iraq in particular against the kurds
1549465 a walkout by kurdish lawmakers over how to deal with the disputed oil city of kirkuk
1549466 we cannot have a vote with an absence of a whole faction the vote is useless it will be rejected by the represenatives of this bloc and by the presidency council
1549467 many observers believe talabani would stand with his kurdish compatriots and vote against the measure bringing it back to square one
1549468 the draft of the provinical elections law will be referred to the presidential council which will definitely not approve it so the elections will be postponed until next year
1549469 a vote had been planned for sunday but it was scrapped when lawmakers failed to agree on how the elections would affect kirkuk which minority kurds want to make part of their semi autonomous northern region turkeys nationalist movement party mhp leader devlet bahceli called on the countrys ruling justice and development party akp in a written statement to warn iraqi kurdish groups in kirkuk more openly and take the necessary measures in order to protect turkmens rights turkey who has historical ties with kirkuk has been monitoring the situation very closely and calls on all parties to reach consensus for a solution
1549470 i think we said something about that last week i believe and our position is that we believe that this now is not the time to be making such a decision we believe that the parties need to leave themselves open to all appropriate or all options in order to come to an understanding so that they can proceed with provincial elections this fall
1549471 the iraqi parliament adjourned its tuesday session without reaching an agreement on provisions in the election law regarding the status of the city of kirkuk shahied al jaberi with the shiite united iraqi alliance said lawmakers opted to postpone the issue until the wednesday session because lawmakers could not agree on the kirkuk issue voices of iraq reported
1549472 elections in kirkuk would also be postponed until no later than december 2009
1549473 a turkmen representative said a delay in kirkuk voting was unacceptable
1549474 the parliament session to approve the provincial election law has been delayed until tomorrow
1549475 the deadlock also prevented a vote by parliament on a 21 billion supplemental budget the crisis has marked the first time that elements of one of the most prominent shiite muslim parties the supreme islamic iraqi council have broken with the kurds their traditional allies

1549485 had met with economic advisers and business leaders in washington last week and they had advised him to call for tapping the government reserve

1549491 india and afghanistan are facing the challenges of terrorism of cold blooded brutal murderous activity in our two countries and we recognise that the two countries and the world at large have no option but to be united in fighting the menace of terrorism as it affects us and as it affects the international community
1549492 as india has suffered immensely from this menace afghanistan has too therefore it is a moral responsibility for us not a political activity i would like to underline it is a moral responsibility for us as human beings to protect the lives of our women and children and to prevent the loss of life caused by terrorism by defeating terrorism and by eliminating it completely and thereby bringing security to our peoples and the world at large

1549499 its fairly clear that this is being packaged as an extraordinary new kind of fund raising and the internet is a new and powerful part of it
1549500 but its also clear that many of the old donors are still there and important
1549501 this is about barack obama and changing the direction of our country
1549502 we value every donation and every donor equally but we are a performance based organization we want everybody to feel like theyre included but at the same time were not here to have tea together
1549503 i dont know whether or not theyre going to give up their weapons
1549504 i really dont know i dont think either of us knows
1549505 i will be patient and i will be consistent i have faith we will be able to move to the verification process then to the next step
1549506 the human rights abuses inside the country still exist and persist the north korea leader has yet to fully verify the extent to which he has had a highly enriched uranium program theres still more steps to be done on the plutonium program
1549507 in order to get off the list the axis of evil list the north korean leader is going to have to make certain decisions
1549508 my hope is that the axis of evil list no longer exists thats my hope for the sake of peace thats my hope for the sake of our children
1549509 as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds to the extent that people arent able to do that people arent able to worship freely is you know i think is a mistake
1549510 i enjoy coming to a free society where people are able to express their opinions and your country is a free society
1549511 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

1549515 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
1549516 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
1549517 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
1549518 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
1549519 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
1549520 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
1549521 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
1549522 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
1549523 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

1549600 vorig jaar hadden we 1800 leden nu zijn daar 800 bijgekomen
1549601 we werden behoorlijk overvallen door deze toename er zijn zelfs verenigingen die een ledenstop in moesten voeren dat gold voor zon beetje alle ijsbanen heel nederland zat vol en er was geen vijf minuten ijs meer te huur
1549602 we doen er alles aan om te voorkomen dat we nee moeten verkopen de verenigingen hebben meer ijstijd gehuurd we hebben extra mensen opgeleid maar soms zit het alsnog vol dat is een groot probleem al is het natuurlijk wel een luxeprobleem want we zijn natuurlijk hartstikke blij met de toestroom en zetten alle zeilen bij ook om de schaatsers vast te houden
1549603 de instroom van jonge mensen is erg belangrijk voor de sport in de toekomst of het door de ijsdansprogramma s komt weet ik niet maar er zitten een paar hele leuke jonge rijdsters aan te komen
1549604 ik had echt heel erg graag doorgegaan ik begon net door te krijgen wat er allemaal kan

1549675 the short race at watkins glen is a bigger challenge than most would expect it is one of the fastest tracks we run on and one of the shortest races we run it also requires a little different setup than other courses the corners are straight forward and very fast a properly setup car is a must for this race since it is a dp race only with no gt cars you should see several different strategies used by teams that will make it a very interesting race
1549676 this is a tough time for the crew we left the track at montr al late on friday night drove to watkins glen moved in on monday and started the prep for fridays race what makes it tough is the time away from home the late hours and the downtime the crew will be gone from home for one and half weeks including two weekends we will do everything but race on thursday and then sit around all day friday until our race that evening we will then work until after midnight packing everything up to exit the track by 2 00 am it is hard work both mentally and physically it takes a lot out of the crew
1549677 returning to the glen for a second time this season allows me to personally be up to speed more quickly ill know immediately what im looking for out of the car and can concentrate solely on setup as opposed to track familiarization and setup so in effect that gives me increased confidence that we can spend more time perfecting our race car
1549678 every race brings a new opportunity and this coming weekend is no different while weve had i feel that our team is much more capable than that the benefit of this course is that i think that the faster flowing turns as opposed to tighter slower ones will complement our engine package having the race be comprised strictly of dps should also play to our advantage thus i believe we could be prime for a season best result
1549679 i find the long course is more challenging but the short course is faster so do i particularly like one of the configurations over the other no not really i generally like faster tracks over slower ones frankly ill like the one that will give us our best performance since the short course provides us a dp only race ill probably favor that aspect over anything else
1549680 i love watkins glen as a driver how can you not like the glen we have had some really good runs the last few races some of it has been good strategy some of it has been skill behind the wheel and some has been just a little luck but at the end of the day you make your own luck you really do as a team we work very hard to get everything out of what we have that is why i love sports car racing all of those things have a role and that is what makes the sport so unique i think watkins glen can be the next step in this team moving forward
1549681 it is even more important that we focus on getting a really good race car because of the configuration results are more car dependant than driver dependant on the short course if you are just a little off on the short course then you are going to be way off the pace
