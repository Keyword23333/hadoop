2860396 some elements with very clear motives and intentions use these lawsuits as a weapon against israel the combat between israel and terrorists continues on different scenes and the legal scene is just one of them

2860403 what may be known about god is plain to them because god has made it plain to them for since the creation of the world gods invisible qualities his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen being understood from what has been made so that men are without excuse for although they knew god they neither glorified him as god nor gave thanks to him but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened

2860422 what is happening over there in lebanon reflects the painful reality that lebanon which is dear to saudis and arabs is not dear to some of its citizens who harmed their country at a time the lebanese economy was in need for development
2860423 in march we are also launching a new section extending over an entire floor of 8 000 square meters dedicated to children dubbed kidsville it will also include a 500 square meter playground an array of kids accessories and a coffee shop la mie doree
2860424 we decided to push forward with the opening of new branches in lebanon despite the prevailing situation following the simple strategy that one has to invest and position oneself in times of relative crisis to prepare for the inevitable economic and political recovery that can be foreseen
2860425 this opening is also justified by a strategic objective to cover the northern beirut area where there is a demand for high quality travel services
2860426 the lebanon venture will also integrate two other complementary projects namely a wine museum and a boutique hotel or h
2860427 i wanted to come back ever since i left i started iioubnan in march 2005 with the help of my wife a french journalist
2860428 it is a web magazine dovetailed with an e commerce wing
2860429 lebanon is our homeland and we believe in our country
2860430 the company will bring to the jordanian market a spirit of lebanon and aims at becoming a leading and trendy shopping destination
2860431 they need to travel study abroad graduate and experience foreign countries
2860432 despite my grief for hariri and his family for its terrible loss whoever did this wanted to destroy what hariri has been doing but we should not be negative
2860433 on the contrary we should keep on going for a better future and i am positive about the future
2860434 we asked the leading 10 most prominent syrians of lebanese origin to join us and we invited 10 prominent syrian businessmen as guest members we did the same in turkey last year and launched it with the turkish embassy here in beirut
2860435 we are a quality group and can afford to pick our members we want to promote business for honest people so business ethics are very important when we choose our members we take into consideration the origin of their money because we dont want gangsters in our group
2860436 we would love to launch from lebanon a palestinian chapter and also for libya
2860437 we would make it an annual occasion and work on opening a chapter in every country in the world
2860438 we hope to have the support of the eu as they have already offered us two experts who have done analysis and research on liban this would promote at the highest level import and export investment and to mobilize the lebanese diaspora abroad for the sake of lebanon their sake and the country they live in
2860439 the system is not really based on big groups but on smaller concerns and we should help and give support to young people to do business
2860440 young lebanese people here and abroad feel frustrated because they have no spokesman to lobby for what they want i am always accusing the government of not doing enough it is not enough for the government to say we love you and dont go abroad we cannot be taken by nice words we are more practical and need more action where is the action
2860441 so far we have been forbidden to be among the main economic organizations of lebanon except the foreign affairs and emigrants ministry what was the reason because we are young but if you see how lebanon is run it is by young people who provide the work and are active but when the time comes to hear their opinion they are told to shut up all these things combine to frustrate young lebanese business people
2860442 in fact young business people have had enough in the middle east and we will not shut up from now on
2860443 we can lobby the government and parliament to make better laws and offer incentives but we are far from dubai why cant lebanon be a dubai sheikh maktoum has made it easy to do business in dubai so far lebanon has not implemented enough incentive for investment
2860444 lebanese are as wealthy and powerful as the jews around the world whether you like the jews or not you have to respect them in the way they help each other and mobilize wealthy people why dont lebanese do this lebanese are individualistic abroad who in many cases went from nothing to creating business empires if you help you will profit we will profit and both countries will profit
2860445 we should promote the fact that thousands of companies in cyprus should come here as they cannot operate there anymore and benefit from zero percent tax you could do billions in offshore business here and lebanon would profit we want foreign companies to have their headquarters in lebanon through offshore companies and to be able to import and export to the arab countries it could be fantastic
2860446 ive been working on it and the russians have just asked us to translate the lebanese offshore laws into russian there are 34 000 companies closing down now in cyprus and if only some come here they can boost the lebanese economy
2860447 even in dark moments we have to be like a phoenix
2860448 we believe in continuation hariris death is a terrible loss for lebanon but hariris family have to keep doing what hariri has done for lebanon to keep it alive and to grow stronger with the younger generation
2860449 globally consumer spending on theme parks is slated to rise by nearly five percent annually resulting in a 28 5 billion industry by 2011 fuelled by vibrant expansion in nations throughout the world
2860450 this increase will be led by the middle east and asia the two fastest growing attractions and amusements parks markets today

2860502 i barged in on him in the bathtub and shoved the stick in his face asking him if he saw a second line he saw it right away and got all smiley stood up in the bath and flexed his arm muscles like he was king kong
2860503 he strutted around like he was a stud for the next couple of days i still catch him doing it and he was so excited to tell anyone he was telling his friend at work that ive never met
2860504 i think he was starting to get worried because all of our friends were getting pregnant
2860505 he hugged me did the im gonna be a daddy dance and boasted about his shooting skills
2860506 i told him i wanted him to look at the test because i wasnt sure
2860507 i had a colposcopy planned and i told my husband to come since it was painful the last time
2860508 we celebrated privately for about two minutes before he picked up the phone most people keep it a secret for a while but i knew wed never be able to he called his dad put his arms around me and told him that this moment was the happiest hed ever been
2860509 i put a bun in the oven in a roaster pan and wrote the expected due date on it we played hot and cold until he finally got to the stove and opened it he barely got it out before i burst out im pregnant he bawled like a baby
2860510 i called from the doctors office and told him well were having a baby and instantly saw him smiling over the phone he has been like a kid in a candy store every since
2860511 after 400 injections thousands of dollars and a year of infertility treatments he was overjoyed
2860512 i took the test and came running out of the bathroom screaming he kept saying are you sure no way i ran to get the test to show him that it literally said pregnant and he started screaming and gave me a hug and kiss then he turned and told the cat he was going to be a brother
2860513 i took the test while my husband was at work so when he came home that night i had tied a ribbon around our dogs neck with the pregnancy test in an envelope that read
2860514 he was in complete denial the morning i took the first test which had a faint line
2860515 he kept saying are you sure really it didnt sink in for him until we finally got to hear the heartbeat after we left he kept saying oh my im really going to be dad he looked stunned the entire time
2860516 my husband told me it wasnt real until our doctor confirmed it but first he realized i had peed on the test the cap was on and i wiped it off anyway before i waved it in his face and told me to get that gross thing out of his face very romantic
2860517 he didnt believe me at all a year before a fertility specialist told me that i would need treatment to get pregnant so my husband thought that was the only way we could have a baby he still jokes that the doctors and i must be making it up
2860518 my husband didnt believe me he made me take a third test when he got home from work when it said i was pregnant he still didnt believe me until three months later when he saw the sonogram
2860519 he quickly grabbed my hand and dragged me out the door and we drove to the nearest drug store
2860520 i told him at 1 a m after he had worked a 17 hour day he asked if i was serious hugged me and said he was happy he then immediately went to our liquor cabinet to make a jack and coke
2860521 he asked if the test was defective since the box says results in three minutes and our positive showed within 30 seconds
2860522 after the initial hugging and staring at the test he immediately and im talking five minutes after the two lines appeared sat down with a calculator and a pad of paper and worked out our finances since we had bought a house literally the day before after about 20 minutes he announced that we should be fine financially to go ahead and do this then he started looking up preschools in our new neighborhood
2860523 he said he knew it because my period hadnt come yet who says men arent observant
2860524 jake began making ignorant and offensive statements to the group
2860525 to their credit they continued to leave and exited the residence
2860526 came running at them yelling for the return of the cell phone
2860527 nick said he was going to beat the s out of them
2860528 jake pushed mike mette at least two times maybe three after the last push mike planted a fist into jakes face that knocked jake to the ground
2860529 without a doubt there was an assault committed by mette
2860530 mette was not the initial aggressor of this incident nick and jake came at the group of six in a threatening manner it was reasonable under the circumstances to believe that harm might come to any of the individuals standing outside on the street
2860531 failed to retreat from the house or walk away and call police about the disturbance because of his failure to take these steps the court cannot find that the self defense justification is available to permit the striking of jake
2860532 if given the discretion to render a decision more appropriate to the facts the court would have imposed a deferred judgment
2860533 mike was threatened and was shoved at least twice and did nothing in response
2860534 hes shoved again and he hits the guy hes defending himself do they put you in prison for five years in iowa for defending yourself when a drunk keeps coming at you
2860535 she commends mike and the others for walking away he didnt react until hed been hit three times mike hit him once she convicts him its insane

2860539 21 not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven 22 many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works 23 and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity
2860540 14 now after that john was put in prison jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god 15 and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel
2860541 18 and jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth
2860542 36 therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made the same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ
2860543 20 which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places 21 far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come 22 and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church 23 which is his body the fulness of him that filleth all in all
2860544 40 as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world 41 the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity 42 and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth 43 then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father who hath ears to hear let him hear
2860545 10 but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up 11 seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness 12 looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat 13 nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness
2860546 5 and there shall be no night there and they need no candle neither light of the sun for the lord god giveth them light and they shall reign for ever and ever
2860547 23 but every man in his own order christ the firstfruits afterward they that are christs at his coming 24 then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power 25 for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet 26 the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death 27 for he hath put all things under his feet but when he saith all things are put under him it is manifest that he is excepted which did put all things under him 28 and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that god may be all in all
2860548 8 henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing
2860549 31 when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory 32 and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats 33 and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left 34 then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world
2860550 10 wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall 11 for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ
2860551 the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ
2860552 21 not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven 22 many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works 23 and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity
2860553 not everyone who says to me lord lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven
2860554 24 ye see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only
2860555 19 thou believest that there is one god thou doest well the devils also believe and tremble
2860556 30 as he spake these words many believed on him 31 then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed 32 and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free
2860557 many will say to me in that day lord lord have we
2860558 22 many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works
2860559 he who does the will of my father in 21 not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven

2860588 15 beware of false prophets which come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves ye shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles 17 even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit 18 a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit 19 every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire 20 wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them
2860589 13 for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of christ 14 and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light 15 therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works
2860590 1 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come 2 for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy 3 without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good 4 traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god 5 having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away 6 for of this sort are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins led away with divers lusts 7 ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth 8 now as jannes and jambres withstood moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith 9 but they shall proceed no further for their folly shall be manifest unto all men as theirs also was
2860591 16 ye shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles 17 even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit 18 a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit 19 every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire 20 wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them
2860592 1 but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the lord that bought them and bring upon themselves swift destruction
2860593 12 yea and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution
2860594 3 and through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not and their damnation slumbereth not
2860595 14 of these things put them in remembrance charging them before the lord that they strive not about words to no profit but to the subverting of the hearers 15 study to shew thyself approved unto god a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth 16 but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness

2860619 you cant find enough oil to drill our way out were importing about 14 million barrels of oil a day in oil and products right now were producing 5 million barrels and the united states peaked on oil in 1970 and it was 10 million barrels so we can never drill our way out of the problem
2860620 that does a far better job of talking about the pros and cons of this source than i ever could
2860621 hydrogen isnt an energy source its an energy carrier like a battery you have to make it and put energy into it both of which take energy
2860622 if you dont understand this concept please mail me ten dollars and ill send you back a dollar
2860623 if you take the total amount of uranium that can be mined energetically without using more energy than what it will yield then all that uranium will only add 5 to 10 years to the lifespan of the fossil fuel age youd make all those investments with the added problems of nuclear waste and only buy 10 years or so that doesnt make sense
2860624 this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of

2860626 insofar as we can estimate the developments the latest numbers indicate that in 25 years around 2030 10 of the worlds energy will be provided by renewables that includes the biomass so its not much and theres still 90 to go in other words it will be too little in volume to solve the entire energy problem combined with the climate problem so in addition to using existing fuels which you cant just get rid of you should work on the best solution for the future the question isnt if it should happen its if we think we have until 2080 or that we decide we need to make considerable progress by 2030 around the world both in europe and elsewhere and do better than the average of 10 that were now headed for once you decide that youll have to make tough choices

2860847 positive psychology is the scientific study of what goes right in life from birth to death and at all stops in between it is a newly christened approach within psychology that takes seriously the examination of that which makes life most worth living everyones life has peaks and valleys and positive psychology does not deny the valleys its signature premise is more nuanced but nonetheless important what is good about life is as genuine as what is bad and therefore deserves equal attention from psychologists

2860876 todays decision in willie ray v state of texas by a federal court in marshall upholding a texas law that restricts the number of signatures on absentee ballot applications that a person may witness is extremely disappointing the decision will regrettably leave in place a significant obstacle between elderly and disabled texans and their right to vote and will serve ultimately to disenfranchise many of them the plaintiffs who brought this case are among the first victims of the supreme courts decision in the indiana voter id case crawford v marion county
2860877 t he plaintiffs offer their deposition testimony which includes logical deductions that 84 004 has the effect of decreasing the numbers of volunteers willing to assist with the early voting ballot application
2860878 appreciates the logical conclusion that precluding volunteers from witnessing more than one ballot application could reduce voter participation to some extent
2860879 the record lacks concrete evidence that 84 004 has had an appreciable impact on elderly and disabled voter participation on this record the court cannot conclude that 84 004 has had a chilling effect on voters or that 84 004 has disenfranchised the voting public to any appreciable extent
2860880 under the plaintiffs proposed construction the state would be forced to honor the voters choice to have an incarcerated family member witness his or her application for an early voting ballot the states position is that section 208 empowers the voter to choose the person who will assist him or her but the voter is not entitled to his or her preferred choice if that choice is reasonably restricted by the state in the states view the protection afforded the voter by section 208 is simply that the voter is not required to accept another persons choice

2860916 we mislead you do your best to figure it out
2860917 theres a real irony going on here the worse the economy gets you would think it hurts bush and hurts the republicans i believe the worse the economy gets the more people get scared to death about what might happen if obama gets elected and raises taxes
2860918 mccain has not articulated a vision for the economy any different from what bush is doing
2860919 as the threat level arises both at home and abroad the economy and national security it becomes harder and harder to close your eyes and bet on obama everybody understands mccain is safe
2860920 and when obama says by the way that hes only gonna raise taxes on the rich thats like the captain of a ship saying the only room hes going to shut down is the engine room
2860921 say what you will about john mccain john mccains made tough decisions he sticks by them

2860934 scaring the hell out of them thats the only way to give diplomacy a chance
2860935 right now the key question going on in israel and in iran i would imagine certainly in israel is will obama let us use iraq to attack iran and the betting among isreali politicians is no
2860936 if its mccain they may give it a little longer and the fascinating thing is that if obama and mccain are close and if the hawkish israeli candidate wins that primary my bet is he attacks before election day to help mccain win
2860937 for the purpose of having mccain win or because you think attacking iran is a good idea
2860938 i think the saudis and the iraqis and the kuwaitis will have parties of thanksgiving that israel is doing the attacking theyll denounce it in public but theyll love it in private
2860939 if you are israel and you are only concerned about israel its what youre in business for and you have an option of attacking in december or attacking in october or september and attacking in september and october would bring may help defeat somebody who you regard as squishy soft on his commitment to you and help elect somebody who you regard as hard as nails in his commitment to you you take the action that helps you
2860940 i believe that if the polling suggests that mccain is gonna win that the israelis may not bomb until after the election or until after the inauguration because they have every confidence that mccain will make the right decision but if the polling shows obamas gonna win theyll attack before the inauguration because they have no confidence that obama will let them use iraqi air space
2860941 therell be a massive retaliation by iran against israel of conventional weapons and you may at that point see an invasion of lebanon an invasion of the west bank an invasion of gaza you may see a whole mess there at that point this country is not going to elect a guy who spent four weeks abroad and thats his foreign policy experience

2860946 all the people who should have been looking out the last six seven eight years are all going oh well who could have known who could have known and theyll put alan greenspan here on a pedestal because hes saying that he had no idea this was going on you had to try not to know this was going on certainly someone like alan greenspan our reserve board chair had all the data i have times a thousand he absolutely knew what was going on and he was doing his best to look the other way because you had a lot of big interests who were making a lot of money

2860973 thomas jefferson once said that all men are created equal there is a tendency for certain people to use this phrase out of context to satisfy all conditions the most ridiculous example i can think of is that the people who run public education promote the stupid and the idle along with the industrious because all men are created equal educators will gravely tell you the children left behind will suffer terrible feelings of inferiority we know all men are not created equal in the sense some people would have us believe some people are smarter than others some people have more opportunity because theyre born with it some men make more money than others some ladies make better cakes than others some people are born gifted beyond the normal scope of most men

2861002 no part of any appropriation contained in this or any other act shall be used for publicity or propaganda purposes within the united states not heretofore authorized by the congress
2861003 the failure of an agency to identify itself as the source of a prepackaged news story misleads the viewing public by encouraging the viewing audience to believe that the broadcasting news organization developed the information the prepackaged news stories are purposefully designed to be indistinguishable from news segments broadcast to the public when the television viewing public does not know that the stories they watched on television news programs about the government were in fact prepared by the government the stories are in this sense no longer purely factual the essential fact of attribution is missing

2861005 look i didnt know look i think that you guys should take a step back and look at this look dod has made a decision theyve decided to stop this program but i would say that one of the things that we try to do in the administration is get information out to a variety of people so that everybody else can call them and ask their opinion about something and i dont think that that should be against the law and i think that its absolutely appropriate to provide information to people who are seeking it and are going to be providing their opinions on it it doesnt necessarily mean that all of those military analysts ever agreed with the administration i think you can go back and look and think that a lot of their analysis was pretty tough on the administration that doesnt mean that we shouldnt talk to people
2861006 scant credible evidence that iraq had any significant collaborative ties with al qaeda
2861007 saddams regime is intensely secular and is wary of islamic revolutionary movements moreover baghdad is unlikely to provide assistance to a group it cannot control
2861008 in desperation saddam would share chemical or biological weapons with al qaeda
2861009 sporadic wary contacts with al qaeda since the mid 1990s rather than a relationship with al qaeda that has developed over time
2861010 if iraq regimes sic continues to defy us and the world we will move deliberately yet decisively to hold iraq to account its a new world were in we used to think two oceans could separate us from an enemy on that tragic day september the 11th 2001 we found out thats not the case we found out this great land of liberty and of freedom and of justice is vulnerable and therefore we must do everything we can everything we can to secure the homeland to make us safe
2861011 with every step the iraqi regime takes toward gaining and deploying the most terrible weapons our own options to confront that regime will narrow and if an emboldened regime were to supply these weapons to terrorist allies then the attacks of september 11th would be a prelude to far greater horrors
2861012 the battle of iraq is one victory in a war on terror that began on september the 11 2001 and still goes on that terrible morning 19 evil men the shock troops of a hateful ideology gave america and the civilized world a glimpse of their ambitions they imagined in the words of one terrorist that september the 11th would be the beginning of the end of america by seeking to turn our cities into killing fields terrorists and their allies believed that they could destroy this nations resolve and force our retreat from the world they have failed
2861013 now were in a new and unprecedented war against violent islamic extremists this is an ideological conflict we face against murderers and killers who try to impose their will these are the people that attacked us on september the 11th and killed nearly 3 000 people the stakes are high and once again we have had to change our strategic thinking the major battleground in this war is iraq
2861014 we know that iraq and al qaeda have had high level contacts that go back a decade some al qaeda leaders who fled afghanistan went to iraq these include one very senior al qaeda leader who received medical treatment in baghdad this year and who has been associated with planning for chemical and biological attacks weve learned that iraq has trained al qaeda members in bomb making and poisons and deadly gases
2861015 w e we need to think about saddam hussein using al qaeda to do his dirty work to not leave fingerprints behind
2861016 evidence from intelligence sources secret communications and statements by people now in custody reveal that saddam hussein aids and protects terrorists including members of al qaeda secretly and without fingerprints he could provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists or help them develop their own
2861017 w hat i want to bring to your attention today is the potentially much more sinister nexus between
2861018 the battle of iraq is one victory in a war on terror that began on september the 11 2001 and still goes on t he liberation of iraq removed an ally of al qaeda
2861019 statements and implications by the president and secretary of state suggesting that iraq and al qaida had a partnership or that iraq had provided with weapons training were not substantiated by the intelligence
2861020 the intelligence community did not confirm that muhammad atta met an iraqi intelligence officer in prague in 2001 as the vice president repeatedly claimed
2861021 a substantial amount of iraqs chemical warfare agents precursors munitions and production equipment were destroyed between 1991 and 1998 as a result of operation desert storm and unscom actions t here is no reliable information on whether iraq is producing and stockpiling chemical weapons or whether iraq has or will establish its chemical warfare agent production facilities
2861022 t he notion of a saddam hussein with his great oil wealth with his inventory that he already has of biological and chemical weapons is i think a frightening proposition for anybody who thinks about it
2861023 in defiance of the united nations iraq has stockpiled biological and chemical weapons and is rebuilding the facilities used to make more of those weapons
2861024 all the world has now seen the footage of an iraqi mirage aircraft with a fuel tank modified to spray biological agents over wide areas iraq has developed spray devices that could be used on unmanned aerial vehicles with ranges far beyond what is permitted by the security council a uav launched from a vessel off the american coast could reach hundreds of miles inland
2861025 the iraqi report also failed to deal with issues which have arisen since 1998 including attempts to acquire uranium and the means to enrich it
2861026 the british government has learned that saddam hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa
2861027 we do know that there have been shipments going into iraq of aluminum tubes that really are only suited to high quality aluminum tools sic that are only really suited for nuclear weapons programs centrifuge programs
2861028 our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production
2861029 h e has made repeated covert attempts to acquire high specification aluminum tubes from 11 different countries even after inspections resumed by now just about everyone has heard of these tubes and we all know that there are differences of opinion there is controversy about what these tubes are for most us experts think they are intended to serve as rotors in centrifuges used to enrich uranium
2861030 statements by the president and vice president prior to the october 2002 national intelligence estimate regarding iraqs chemical weapons production capability and activities did not reflect the intelligence communitys uncertainties as to whether such production was ongoing
2861031 the secretary of defenses statement that the iraqi government operated underground wmd facilities that were not vulnerable to conventional airstrikes because they were underground and deeply buried was not substantiated by available intelligence information
2861032 in making the case for war the administration repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when in reality it was unsubstantiated contradicted or even non existent as a result the american people were led to believe that the threat from iraq was much greater than actually existed
2861033 states such as these iraq iran and north korea and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil arming to threaten the peace of the world by seeking weapons of mass destruction these regimes pose a grave and growing danger they could provide these arms to terrorists giving them the means to match their hatred they could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the united states in any of these cases the price of indifference would be catastrophic
2861034 simply stated there is no doubt that saddam hussein has weapons of mass destruction he is amassing them to use against our friends our enemies and against us
2861035 the history the logic and the facts lead to one conclusion saddam husseins regime is a grave and gathering danger to suggest otherwise is to hope against the evidence to assume this regimes good faith is to bet the lives of millions and the peace of the world in a reckless gamble and this is a risk we must not take
2861036 n o terrorist state poses a greater or more immediate threat to the security of our people than the regime of saddam hussein and iraq
2861037 on its present course the iraqi regime is a threat of unique urgency it has developed weapons of mass death
2861038 but the president also believes that this problem has to be dealt with and if the united nations wont deal with it then the united states with other likeminded nations may have to deal with it we would prefer not to go that route but the danger is so great with respect to saddam hussein having weapons of mass destruction and perhaps even terrorists getting hold of such weapons that it is time for the international community to act and if it doesnt act the president is prepared to act with likeminded nations
2861039 today the world is also uniting to answer the unique and urgent threat posed by iraq a dictator who has used weapons of mass destruction on his own people must not be allowed to produce or possess those weapons we will not permit saddam hussein to blackmail and or terrorize nations which love freedom
2861040 but the risk of doing nothing the risk of the security of this country being jeopardized at the hands of a madman with weapons of mass destruction far exceeds the risk of any action we may be forced to take
2861041 statements by the president and the vice president indicating that saddam hussein was prepared to give weapons of mass destruction to terrorist groups for attacks against the united states were contradicted by available intelligence information
2861042 authorization for use of military force against iraq resolution of
2861043 whereas iraq both poses a continuing threat to the national security of the
2861044 whereas members of al qaeda an organization bearing responsibility for
2861045 b presidential determination in connection with the exercise of the authority granted in subsection a to use force the president shall prior to such exercise or as soon thereafter as may be feasible but no later than 48 hours after exercising such authority make available to the speaker of the house of representatives and the president pro tempore of the senate his determination that 1 reliance by the united states on further diplomatic or other peaceful means alone either a will not adequately protect the national security of the united states against the continuing threat posed by iraq or b is not likely to lead to enforcement of all relevant united nations security council resolutions regarding iraq and 2 acting pursuant to this joint resolution is consistent with the united states and other countries continuing to take the necessary actions against international terrorist and terrorist organizations including those nations organizations or persons who planned authorized committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11 2001
2861046 one question for you both do you believe that there is a link between saddam hussein a direct link and the men who attacked on september the 11th
2861047 i could find no evidence of links between iraq and al qaeda the documentation and interviews indicated that al qaeda regarded saddam a secular leader as an infidel
2861048 weve been looking at this hard for more than a year and you know what we just dont think its there
2861049 nothing in this joint resolution supersedes any requirement of the war powers resolution
2861050 the president is authorized to use the armed forces of the united states as he deems necessary and appropriate in order to 1 defend the national security of the united states against the continuing threat posed by iraq and 2 enforce all relevant united nations security council resolutions regarding iraq
2861051 3 all members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that
2861052 4 all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the united nations
2861053 51 nothing in the present charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective selfdefense if an armed attack occurs against a member of the united nations until the security council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security
2861054 i directed u s armed forces operating with other coalition forces to commence combat operations on march 19 2003 against iraq
2861055 i have indicated it was not in conformity with the un charter from our point of view from the charter point of view it was illegal
2861056 a broken arm a broken thigh and a dislocated ankle
2861057 used me to symbolize all this stuff its wrong i dont know why they filmed my rescue or why they say these things i did not shoot not a round nothing i went down praying to my knees and thats the last i remember
2861058 right after my capture tales of great heroism were being told my parents home in wirt county was under siege of the media all repeating the story of the little girl rambo from the hills who went down fighting it was not true i am still confused as to why they chose to lie

2861060 provisions of the act including sections 841 846 1079 and 1222 purport to impose requirements that could inhibit the presidents ability to carry out his constitutional obligations to take care that the laws be faithfully executed to protect national security to supervise the executive branch and to execute his authority as commander in chief the executive branch shall construe such provisions in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the president
2861061 should be opened to international oil companies as quickly as possible after the war
2861062 the country should establish a conducive business environment to attract investment of oil and gas resources
2861063 by 2010 we will need on the order of an additional 50 million barrels a day so where is the oil going to come from governments and national oil companies are obviously controlling about 90 percent of the assets oil remains fundamentally a government business while many regions of the world offer great oil opportunities the middle east with two thirds of the worlds oil and lowest cost is still where the prize ultimately lies even though companies are anxious for greater access there progress continues to be slow
2861064 in a january 29 2001 memorandum the president established nepdg the national energy policy development group comprised of the vice president nine cabinet level officials and four other senior administration officials to gather information deliberate and make recommendations to the president by the end of fiscal year 2001 the president called on the vice president to chair the group direct its work and as necessary establish subordinate working groups to assist nepdg
2861065 other senior administration officials were the director of the office of management and
2861066 in developing the national energy policy report the nepdg principals support group and
2861067 none of the key federal entities involved in the nepdg effort provided gao with a complete accounting of the costs that they incurred during the development of the national energy policy report the two federal entities responsible for funding the nepdg effort ovp and the department of energy doe did not provide the comprehensive cost information that gao requested ovp provided gao with 77 pages of information two thirds of which contained no cost information while the remaining one third contained some miscellaneous information of little to no usefulness ovp stated that it would not provide any additional information doe the department of the interior and the environmental protection agency epa provided gao with estimates of certain costs and salaries associated with the nepdg effort but these estimates all calculated in different ways were not comprehensive
2861068 iraq possesses huge reserves of oil and gas reserves id love chevron to have access to
2861069 to open up areas of their energy sectors to foreign investment
2861070 from the beginning the administration adopted a flawed contracting approach in iraq instead of
2861071 even after the administration claimed it was awarding iraq contracts competitively in early 2004 real
2861072 in the absence of price competition rigorous government oversight becomes essential for
2861073 under halliburtons two largest iraq contracts pentagon auditors found 1 billion in questioned costs
2861074 the air force found that another u s government contractor custer battles set up shell
2861075 despite the spending of billions of taxpayer dollars u s reconstruction efforts in keys sectors of the iraqi economy are failing over two years after the u s led invasion of iraq oil and electricity production has fallen below pre war levels the administration has failed to even measure how many iraqis lack access to drinkable water
2861076 bunnatine greenhouse was the chief contracting officer at the army corps of engineers the agency
2861077 on june 27 2005 ms greenhouse testified before congress detailing that the contract award process
2861078 the most blatant and improper contract abuse i have witnessed during the course of my professional career
2861079 on august 27 2005 the army demoted ms greenhouse removing her from the elite senior executive service and transferring her to a lesser job in the corps civil works division as frank rich of the new york times described the situation h er crime was not obstructing justice but pursuing it by vehemently questioning irregularities in the awarding of some 7 billion worth of no bid contracts in iraq to the halliburton subsidiary kellogg brown root the demotion was in apparent retaliation for her speaking out against the abuses even though she previously had stellar reviews and over 20 years of experience in military procurement
2861080 the administrations domestic contracting record is no better than its record on iraq waste fraud and
2861081 a transportation security administration tsa cost plus contract with ncs pearson inc to hire
2861082 the administration is spending 239 million on the integrated surveillance and intelligence system a

2861087 according to news reports pentagon auditors examined a contract between the transportation security administration tsa and unisys a technology and consulting company for the upgrade of airport computer networks among other irregularities government auditors found that unisys may have overbilled for as much as 171 000 hours of labor and overtime by charging for employees at up to twice their actual rate of compensation while the cost ceiling for the contract was set at 1 billion unisys has reportedly billed the government 940 million with more than half of the seven year contract remaining and more than half of the tsa monitored airports still lacking upgraded networks

2861092 must have some status under international law he is either a prisoner of war and as such covered by the third convention or a civilian covered by the fourth convention there is no intermediate status nobody in enemy hands can be outside the law
2861093 encourage populations dominated by terrorist organizations or their supporters to overthrow that domination
2861094 foodstuffs economic assistance medical supplies and russian military equipment some of it funneled through nonprofit groups
2861095 it appears to us that there was never any legitimate basis for the purely legal analysis contained in this
2861096 in addition to this opinion however the yoo memorandum references at least 10 other olc opinions
2861097 indeed a recent court filing by the department in foia litigation involving the central intelligence agency identifies 8 additional secret olc opinions dating from august 6 2004 to february 18 2007 given that these reflect only olc memoranda identified in the files of the cia and based on the sampling procedures under which that listing was generated it appears that these represent only a small portion of the secret olc memoranda generated during this time with the true number almost certainly much higher
2861098 it is a basic tenet of democracy that the people have a right to know the law in keeping with this
2861099 that purpose today is being thwarted congressional enactments and agency regulations are for the
2861100 a legal interpretation by the justice departments office of legal counsel binds the entire
2861101 another body of secret law is the controlling interpretations of the foreign intelligence surveillance
2861102 the administrations shroud of secrecy extends to agency rules and executive pronouncements such as executive orders that carry the force of law through the diligent efforts of my colleague senator whitehouse we have learned that olc has taken the position that a president can waive or modify a published executive order without any notice to the public or congress simply by not following it
2861103 whoever except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the constitution or act of congress willfully uses any part of the army or the air force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years or both

2861109 months after the sept 11 attacks president bush secretly authorized the national security agency to eavesdrop on americans and others inside the united states to search for evidence of terrorist activity without the court approved warrants ordinarily required for domestic spying according to government officials
2861110 i have reauthorized this program more than 30 times since the september the 11th attacks and i intend to do so for as long as our nation faces a continuing threat from al qaeda and related groups the nsas activities under this authorization are thoroughly reviewed by the justice department and nsas top legal officials including nsas general counsel and inspector general leaders in congress have been briefed more than a dozen times on this authorization and the activities conducted under it
2861111 we have had discussions with congress in the past certain members of congress as to whether or not fisa could be amended to allow us to adequately deal with this kind of threat and we were advised that that would be difficult if not impossible
2861112 the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized
2861113 the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 unambiguously limits warrantless domestic
2861114 exclusive means by which electronic surveillance and the interception of domestic wire oral and electronic communications may be conducted
2861115 our position is is that the authorization to use force which was passed by the congress in the days following september 11th constitutes that other authorization that other statute by congress to engage in this kind of signals intelligence
2861116 from the foregoing analysis it appears unlikely that a court would hold that congress has
2861117 presidential authority to conduct warrantless electronic surveillance to gather foreign intelligence information
2861118 the inescapable conclusion is that the aumf did not implicitly authorize what the fisa expressly prohibited it follows that the presidential program of surveillance at issue here is a violation of the separation of powers as grave an abuse of executive authority as i can recall ever having studied
2861119 nsa program to wiretap the international communications of some americans without a court warrant violated the constitution judge taylor ruled that the program violated both the fourth amendment and a 1978 law that requires warrants from a secret court for intelligence wiretaps involving people in the united states she rejected the administrations repeated assertions that a 2001 congressional authorization and the presidents constitutional authority allowed the program
2861120 the stored communications act of 1986 sca prohibits the knowing disclosure of customer telephone records to the government unless pursuant to subpoena warrant or a national security letter or other administrative subpoena with the customers lawful consent or there is a business necessity or an emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury none of these exceptions apply to the circumstance described in the usa today story

2861128 most of observed warming over last 50 years is likely due to increases in greenhouse gas concentrations due to human activities
2861129 increase threats to human health particularly in lower income populations predominantly within tropical subtropical countries
2861130 explores how such an abrupt climate change scenario could potentially destabilize the geo political environment leading to skirmishes battles and even war due to resource constraints such as 1 food shortages due to decreases in net global agricultural production 2 decreased availability and quality of fresh water in key regions due to shifted precipitation patters causing more frequent floods and droughts 3 disrupted access to energy supplies due to extensive sea ice and storminess
2861131 remarkably none of the papers disagreed with the consensus position
2861132 in august 2003 the bush administration denied a petition to regulate co2 emissions from motor vehicles by deciding that co2 was not a pollutant under the clean air act in april 2007 the u s supreme court overruled that determination in massachusetts v epa the supreme court wrote that if epa makes a finding of endangerment the clean air act requires the agency to regulate emissions of the deleterious pollutant from new motor vehicles the epa then conducted an extensive investigation involving 60 70 staff who concluded that co2 emissions endanger both human health and welfare these findings were submitted to the white house after which work on the findings and the required regulations was halted
2861133 the record before the committee shows 1 the career staff at epa unanimously supported granting californias petition to be allowed to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks consistent with california state law 2 stephen johnson the administrator of epa also supported granting californias petition at least in part and 3 administrator johnson reversed his position after communications with officials in the white house
2861134 at climate laboratories of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration for example many scientists who routinely took calls from reporters five years ago can now do so only if the interview is approved by administration officials in washington and then only if a public affairs officer is present or on the phone
2861135 the evidence before the committee leads to one inescapable conclusion the bush administration has engaged in a systematic effort to manipulate climate change science and mislead policy makers and the public about the dangers of global warming
2861136 there was a systematic white house effort to minimize the significance of climate change by editing climate change reports ceq chief of staff phil cooney and other ceq officials made at least 294 edits to the administrations strategic plan of the climate change science program to exaggerate or emphasize scientific uncertainties or to de emphasize or diminish the importance of the human role in global warming
2861137 almost 1 600 epa scientists completed the union of concerned scientists survey questionnaire over 22 percent of these scientists reported that selective or incomplete use of data to justify a specific regulatory outcome occurred frequently or occasionally at epa ninety four epa scientists reported being frequently or occasionally directed to inappropriately exclude or alter technical information from an epa scientific document nearly 200 epa scientists said that they have frequently or occasionally been in situations in which scientists have actively objected to resigned from or removed themselves from a project because of pressure to change scientific findings

2861144 in a single 17 sentence document the intelligence briefing delivered to president bush in august 2001 spells out the who hints at the what and points towards the where of the terrorist attacks on new york and washington that followed 36 days later
2861145 reiterated a consistent and constant theme osama bin ladens intent to launch terrorist attacks inside the united states
2861146 the attack will be spectacular and designed to inflict mass casualties against u s facilities or interests attack preparations have been made attack will occur with little or no warning

2861151 i need to report that according to the white house and the director of central intelligence the presidents knowledge of intelligence information relevant to this inquiry remains classified even when the substance of the intelligence information has been declassified
2861152 epas response to the world trade center collapse challenges successes and areas for improvement
2861153 w hen epa made a september 18 announcement that the air was safe to breathe it did not have sufficient data and analyses to make such a blanket statement at that time air monitoring data was lacking for several pollutants of concern including particulate matter and polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs furthermore the white house council on environmental quality ceq influenced through the collaboration process the information that epa communicated to the public through its early press releases when it convinced epa to add reassuring statements and delete cautionary ones
2861154 as a result of the white house ceqs influence guidance for cleaning indoor spaces and information
2861155 all statements to the media should be cleared through the nsc national security council before
2861156 according to the epa chief of staff one particular ceq official was designated to work with epa to ensure that clearance was obtained through nsc the associate administrator for the epa office of communications education and media relations ocemr said that no press release could be issued for a 3 to 4 week period after september 11 without approval from the ceq contact
2861157 i think that the thinking was these are experts in wmd weapons of mass destruction so they should have the coordinating role
2861158 both upper and lower respiratory problems and mental health difficulties are widespread among
2861159 an analysis of the screenings of 1 138 workers and volunteers who responded to the world trade center disaster found that nearly three quarters of them experienced new or worsened upper respiratory problems at some point while working at ground zero and half of those examined had upper and or lower respiratory symptoms that persisted up to the time of their examinations an average of eight months after their wtc efforts ended

2861228 in year three you should know what your glide path is
2861229 you should have repurposed by year five or you dont have to because youre reaching the standards

2861243 its not just about solving one problem but a deeper understanding
2861244 all these teachers that were responsible for this growth i have to get rid of three out of four of them
2861245 teachers have families and investments and they want to know where theyre going to be
2861246 success with kids and a real ability to make education come alive

2861278 to charge ii a violation of article 118 premeditated murder
2861279 in my opinion the principal factor the five decided to accept the governments plea bargain offer was the potential of life in the penitentiary without parole was just too intimidating
2861280 there are more members of our military accused of murder or serving time for murder than at any other time that i or my contemporaries can recall
2861281 only the defense department has that information and theyre not about to release it
2861282 our soldiers are on edge 24 7 there is no front line to retreat from there is no uniform to identify the enemy you have layers of roe rules of engagement stress fatigue and when something goes wrong they face accusations that bring life sentences i fear we may be eating our own

2861301 mijn jongste zoon was gisteravond over het web aan het surfen en tot mijn schrik zat hij op de website van de bbc
2861302 dat uk aan het eind dat staat toch voor united kingdom
2861303 verdomme ik wist het wel nou die heeft een probleem dat kan ik je wel vertellen hij zat er meer dan een half uur hoeveel kost het eigenlijk naar engeland
2861304 zo werkt het niet helemaal u kunt surfen naar elke plek ter wereld zonder dat dat meer kost dan lokaal inbel tarief
2861305 nee ik weet zeker dat daar extra voor gerekend wordt het zou onzinnig zijn om het niet te doen tenslotte engeland is ver weg ze zouden miljoenen verliezen als ze het niet zouden doen
2861306 nou het lijkt erop dat je gelijk hebt ik heb nog een vraag voor je
2861307 weet jij of e mailen naar het buitenland duurder is
2861308 prachtig mijn oudste zoon werkt in zweden hij stuurt ons e mail maar ik vond het altijd eng om hem te beantwoorden omdat ik niet wist hoeveel het kost daarom belde ik hem altijd maar op dit scheelt me een hoop centen toch zou het slim van ze zijn als ze internet naar het buitenland duurder zouden maken

2861313 uhm u moet uw printerkabel inpluggen in de computer de kabel moet van de printer naar uw computer lopen als het goed is zat er een kabel in de doos toen u de computer bij ons kocht
2861314 volgens mij niet hoor er was wel een vreemd uitziende kabel bij maar ik dacht dat dat een extra kabel was dus die heb ik weggegooid
2861315 u heeft echt een andere printerkabel nodig als u wilt printen en die moet u aansluiten aan uw computer en aan de printer
2861316 het staat misschien niet op het plaatje maar als u wilt printen zult u dat toch echt moeten doen
2861317 het enige dat u hoeft te doen is een printerkabel kopen en deze aan te sluiten
2861318 dus je bedoelt dat ik extra dingen moet kopen om mijn computer te laten werken
2861319 nee u had een goede printerkabel maar die heeft u weggegooid zei u

2861462 the anger and toxic obsessions overwhelmed even the most reserved beltway wise men
2861463 h er advisers couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution s he never behaved like a chief executive and her own staff proved to be her achilles heel

2861475 they proposed that clinton from a position of strength immediately after her wins challenge obama to accept michigan and florida revotes

2861499 um salaim said o allahs apostle allah does not refrain from saying the truth is it obligatory for a woman to take a bath after she gets nocturnal discharge he said yes if she notices the water i e discharge um salama smiled and said does a woman get discharge allahs apostle said then why does a child resemble its mother
2861500 i am going to ask you about three things which nobody knows except a prophet what is the first portent of the hour what will be the first meal taken by the people of paradise why does a child resemble its father and why does it resemble its maternal uncle
2861501 he i e gabriel from amongst all the angels is the enemy of the jews
2861502 the first portent of the hour will be a fire that will bring together the people from the east to the west the first meal of the people of paradise will be extra lobe caudate lobe of fish liver as for the resemblance of the child to its parents if a man has sexual intercourse with his wife and gets discharge first the child will resemble the father and if the woman gets discharge first the child will resemble her

2861511 as regards your creation every one of you is collected in the womb of his mother for the first forty days and then he becomes a clot for an other forty days and then a piece of flesh for an other forty days then allah sends an angel to write four words he writes his deeds time of his death means of his livelihood and whether he will be wretched or blessed in religion then the soul is breathed into his body so a man may do deeds characteristic of the people of the hell fire so much so that there is only the distance of a cubit between him and it and then what has been written by the angel surpasses and so he starts doing deeds characteristic of the people of paradise and enters paradise similarly a person may do deeds characteristic of the people of paradise so much so that there is only the distance of a cubit between him and it and then what has been written by the angel surpasses and he starts doing deeds of the people of the hell fire and enters the hell fire
2861512 allah has appointed an angel in the womb and the angel says o lord a drop of discharge i e of semen o lord a clot o lord a piece of flesh and then if allah wishes to complete the childs creation the angel will say o lord a male or a female o lord wretched or blessed in religion what will his livelihood be what will his age be the angel writes all this while the child is in the womb of its mother

2861540 on the day of resurrection abraham will meet his father azar whose face will be dark and covered with dust the prophet abraham will say to him didnt i tell you not to disobey me his father will reply today i will not disobey you abraham will say o lord you promised me not to disgrace me on the day of resurrection and what will be more disgraceful to me than cursing and dishonoring my father then allah will say to him i have forbidden paradise for the disbelievers
2861541 what is the matter with them i e quraish they have already heard that angels do not enter a house in which there are pictures yet this is the picture of abraham and why is he depicted as practicing divination by arrows
2861542 may allah curse them i e the quraish by allah neither abraham nor ishmael practiced divination by arrows
2861543 o allahs apostle who is the most honorable amongst the people in allahs sight
2861544 then you want to ask about the descent of the arabs those who were the best in the pre lslamic period of ignorance will be the best in islam provided they comprehend the religious knowledge
2861545 two persons came to me at night in dream and took me along with them we passed by a tall man who was so tall that i was not able to see his head and that person was abraham
2861546 i did not hear this but the prophet said if you want to see abraham then look at your companion i e the prophet but moses was a curly haired brown man who used to ride a red camel the reins of which was made of fires of date palms as if i were now looking down a valley
2861547 abraham did his circumcision with an adze at the age of eighty
2861548 abraham did not tell a lie except on three occasions
2861549 i have not done this but the big idol has done it
2861550 this man i e abraham is accompanied by a very charming lady
2861551 o sarah there are no believers on the surface of the earth except you and i this man asked me about you and i have told him that you are my sister so dont contradict my statement
2861552 pray to allah for me and i shall not harm you
2861553 pray to allah for me and i will not harm you
2861554 you have not brought me a human being but have brought me a devil
2861555 allah has spoiled the evil plot of the infidel or immoral person and gave me hajar for service
2861556 that hajar was your mother o bani ma is sama i e the arabs the descendants of ishmael hajars son
2861557 it i e the salamander blew the fire on abraham
2861558 o allahs apostle who is there amongst us who has not done wrong to himself
2861559 it is not as you say for wrong in the verse and do not confuse their belief with wrong means shirk i e joining others in worship with allah havent you heard luqmans saying to his son o my son join not others in worship with allah verily joining others in worship with allah is a great wrong indeed
2861560 on the day of resurrection allah will gather all the first and the last people in one plain and the voice of the announcer will reach all of them and one will be able to see them all and the sun will come closer to them
2861561 the people will go to abraham and say you are allahs prophet and his khalil on the earth will you intercede for us with your lord abraham will then remember his lies and say myself myself go to moses
2861562 may allah bestow his mercy on the mother of ishmael had she not hastened to fill her water skin with water from the zam zam well zam zam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth
2861563 the prophet abraham brought ishmael and his mother to mecca and she was suckling ishmael and she had a water skin with her
2861564 o abraham where are you going leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy nor is there anything to enjoy
2861565 this is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them i e safa and marwa when she reached the marwa for the last time she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively she heard the voice again and said o whoever you may be you have made me hear your voice have you got something to help me
2861566 may allah bestow mercy on ishmaels mother had she let the zam zam flow without trying to control it or had she not scooped from that water to fill her water skin zam zam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth
2861567 then she drank water and suckled her child the angel said to her dont be afraid of being neglected for this is the house of allah which will be built by this boy and his father and allah never neglects his people the house i e kaba at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock and when torrents came they flowed to its right and left she lived in that way till some people from the tribe of jurhum or a family from jurhum passed by her and her child as they i e the jurhum people were coming through the way of kada they landed in the lower part of mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it they said this bird must be flying around water though we know that there is no water in this valley they sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water and returned to inform them of the water so they all came towards the water
2861568 ishmaels mother was sitting near the water they asked her do you allow us to stay with you
2861569 ishmaels mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people so they settled there and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there the child i e ishmael grew up and learnt arabic from them and his virtues caused them to love and admire him as he grew up and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them after ishmaels mother had died abraham came after ishmaels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before but he did not find ishmael there when he asked ishmaels wife about him she replied he has gone in search of our livelihood then he asked her about their way of living and their condition and she replied we are living in misery we are living in hardship and destitution complaining to him he said when your husband returns convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate of his house when ishmael came he seemed to have felt something unusual so he asked his wife has anyone visited you she replied yes an old man of so and so description came and asked me about you and i informed him and he asked about our state of living and i told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty on that ishmael said did he advise you anything she replied yes he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate ishmael said it was my father and he has ordered me to divorce you go back to your family so ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them i e jurhum then abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as allah wished and called on them again but did not find ishmael so he came to ishmaels wife and asked her about ishmael she said he has gone in search of our livelihood abraham asked her how are you getting on asking her about their sustenance and living she replied we are prosperous and well off i e we have everything in abundance then she thanked allah abraham said what kind of food do you eat she said meat he said what do you drink she said water
2861570 at that time they did not have grain and if they had grain he would have also invoked allah to bless it
2861571 if somebody has only these two things as his sustenance his health and disposition will be badly affected unless he lives in mecca
2861572 when your husband comes give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate when ishmael came back he asked his wife did anyone call on you she replied yes a good looking old man came to me so she praised him and added he asked about you and i informed him and he asked about our livelihood and i told him that we were in a good condition ishmael asked her did he give you any piece of advice she said yes he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate on that ishmael said it was my father and you are the threshold of the gate he has ordered me to keep you with me then abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as allah wished and called on them afterwards he saw ishmael under a tree near zamzam sharpening his arrows when he saw abraham he rose up to welcome him and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father abraham said o ishmael allah has given me an order ishmael said do what your lord has ordered you to do abraham asked will you help me ishmael said i will help you abraham said allah has ordered me to build a house here pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it
2861573 then both of them went on building and going round the kaba saying o our lord accept this service from us verily you are the all hearing the all knowing
2861574 if she had left the water flow naturally without her intervention it would have been flowing on the surface of the earth
2861575 will you stay for some time and have something to eat and drink abraham asked what is your food and what is your drink she replied our food is meat and our drink is water he said o allah bless their meals and their drink
2861576 o ishmael your lord has ordered me to build a house for him
2861577 allah has also ordered me that you should help me therein
2861578 o our lord accept this service from us verily you are the all hearing the all knowing
2861579 o allahs apostle which mosque was first built on the surface of the earth
2861580 wherever you may be and the prayer time becomes due perform the prayer there for the best thing is to do so i e to offer the prayers in time
2861581 this is a mountain that loves us and is loved by us o allah abraham made mecca a sanctuary and i make the area in between these two mountains of medina a sanctuary
2861582 dont you see that when your folk built the kaba they did not build it on all the foundations built by abraham
2861583 o allahs apostle why dont we rebuild it on the foundations of abraham
2861584 but for the fact that your folk have recently given up infidelity i would have done so
2861585 o allahs apostle how shall we ask allah to send blessings on you
2861586 say o allah send your mercy on muhammad and on his wives and on his off spring as you sent your mercy on abrahams family and send your blessings on muhammad and on his offspring as you sent your blessings on abrahams family for you are the most praise worthy the most glorious
2861587 shall i not give you a present i got from the prophet
2861588 we are more liable to be in doubt than abraham when he said my lord show me how you give life to the dead
2861589 yes but i ask in order to be stronger in faith
2861590 o offspring of ishmael practice archery i e arrow throwing as your father was a great archer i e arrow thrower i am with on the side of the son of so and so
2861591 o allahs apostle how shall we throw when you are with the opposite team
2861592 the most honorable among them is the one who is the most allah fearing
2861593 then the most honorable person is joseph allahs prophet the son of allahs prophet the son of allahs prophet the son of allahs khalil
2861594 then you want to ask me about the arabs descent
2861595 those who were best in the pre lslamic period are the best in islam if they comprehend the religious knowledge
2861596 may allah forgive lot he wanted to have a powerful support
2861597 the honorable is the son of the honorable the son the honorable i e joseph the son of jacob the son of isaac the son of abraham
2861598 the most honorable person is joseph allahs prophet the son of allahs prophet the son of allahs prophet the son of allahs khalil
2861599 order abu bakr to lead the prayer you are like the female companions of joseph
2861600 o allah save aiyyash bin abi rabia from the unjust treatment of the infidels o allah save salama bin hisham o allah send your punishment on the tribe of mudar o allah let them suffer from years of drought similar to that inflicted during the life time of joseph
2861601 may allah bestow his mercy on lot he wanted to have a powerful support if i were to stay in prison for a period equal to the stay of joseph prison and then the offer of freedom came to me then i would have accepted it
2861602 while i was sitting with aisha an ansari woman came to us and said let allah condemn such and such person i asked her why do you say so she replied for he has spread the slanderous story aisha said what story the woman then told her the story aisha asked have abu bakr and allahs apostle heard about it she said yes aisha fell down senseless on hearing that and when she came to her senses she got fever and shaking of the body the prophet came and asked what is wrong with her i said she has got fever because of a story which has been rumored aisha got up and said by allah even if i took an oath you would not believe me and if i put forward an excuse you would not excuse me my example and your example is just like that example of jacob and his sons against that which you assert it is allah alone whose help can be sought 12 1 the prophet left and then allah revealed the verses concerning the matter and on that aisha said thanks to allah only and not to anybody else
2861603 respite will be granted until when the apostles give up hope of their people and thought that they were denied by their people
2861604 by allah they were definite that their nations treated them as liars and it was not a matter of suspecting
2861605 o uraiya i e urwa no doubt they were quite sure about it
2861606 may the verse be read in such a way as to mean that the apostles thought that allah did not help them
2861607 allah forbid impossible the apostles did not suspect their lord of such a thing but this verse is concerned with the apostles followers who had faith in their lord and believed in their apostles and their period of trials was long and allahs help was delayed till the apostles gave up hope for the conversion of the disbelievers amongst their nation and suspected that even their followers were shaken in their belief allahs help then came to them
2861608 the honorable the son of the honorable the son of the honorable was joseph the son of jacob the son of isaac the son of abraham
2861609 while job was naked taking a bath a swarm of gold locusts fell on him and he started collecting them in his garment
2861610 that is the same angel whom allah sent to the prophet moses should i live till you receive the divine message i will support you strongly
2861611 gabriel greeted and so did i and he returned the greeting saying welcome o pious brother and pious prophet
2861612 on the night of my ascension to heaven i saw the prophet moses who was a thin person with lank hair looking like one of the men of the tribe of shanua and i saw jesus who was of average height with red face as if he had just come out of a bathroom
2861613 one should not say that i am better than jonah i e yunus bin matta
2861614 the prophet moses was brown a tall person as if from the people of the tribe of shanua jesus was a curly haired man of moderate height
2861615 this is a great day on which allah saved moses and drowned the folk of pharaoh moses observed the fast on this day as a sign of gratitude to allah
2861616 were it not for bani israel meat would not decay and were it not for eve no woman would ever betray her husband
2861617 my friend and i have differed regarding moses companion whom moses asked the way to meet have you heard allahs apostle mentioning something about him
2861618 yes i heard allahs apostle saying while moses was sitting in the company of some israelites a man came and asked him do you know anyone who is more learned than you moses replied no so allah sent the divine inspiration to moses yes our slave khadir is more learned than you moses asked how to meet him i e khadir so the fish was made as a sign for him and he was told that when the fish was lost he should return and there he would meet him so moses went on looking for the sign of the fish in the sea the servant boy of moses said to him do you know that when we were sitting by the side of the rock i forgot the fish and t was only satan who made me forget to tell you about it moses said that was what we were seeking after and both of them returned following their footmarks and found khadir and what happened further to them is mentioned in allahs book
2861619 nauf al bukah claims that moses the companion of al khadir was not moses the prophet of the children of israel but some other moses
2861620 have you killed an innocent person who has not killed any person you have really done a horrible thing
2861621 did i not tell you that you could not remain patient with me
2861622 if i ask you about anything after this dont accompany me
2861623 these are the people whom we have called on but they neither gave us food nor entertained us as guests yet you have repaired their wall if you had wished you could have taken wages for it
2861624 this is the parting between you and me and i shall tell you the explanation of those things on which you could not remain patient
2861625 we wished that moses could have remained patient by virtue of which allah might have told us more about their story
2861626 al khadir was named so because he sat over a barren white land it turned green with plantation after his sitting over it
2861627 it was said to bani israel enter the gate of the town with humility prostrating yourselves and saying
2861628 the prophet moses was a shy person and used to cover his body completely because of his extensive shyness
2861629 o you who believe be you not like those who annoyed moses but allah proved his innocence of that which they alleged and he was honorable in allahs sight
2861630 this distribution has not been done with justice seeking allahs countenance
2861631 may allah bestow his mercy on moses for he was harmed more in a worse manner than this yet he endured patiently
2861632 you have sent me to a slave who does not want to die
2861633 return to him and tell him to put his hand on the back of an ox and for every hair that will come under it he will be granted one year of life
2861634 allahs apostle said if i were there i would show you his grave below the red sand hill on the side of the road
2861635 dont give me superiority over moses for the people will become unconscious on the day of resurrection and i will be the first to gain consciousness to see moses standing and holding a side of allahs throne i will not know if he has been among those people who have become unconscious and that he has gained consciousness before me or he has been amongst those whom allah has exempted
2861636 all the nations were displayed in front of me and i saw a large multitude of people covering the horizon
2861637 many amongst men reached the level of perfection but none amongst the women reached this level except asia pharaohs wife and mary the daughter of imran and no doubt the superiority of aisha to other women is like the superiority of tharid i e a meat and bread dish to other meals
2861638 none of you should say that i am better than yunus i e jonah
2861639 no slave of allah should say that i am better than yunus bin matta
2861640 no by him who gave moses superiority over all human beings
2861641 you say by him who gave moses superiority over all human beings although the prophet muhammad is present amongst us
2861642 o abu l qasim i am under the assurance and contract of security so what right does so and so have to slap me
2861643 dont give superiority to any prophet amongst allahs prophets for when the trumpet will be blown everyone on the earth and in the heavens will become unconscious except those whom allah will exempt the trumpet will be blown for the second time and i will be the first to be resurrected to see moses holding allahs throne i will not know whether the unconsciousness which moses received on the day of tur has been sufficient for him or has he got up before me and i do not say that there is anybody who is better than yunus bin matta
2861644 none should say that i am better than yunus bin matta
2861645 the reciting of the zabur i e psalms was made easy for david he used to order that his riding animals be saddled and would finish reciting the zabur before they were saddled and he would never eat except from the earnings of his manual work
2861646 by allah i will fast all the days and pray all the nights as long as i live
2861647 are you the one who says i will fast all the days and pray all the nights as long as i live
2861648 you cannot do that so fast sometimes and do not fast sometimes pray and sleep fast for three days a month for the reward of a good deed is multiplied by ten time and so the fasting of three days a month equals the fasting of a year
2861649 o allahs apostle i can do fast more than this
2861650 fast on alternate days and this was the fasting of david which is the most moderate sort of fasting
2861651 o allahs apostle i can do fast more than that
2861652 i have been informed that you pray all the nights and observe fast all the days is this true
2861653 if you do so your eyes will become weak and you will get bored so fast three days a month for this will be the fasting of a whole year or equal to the fasting of a whole year
2861654 then fast like the fasting of the prophet david who used to fast on alternate days and would not flee on facing the enemy
2861655 the most beloved fasting to allah was the fasting of the prophet david who used to fast on alternate days and the most beloved prayer to allah was the prayer of david who used to sleep for the first half of the night and pray for 1 3 of it and again sleep for a sixth of it
2861656 your prophet is amongst those people who have been ordered to follow them i e the preceding apostles
2861657 a strong demon from the jinns came to me yesterday suddenly so as to spoil my prayer but allah enabled me to overpower him and so i caught him and intended to tie him to one of the pillars of the mosque so that all of you might see him but i remembered the invocation of my brother solomon and grant me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me 38 35 so i let him go cursed
2861658 solomon the son of david said tonight i will sleep with seventy ladies each of whom will conceive a child who will be a knight fighting for
2861659 if the prophet solomon had said it i e if allah will he would have begotten children who would have fought in allahs cause
2861660 wherever the time for the prayer comes upon you perform the prayer for all the earth is a place of worshipping for you
2861661 my example and the example o the people is like that of a person who lit a fire and let the moths butterflies and these insects fall in it
2861662 there were two women each of whom had a child with her a wolf came and took away the child of one of them whereupon the other said it has taken your child the first said but it has taken your child so they both carried the case before david who judged that the living child be given to the elder lady so both of them went to solomon bin david and informed him of the case he said bring me a knife so as to cut the child into two pieces and distribute it between them the younger lady said may allah be merciful to you dont do that for it is her i e the other ladys child so he gave the child to the younger lady
2861663 who amongst us has not mixed his belief with wrong
2861664 join none in worship with allah verily joining others in worship with allah is a great wrong indeed
2861665 o allahs apostle who amongst us does not do wrong to himself
2861666 the verse does not mean this but that wrong means to associate others in worship to allah dont you listen to what luqman said to his son when he was advising him
2861667 then gabriel took me and ascended up till he reached the second heaven where he asked for the gate to be opened but it was asked who is it
2861668 i heard allahs apostle saying there is none born among the off spring of adam but satan touches it a child therefore cries loudly at the time of birth because of the touch of satan except mary and her child
2861669 and i seek refuge with you for her and for her offspring from the outcast satan
2861670 mary the daughter of imran was the best among the women of the world of her time and khadija is the best amongst the women of this nation
2861671 the superiority of aisha to other ladies is like the superiority of tharid i e meat and bread dish to other meals many men reached the level of perfection but no woman reached such a level except mary the daughter of imran and asia the wife of pharaoh
2861672 if anyone testifies that none has the right to be worshipped but allah alone who has no partners and that muhammad is his slave and his apostle and that jesus is allahs slave and his apostle and his word which he bestowed on mary and a spirit created by him and that paradise is true and hell is true allah will admit him into paradise with the deeds which he had done even if those deeds were few
2861673 ubada added such a person can enter paradise through any of its eight gates he likes
2861674 none spoke in cradle but three the first was jesus the second was there a man from bani israel called juraij while he was offering his prayers his mother came and called him he said to himself shall i answer her or keep on praying
2861675 o allah do not let him die till he sees the faces of prostitutes
2861676 as if i were now looking at the prophet sucking his finger in way of demonstration
2861677 i met moses on the night of my ascension to heaven
2861678 he was a tall person with lank hair as if he belonged to the people of the tribe of shanus
2861679 he was one of moderate height and was red faced as if he had just come out of a bathroom i saw abraham whom i resembled more than any of his children did
2861680 that night i was given two cups one full of milk and the other full of wine i was asked to take either of them which i liked and i took the milk and drank it on that it was said to me you have taken the right path religion if you had taken the wine your muslim nation would have gone astray
2861681 i saw moses jesus and abraham on the night of my ascension to the heavens jesus was of red complexion curly hair and a broad chest moses was of brown complexion straight hair and tall stature as if he was from the people of az zutt
2861682 while i was asleep circumambulating the kaba in my dream suddenly i saw a man of brown complexion and lank hair walking between two men and water was dropping from his head i asked who is this the people said he is the son of mary then i looked behind and i saw a red complexioned fat curly haired man blind in the right eye which looked like a bulging out grape i asked who is this they replied he is ad dajjal the one who resembled to him among the people was ibn qatar
2861683 i am the nearest of all the people to the son of mary and all the prophets are paternal brothers and there has been no prophet between me and him i e jesus
2861684 both in this world and in the hereafter i am the nearest of all the people to jesus the son of mary the prophets are paternal brothers their mothers are different but their religion is one
2861685 jesus seeing a man stealing asked him did you steal he said no by allah except whom there is none who has the right to be worshipped jesus said i believe in allah and suspect my eyes
2861686 do not exaggerate in praising me as the christians praised the son of mary for i am only a slave so call me the slave of allah and his apostle
2861687 if a person teaches his slave girl good manners properly educates her properly and then manumits and marries her he will get a double reward and if a man believes in jesus and then believes in me he will get a double reward and if a slave fears his lord i e allah and obeys his masters he too will get a double reward
2861688 you will be resurrected and assembled bare footed naked and uncircumcised
2861689 as we began the first creation we shall repeat it a promise we have undertaken truly we shall do it
2861690 those were the apostates who renegade from islam during the caliphate of abu bakr who fought them
2861691 by him in whose hands my soul is surely jesus the son of mary will soon descend amongst you and will judge mankind justly as a just ruler he will break the cross and kill the pigs and there will be no jizya i e taxation taken from non muslims money will be in abundance so that nobody will accept it and a single prostration to allah in prayer will be better than the whole world and whatever is in it
2861692 if you wish you can recite this verse of the holy book and there is none of the people of the scriptures jews and christians but must believe in him i e jesus as an apostle of allah and a human being before his death and on the day of judgment he will be a witness against them
2861693 how will you be when the son of mary i

2861701 even a successful war against iraq will require a u s occupation of undetermined length at undetermined cost with undetermined consequences

2861735 theyve iran declared they want to have a nuclear weapon to destroy people some in the middle east and thats unacceptable to the united states and its unacceptable to the world
2861736 obviously iran is also heavily involved in trying to develop nuclear weapons enrichment the enrichment of uranium to weapons grade levels
2861737 it is common knowledge and has been reported in the media that al qaeda is going back into iran and receiving training and are coming back into iraq from iran thats well known and its unfortunate
2861738 the rockets that were launched at the g reen zone in baghdad yesterday for example were iranian provided iranian made rockets
2861739 if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it people will eventually come to believe it the lie can be maintained only for such time as the state can shield the people from the political economic and or military consequences of the lie it thus becomes vitally important for the state to use all of its powers to repress dissent for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie and thus by extension the truth is the greatest enemy of the state
2861740 today in iraq america and our allies stand on the precipice of winning a major victory against radical islamic extremism the security gains over the past year have been dramatic and undeniable al qaeda and shia extremists with support from external powers such as iran are on the run but not defeated
2861741 the problem is the iranian government cannot be trusted to enrich uranium because one theyve hidden programs in the past and they may be hiding one now who knows
2861742 thats as uninformed as sen john mccains statement that iran is training al qaeda iran has never said it wanted a nuclear weapon for any reason its just not true its a little troubling that the president and the leading republican candidate are both so wrong about iran
2861743 the iranian government is on the record across the board as saying it does not want a nuclear weapon theres plenty of room for skepticism about these assertions but its troubling for the administration to indicate that iran is explicitly embracing the program as a means of destroying another country
2861744 has declared two acts of war one against irans banks and one against any financial institution anywhere in the world that tries to do business with an iranian bank
2861745 irans oil fields need structural upgrades including enhanced oil recovery eor efforts such as natural gas injection

2861757 we bombed hiroshima we bombed nagasaki and we nuked far more than the thousands in new york and the pentagon and we never batted an eye we have supported state terrorism against the palestinians and black south africans and now we are indignant because the stuff we have done overseas is now brought right back to our own front yards americas chickens are coming home to roost
2861758 i categorically denounce any statement that disparages our great country or serves to divide us from our allies
2861759 the violence of 9 11 was inexcusable and without justification it sounds like he rev wright was trying to be provocative
2861760 this constant drumbeat of conflict is not helpful and not useful i expect that there will be no war and that is what we ought to be working for we ought to try to do our utmost to create different conditions

2861766 i think the guy calls em as he sees em and as president would call em as he sees em and would make people mad all over the place because it wouldnt fit anybodys playbook
2861767 hes a very good legislator from my point of view because when he gets onto something he doesnt just want to introduce a bill he likes to move it and hes fearless
2861768 people couldnt believe how long we stayed on mccain feingold wed come to those press conferences year after year and you guys would laugh at us i mean literally
2861769 hes a great guy to fight an uphill battle with legislatively he keeps his word i probably shouldnt be saying this stuff but to be honest about it it was one of the better professional experiences ive ever had in my life
2861770 its unfair because mccains a blast hes fun to be around hes certainly young in spirit hes actually very young in energy
2861771 yes he shows temper but he burns fast and he doesnt let it cloud his judgment he would not be a loose cannon in the oval office
2861772 its not like hes going to pick up the red phone in a rage
2861773 he is not a guy who wants to be chummy chummy with political leaders of the party he doesnt like that sort of constraint hes an independent
2861774 so he somehow managed to become the nominee of the republican party but we all know its not because he was somebody that was kissing up to the republican establishment to say the least

2861781 if he does not resign within the next 24 to 48 hours we will prepare articles of impeachment to remove him

2861784 remember when you faced such and such adversity and you prayed to me so i relieved you of it remember when you were travelling in such and such a place and you asked me to give you a travelling companion and i did so remember when you asked for the hand of so and so the daughter of so and so and others also asked for her hand so i gave her to you to marry and kept the others away
2861785 i hope that no one will stand before his lord in this way because the one who does so will be punished
2861786 the blessing of all h to us in keeping the luxuries of this world away from us is greater than the blessing of that which he has given us because allah did not like his prophet to have the luxuries of this world so i prefer to live in the manner which all h preferred for his prophet than to live a life which he disliked for him
2861787 it was narrated to me that some scholars said the scholar should praise all h for having deprived him of the luxuries of this life in the same way that he should praise him for what he has bestowed upon him

2861796 the meaning of al hamdu lillah all praise and thanks be to allah is all thanks are due purely to allah alone not any of the objects that are being worshipped instead of him nor any of his creation these thanks are due to allahs innumerable favors and bounties that only he knows the amount of allahs bounties include creating the tools that help the creation worship him the physical bodies with which they are able to implement his commands the sustenance that he provides them in this life and the comfortable life he has granted them without anything or anyone compelling him to do so allah also warned his creation and alerted them about the means and methods with which they can earn eternal dwelling in the residence of everlasting happiness all thanks and praise are due to allah for these favors from beginning to end
2861797 a praise that allah praised himself with indicating to his servants that they too should praise him as if allah had said say all thanks and praise is due to allah it was said that the statement all praise and thanks be to allah entails praising allah by mentioning his most beautiful names and most honorable attributes when one proclaims all thanks are due to allah he will be thanking him for his favors and bounties
2861798 we know la ilaha illallah subhan allah and allahu akbar what about al hamdu lillah
2861799 a statement that allah liked for himself was pleased with for himself and he likes that it be repeated
2861800 al hamdu lillah is the statement of appreciation when the servant says al hamdu lillah allah says my servant has praised me

2861819 barack obama never held a single senate hearing on afghanistan he hasnt been to iraq in years he voted against funding our troops positions that helped him win his nomination now obama is changing to help himself become president
2861820 if they have a difference with me on policy they should debate me not her
2861821 what is interesting is that a man who is not white is trying to be president this is interesting because it is so unique
2861822 his second name hussein is arabic but that will make no difference because his father refused his religion and his name to get what he wanted this is the height of pragmatism and is standard in the united states the persons interests are above all other things
2861823 anyway whether obama or sen john mccain wins the president is just the figure who works on strategies run by the institutions that run america the president is like a middleman
2861824 they are two very different kinds of people there is clearly a lot of tension between the two but that never stops anyone from joining into an alliance if they can win and given the odds republicans face and given the challenges that mccain faces in winning if romney brings him that one asset that changes his odds i think mccain would be more than willing to enter into that alliance
2861825 the first lady tightrope walk unlike earlier presidential spouses michelle obama and cindy mccain must emphasise both career and family to avoid criticism
2861826 unfortunately for first ladies the game is often more about un favourability than favourability
2861827 they rarely deliver votes but they have much more of a track record of alienating voters or losing voters so the first ladys mission is to follow the political version of the hippocratic oath first do no harm
2861828 it is clear to me that democrats want to attack me rather than debate senator mccain on important economic issues facing the country
2861829 that kind of distraction hurts not only senator mccains ability to present concrete programs to deal with the countrys problems it hurts the country to end this distraction and get on with the real debate i hereby step down as co chair of the mccain campaign and join the growing number of rank and file mccain supporters

2861986 i am a christian and i am a devout christian i believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of jesus christ i believe that that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life but most importantly i believe in the example that jesus set by feeding the hungry and healing the sick and always prioritizing the least of these over the powerful i didnt fall out in church as they say but there was a very strong awakening in me of the importance of these issues in my life i didnt want to walk alone on this journey accepting jesus christ in my life has been a powerful guide for my conduct and my values and my ideals there is one thing that i want to mention that i think is important part of what weve been seeing during the course this campaign is some scurrilous e mails that have been sent out denying my faith talking about me being a muslim suggesting that i got sworn in the u s senate with a quran in my hand or that i dont pledge allegiance to the flag i think its really important for your readers to know that i have been a member of the same church for almost 20 years and i have never practiced islam i am respectful of the religion but its not my own one of the things thats very important in this day and age is that we dont use religion as a political tool and certainly that we dont lie about religion as a way to score political points i just thought it was important to get that in there to dispel rumors that have been over the internet weve done so repeatedly but obviously its a political tactic of somebody to try to provide this misinformation

2862021 theres not that much difference between my position and george bushs position at this stage the difference in my mind is whos in a position to execute

2862025 obamas position on mining law questioned democrat shares position with mining executives who employ lobbyist advising him
2862026 senator obamas staff was sending us copies of the bill to review and we could see it weakening with each successive draft
2862027 since 2003 executives and employees of exelon which is based in illinois have contributed at least 227 000 to mr obamas campaigns for the united states senate and for president two top exelon officials frank m clark executive vice president and john w rogers jr a director are among his largest fund raisers
2862028 it simply isnt a major improvement over gasoline when it comes to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions
2862029 obama wants the insurance companies to help us develop a new health care plan the same companies who have created the mess in the first place
2862030 i dont think nafta has been good for americans and i never have
2862031 in his 2004 senate campaign obama said the us should pursue more deals such as nafta and argued more broadly that his opponents call for tariffs would spark a trade war ap reported then that the illinois senator had spoken of enormous benefits having accrued to his state from nafta while adding that he also called for more aggressive trade protections for us workers
2862032 im amazed at democrats cowering with this presidents numbers so low
2862033 applauded israels siege and starvation of 1 5 million innocent gazans
2862034 make so many accusations about obama without one shred of evidence
2862035 the rock afire explosion videos went viral as they say and all hell broke loose
2862036 i decided to make an investment in the whole youtube phenomenon
2862037 developed by fechter puts internet users in the producers chair as they pay to get new songs produced
2862038 the company didnt want to license characters from me anymore they wanted to own my characters
2862039 but i believed i had a future with the rock afire explosion beyond what they wanted to do with it
2862040 nowadays it would cost several hundred thousand dollars to build a set
2862041 i sold them to fans for next to nothing to put them into the hands of people who loved them
2862042 my dream as far back as i can remember was to own a rock afire explosion stage show
2862043 our label sent me an e mail and said have you guys seen that rock afire website
2862044 its a story of two things the story of how rock afire came to be and how it came to disappear its sort of a tragic story there
2862045 but its also the story of chris thrash who single handedly brought it back into the public arena by putting shows on youtube
2862046 the question now is whether its a nostalgic flash in the pan or is there something there i say lets see if we can create quality content that will give us a new life
2862047 i knew from the very beginning if we could hang on long enough some day the rock afire explosion would live on again
2862048 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2862049 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
2862050 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2862051 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2862052 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation
2862053 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2862054 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
2862055 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2862056 we were actually getting ready to schedule a trip to memphis to talk to isaac
2862057 id never thought about the size of a characters hands ever
2862058 ive been celibate for a year and starting to think i may never have sex again
2862059 its not something i planned but i just dont get asked out any more
2862060 men seem to look at me and think she went out with george clooney
2862061 there was a friendship in the beginning but they got closer after heath died
2862062 spike was there for michelle after the tragedy and he helped her get through some of the darkest days
2862063 right now theyre secretly playing house and seeing where things go but its serious enough that spike is the first love interest michelles introduced her daughter to since heaths death and hes so great with matilda thats one of the reasons michelle is falling so hard for him
2862064 i think many of our problems as a country would be solved if people had thick passports
2862065 theres just no substitute for actually going and seeing things
2862066 its still not my business i just stayed out of it so i dont know
2862067 i obviously hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem
2862068 to believe that i achieved something they hadnt is very special
2862069 i have no regrets of anything i did out there
2862070 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2862071 i turned to my caddie on 16 and said god this is a lot of fun just to watch
2862072 to try to go ahead with the fight against poverty or it could just entrench the situation further
2862073 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2862074 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2862075 the vice president expressed the with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2862076 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2862077 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2862078 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2862079 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2862080 let us make man in our image in our likeness and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air over the livestock over all the earth and over all the creatures that move along the ground
2862081 to crush your enemys watch them driven before you and to hear the lamentations of there women
2862082 activities in connection with motor carrier operations pose an imminent hazard to the public
2862083 i think that god used this tragedy to strengthen our faith i truly believe that
2862084 help the people of cuba realize the blessings of liberty
2862085 eventually this transition ought to lead to free and fair elections and i mean free and i mean fair not these kind of staged elections that the castro brothers try to foist off as true democracy
2862086 the struggle of the persecuted kosovar people for independence is reminiscent of the struggles by other nations for the right of self determination
2862087 state of israel which was established in the wake of the jewish peoples struggle for self determination
2862088 prove that the jewish state is not an enemy of the muslims
2862089 who ha ve not identified with extremist islamic tendencies and ha ve kept a distance from israels opponents in the arab world
2862090 muslims of kosovo constitute an absolute majority of the population
2862091 israeli governments have resigned themselves to the blatant unconcealed separatist actions of the galilee arabs
2862092 arab intellectuals and public officials have compiled documents known as the vision in which they reject israel as a jewish state and the homeland of the jewish people
2862093 the american and eu impatience to sever a portion of a un member state universally recognized even by them to constitute a portion of that states sovereign territory ostensibly because 90 percent of those living in that portion of the states territory support separation contrasts starkly with the unlimited patience of the us and the eu when it comes to ending the 40 year long belligerent occupation of the west bank and gaza strip
2862094 the ramallah based palestinian leadership accepted as such by the international community because it is perceived as serving israeli and american interests
2862095 this leadership truly believes despite all evidence to the contrary that a decent two state solution is still possible

2862118 the biblical prophecies of what would portend the coming of armageddon and so forth and the fact that a number of theologians for the last decade or more have believed that this was true that the prophecies are coming together that portend that

2862149 if i knew where caylee is i wouldnt be in jail
2862150 we had a chance to take a trip to a cenote while on vacation in playa del carmen in mexico the water was crystal clear warm and so relaxing we walked down a long steep staircase into an underground cave where a pool of the clearest cleanest freshwater ive ever seen awaited us the sun was shining into the cenote helping illuminate the stalactites and stalagmites it was awesome

2862154 these hands though wrinkled shriveled and weak have been the tools i
2862155 they held my husband and wiped my tears when he went off to war
2862156 they were uneasy and clumsy when i tried to hold my newborn daughter
2862157 they wrote my letters to him and trembled and shook when i buried my
2862158 they have been sticky and wet bent and broken dried and raw
2862159 these hands are the mark of where ive been and the ruggedness of life

2862169 actually the true gourmet like the true artist is one of the unhappiest creatures existent his trouble comes from so seldom finding what he constantly seeks perfection
2862170 gourmandism is an impassioned considered and habitual preference for whatever pleases the taste it is the enemy of overindulgence any man who eats too much or grows drunk risks being expelled from the army of disciples
2862171 no esta corte no este imperio de sangre y de fuego no este rumor de usura y soldadesca
2862172 motorists residents and store owners in the area say a tow company waited until lots near the parade route were full of cars before posting towing notices and taking vehicles each owner had to shell out at least 170 to rendered services inc to retrieve their cars
2862173 its easy to get caught up in the distractions and the silliness and the tit for tat that consumes our politics
2862174 became a substitute for i think true patriotism which is speaking out on issues that are of importance to our national security
2862175 im really grateful to the wa police for allowing me to take up this opportunity and i cant wait to run out with my new team mates this season
2862176 hes very versatile has two good feet and can play anywhere down the left for us
2862177 scotty is someone ive had my eye on for a while he is very keen to be a professional player and give it a crack and things have fallen into place that will allow him to do that which is fantastic
2862178 there are quality players locally and ill continue to give them the opportunities to play with the glory if theyre up to the standard
2862179 we have a terrific mix of players this season and im confident that wa football fans will have plenty to get excited about when the season kicks off
2862180 kalau awak baik dan sayang kepada anak isteri kita takkan
2862181 sexo por um mundo melhor se divertindo e preservando o meio ambiente oh id ia boa
2862182 i will not entreat you nor do i care what sentence you pass

2862184 pernahkah kamu bermuamalah supaya kamu tahu setakat mana waraknya dia pernahkah kamu menjadi jirannya supaya kamu tahu kemana perginya dan setakat mana pergaulan siapa keluarga dan kawan kawannya
2862185 tidak ada yang lebih baik bagi kedua pasangan yang berkasih ini melainkan mengakhirinya dengan perkahwinan
2862186 pergi lihat dahulu wanita itu kalau kalau dengan melihat itu boleh menjamin kasih sayang di antara kamu
2862187 orang orang yang benar benar redha dengan pasangan yang di tentukan oleh allah tetapi pokok pangkal banyak terletak pada hati kaum lelaki
2862188 barangsiapa yang berkawin dengan wanita kerana kedudukan ia hanya mendapat kehancuran sebagai balasan barangsiapa yang berkawin dengan wanita kerana kekayaan allah menjanjikan kemiskinan barangsiapa yang menikahi kerana keturunan allah akan menghina keturunannya dan barang siapa yang berkawin dengan niat baik dan kerana allah demi menutup pandangan dan kemaluannya atau menyambung silahturrahim allah akan memberkati kedua duanya
2862189 apa yang dikatakan baik bukan sekadar mengikut telunjuk isteri suami baik yang di maksudkan sanggup mengaku kekurangan diri dan mencari jalan mengatasinya
2862190 seorang lelaki yang tidak baik itu sesuai dengan wanita yang tidak baik dan seorang lelaki yang baik itu adalah untuk wanita yang baik
2862191 i know how he she feels i have been there
2862192 one day sophie comes home from school to find two questions in her mail who are you and where does the world come from
2862193 sophie amundsen was on her way home from school she had walked the first part of the way with joanna they had been discussing robots joanna thought the human brain was like an advanced computer sophie was not certain she agreed

2862195 the development of embryo in mammals if you compare the embryos of dogs bats rabbits and humans at an early stage the look so alike that it is hard to tell the difference you cannot distinguish a human embryo from a rabbit embryo until a very late stage shouldnt this indicate that we are distant relatives
2862196 i awoke at about 900am in my hotel bed in central sydney feeling financially embarrassed to say the least with only one more night left in sydney before making the depressing 23hr flight back to london heathrow and a little over 100 in my pocket i was faced with a stark choice hotel with comfy bed nearby for my last night or an all day drinking session in the pubs of sydney and sleep at the airport it was an obvious choice really so at about 930pm that night i staggered into the international terminal full of beer and looked for somewhere comfy to crash on arrival i saw the airport wasnt that busy apart from rather a lot of hyperactive japanese teenagers running around and shouting whilst they waited for their flight to tokyo narita airport i found a nice comfy looking padded flat bench in a quiet corner at the other end of the terminal and fell onto it using my luggage as a pillow i soon drifted off into an alcohol induced slumber not more than 5 minutes later i was awoken by a loud p a recorded announcement telling me to keep my luggage with me at all times and to report any suspicious items i saw great advice i thought as i started to drift off again about 5 minutes later the same loud announcement was made waking me up again i rolled over and covered my head with my zip up jacket five minutes later the same announcement was made again and again five minutes after that and so on i lay looking at my watch the announcements continued until 1100pm when it all went quiet thank god i thought and fell into a peaceful sleep at about 1130 pm i was woken up by a security guard who told me the airport was closing and if i wanted to sleep there i had to go downstairs to the arrivals lounge to a waiting area with other transit passengers i was too tired to argue the point and i shuffled off to the escalators the area set aside for us downstairs was basic to say the least and quite busy with lots of other sleepy people dotted around on the few available seats and the floor on looking at this scene my heart sank and i wandered off outside for a cigarette outside it was a warm night it was very quiet there was a nice bench seat by some trees under a light i didnt fancy going back and fighting for a space on the floor so i thought i would sleep outside on the bench under the stars i didnt have anything worth nicking in my backpack anyway so what the hell i wondered why none of the others had thought of this i stretched out and was soon fast asleep my flight left at 1015 the next morning as i queued to check in i could not stop scratching at the 20 or so mosquito bites that covered my legs and arms i had been eaten alive outside that night amp realised why none of the others hadnt slept outside i had 3 40 in my pocket calamine lotion from the airport chemist was 5 50 i had 23 hours until london note to all travellers from sydney if you only have a few dollars left spend it more wisely than i did

2862212 the worst comments ever in the history of the innernetubes
2862213 secara keseluruhan terdapat tujuh paket shabu shabu tapi yang di tangan sheila cuma 0 2 gram saja
2862214 roger nggak ada di situ yang ada kan ay dari inisialnya aja udah beda
2862215 berkali kali saya ditawari untuk menerima uang itu macam macam caranya dia oknum pembagi bansos red membujuk saya saya tidak mau
2862216 saya ini terus didatangi terakhir waktu rapat komisi saya dibisikin tinggal pak ali aja yang belum terima ini
2862217 saya heran itu uang dari mana uang gaji dan tunjangan perumahan dewan sudah terima tiap bulan terus uang apa lagi itu kami di partai sudah ditatar yang namanya uang riswah suap atau gratifikasi fungsi dewan syariah yang mengawasi kalau sampai ada anggota dewan yang terima risikonya tanggung sendiri
2862218 rumah ini saya beli tahun 2003 waktu saya beli kondisinya setengah jadi itu sampai sekarang pagarnya belum jadi
2862219 sppd itu ndak banyak apalagi sekarang ini harga tiket pesawat naik terus sementara anggaran sppd tidak berubah walapun harga bbm naik
2862220 saya seakan akan sudah ndak tahan saya ingin kembali mengajar dan memenuhi undangan perusahaan berdakwah red
2862221 wah soal itu saya kurang tahu pokoknya lihat besok sajalah baru bisa kita komunikasikan lagi
2862222 kondisi sheila masih agak shock dan pucat kita bisa pahami mungkin ini yang pertama kali dia berhubungan dengan polisi
2862223 yang jelas dia ditangkap di apartemen di sana ada barang bukti tapi perlu diselidiki lagi barang itu milik siapa
2862224 rencananya besok kita ingin minta penangguhan penahanan sesuai uu kuhp pasal 60 yang isinya bahwa seorang terdakwa atau tersangka punya hak permohonan untuk pengajuan penangguhan penahanan
2862225 dia cuma bilang kenapa ini harus terjadi ini suatu kesalahan
2862226 biarlah dari kejadian ini dia belajar dari sesuatu biar dia dapat lebih bijak jika memilih teman
2862227 mungkin ini akibat coba coba sheila hanya berada di tempat yang salah dan waktu yang salah tapi kan nggak tahu dia pakai atau tidak
2862228 sekarang kondisinya sehat nggak apa apa udah stabil nggak batuk batuk lagi dia mengungkapkan penyesalannya saya belum bisa ngomong banyak sama dia
2862229 tidak mungkin pernyataan seperti itu tidak didasari bukti dan juga pasti bukan alasan untuk lempar tanggung jawab apalagi ini kasus besar beliau pasti memiliki bukti hukum seperti surat tertulis atau bisa berupa saksi
2862230 ini yang nantinya menjadi tugas penyidik mereka harus mengusut tuntas kalaupun memang tidak ada bukti tertulis dan saksi pernyataan itu tetap harus diusut tidak hanya oleh kpk tapi juga oleh pengadilan tinggi
2862231 menurut saya akan banyak yang terlibat maka kpk harus melakukan penyidikan secara tuntas semua sama di mata hukum tidak boleh ada yang terlepas semua penyidikan harus dilakukan secara proporsional dan menyeluruh
2862232 kemitraan ini diartikan oknum sebagai hal yang negatif salah satu contohnya kasus dana bansos ini
2862233 siapa pun yang menekan asal taat pada aturan tidak akan terjadi ini merupakan prinsip dasar kepemimpinan namun kalau kemitraan sudah terbentuk memang ada beban psikologis yang ada

2862244 that um they werent big enough to express how much i love you
2862245 excuse me mr big cheese before we get started id like to say a few things
2862246 good morning everyone before we get started there are a few things i really need for everyone to be aware of to better understand the situation
2862247 firstly throughout this meeting you may very well see my hands shake from time to time and possibly i may have some difficulty forming words at times please dont be concerned or alarmed
2862248 i have recently had an icky diagnosis and these are a couple of the symptoms also i wanted everyone to know a little bit about my educational back round right off the bat it seems ever since ive had meetings at the schools in the district ive been treated as though i didnt have a clue as to what i was talking about to save us all some time and embarrassment especially for those whove already made assumptions that they were more educated than myself these are my qualifications

2862252 cuando los estudiantes practicaban de esta manera yang cheng fu se sentaba en su silla y los observaba
2862253 l siempre miraba y nunca se iba mientras miraba les hac a repetir las posturas una y otra vez hasta que las aprend an bien era un gran maestro
2862254 mucha gente puede decir los principios pero no pueden seguirlos f cilmente
2862255 la raz n por la que se hace tai chi despacio es porque nosotros queremos hacerlo m s r pido este es el principio la idea del taiji es practicar despacio pero no consiste en hacer movimientos sino usar tu mente para controlar estos movimientos no son movimientos solamente es utilizar nuestro interior para hacer el movimiento de manera que cada movimiento fuera el fin en si mismo
2862256 si haces los movimientos deprisa algo puede estar mal y pasar desapercibido pero si lo haces despacio entonces puedes darte cuenta si est s haciendo algo mal y otras personas pueden verlo
2862257 esta es la raz n por la que incluso los principiantes con fuertes piernas experimentan temblores en stas cuando comienzan a practicar taiji
2862258 mi abuelo me dice que advierta a la gente para que no est 1 hora practicando una vez la secuencia as no hay jing desaparece si lo haces y tardas 1 hora es que est parado
2862259 es dif cil de explicar cuando t lo tienes sabes c mo hacerlo
2862260 t puedes hacer movimientos bajos amplios con los brazos o con pasos cortos y los brazos menos amplios esto depende del nivel en el que te encuentres pero si sigues los principios tus hombros est n relajados los codos suspendidos el peso del cuerpo delante y relajado entonces no puedo decirte que est s haci ndolo mal
2862261 mucha gente cambi la forma soy el nico que no la ha cambiado c mo puedo cambiarla los ancianos fueron muy buenos c mo puedes cambiar algo que desarrollaron personas con tan altas habilidades
2862262 mucha gente tiene unos buenos movimientos pero pierde ciertas puntos importantes cuando hace las transiciones y esto debilita su kung fu
2862263 cuando haces la postura de cepillar la rodilla no es el brazo el que bloquea o empuja tienes que utilizar la cintura
2862264 la cintura es lo m s importante si utilizas la cintura entonces puedes relajarte incorporas todo el cuerpo y todo l se relajar naturalmente la cintura es quien controla relajas los hombros y los codos esto viene de la pr ctica no de hablarlo
2862265 cuando haces la forma haces la forma muchas formas te ense an c mo usar los movimientos y al mismo tiempo te ense an t cnicas de defensa personal
2862266 la cuesti n principal al hacer las formas es hacer tus piernas fuertes como las raices de un rbol
2862267 cualquier momento puede ser utilizado para practicar fa jing igual que el fa jing es fuerte tambi n es relajado y el codo tiene que estar desbloqueado
2862268 esto es porque ten a mucho jing en su dantian
2862269 si t pones tu pensamiento ah nunca estar s ah pero tienes que controlar tu equilibrio corporal es muy importante cuando realizas los movimientos
2862270 dec a es como una mangera cuando riegas el jard n si no presionas la boca de la manguera el agua fluye normalmente si la presionas o la doblas levemente el agua ir m s deprisa y si presionas la boca muy fuerte el agua se parar as lo que hacemos en taiji es doblar ligeramente la mu eca para incrementar la presi n si se flexiona demasiado entonces la sangre parar su circulaci n hay que doblarla un poco pero manteniendo la mu eca y la mano relajada
2862271 tienes que tener un poco de presi n en la mu eca y la palma de la mano para sentir la circulaci n sangu nea
2862272 tienes que trabajar los cimientos hasta que la base sea firme y profunda tienes tambi n que hundir los kua y relajar y hundir las caderas tienes que sentir que te hundes necesitas elevar las ingles no pueden bajar
2862273 la nuca debe estar plana y elevada con los ojos mirando al frente no mirar abajo a los pies sino hacia delante en la direcci n del movimiento
2862274 l nunca me pidi que fuera en posiciones muy bajas me ense aba a ir m s alto al principio y despu s poco a poco fue bajando m s las posiciones si lo haces de esta manera tus rodillas no ir n m s all de tus dedos de los pies y es menos peligroso y da ino para las rodillas
2862275 puede estar bien ir m s all de los dedos cuando conectas un movimiento con otro pero cuando paras el movimiento no se debe sobrepasar esa l nea
2862276 hacemos un poco de estiramientos y algunos ejercicios de respiraci n que son m s como meditaci n t utilizas tu mente para relajar usando la intenci n esto se hace antes y despu s del taiji con posturas bien de pie o bien sentado es la manera antigua y cuando practicamos tienes que seguir utilizando la mente
2862277 la respiraci n natural es la que se usa durante la pr ctica

2862290 idealnya adalah makin sering makin baik tetapi definisi sering ini juga bersifat amat relatif tergantung ketubuhan setiap pasangan suami istri
2862291 tetapi yang saya maksud di sini adalah aktivitas seksual bukan melulu hubungan seks jadi segala macam aktivitas yang berhubungan dengan seks walau tanpa hubungan intim bisa dimasukkan ke dalam kategori aktivitas seksual seperti belaian sentuhan yang sifatnya erotik maupun tidak pembicaraan mesra foreplay tanpa penetrasi dan sebagainya
2862292 kasihan para guru yayasan di honorer lokal itu kenapa tidak dibayar sampai sekarang bukankah tunjangan tenaga guru yayasan dan honor lokal sebesar rp32 miliar sudah dianggarkan di apbd kukar 2008 jadi tak ada alasan untuk tidak direaliasikan
2862293 beberapa kali kami di komisi iv melakukan pertemuan dengan disdik dan perwakilan guru kami selalu meminta agar disdik segera merealisasikan tunjangan pendapatan guru yayasan dan guru honor lokal
2862294 dinas pendidikan dan bagian hukum pemkab kukar terus berupaya memproses bagaimana supaya tunjangan guru guru ini bisa cair
2862295 memakaikan baju khusus pada tahanan juga dilakukan kepolisian itu biasa soal ham bagaimana bisa justru orang orang yang menjarah uang negara dan uang rakyat itu yang melakukan pelanggaran ham
2862296 kalau pakai jaket baju dalamnya masih beda kelihatannya tidak seragam
2862297 masih dibahas apakah baju itu untuk para tahanan kpk alias habis pakai atau bisa dipakai berulang kali jika statusnya bukan lagi tahanan kpk dan tinggal di lapas
2862298 tidak ada yang dilanggar kecuali kpk menempelkan predikat koruptor dalam tulisan kepada orang yang kasusnya belum berkekuatan hukum tetap in kracht
2862299 di beberapa negara itu sudah diterapkan seperti korea selatan dan hongkong terdakwa memakai seragam tidak memakai jas dan dasi atau memakai baju warna warni dan menyasak rambutnya
2862300 dalam perjanjian pkp2b ada poin yang tidak bisa melawan poin kesepakatan itu sebelumnya ditandatangani pemerintah pusat dengan kpc kita menilai tuntutan yang kita lakukan peluangnya sangat tipis karena itu kita menyarankan pemprov berdamai dengan kpc
2862301 kita menyarankan kepada pemprov untuk menerima tawaran damai dari kpc karena kita tahu pemerintah tidak memiliki pos anggaran untuk membiayai persidangan
2862302 benahi dulu aturannya kalau itu masih belum beres apa pun yang akan kita lakukan tidak akan berpengaruh apa apa
2862303 ini bukan penghentian kalau penghentian kan tidak ada kelanjutan apa apa nyatanya seteleh itu hubungan kpc dengan pemprov kan masih tetap terjalin ini saya sebut perdamaian
2862304 memang nilai itu sangat kecil daripada apa yang dibawa kpc keluar kaltim tapi nilai itu saya lihat sebagai satu hasil dari perjuangan kita bersama lalu dimana pak ngayoh merugikan negara ini kan aneh orang yang berjuang untuk kepentingan bangsa malah dianggap merugikan negara
2862305 kalau memang berani kita sama sama buktikan data yang ada jangan hanya berani mengobok obok kaltim dari jakarta sebagai masyarakat asli kaltim saya sangat tersinggung dengan tuduhan itu kalau memang berani membuktikan mari kita duduk satu meja sama sama beberkan data
2862306 kalau memang tidak terbukti tuduhannya kita akan kenakan denda adat kepada mereka ncw red
2862307 ini jelas terlalu kecil karena minoritas ada potensi dividen tidak dibagikan setiap tahun kalau jalur ini yang ditempuh maka harus mendapat angka yang lebih tinggi dan jaminan dapat dividen setiap tahun

2862331 time will tell if this is the beginning or just another event of no consequence
2862332 for those of us who despair about christianity and judaism having gone astray the notion that islam might be the spark that generates a new religious revival based on mutual respect and spiritual intensity could dramatically expand our understanding of the endless potential for god to surprise us
2862333 islam is a moderate culture and we are determined to prevent extremists from hijacking islam
2862334 for international organizations to work to issue a document stating respect of faiths and religious symbols and criminalizing those insulting them
2862335 the feeling of having gone on the trip but having missed the adventure
2862336 justice is at the core of the heart of god
2862337 if god is passionate about it god is responsible for it
2862338 it seemed to them when faced with such an impossible task all they could do was sit in the paralysis of despair but jesus simply said what do you have give it to me jesus didnt ask what they needed he asked that they have and would they give it to him
2862339 but weve experienced god jesus didnt come to make us safe jesus came to make us brave and to release us from the mediocrity of safe bets he called us to follow him beyond what we can control so that we can experience gods wisdom power and love
2862340 if we can get through an hour or a day without prayer we need to consider getting a new lifes work or pursing our old lifes work in needs ways
2862341 weve had enough of the christian adjusted scale of mediocrity
2862342 the first thing to disappear when spiritual discipline departs is laughter
2862343 we need to do away with the exaggerated anxieties of self seriousness theres something wrong if jesus yolk is light and ours is heavy the joy of the lord really is our strength

2862352 the hardest things that there isnt any connection between me and my child
2862353 when i told him to talk to me he doesnt have any response
2862354 i see him grow up in front of my eyes
2862355 in order to recognize his state and in order to learn me how to practice with him
2862356 who will take care of him if i die for example
2862357 maybe i go in the street out there and a bomb in my way and ill die especially in these situations so who would take care of him in his situation who would take care of him
2862358 with those bills and the tuition coming due and hanging over your head it does put you in a bit of a panic
2862359 only to find out the lenders theyve chosen are no longer going to be offering loans this fall

2862366 not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but only he who does the will of my father who is in heaven
2862367 when they saw the courage of peter and john and realized that they were unschooled ordinary men they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with jesus

2862377 the jobs market has been one of the few bright spots in the uk economy but cracks are appearing in the face of an increasingly uncertain economic outlook
2862378 even if we avoid the scale of jobs fallout suffered in previous downturns the era of the candidates recruitment market is already over with people in work becoming increasingly anxious that their p45 might soon be on its way

2862382 behold i will stand before thee there upon the rock in horeb and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink and moses did so in the sight of the elders of israel
2862383 take the rod and gather thou the assembly together thou and aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink
2862384 and he looked on the kenites and took up his parable and said strong is thy dwellingplace and thou puttest thy nest in a rock
2862385 he is the rock his work is perfect for all his ways are judgment a god of truth and without iniquity just and right is he
2862386 how should one chase a thousand and two put ten thousand to flight except their rock had sold them and the lord had shut them up for their rock is not as our rock even our enemies themselves being judges
2862387 and he shall say where are their gods their rock in whom they trusted
2862388 but jeshurun waxed fat and kicked thou art waxen fat thou art grown thick thou art covered with fatness then he forsook god which made him and lightly esteemed the rock of his salvation
2862389 of the rock that begat thee thou art unmindful and hast forgotten god that formed thee
2862390 and build an altar unto the lord thy god upon the top of this rock in the ordered place and take the second bullock and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down
2862391 so manoah took a kid with a meat offering and offered it upon a rock unto the lord and the angel did wonderously and manoah and his wife looked on
2862392 there is none holy as the lord for there is none beside thee neither is there any rock like our god
2862393 the lord liveth and blessed be my rock and exalted be the god of the rock of my salvation
2862394 the god of israel said the rock of israel spake to me he that ruleth over men must be just ruling in the fear of god
2862395 they are wet with the showers of the mountains and embrace the rock for want of a shelter
2862396 doth the eagle mount up at thy command and make her nest on high she dwelleth and abideth on the rock upon the crag of the rock and the strong place
2862397 from the end of the earth will i cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than i
2862398 in god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god
2862399 he brought streams also out of the rock and caused waters to run down like rivers
2862400 behold he smote the rock that the waters gushed out and the streams overflowed can he give bread also can he provide flesh for his people
2862401 he shall cry unto me thou art my father my god and the rock of my salvation
2862402 but the lord is my defence and my god is the rock of my refuge
2862403 o come let us sing unto the lord let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation
2862404 he opened the rock and the waters gushed out they ran in the dry places like a river
2862405 enter into the rock and hide thee in the dust for fear of the lord and for the glory of his majesty
2862406 because thou hast forgotten the god of thy salvation and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants and shalt set it with strange slips
2862407 and they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them he clave the rock also and the waters gushed out
2862408 hearken to me ye that follow after righteousness ye that seek the lord look unto the rock whence ye are hewn and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged
2862409 o ye that dwell in moab leave the cities and dwell in the rock and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the holes mouth

2862437 according to the anthropologists there is natures law of struggle for existence and survival of the fittest
2862438 nationalism is an infantile disease it is the measles of mankind
2862439 christs faithful have the right indeed at times the duty in keeping with their knowledge competence and position to manifest to the sacred pastors their views on matters which concern the good of the church they have the right also to make their views known to others of christs faithful but in doing so they must always respect the integrity of faith and morals show due reverence to the pastors and take into account both the common good and the dignity of individuals
2862440 the catholic church is the only thing which saves a man from the degrading slavery of being a child of his age
2862441 pernah suatu saat agus noor datang ke rumah saya membawa sebuah majalah terkenal yang di dalamnya memuat cerpennya
2862442 matra matra hati saya jengkel betul ketika itu yang ada dalam pikiran saya adalah bagaimana supaya agus juga merasakan sakit hati saya itu untuk itu saya harus berjuang keras agar menulis yang lebih baik dari agus
2862443 tetapi itu hanya persaingan kreatif di kehidupan sebenarnya kami tetap berteman saya tak punya rokok minta agus dia tak punya kopi datang ke rumah saya dan kami ngopi dan saling berbagi cerita dan ide hal hal seperti ini perlu untuk menyalakan api kreatif yang tidak bagus kalau persaingan itu masuk ke hati dan membuat kedua orang teman saling bertolak belakang pandangan dan malah berseberangan secara pribadi
2862444 yang terjadi persaingan ketat antar teman itu membuahkan hasil semuanya jadi sekarang redaktur budaya media mana yang berani menolak karya raudal marhalim satmoko atau putut
2862445 tetapi sekali lagi secara pribadi dengan faruk saya tetap akrab sebagai teman
2862446 tahun 1990 an setiap hari kompas menerima 80 lebih naskah setiap harinya atau lebih 500 cerpen setiap pekannya dan yang dimuat hanya satu

2862451 we dont feel there has been any decline in the numbers of people tried and sentenced to death
2862452 the majority of my clients are drug traffickers they deal in new non traditional drugs that are manufactured locally and easy to pass the number of dealers is growing and the cases of death penalties are growing too the lawyer told ips
2862453 after three years of our peoples war on drugs we have effectively contained drug sources and the widespread expansion of dangerous drug products and drug addicts
2862454 but although our fight against drugs has clearly turned in our favour it remains a difficult struggle
2862455 when the first case of ketamine trafficking was tried in year 2000 there was no legal standard set yet and the harshest sentence handed down was life in prison
2862456 the way the judge felt about chen zhishi not pleading or protesting during the trial influenced the sentence
2862457 death sentences are often handed down in one and half month the time normally spent on trying a robbery case
2862458 the attorney has no time or ability to mount a proper defence as lawyers we feel very awkward we are blamed by people for the deaths of the defendants and often pursued to return our fees

2862465 we are excited by both the quality of the data and the results which are a significant improvement on previous data sets
2862466 our geologists and geophysicists are currently working with nautilus personnel to interpret this new data and prioritize targets for our follow up sampling program which we are planning to launch in mid may next year
2862467 nautilus is fortunate to have a company of tecks size and
2862468 nautilus has already signed a contract with canyon offshore inc
2862469 we are pleased that canyons competitive quote for our 2008 exploration program has allowed us to use the same successful teams that discovered and sampled four new seafloor massive sulphide sms systems in four weeks of target testing in 2007
2862470 in 2008 the teams will be adding our improved electromagnetic and geophysical capability to their tool kits as well as 75 000 km2 of highly prospective ground in
2862471 the combination of this nautilus managed program with programs being managed by teck cominco ltd ensures nautilus shareholders will see aggressive exploration being undertaken in 2008 over most of our 154 000 km2 of granted exploration titles this program will have the potential to increase our resource inventory and deepen our project pipeline as we aim to deliver our mining equipment and commence production in 2010 subject to timely permitting

2862506 jadi seharusnya panitia angket bbm dpr ri itu fokus dulu secara teknis memanggil direksi pertamina dan menteri pertambangan energi dan sumberdaya mineral esdm ed yang sekarang dan juga periode sebelumnya mulai dari purnomo yusgiantoro kuntoro sby subroto dan lain lain untuk dimintai penjelasan seputar kebijakan pengelolaan energi minyak itu

2862515 leave your country your people and your fathers household and go to the land i will show you
2862516 if you ask god for something and you arent ready god says grow if you ask god for something and the times not right he says slow if you ask god for the wrong reason he says no if you ask god and the time is right and you are where you need to be god says go
2862517 how do i know what god wants me to do
2862518 faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen
2862519 youre the shaman you know youre the storyteller youre the magician the idea is whatever the ticket price were supposed to be there to deliver something that cant be paid for thats our job
2862520 you have got to be wild guess worth somewhere north of 100 million dollars why are you still touring you dont have to do this
2862521 got any suggestions i mean am i going to garden why would you stop i mean you play the music and you know grown men cry and women dance thats why you do it
2862522 but you have to be one of those or else why would you be up in front of thousands of people you know shaking your butt but at the same time when it comes down to it its the way it makes you feel i do it because of the way it makes me feel when i do it it gives me meaning it gives me purpose
2862523 some of the pieces in the new record are gonna be considered controversial give me a sense of what you think has to be said why are you still writing
2862524 its how i find out who you are and who i am and then who we are im interested in that im interested in what it means to be an american
2862525 im interested in what it means to live in america im interested in the kind of country that we live in and leave our kids im interested in trying to define what that country is i got the chutzpa or whatever you want to say to believe that if i write a really good about it its going to make a difference its going to matter to somebody
2862526 its funny you said that because i was watching something on tv
2862527 i figure if we do a few more tours i might actually learn it
2862528 so you know i mean we live in hope right
2862529 how was the news broken did bruce tell the band himself tell me about it
2862530 i think bruce picked up the phone and called everybody and i think everybody was shocked and im hurt and just felt really abandoned
2862531 i soft soaped it somehow or i tried you know and you know everybody had different feelings i mean people were mad or angry and suddenly theyre okay i wasnt going to be any good to them at that moment you know and i think what happens is sometimes you got to break your own narrative
2862532 and theres a time when that narrative has to be broken because youve run out of freedom in it youve run out of places to go
2862533 we made fewer screw ups than i thought we might the main thing you learn is not so much the band because the band will just play better from tonight on out you know but you learn a lot about the set you know youre trying to work your new things in youre trying to get in what youre trying to say youre trying to get people just to rock you know to go crazy and have fun its ultimately sort of supposed to be a bit of an ecstatic experience
2862534 and we got there a few times its pretty good
2862535 and so youre trying to figure out okay now how do you take it up to a certain height
2862536 oh thats nothing im still a chiseled hunk of muscle so i guess ill keep going for a while
2862537 i was probably one of the smartest kids in my class at the time except you wouldve never known it
2862538 you wouldve never known it because where my intelligence lay was not wasnt able to be tapped within that particular system and i didnt know how to do it myself until music came along and opened me up not just to the world of music but to the world period you know to the events of the day to the connection between culture and society and those were things that riveted me engaged me in life
2862539 gave me a sense of purpose what i wanted to do who i wanted to be the way that i wanted to do it what i thought i could accomplish through singing songs
2862540 its not just the singing its the writing isnt it for you
2862541 of course every good writer or filmmaker has something eating at them right that they cant quite get off their back and so your job is to make your audience care about your obsessions
2862542 it was a tough struggling household people struggled emotionally people struggled financially to get through the day
2862543 small town small town world which i continue to return to its like when i went to write though i put my fathers clothes on you know the immersement in that world through my parents and my own experience as a child and the need to tell a story that maybe was partially his or maybe a lot his i just felt drawn to do it
2862544 your dad wasnt all that proud of you as a young man
2862545 who will be the last to die for a mistake
2862546 i guess i would say that what i do is i try to chart the distance between american ideals and american reality thats how my music is laid out its like weve reached a point where it seems that were so intent on protecting ourselves that were willing to destroy the best parts of ourselves to do so
2862547 well i think that weve seen things happen over the past six years that i dont think anybody ever thought theyd ever see in the united states when people think of the american identity they dont think of torture they dont think of illegal wiretapping they dont think of voter suppression they dont think of no habeas corpus no right to a lawyer you know those are things that are anti american
2862548 you know i think this record is going to be seen as anti war
2862549 well thats just the language of the day you know the modus operandi for anybody who doesnt like somebody you know criticizing where weve been or where were goin
2862550 its unpatriotic at any given moment to sit back and let things pass that are damaging to some place that you love so dearly and that has given me so much and that i believe in i still feel and see us as a beacon of hope and possibility
2862551 theres a part of the singer going way back in american history that is of course the canary in the coalmine when it gets dark youre supposed to be singing its dark right now
2862552 and so i went back to woody guthrie and dylan and the people who said say take pete seeger who wants to know doesnt want to know how this song sounds he wants to know whats it for
2862553 what needs to be said in this country at this moment in your opinion what needs to be said
2862554 i think we live in a time when what is true can be made to seem a lie
2862555 and what is lie can be made to seem true and i think that the successful manipulation of those things have characterized several of our past elections that level of hubris and arrogance has got us in the mess that were in right now and were in a mess but if we subvert the best things that were about in the name of protecting our freedoms if we remove them then who are we becoming you know who are we you know the american idea is a beautiful idea it needs to be preserved served protected and sung out sung out on a nightly basis thats what im going to try to do

2862557 in our earlier study areas of stress were largely located at the outer suburban mortgage belts where car dependency is high
2862558 in this study we have seen the number and geographical range of vulnerable households creep inwards as fuel costs and interest rates rise
2862559 worse the deficits in urban infrastructure and services meant the more vulnerable households had less ability to adapt to higher fuel costs by taking public transport
2862560 across australias cities public transport is bursting at the seams during peak hour which gives clear evidence people will use public transport when it becomes just too costly not to
2862561 public transport use in sydney had steadily declined between 2000 and 2005 but the sharp rise in fuel costs forced commuters onto trains between 2005 and 2007 the number of train journeys jumped by 11 million
2862562 state governments nationwide are debating measures such as underground loops and light rail which is great but will only assist inner urban residents who are already the least vulnerable in society we need to get new trains and buses into our outer suburbs
2862563 since world war ii australias cities have been planned on the presumption that cars running on low priced fuel would be the dominant means of transportation
2862564 the australian senate estimates peak oil to occur by 2030 so a broad comprehensive plan to reconstruct australian suburbs to reduce petrol reliance must begin now

2862606 what can i say after investing just 200 into the forex market your auto pilot software netted me a clear profit of 489 75 in the first 72 hours i couldnt believe how user friendly it was within a month of using the system i only had to work part time allowing me to spend more time with my daughter lauren thanks marcus youre a real life saver
2862607 im an experienced trader in the forex market and have tried practically every system out there do any of them perform as well as the forex auto pilot system not by a long shot ive been in the industry for 23 years but the step by step success blue prints still taught me a thing or two i would recommend this product to anybody who is serious about earning a substantial income online
2862608 this thing needs to be kept on a leash the automated forex robots generated me profits overnight while i was asleep in bed not only that but the telephone support team answered each and every one of my questions while talking me through the entire setup process top product and top support thanks a bunch
2862609 even though i had absolutely no previous business or trading experience my profits have gone through the roof i strongly encourage anyone whos ever wanted to work from home to purchase this system the best part is that if youre not 100 completely satisfied with how it performs just get a refund theres absolutely nothing to lose

2862629 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2862630 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

2862633 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2862634 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2862657 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2862658 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2862659 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2862660 after conducting nitrogen rate trials in 06 and 07 we found the optimum nitrogen fertilizer rate is not strongly related to yield potential
2862661 or it could be said that higher yielding fields dont necessarily require higher nitrogen fertilizer rates
2862662 there was however an excellent relationship between relative yield in each field and the total nitrogen available to the crop which is the nitrogen the soil supplies plus the fertilizer in some cases more than half of the nitrogen supplied from the crop originated from the soil itself
2862663 this means if we know how much nitrogen the soil supplies we can subtract that amount from 275 and know how much additional nitrogen the plant actually needs
2862664 but predicting the amount of nitrogen supplied by the soil is difficult
2862665 optical sensors helps us recognize and quantify differences in the nitrogen content of plants in areas of a field
2862666 the nitrogen rate can be controlled manually or electronically to change application rates based on reflectance differences in a field
2862667 the down side of waiting to apply nitrogen after the v8 growth stage is that the corn plants are much taller which limits the technology to operations that can apply fertilizer through irrigation water or with high clearance applicators
2862668 these guys are amazing and this is the best team ive ever seen together just like john force and amatos teams in their time
2862669 its unbelievable not only have we won a lot of races but weve won some of the most difficult races with so much pressure
2862670 it sure looked like a major drama when we came through there
2862671 i was expecting yellow tape to be strung around it as a crime scene
2862672 i was trying to get around joe nemechek and the first thing that i saw was someones radiator
2862673 its not a good feeling to look down and see the end of pit wall coming up really fast i may be a little bit sore tomorrow
2862674 i had a run and i went underneath him and he just didnt give me a whole lot of room
2862675 maybe i shouldnt have been in there but were racing hard to try to get back into the top 35 in owner points
2862676 i know once we get in were not going to fall back out
2862677 when we get to michigan ill be a lot happier when we dont have to qualify on time
2862678 im not convinced its the cheating that matters to us so much as the power of judging and condemning strangers
2862679 hes made progress until he had the injury and now its a weird deal but i feel bad for him because he came in and worked really hard he was really going to push for a lot of playing time throughout this year
2862680 were obviously light at corner and were light at safety now with jerome carter for practice purposes or anything else
2862681 i obviously hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem
2862682 to believe that i achieved something they hadnt is very special
2862683 i have no regrets of anything i did out there
2862684 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2862685 i turned to my caddie on 16 and said god this is a lot of fun just to watch
2862686 i havent seen anything like this in my whole life

2862688 michael phelps could match greatest olympians ever monday live in prime time on nbc
2862689 kopf nach hinten einen nassen lappen in den nacken oder auf die stirn nee auf den nacken nicht den kopf nach hinten halten wie man ja oft das so denkt noch und ich glaube kaltes wasser mit kaltem wasser sp len das machen wir einen kalten lappen in den nacken kopf hinter und kalten lappen
2862690 bleiben sie ruhig setzen sie sich aufrecht hin und beugen sie den kopf nach vorne nicht nach hinten denn dann k nnte blut in den rachen laufen und fangen sie die bluttropfen mit einem taschentuch oder eventuell auch mit einer schale auf meist h rt nasenbluten von alleine wieder auf
2862691 wenn es nach einer halben stunde immer noch blutet sollten sie auf alle f lle einen arzt aufsuchen und lassen sie sich begleiten denn durch den blutverlust kann es zu kreislaufproblemen kommen und sie k nnten eventuell in ohnmacht fallen sie sollten auch dann zum arzt gehen wenn sie h ufiger nasenbluten haben ganz wichtig dass die ursache abgekl rt wird
2862692 das kann durch heizungsluft aber auch durch klimaanlagen entstehen aber auch durch heftiges schn uzen durch heuschnupfen und durch nasenbohren kann es zu nasenbluten kommen
2862693 i began looking at this race in december of 2007
2862694 wed hoped that was the beginning of an opening in the democratic space
2862695 but the political space is contracting again its clear the ruling party is determined to stay in power by any means
2862696 i dont think the political space is in any way being constrained
2862697 they dont claim they want a socialist state but the ideology is still there
2862698 the international community espouses ideas about good governance transparency and human rights but then they help a regime that flouts and violates those fundamental rights
2862699 i dont think the american people or the congress are going to accept decreasing food when there are photographs from ethiopia of starving children
2862700 they are going to ask why arent you helping these starving kids
2862701 das hat die reifen zu sehr abgek hlt und sie haben druck verloren

2862704 huge vivid orange balls of fire lighting up the morning sky
2862705 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2862706 my whole room lights up orange and i look out i live on the top floor so i had a perfect view and i just seen a huge ball of flame hundreds of metres in the sky big black pillars of smoke
2862707 we got freaked out my family woke up they thought it was a plane that went down
2862708 at present we do not know anything about how the explosions occurred and we are waiting to learn about its cause
2862709 it wasnt impacted by anything it was just in the course of him performing some operations that he went down
2862710 i dont know of any pre existing medical conditions that could have contributed to this tragic accident
2862711 im sure that all of our all of our guys are having a rough time with it
2862712 there was a very very large amount of fire when we arrived and the extent of the explosion if the blast was heard as far away as it was could have been much more serious
2862713 hopefully we wont find that there are a lot of people missing or injured but so far it looks like we got off very lucky
2862714 he was going to check on my parents but the explosions were getting louder and louder so the three of us just ran and ran and ran
2862715 everyone was just running down the street it was like something from a movie
2862716 we were concerned when this company moved at the end of the street
2862717 but we werent even advised that they were going to be there they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen
2862718 i want you i want you i want you baby be mine be mine

2862722 ik ben namelijk van mening dat je als kunstenaar ook iets te vertellen moet hebben natuurlijk zijn de beelden die je maakt het belangrijkst maar het denken over kunst is volgens mij ook erg belangrijk
2862723 een kunstenaar is iemand die ontdekt heeft dat hij net zo is als een ander en daarover niet uitgepraat raakt
2862724 dit en dat moet je erin zien de kunstenaar moet prikkelen vragen bij mensen oproepen welke vragen dat dan zijn maakt niet eens zo uit als de kijker er maar iets door beleeft
2862725 there was nothing to provoke this kind of reaction freddy was a good boy who has never done anything wrong
2862726 people want to know if they werent armed why such force
2862727 weve seen many cases where blacks and other minorities have been shot for no reason people are angry but more than that they want answers
2862728 you can see where the glass was smashed on the police car
2862729 great subscriber adds obviously clearly beat even the highest estimates on the street said national bank financial analyst greg macdonald
2862730 we were taken to the police holding facility and interrogated for several hours before we were deported

2862732 oh im not afraid i feel like i might puke
2862733 how the welfare state robs americans of money and spirit
2862734 the federal government shall not adopt any policies that transfer income resources from some americans to other americans
2862735 i cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the constitution which granted a right to congress of expending on objects of benevolence the money of their constituents
2862736 we also exult in our tribulations knowing that tribulation brings about perserverance and perserverance proven character and proven character hope and hope doesnt dissapoint
2862737 theres a very good turnout and there was no except for one report no untoward incidents involved and the turnout is very well
2862738 i dont have a full report yet on this mater but thats the only untoward incident that weve received but as ive said one life lost is too much still
2862739 so they said transfer but no escort but i was not very comfortable with that
2862740 the current situation on the ground is very fluid and very volatile
2862741 i didnt get to choose my ancestors and i look upon my brain and the rest of my body as a house i inhabit which was built long before i was born
2862742 rolling stone has asked me to discover what the american dream looks like in the mind of some young person of my acquaintance with the year 2000 hanging over his or her head by a thread like the sword of damocles
2862743 in order not to seem a spiritual quadriplegic to strangers trying to get a fix on me i sometimes say i am a unitarian universalist i breathe
2862744 i can be more prompt than the roman catholic church in announcing who is a saint since i do not require courtroom style proofs that so and so was on at least three occassions capable of magic with the help of god it is enough for me if a person like a good anthropologist easily finds all races and classes equally respectable and intersting and doesnt keep score with money
2862745 its a hallmark holiday just to take more of our money
2862746 if you love these people so much you shouldnt need a holiday to express it
2862747 if you are lonely when youre alone youre in bad company
2862748 jeff has already laughed a lot so hes ok i think his pride was bruised
2862749 he had this idea that he would bring this bike out onstage and show people how the rider would become one with the bike
2862750 he was going to just sit on it and drive it out he was just walking the dirt bike out onstage and somehow it got away from him it was not intended
2862751 why should you do anything for her look at all the shit she puts you through
2862752 it was like somebody shot me in the back of the leg
2862753 its kind of a hot pain like somebody was stabbing in me there with a knife
2862754 im not sure if it was the last step before i hit the bag or the one after
2862755 it was kind of between there it all happened real fast
2862756 i dont know if well see willie again the rest of this year
2862757 my goal is to be ready before the end of year but im not going to be stupid about it
2862758 i understand that my legs are my game i need to make sure its healthy if and when i go back out there
2862759 this one i could kind of hear and feel a pop
2862760 this game has a way of humbling you one way or another the thing with an injury is that its out of your control but i was getting a chance to play a little bit and it was looking like i would have played a lot down the stretch so its frustrating
2862761 numbers wise you look at the depth chart and you kind of say theres no way im making this team
2862762 and i tried to talk to him about that early on telling him dont look at the numbers just go out there and play your game and let what happens happen
2862763 hes had a phenomenal camp hes really working the slot well hes got great speed on the outside and hes a tough guy
2862764 he gets it but hes still young the challenge will be when hes playing earlier in the game against the other teams top people then youll see
2862765 so until he gets on their best nickel defensive back and best corners and has to go against really the top people in the league then well see
2862766 i feel like im working hard and that im competing for a spot
2862767 i dont really look for the recognition as much as long as the people upstairs are taking a look at the film and theyre satisfied with what im doing then im pretty secure out here
2862768 a lot of guys come here and struggle with this offense
2862769 it just gives a player like me a lot of confidence knowing i can come in here and learn a complex offense and get it down in a couple weeks

2862772 la crescita di produzione e occupazione rallentata considerevolmente e i rischi di frenata sono aumentati
2862773 c un clima di maggior preoccupazione rispetto a quanto registrato ad ottobre e in altre riunioni internazionali successive la mia impressione che la fase in cui ci troviamo da molti mesi possa peggiorare e che la crisi non sia terminata

2862775 its time for a change we have to bring up the big issues
2862776 ive always been interested in how the union movement relates to the community it seems like an evolution of the union movement
2862777 to help facilitate the long term growth of the labor program
2862778 people are hurting enough right now that the time is right for a once in a generation change
2862779 valuing corporations and capitalism over families and democracy we need to value families again in politics
2862780 the fundamental truth at the heart of this country and the heart of the labor movement is that we have mutual obligations in this country we rise and fall together
2862781 change doesnt happen from the top down it happens from the bottom up people trust their union and local union leaders because they work alongside you they elect you it means more than any other phone call more than any other piece of political mail
2862782 as always when i am able to hear barack obama speak to an audience i am energized by his move to action as much as his words of hope when i am personally able to be a participant as i was last thursday i am encouraged by his non stop focus on organizing what a movement when a leader can say he cannot do it alone and is listening to what working people are saying however what i find the most refreshing when i hear him speak is his focus on what issues are important to the citizens of america rather than wasting time bashing his opponent i commend him on taking the time to speak to labor and keep us in the forefront
2862783 northeast ohio has been incredibly hard hit by the bush administration
2862784 the education of the membership is the most important thing
2862785 and were constantly sending out flyers and letters and emails
2862786 i solidly stand in support of barack obama he represents the opportunity to have some real change in this country
2862787 there is no choice as far as im concerned all you have to do is look at this economy and see how disastrous its been
2862788 were very focused on involving our members through one on one communication at the worksite
2862789 im really very committed to building unions from the ground up
2862790 its about really giving workers their own voice and an opportunity to have a say in their workplace and build for the future
2862791 itll be great to have an organizer in the white house someone that talks about we instead of i all the time barack obama is someone whos really committed to helping make the kind of changes in america that we need to make and has an organizer mindset which is its really about us helping ourselves
2862792 were here as community members who support the community private companies are usually from out of district or they dont have the community first in mind they have their profit first in mind
2862793 they need to make their profit somewhere else not on the backs of this community
2862794 big business has been sucking profits out of our community for too long any bus that drives up to our home should be a public school employee and a union driver
2862795 its important to get the message out that these things start at the top with policies that encourage privatization and they filter down to the working class thats why we have to make sure were working on member to member communications like worksite flyers to give folks the information they need
2862796 were hoping this privatization effort doesnt work at all because it could really spread
2862797 its the weekend you should chill relax and hang out
2862798 were hoping were praying and we will take back the white house so we can have a president there whos labor friendly who can solve these problems and help the middle class
2862799 we believe its very important that we start at the local level
2862800 he did not come with a silver spoon in his mouth hes a christian hes a patriot he understands what the middle class is all about

2862823 when i first wanted to run for office he was one of the first people i met he happened to live in the ward i represent and he took me under his wing and told me told me all the great stories of glens falls and its past
2862824 there are so many things that he has his signature on so many people will remember roy akins and the man he was

2862830 then we would smile and laugh quietly at each other this is obviously a sour grapes

2862867 the offensive line did an amazing job of blocking and letting me step my throws
2862868 the protection was pretty good i think we got run around maybe one time early and after that we really solidified on the edges
2862869 i know i need to work on tweaking my technique the game experience is the best thing for that
2862870 we moved the ball and i thought we had good communication they had a pretty basic front i thought this was a good start for us
2862871 the offense decided not to come to practice today were going to get this right
2862872 hes done a heck of a job i dont know if ive ever seen a guy get into playing shape as quickly as he has from where he was coming from
2862873 he worked hard he took a ton of reps he had a full body cramp on the steps right over here one day that was part of his process and he had a good game the other night
2862874 my face is so scary that when people see it they fall over and i take all the candy in the house now i am going to scare you and take all the candy in your house

2862887 make budget negotiation transcripts public impose limits on campaign contributions of 2 500 for individuals and 10 000 per candidate for political action committees require lobbyists to disclose all expenditures put a nonpartisan body in charge of redistricting and increase funding for the state ethics commission to ensure they have the resources to investigate complaints
2862888 i cant speak to the culture of the legislature the appearance is that theres too many people that think theyre above the law i think its time we have new blood and new energy
2862889 im not sure what would be accomplished in a special legislative reform session that couldnt have been accomplished over the last term where bills were sitting in piccolas state government committee
2862890 i think he probably has a tough sell as to why he should remain in the leadership post it will be dependent upon his caucus and what his caucus decides
2862891 i dont know anything right now thats currently being drafted over the past several years 51 reform bills have been stalled on issues ranging from posting government salaries online to preventing state agencies from hiring lobbyists with tax dollars i support those bills
2862892 it is a cultural matter i think its very widespread
2862893 yes its a fortunate moment to have it because it should have been done years ago
2862894 im not prepared to answer that im not familiar with the specifics of individuals ive been trying more or less to run my campaign focusing on reform overall and not trying to be bogged down by the politics that is happening right now
2862895 a complete a review of leadership accountability open all legislative accounts for complete disclosure expand the freedom of information act create a stronger barrier between government and campaign work for state employees who are also on campaign payrolls mandate that the legislature work 12 months a year and rotate leadership positions and committee chairs every few years
2862896 from the time i graduated from the university of pennsylvania ive said its not a culture its individuals who are trying to get their own power and putting their own preferences above everyone elses
2862897 no i would have very serious caucus meetings during this downtime reorganize every caucus and have the caucuses become the models for how to do things theyve got to sit down and figure out how to operate the capitol special sessions are a press stunt
2862898 two years ago i said he is not my choice for house leader i certainly would not vote for him its in the best interest for him to step aside and handle the allegations similar to what sen vincent fumo just did
2862899 consider reducing the size of the legislature consider implementing ideas from the speakers commission on legislative reform possibly limit the amount of time someone can serve as committee chair and make sure bills that need to get out of committee get out of committee and let legislators debate them
2862900 i hate to cast a wide brush because i dont think its the entire culture its the few that didnt abide by the rules
2862901 yes there are changes that are needed and i think we have to take that first step
2862902 remove influence of special interest lobbyists eliminate the perk lifestyle reduce legislators monthly allowance eliminate bonuses provide full transparency of all caucus accounts
2862903 yes but a lot of things are hearsay so we dont know until people are really brought to justice
2862904 yes also there are a number of things that could be addressed just among the members themselves for instance the people need to be present when theyre voting i think there are a lot of rules that are in place but no ones really policed them
2862905 i would wait until i had all the facts nothing against your paper but i dont count the paper all the time as my resource for all the facts
2862906 i would support stepped up enforcement of existing measures as a candidate i dont know inside the legislature what the rules are in terms of financial reporting requirements but we should really audit those records and take a look at where the money is coming from and to watch for inconsistencies or patterns that would indicate some form of abuse
2862907 its isolated to a few powerful individuals i mean that in the broadest sense across the federal state and local governments
2862908 i dont know the specifics enough to really say yes or no i support anything that is going to improve the ethics of our legislature but i think its a matter of enforcing the current laws that are related to campaign finance
2862909 if a court found that there were crimes committed and he was one of the people that was looking the other way then yes under those circumstances but until its all shown and proven i dont have a statement one way or the other
2862910 as a religious man first im able to tell these people that once religion takes hold in a society it cant be stopped

2862919 let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilize this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
2862920 also relates his own personal experiences having lived in pakistan in an apparent attempt to build a stronger connection with the pakistani people

2862950 the ice is crescent shaped and when you tilt the glass it all rushes to the mouth and hits you in the face and spills your drink

2863093 the humanitarian situation is horrifying we have no cameras and cannot document what we can see but the morgues are busy receiving streams of dead bodies
2863094 we have fulfilled our side of the initiative the russians have not but on the contrary have increased their military presence

2863106 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
2863107 the anger and toxic obsessions overwhelmed even the most reserved beltway wise men
2863108 h er advisers couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution s he never behaved like a chief executive and her own staff proved to be her achilles heel
2863109 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from any specific decision she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make
2863110 i dont mean to be an asshole but changes to important statements and other critical campaign communications simply have to go through howard
2863111 howard is the person who is ultimately responsibility for making sure that we deliver our messages the right way and i hope everyone will support and respect him in that role

2863117 the internal discord over whether to attack obama led some of her own staff to spin reporters to try to downplay the significance of her criticisms the result for clinton was the worst of both worlds the conflicting message exacerbated her reputation for negativity without affording her whatever benefits a sustained attack might have yielded

2863122 he claimed in his book that he should have got his chance in our first xi sooner than he did and that when he got a go he did fantastically well but his scores were more mediocre than fantastic i always say to guys prove me wrong pick yourself
2863123 he improved after he left school he got stronger and ended up playing for natal schools since then he has grown incredibly as a batsman he was very aggressive when i knew him but not a match winner
2863124 he was young for his year which im sure affected his development but always had a word for somebody id call it confidence rather than arrogance
2863125 i get great delight when he scores a hundred because i know why he left south africa which is to be measured for what hes worth and theres a lot of sportsmen disappearing in south africa because they cant be
2863126 kevin has gone overseas determined to prove the system here is wrong i take my hat off to him for that
2863127 he was 18 and wouldnt have been in our set up if he hadnt been talented
2863128 what stood out in his innings against england of 61 not out for natal in 1999 was how cleanly he hit the ball shaun pollock said hed never seen a guy hit the ball so cleanly at that age
2863129 at the end of the season he was offered a one year contract for not a substantial amount and had the chance to go to england i was not surprised he went he had a british passport and it was an option
2863130 as long as he could put to rest in his own mind that if he never played for south africa he could live with that then going to england was an opportunity to have a good career
2863131 i was led to believe he was a batter but kevin desperately wanted to bowl
2863132 he would ring me on a friday asking to bowl more overs but we had two spinners and his off spin was inconsistent there was a certain arrogance though that is not a bad thing
2863133 he did very well with the bat it was unfortunate that he left early natal was touring western australia because he missed us clinching the title that season was the pinnacle for us kevin made a lot of friends though he had difficulties with the club over money
2863134 i wouldnt want to take the credit but maybe that season was when he began to think of himself chiefly as a batsman
2863135 the conditions were bowler friendly and carl greenidge bowled really well and quickly all their batsmen struggled all except one carl dropped slightly short and pietersen hooked it miles over square leg it flew out of the ground over some trees and knocked the tiles off the roof of a house it made us all sit up
2863136 matthew hayden hadnt arrived so i was leading the side
2863137 we played again in a one dayer at the end of the season it was my last match at northampton as i was retiring and we had a party after the game and kevin came along i know hes not everyones cup of tea but he seemed a nice guy to me i admire his self belief and work ethic
2863138 he had an unusual style unique really for a tall guy he got very low to drive and he hit the ball as hard as anyone
2863139 rod marsh was head of the academy and i spoke to him regularly while the england a team were in india the team did not do well but pietersen had a very good tour rod spoke a lot about him
2863140 shortly after he qualified we picked him for a one day series in zimbabwe and duncan fletcher the england coach was so impressed he wanted to find a way to get him on the south africa tour
2863141 this happened when andrew flintoff returned home injured from the one dayers then it was like a one man show pietersen scoring hundreds on his own batting in an extraordinarily controlled way
2863142 kevin didnt get off to a great start in zimbabwe
2863143 he has been quoted as saying that he wants to improve every day and he means it
2863144 instead of tightening the neck there is a resuspending of the muscles in the face
2863145 its not as much a pulling back of the skin as it is a muscle correction in the cheek i go under the fat pad and re support it to a place where it was earlier in time to recreate a younger looking cheek i go under the muscles along the jawline and neck and resupport them back to a more youthful position

2863200 criminy dont you realize its 3 in the morning im not supposed to be up for another hour what do you want
2863201 you need to work on your phone etiquette dude i just wanted to be the first to congratulate you i was up late sipping scotch and working my crystal ball when i cracked into the bureau of economic analysis i just thought you might be interested in the gdp numbers theyre releasing later this morning
2863202 i could wait actually i cant imagine anything but a slight gain from first to second quarter whats so important that you have to call me in the middle of the night
2863203 ignore the headline number data boy im talking about the fourth quarter revision looks to me like you nailed it on the recession call
2863204 heres the deal second quarter growth is coming in at 1 9 percent a little shy of expectations but nearly twice the pace of the first quarter not terrible all things considered but they revised fourth quarter gdp down to negative 0 2 percent
2863205 hmmm unless im grievously mistaken thats the first negative number since the 2001 recession
2863206 you know its just plain sad when pundits forget what they wrote the second they write it im quoting your april 8 column now my best guess and economics is as much guess as science is the nation entered recession in december thats the fourth quarter my friend and now youve got an actual negative number to back up your call
2863207 thats nice i reckon but dont you think its a little unseemly celebrating economic shrinkage
2863208 toughen up boy theres no whining in swamiville you call em like you see em and gloat when youre right actually human suffering be damned youre officially a swami now act like it
2863209 now hold on there swamster it takes two quarters for the laymans definition of recession and the recession dating committee at the national bureau of economic research remains silent on the matter im not ready to gloat just yet
2863210 blah blah blah you so called economists get so caught up in clicking your abacuses that you never take the glory shot its a recession i tell ya doff your turban and tell the masses
2863211 frankly id rather make the call that the economy is turning around i cant wait until weve got a month in which nationwide existing home prices post a year over year increase then well make the turn
2863212 dont bother dollar chaser youre already on the record regarding the turnaround im quoting the same april 8 column now my best guess is that we wont be out of it until later this year late june at the very earliest and possibly as late as spring 2009 dont bother making a fresh call you probably should grab the 1 9 percent second quarter increase and claim you nailed the recovery too
2863213 youre hopeless youre never going to get out of the shadows of dismal science are you im taking your turban back go back to sleep
2863214 i cant swaminator you got me all stirred up now i reckon ill try to get some work done while the world is sleeping

2863254 thomas jefferson once said that all men are created equal there is a tendency for certain people to use this phrase out of context to satisfy all conditions the most ridiculous example i can think of is that the people who run public education promote the stupid and the idle along with the industrious because all men are created equal educators will gravely tell you the children left behind will suffer terrible feelings of inferiority we know all men are not created equal in the sense some people would have us believe some people are smarter than others some people have more opportunity because theyre born with it some men make more money than others some ladies make better cakes than others some people are born gifted beyond the normal scope of most men

2863283 the white house was more focussed on stripping hezbollah of its missiles because if there was to be a military option against irans nuclear facilities it had to get rid of the weapons that hezbollah could use in a potential retaliation at israel bush wanted both bush was going after iran as part of the axis of evil and its nuclear sites and he was interested in going after hezbollah as part of his interest in democratization with lebanon as one of the crown jewels of middle east democracy
2863284 has been agitating for some time to find a reason for a pre mptive blow against hezbollah
2863285 it was our intent to have hezbollah diminished and now we have someone else doing it
2863286 the only thing that the bombing has achieved so far is to unite the population against the israelis

2863356 job is to think about the national security interest as a whole the generals job is just to get their job done in iraq
2863357 pride indeed is the cardinal vice it swings open the door to most of the other theological vices and undermines the classical virtues of prudence courage and justice it thrives not on what one has but on what others do not have and even when one has diligently practiced the most admirable virtues there always lurks the danger that at some moment one will look in the mirror and say oh my what a wonderful person i am thus does the vice lunge from its hiding place
2863358 weve built the team to be an attacking team not a defensive one and the players are doing a fantastic job

2863396 from a value and accuracy perspective this card is spot on
2863397 i want to see him first before i make any judgment there
2863398 i know hes been working out but i just want to sit down and talk to him face to face and make sure everythings set up for him here so he can be successful
2863399 im sure theres some apprehension there but i know he wants to get back going get back up here with the guys
2863400 we took him out and are just easing him back in

2863407 does it exist is apple really making a cell phone
2863408 i have not the slightest intention here of defending karl marx against mr wicksteed i write partly to draw further attention to a controversy which seems to me of great interest because it is one on which socialists without at all ceasing to be socialists are sure to divide very soon and partly because i wish to have a word with mr wicksteed as to my own perplexities concerning final utility before some more competent hand deals him the coup de gr ce to which i have already alluded even were i economist enough to do that myself i am not mathematician enough to confute mr wicksteed by the jevonian method i somewhat mistrust mathematical symbols i remember at school a plausible boy who used to prove to me by algebra that one equals two he always began by saying let x equal a i saw no great harm in admitting that and the proof followed with rigorous exactness the effect was not to make me proceed habitually on the assumption that one equals two but to impress upon me that there was a screw loose somewhere in the algebraic art and a chance for me to set it right some day when i had time to look into the subject and i feel bound to make the perhaps puerile confession that when i read jevonss theory of political economy i no sooner glanced at the words let x signify the quantity of commodity than i thought of the plausible boy and prepared myself for a theory of value based on algebraic proof that two and two make five
2863409 it sure looked like a major drama when we came through there
2863410 i was expecting yellow tape to be strung around it as a crime scene
2863411 i was trying to get around joe nemechek and the first thing that i saw was someones radiator
2863412 its not a good feeling to look down and see the end of pit wall coming up really fast i may be a little bit sore tomorrow
2863413 i had a run and i went underneath him and he just didnt give me a whole lot of room
2863414 maybe i shouldnt have been in there but were racing hard to try to get back into the top 35 in owner points
2863415 i know once we get in were not going to fall back out
2863416 when we get to michigan ill be a lot happier when we dont have to qualify on time
2863417 i request a most benevolent outcome to or for thank you
2863418 im expecting great things today great things tomorrow and great things all this week thank you
2863419 theres a lot of room to grow thats the biggest thing
2863420 you want to play the best game you can but its a big learning experience its just like the first day of practice
2863421 angel tours and iguana currently operate vehicles in a mechanically unsafe operating condition which if operated would pose an imminent hazard to the public
2863422 we dont know the answer to that question thats why were here
2863423 we went from our base plan to our stretch plan and i was a hero to my ceo
2863424 the first official message ever in which he speaks english
2863425 calls for the people to support jihad in pakistan and lists a litany of grievances against the pakistani government and us involvement there
2863426 let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilize this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
2863427 also relates his own personal experiences having lived in pakistan in an apparent attempt to build a stronger connection with the pakistani people
2863428 wants to speaks directly to the pakistani people and chose english because he cannot speak urdu

2863431 our first trip to north carolina to start a house search did not start out so well
2863432 there certainly is a level of isi complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organisations such as the taliban
2863433 i cant say to what level of leadership that goes to but there are indications of complicity on the part of isi to the extent that they are facilitating these militant groups that come out of the tribal areas in pakistan
2863434 unfortunately we see a higher number of non pashtun non afghanistan fighters this year than this time last year
2863435 they are really from a variety of ethnic groupings some are from areas in pakistan some are from places like chechnya some are from europe and some are from other arab countries
2863436 but when you have a problem of porous borders and fighters and weapons and resources and command and control and logistics being brought in from outside of afghanistan that adds a complicating context to the insurgency
2863437 we come with militaries that have advantages in command and control in speed in lethality in logistics in intelligence in all those things
2863438 if nations provide forces with restrictions what it does is it decreases those advantages
2863439 how fast we can get there i dont know but it is important that the international community remain committed to afghanistan
2863440 dear self you really need to go to college and get that teaching degree you want so bad you love little kids and would make a great teacher please do not start to smoke because you will get hooked to bad and never be able to quit when someone gives you a complement do not just brush it off smile and say thank you very much
2863441 can you write 29 on one leg and plus 8 on the other leg
2863442 wow shes doing great darn i wanted to get a picture of her during transition
2863443 great not only will i come in last place but i will get ringworm too
2863444 its all right youll pass me in a little bit
2863445 its a good thing they write our ages on the back of our legs it makes it so much less embarrassing when youre in last place and a 78 year old man races past you
2863446 wed hoped that was the beginning of an opening in the democratic space
2863447 but the political space is contracting again its clear the ruling party is determined to stay in power by any means
2863448 i dont think the political space is in any way being constrained
2863449 they dont claim they want a socialist state but the ideology is still there
2863450 the international community espouses ideas about good governance transparency and human rights but then they help a regime that flouts and violates those fundamental rights
2863451 i dont think the american people or the congress are going to accept decreasing food when there are photographs from ethiopia of starving children
2863452 they are going to ask why arent you helping these starving kids
2863453 i want to see him first before i make any judgment there
2863454 i know hes been working out but i just want to sit down and talk to him face to face and make sure everythings set up for him here so he can be successful

2863457 he feels good and i want to make sure he keeps feeling good
2863458 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2863459 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2863460 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2863461 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2863462 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2863463 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2863464 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities in balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2863465 we have been found efficient effective and hardworking more than permanent teachers and our performance has been acknowledged by maqsoodul hassan a former director general of the federal directorate of education
2863466 we had been promised that our job will be regularised with the passage of time but it has not been done yet
2863467 the punjab government has regularised 7 000 english teachers who were contracted in 1995 and has given them other benefits
2863468 we have been in depression because the federal government has been ignoring us our salary has been fixed at rs 10 000 over the last three years while prices of commodities have multiplied in this time contract has been hanging over us like sword of damocles
2863469 i saw her eyes they were like the eyes in a horror film they were black there were no irises and her pupils were so dilated
2863470 leahs body started to go stiff and she began to twitch
2863471 then leah started to hallucinate she continued to go rigid and began to scream an indescribable scream because of the pains in her head
2863472 we wanted to provide an environment that heals not just the body but the mind and spirit
2863473 most patients arent restricted 24 hours a day to their rooms after surgery they have to walk and are told to walk
2863474 if they can walk out to a healing garden theyd much rather walk there than up the hall six or eight times
2863475 research has shown cut flowers can bring a smile in 10 seconds just think what we can do for families and patients who are going through some of the most traumatic times of their life
2863476 its good for the patient good for the family good for the environment and good for my neighborhood
2863477 miyamoto out of ideas for wii nintendo hard at work on wii follow up
2863478 wii 2 i dont want to have to buy another console for a good long while they way i see it the wii still has most of its lifetime and potential ahead of it
2863479 with those bills and the tuition coming due and hanging over your head it does put you in a bit of a panic
2863480 only to find out the lenders theyve chosen are no longer going to be offering loans this fall
2863481 some of these rates have no caps which means if interest rates rise you could be up to paying 15 to 18 percent on these loans
2863482 you know when he comes out so its very scary
2863483 kami mempunyai satu atau dua opsi yang sedang kami incar mudah mudahan kami berhasil merekrut salah satunya di pekan ini
2863484 tidak ada yang perlu dikatakan tentang berbatov kami mencari opsi lain
2863485 setiap hari selalu muncul nama pemain baru itulah seninya jurnalisme saya tidak dapat menjawabnya sebab saya tidak mempunyai jawaban yang tepat untuk itu
2863486 saat sekarang memang ada isu tentang ketajaman lini depan tim namun melihat begitu banyaknya peluang yang tercipta lawan portsmouth kami sepantasnya tidak terlalu khawatir lagipula sejumlah pemain bakal kembali fit mereka tentunya bakal kami cantumkan dalam skuad
2863487 need a car how about 10 000 month from home

2863489 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2863490 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2863491 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2863492 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2863493 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2863494 pure speculation the defendants provide no evidence such as sampling or other statistical data to support that assertion
2863495 t he threat of such obliteration is a text book example of irreparable harm

2863503 we have questioned their estimates for many years mapp being 20 years old this year the history of this epidemic has been that the government has not only often been behind the ball on estimates but where the epidemic was heading in the 90s we knew it was going into the black community
2863504 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the u s hiv epidemic and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease we as a nation have to come together to focus our efforts on expanding the prevention programs we know are effective
2863505 we still have bathhouses here in detroit that refuse to have hiv education in there
2863506 a year ago we were asked to leave menjos which is a very popular gay club for younger gay men in detroit and i know that backstreet the largest gay club in michigan is not doing any hiv education or prevention work
2863507 if i approach some of the main gay foundations in this country i am declined because they dont fund aids work groups like the hope fund detroit or arcus foundation kalamazoo or gill foundation colorado those are three and i believe all three of them do not fund hiv aids work in the lgbt community
2863508 i think the black gay community is coming around but they dont always have adequate resources i dont see the glbt community doing enough to support that community i mean we have discussions and panels and roundtables about it but we dont really do what is necessary a lot of times that means rolling up your sleeves and going into the community
2863509 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2863510 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient

2863516 all in all school supplies ill spend a hundred probably 150
2863517 with everything being so expensive you bet gas is atrocious and groceries are higher you just have to get school supplies even if we have to save in other areas you know were not eating out as much as we normally would not going to the lake as much
2863518 i have ads i have grocery lists i have coupons i have everything
2863519 since these big ads weve been running for back to school traffic has definitely increased
2863520 over the years its been around 300 400 somewhere around there every semester
2863521 i think its a pretty good idea if it would help save a lot of money

2863536 thats not my problem every morning at 6 00 am sharp i have a good long pee at 6 30 am sharp i have a great bowel movement the best thing that could happen to me would be if i could wake up before 7 00 am

2863588 the vice president praised president saakashvili for his governments restraint offers of ceasefire and disengagement of georgian forces from the zone of conflict in the south ossetian region of the country
2863589 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time said robert helman said on ctv
2863590 without diminishing the callous and brutal nature of this crime which was certainly committed partly for financial gain and with no regard to the sanctity of human life i believe that a determinate sentence is appropriate
2863591 my client states his instructions are that ben clark acted alone and that is what we maintained throughout the trial and unfortunately the jury did not accept that
2863592 these guys are amazing and this is the best team ive ever seen together just like john force and amatos teams in their time

2863603 leigos cat licos deixando a igreja ministros protestantes se juntando igreja o que est acontecendo
2863604 nos ltimos 20 anos enquanto alguns membros cat licos se v o um n mero crescente de ex ministros liderados pelo esp rito santo se convertem ao catolicismo tamb m um grande n mero de leigos protestantes est se juntando a n s
2863605 quase todos os ministros protestantes agora cat licos cresceram numa atmosfera anti cat lica foram muito bem educados nas cren as de suas religi es juntando se igreja cat lica significava perderem os seus trabalhos as suas regalias muitos deixaram comunidades de f vibrante para se juntarem a uma par quia que poderia n o ser muito viva espiritualmente agora perguntemo nos por que ent o esses ministros vieram para a nossa igreja porque eles sentiram insipi ncia na sua doutrina nos seus testemunhos percebemos que coisas pequenas que come aram a suscitar d vidas em seus cora es e nos seus questionamentos como n o obtinham resposta l procuravam na no catolicismo e assim adentravam nas ra zes do cristianismo s encontradas na igreja cat lica a igreja fundada por jesus cristo
2863606 esse processo de convers o n o era breve e f cil levava muito tempo anos de estudos profundos e compara es entre as doutrinas a nossa igreja n o ensina isso assim e a percebiam a verdade tamb m significava uma mudan a radical nas suas vidas

2863618 i thought it would be lovely to give a home and family life to one or two people who would otherwise be sitting around there
2863619 i started asking people if they wanted to move out of their care homes and live with me and ive had dozens of offers they are queuing up
2863620 its nice for me too because at my age its handy to have someone to live with now every book that sells will help towards making a home for someone

2863624 man it would be awesome to have a keen guide at the games to offer a tour of the bird nest and to offer an explanation behind the architecture as well as the water cube not that im criticizing im just curious the more i see it the cooler i think it is
2863625 everybody was expecting them to win including them and when they called out our names instead it was perfect when we watched the video takes later on we saw them and their producer rolling their eyes and glaring when we won
2863626 people were complaining about us everywhere in the papers and on the radio
2863627 it was very annoying actually because most of the people hadnt even seen our show but they had seen kath amp kim
2863628 we dont like them because were actually from the west and theyre these fancy rich old comedians making fun of lower class people
2863629 weve always been opposed to that sort of comedy and it really got us thinking about the type of show we wanted to make and thats what weve done in the second series its all about lower class people having cool fantasies and action adventures not just being bogans that people laugh at
2863630 she wanted to punish us for beating her favourite kath amp kim
2863631 thats why it took us so long to come back with a second series she never said as much to our face but it wasnt until she left and the new dude came that we were allowed to make another series
2863632 i totally reject any suggestion that i had a personal gripe with double the fist
2863633 although its been three years since i left the organisation for craig anderson to think important programming decisions at the abc are based on such trivial issues is pure fantasy
2863634 we were initially asked to make a sports sketch comedy show and thats really what the first season was with some special effects thrown in
2863635 the afi award meant that the abc recognised that action and special effects was our special skill and so they let us make the show we wanted to make from the start a comic book action hero show
2863636 its crazier and faster like those shows from the early 1990s in japan or korea where you think thats so crazy i really wish i knew what was going on its really cinematic and weve got more special effects than ever before theres really nothing else like it on tv other shows use special effects but no others just smash the audience with them constantly
2863637 you can get it to about 70 to 80 per cent finished in a certain amount of time but to then get that other 20 per cent is going to take you the same amount of time as the first bit we became the 80 per cent kings which was very frustrating for the graphics people
2863638 normally visual effects artists only get one tiny thing to work on
2863639 they design the jacket and the way the wind affects the jacket whereas in our show we say design the dragon thats going to wear that jacket and then have the dragon attack someone people were willing to take a pay cut just to get a chance to do a whole sequence like that
2863640 ian turpie bruce spence kate fitzpatrick hollie andrew ahn do and the umbilical brothers all have roles in this series and believe it or not they all approached us
2863641 the only real disappointment we had was that we couldnt get cate blanchett to play the voice of panda we tried really hard to get her but she just wouldnt do it
2863642 he was under absolutely no illusions that judges were the stars of the show
2863643 if you think about the dramas the stories the emotional hooks thats exactly what we do
2863644 every week youve got somebody being eliminated theres your jeopardy and the conflict must certainly come from the judging
2863645 the contest is not new though perhaps the idea of broadcasting it is
2863646 i think if you start playing silly buggers it really starts to whiff a little bit
2863647 tom burlinson genuinely looks at an eight year old who has been to three years of tap school and assesses their craft which i think plays well against me because i couldnt care less i just find small children who dance annoying if theyre under 10 and theyre dancing i want them dead
2863648 im not a nasty person i just try and encourage and be as honest as i can when youre a singer and you sing something stinky you know its stinky you dont need anybody to rub salt into those wounds if i criticise it will be constructive criticism
2863649 what are they going to do with that you say why dont you try to work on your pitch or why dont you try to work on not being so nervous when you come here on stage or why dont you wear some flatter shoes because youre not going to be so worried theres no need to shoot anybody down not in my heart anyway
2863650 they dont tell me what to say they wouldnt tell me
2863651 im nice but i dont suffer much you dont want to see me turn
2863652 just because i say something it doesnt necessarily mean its right its just my judgment
2863653 i was a dancer for 15 years and i hope that my criticism comes with a lot of empathy and compassion
2863654 this is a formula and when you got up this morning and decided to come in here and put yourself on you knew what it might involve
2863655 television like real life is full of meaningless politeness so its a relief to people when somebody says no that was rubbish i didnt like it
2863656 generally speaking in popular culture if you say that you like something youre not normally called upon to justify it i champion the view that you can bag something without having a reason
2863657 sometimes contestants get emotional and point out they are tired and rundown from the long hours and intense schedule
2863658 alan jones launched upon a two minute spittle flecked invective about what a filthy disgusting human being i was
2863659 im like the viewing public i dont give it any thought before i get there i give it very little while im watching it and i give it my two bobs worth its not that important its only television you know
2863660 ordinary people wear themselves out with useless toil and pointless argument

2863692 we have long wanted to be a part of such a growing sporting market place and this sponsorship has allowed us to take a giant step and weve put our faith in the newcastle jets
2863693 never before has such a corporate bookmaker taken such a step and we hope it opens every sports eyes in these tough economic times what can be achieved
2863694 we know the club is excited and committed to the centrebet partnership and we want to a build a financial and community relationship with our champion football club
2863695 i see youre making the best of a bad job thats right youve been well brought up you have youve learned to put a good face on things
2863696 because haoles arent allowed there and so they dont beat my a and yes that did happen or waiting in line for 3 hours to be seated and when i did get seated people moved muttering haole under their breath so like i said before there are good and bad in all races quote
2863697 considered synonymous with desire and sexual desire is seen as low literally unspeakable
2863698 later on there were sexy books valley of the dolls barbara cartland danielle steele
2863699 all these books even the trashy ones carried with them ideas races were equal women were equal to men and concepts of freedom struggle and adventure that were new to me
2863700 t he spark of will inside me grew even as i studied and practiced to submit it was fanned by the free spirited novels most of all i think it was the novels that saved me from submission i was young but the first tiny meek beginnings of my rebellion had already clicked into place
2863701 i always found it uncomfortable to be opposed to the west for me britain and america were the countries in my books where there was decency and individual choice
2863702 i knew that another kind of life was possible i had read about it t he kind of life i had always wanted with a real education a real job a real marriage i wanted to become a person an individual with a life of my own
2863703 it hurts my feelings when i was hoping we could figure out a new way to handle the situation together
2863704 i know were close and we can share everything but id really appreciate it if youd leave the room or leave me out when you do that its not very sexy and i dont want anything that makes you less sexy to me
2863705 nothing the sun rises on a day so horribly normal i feel as if everything has been an unfortunate fantasy today tomorrow and forever all mine all the same
2863706 ive been in rooms with bodies rotting there for a week and it never stunk that bad
2863707 theres just no way to describe it urine and feces dog cat and human excrement smeared on the walls mashed into the carpet everything dank and rotting
2863708 it sounded like you were walking on eggshells you couldnt take a step without crunching german cockroaches
2863709 they were in the lights in the furniture even inside the freezer the freezer
2863710 the pile of dirty diapers in that room must have been 4 feet high
2863711 the glass in the window had been broken and that child was just lying there surrounded by her own excrement and bugs
2863712 i put her over my shoulder and that diaper started leaking down my leg
2863713 but the only ones i found were covered in maggots and roaches
2863714 the mothers statement was im doing the best i can
2863715 if this child doesnt get to a hospital shes not going to make it
2863716 the child will be disabled for the rest of her life
2863717 there was no light in her eye no response or recognition we saw a little girl who didnt even respond to hugs or affection even a child with the most severe autism responds to those
2863718 in the first five years of life 85 percent of the brain is developed
2863719 those early relationships more than anything else help wire the brain and provide children with the experience to trust to develop language to communicate they need that system to relate to the world
2863720 its mind boggling that in the 21st century we can still have a child whos just left in a room like a gerbil
2863721 no food no one talking to her or reading her a story she cant even use her hands how could this child be so invisible
2863722 my hope was that she would be able to sleep through the night to be out of diapers and to feed herself
2863723 we were so distraught over her condition we agonized over what to do
2863724 her behavior was different than any child id ever seen
2863725 if you put food anywhere near her shed grab it
2863726 she had a lot of episodes of great agitation yelling flailing her arms rolling into a fetal position shed curl up in a closet just to be away from everyone she didnt know how to climb a slide or swing on a swing she didnt want to be touched
2863727 in my entire career with the child welfare system i dont ever remember a child like danielle
2863728 it makes you think about what does quality of life mean whats the best we can hope for her after all shes been through is it just being safe
2863729 that one is dangerous she cant be with other children
2863730 i guess she wanted to make sure the food was still there
2863731 okay lets put your shoes on do you need to go potty again
2863732 i know my son will never stand on his own will never be able to climb onto a horse you have no idea what your daughter might be able to do
2863733 id like her to at least be able to master a sound board so she can communicate her choices even if she never finds her voice
2863734 i think she understands most of what we say its just that she doesnt always know how to or want to react
2863735 i drive her around in my jeep and she honks the horn
2863736 you got your wormie you ready to go to sleep
2863737 thats okay too for me its all about getting the kisses and the hugs
2863738 left unattended for days with a retarded older brother never seen wearing anything but a diaper
2863739 the home is filthy there are clothes everywhere there are feces on the childs seat and the counter is covered with trash
2863740 is still wearing a diaper and drinking from a baby bottle on going situation worse since last august mom leaves grant and danielle at home for several days in a row while she goes to work and spends the night with a new paramour danielle is never seen outside the home
2863741 its not automatic that because the home is dirty wed remove the child
2863742 and what they found in 2002 was not like the scene they walked into in 2005
2863743 im concerned though that no effort was made to interview the child
2863744 if you have a 4 year old who is unable to speak that would raise a red flag to me
2863745 im not going to tell you this was okay i dont know how it could have happened
2863746 i tried to potty train her she wouldnt train i tried to get her into schools no one would take her
2863747 was that she didnt speak much she talked in a soft tone shed say lets go eat but no one could hear her except me
2863748 miss polly had a dolly she was sick sick sick
2863749 id been sick and it got away from me but i never knew a dirty house was against the law
2863750 he said she was starving i told him me and my sisters were all skinny till we were 13
2863751 she tended to blame her difficulties on circumstances while rationalizing her own actions
2863752 is more concerned with herself than most other adults and this could lead her to neglect paying adequate attention to people around her
2863753 they say i made her autistic but how do you make a kid autistic they say i didnt put clothes on her but she just tore them off
2863754 i thought man im feeling exactly the way he feels
2863755 thats a guy you love to coach because when you tell him something he takes it to heart he takes it personal
2863756 those are the guys who usually are the good players because theyve got the intangibles in life that some other guys dont have he certainly has those qualities
2863757 the desire to beat the other person off the ball
2863758 we all think hell be an all american by the end of the season
2863759 the sanctuarys full the overflow is full so well just see yall at the reception okaaay
2863760 no actually i dont think we are going to be doing that
2863761 i just asked your friends from virginia nicely to help and they just walked away
2863762 one interpretation of these studies is that men are unable to ward off temptation we do not subscribe to this instead we believe men simply interpret these interactions differently than women do
2863763 we think that if men believed an attractive available woman was a threat to their relationship they might try to protect that relationship
2863764 women have been socialized to be wary of the advances of attractive men
2863765 these findings show that even if a man is committed to his relationship he may still need to formulate strategies to protect his relationship by avoiding that available attractive woman the success rate of such strategies may not be 100 percent but it is likely to be significantly higher than if the man was not made aware of the specific consequences of his actions
2863766 if then contingencies and the differential effects of the availability of an attractive alternative on relationship maintenance for men and women
2863767 i can think of no justifiable reason why the former nccu leadership would have completely ignored and failed to abide by the appropriate approval process in creating this program
2863768 such action is contrary to all university policy to say the least it is very disappointing we are working closely with chancellor charlie nelms and his new leadership team to examine the various academic legal and financial questions associated with this georgia based program

2863794 this is an issue which has to be dealt with carefully because while trying to solve this issue we should not do anything which will give solace to one part and create problem in another part of the state we would like to evolve a formula which is acceptable to all the sides
2863795 the prime minister has also said that it should continue as in the past
2863796 we communicated that message beforehand to the russians through us secretary of state condoleezza rice
2863797 then i told the deputy director you go and pull him out there
2863798 it is true that an incident has taken place but not on thursday night as reported by her friend it may be before or on friday also we are not yet sure of the gang rape
2863799 there are several loose ends right now it will all be clear only after the girl comes out of her shock
2863800 there were quite a few complaints about the scarcity of clean up marshals and as a result their lack of visibility so we decided to extend more power to our volunteers currently we have around 2 000 volunteers three four per cent of them are senior or middle aged citizens the rest are college students
2863801 when more people are fined for spitting littering urinating in public places etc thats when awareness about cleanliness will grow
2863802 this move will help lift the image of our campaign as college students have good communication skills they also work out of passion and not for money
2863803 dhoni would have made a big difference to this side with his keeping and runs
2863804 if youve done something right no one will know that youve done anything at all
2863805 these are aggravated assaults were investigating two of them at this time and at this location
2863806 its living with the questions that doesnt mean you have the answers thats exactly what faith is
2863807 i dont know if i think somewhere in our hearts maybe i had a sense that we may be losing had already lost our daughter
2863808 but i really just had a deep concern in my heart that i wouldnt lose two children as a result of this because i knew what will was struggling with
2863809 what has kept us breathing kept us alive is that while we are grieving this process there is a hope that we have that were anchored to in the midst of what sometimes seems unbearable
2863810 ive said somewhat coldly i dont care whose lives are touched by this story and whose lives are changed or what good comes of it as the heart of a mom i want maria back thats what i want people to know i want maria back
2863811 but because of my faith i know that shes completely whole and completely ok and im going to see her again
2863812 and through that then when peoples lives are changed and touched then i can be ok with that but as a mom id like to have maria back
2863813 and i remember caleb was the first one to run and kind of just jump on me and hold me
2863814 and then shaoey was right there by him that meant a ton i didnt really want to be at the house i just wanted to be away and i was just freaking out
2863815 ive gotten a stronger faith through all this and more faith through all this
2863816 but then theres those days that just hit you and youre just like oh man this is just awful but you just gotta continue to choose to live and thats the faith that that continues to keep me going
2863817 youd rather endure that pain than see your brother and this case my for real brother endure that pain
2863818 sometimes you turn the corner and youve got a straightaway and its beautiful
2863819 and then you can turn a corner at the end of that straightaway and its thunderstorms and mountains and it can be hard even within the same day
2863820 i have to sing it because i have to continue
2863821 these chapters that are still being written with my two little girls shaohannah and stevey joy and emily whos getting ready to be married we need to keep living these moments these living years that we have i still need to be engaged in those and i need to be dancing with my cinderellas im going to dance with maria again im absolutely sure of that
2863822 i will do your bidding without delay i will refuse you nothing i will seek to love you as you have never been loved before

2863826 we are recommending the exemptions be eliminated for political parties and for small businesses and employee records
2863827 he was struck down with an ankle injury early in the game and played the whole game with injections so to kick that goal just before three quarter time was just exceptional
2863828 i just thought its been a pretty rough three weeks for him i just thought that playing on despite his injury is the effort required
2863829 sometimes its not about kicks marks and handballs its what you do for the team
2863830 the government has its centrepiece building wa a package of infrastructure projects with such long lead times that many wont come to fruition until its time to vote again in another four years when victoria park mla ben wyatt is premier
2863831 it really requires the premier to come out immediately and clarify the situation
2863832 is ben wyatt the next in line during the next term is mr carpenter going to serve out the full term
2863833 mr halden does not say things like this unless theres truth to them
2863834 without diminishing the callous and brutal nature of this crime which was certainly committed partly for financial gain and with no regard to the sanctity of human life i believe that a determinate sentence is appropriate
2863835 my client states his instructions are that ben clark acted alone and that is what we maintained throughout the trial and unfortunately the jury did not accept that
2863836 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
2863837 there is a name every day that is the nature of the business
2863838 i cant answer it because ive not got a direct answer
2863839 its possible we could sign someone this week we are trying weve got one or two options we are looking at and hopefully we can get something done before the start of the season
2863840 it has been pressing since the end of last season we like to operate with four strikers and we have not been able to do that
2863841 rio is now the best centre half in the world by far
2863842 that was an exemplary performance he did not give one foul away and intercepted every ball that came towards him
2863843 he broke out of defence in comfort so many times it was unbelievable he is a magnificent player
2863844 he is 30 now and because he has experience his potential is now being fulfilled in a big way
2863845 i was down and he stamped on me i thought he could have avoided me there was no need for it that was why i reacted and why i grabbed his leg
2863846 we came here with just 18 players and we know we are going to need a bigger squad because of the extra demands on the uefa cup which is new ground for us
2863847 it is going to take a lot for players to play saturday thursday sunday but we have to be competitive
2863848 kaboul should help hes a been a long term target of the manager hes only 22 and is coming to a good place to learn with sol campbell and sylvain distin
2863849 there are always sticking points in any dialogue but we are confident we will overcome
2863850 so the vast majority of older australians are on the pension and a very very significant number of these people have very small additional amounts of private income as well as the pension
2863851 most pensioners also have very low levels of assets in fact 30 per cent report having bank balances of less than 1 000
2863852 our argument is that the fixed costs people face in terms of rent and utilities makes that quite inequitable
2863853 prices are rising inflation is an issue mr rudd had the opportunity to address pensions in the budget and he chose not to do so
2863854 mr rudd has the money he has the massive surplus delivered to him by many years of sound economic management by john howard and peter costello and he chose to forget the pensioners
2863855 weve been standing up and fighting for pensioners and retirees in opposition as we did in government
2863856 the benefits and the bonuses to superannuation all the measures taken under the howard years were designed to deliver better benefits for pensioners and older australians
2863857 the evidence to date is that a significant moderation in demand is now occurring and it is looking more likely the demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow in the period ahead
2863858 while inflation is likely to remain high in the short term the board judged at its august meeting that demand was slowing to an extent that could be expected to bring about a significant reduction in inflation over time
2863859 on this basis the board decided that the existing monetary policy setting was appropriate for the time being
2863860 on the assumption that the subdued demand conditions are like to continue scope to move to a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing
2863861 the combination of falls in housing and equity prices means that household net wealth has declined in the first half of this year
2863862 minerals seeped into their tissues and hardened preserving their calcified remains
2863863 i wonder if the fact that the mosquito question was raised isnt an indication of the very urgent need for understanding such things as marshes and our dependence on nature todays adults have had to make a choice between ducks and dishwashers or if you prefer between conservation of natural resources necessary to human survival and gnp personal profit convenience most of us have been unaware that we were making a choice and unaware of the consequences by such means as sibley marsh our children will have more facts on which to base the far more difficult decisions that they will be required to make
2863864 lies thick and heavy on such a place yearly since the ice age it has awakened each spring to the clangor of cranes
2863865 whether or not one believes in god tends to be sidestepped its not quite in good taste t he church of england is so constituted that its members can really believe anything at all but of course almost none of them do
2863866 religion what religion am i were not any religion are we
2863867 yes sort of well no not just what you put
2863868 an elderly lady who mutters away to herself in a corner ignored most of the time
2863869 one name suggested was united church of christ as in the united states of america but that was felt to be perhaps a little too arrogant making too strong a claim
2863870 on every hand dull shapes of men sitting standing or stooping inspected us curiously out of the darkness reached out their hands toward us some appealing some beckoning some warning us away effigies they were statues over the graves but they looked human and natural in the murky shadows
2863871 the difference between the almost right word and the right word is really a large the difference between the lightning bug and the lightning
2863872 doesnt tend to concern itself with truth there simply isnt time for truth by the time all the singing and candle lighting and toadying and condemning and hiding from science is done truths given up and gone to the pub for a pint

2863879 the person be it gentleman or lady who has not pleasure in a good novel must be intolerably stupid i have read all mrs radcliffes works and most of them with great pleasure the mysteries of udolpho when i had once begun it i could not lay down again i remember finishing it in two days my hair standing on end the whole time
2863880 and i remember that you undertook to read it aloud to me and that when i was called away for only five minutes to answer a note instead of waiting for me you took the volume into the hermitage walk and i was obliged to stay till you had finished it

2863891 in naturally occurring material the index of refraction a measure of how light bends in a medium is positive
2863892 when you see a fish in the water the fish will appear to be in front of the position it really is or if you put a stick in the water the stick seems to bend away from you
2863893 instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water it would actually appear to be above the waters surface
2863894 what we have done is taken that material and made it much thicker
2863895 however cloaking may be something that this material could be used for in the future
2863896 youd have to wrap whatever you wanted to cloak in the material it would just send light around by sending light around the object that is to be cloaked you dont see it
2863897 this straightforward and elegant demonstration enhances our ability to mould and harness light at will
2863898 invisibility cloaks get a step closer to realisation with the demonstration of a new material that can bend visible light the wrong way for the first time in three dimensions

2864018 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2864019 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2864020 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2864021 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2864022 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2864023 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2864024 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2864025 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2864026 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2864027 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2864028 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2864029 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2864030 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2864031 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2864032 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2864033 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2864034 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2864035 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2864036 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2864037 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2864038 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2864039 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2864040 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2864041 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2864042 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2864043 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2864044 workers in some sense were paid a premium to live in new york
2864045 the idea now is that you become smart by hanging around other smart people which new york has in abundance thats why its been able to thrive
2864046 the dollar has been declining steadily in the past several years which has resulted in an overall decrease in the cost of living in 19 u s cities
2864047 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2864048 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2864049 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2864050 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2864051 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2864052 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2864053 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2864054 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2864055 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2864056 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2864057 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2864058 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2864059 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2864060 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2864061 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2864062 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2864063 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2864064 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2864065 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2864066 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2864067 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2864068 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2864069 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2864070 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2864071 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2864072 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2864073 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2864074 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2864075 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2864076 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2864077 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2864078 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2864079 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2864080 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2864081 who are open to doing something on the production side
2864082 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2864083 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2864084 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2864085 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2864086 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2864087 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2864088 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2864089 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2864090 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2864091 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2864092 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2864093 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2864094 had the chance to watch him last year and while his football skills were raw you could tell that this was going to be a player who would one day make a difference he had too much speed athletic ability and desire to play the game
2864095 no current model is superior to others in all respects
2864096 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2864097 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2864098 book but definitely much more than a mere introduction to mathematical theory and puzzles gardner arouses in the reader a passion for math and makes it really fun i quote keith devlin of stanford university and he had this to say on gardner
2864099 newton said that his many mathematical accomplishments came because he stood on the shoulders of giants for those of us who have tried to make mathematics accessible to a wider audience there is one giant who towers well above anyone else martin gardner
2864100 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2864101 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2864102 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2864103 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2864104 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2864105 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2864106 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2864107 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

2864117 we wanted to get the younger kids a lot of work and the only way we can get them work when you have five guys is to get them in there and get them as much work as we could we made the decision to go with two young guys and daniel today
2864118 they were today well see where they are tomorrow its still an evaluation stage
2864119 we held brown out today baker is not going to scrimmage in the preseason at all
2864120 the defense played much better last week they missed too many tackles and we didnt have missed tackles that makes a heck of a lot of difference
2864121 practice is like the ying and yang of things as the defense gets better the offense will get better and as long as everyone keeps getting better you have to work to make each other a better football team
2864122 they need it because they have exams the next two days thats why we are doing it it just comes at the right time because i think we are a little tired too a little hit out but thats good too

2864136 what really fuels the death penalty is the justifiable frustration and rage of people who see that the government is not coping with violent crime so what if the death penalty doesnt work at least it gives us the satisfaction of knowing that we got one or two of the sons of bitches
2864137 law enforcement officers usually overworked and often under tremendous public pressure to solve terrible crimes make mistakes fail to pursue all lines of investigation and on occasion overreach or take shortcuts in pursuing arrests prosecutors exercise vast and unchecked discretion in deciding which cases are to be prosecuted as capital cases the race of the victim and the defendant political considerations and other extraneous factors influence whether prosecutors seek the death penalty and whether juries or judges impose it
2864138 over 100 people condemned to death in the last 30 years have been exonerated and released after new evidence established their innocence or cast such doubt on their guilt that they could not be convicted
2864139 in the south the death penalty is most often imposed and carried out over half the victims of crime are people of color well over 60 percent of the prison population is made up of people of color and half of those sentenced to death are members of racial minorities yet people of color are seldom judges jurors prosecutors and lawyers in the courts for example there is not one african american or hispanic judge on the nine member texas court of criminal appeals even though 43 percent of the population of texas is nonwhite over 65 percent of homicide victims are people of color and nearly 70 percent of the prison population is black hispanic or nonwhite
2864140 this lottery of death both comes from and encourages an attitude toward human life that is not reverent but reckless he suggests that we trivialize murder unless we kill murderers by that logic we also trivialize rape unless we sodomize rapists
2864141 why the united states will join the rest of the world in abandoning capital punishment
2864142 we agree with our critics we never proved those 23 executed to be innocent we never claimed that we had
2864143 it is abundantly clear that the bible depicts murder as a capital crime for which death is considered the appropriate punishment and one is hard pressed to find a biblical proof text in either the hebrew testament or the new testament which unequivocally refutes this even jesus admonition let him without sin cast the first stone when he was asked the appropriate punishment for an adulteress john 8 7 the mosaic law prescribed death should be read in its proper context this passage is an entrapment story which sought to show jesus wisdom in besting his adversaries it is not an ethical pronouncement about capital punishment
2864144 t his view appears to be the consensus of all major groups in society including men women whites nonwhites
2864145 i already knew you had these powers you dont know your own worth yet and you dont know what youre capable of right now though you must concentrate only on your studies and pray regularly therell be a lot of time to teach you all this later
2864146 if something happens the way you wanted it to thats good if it doesnt its even better because then gods will is involved
2864147 do not think of knocking out another persons brains because he differs in opinion from you it would be as rational to knock yourself on the head because you differ from yourself ten years ago
2864148 keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions small people always do that but the really great make you feel that you too can become great
2864149 understand that the right to choose you own path is a sacred privilege use it dwell in possibility
2864150 selfishness is not living as one wishes to live it is asking others to live as one wishes to live
2864151 do what you feel in your heart to be right for youll be criticized anyway youll be damned if you do and damned if you dont

2864211 there are more important things in this new authority than who will be going around in a red coat and a hat its ridiculous we have already got three mayors in vale royal borough council northwich winsford and frodsham and a mayor of vale royal borough council it is crazy
2864212 everything is in place to ensure the continuance of chesters city status within the existing district boundary and retain its lord mayor support the continuation of the mayors for ellesmere port and neston and vale royal create a mayor of cheshire west and chester and retain the lord lieutenant and high sheriff

2864225 its very sad whats going on in the world and we share the concern of the ioc but i would refer to the politicians for that
2864226 but personally i do believe that the olympics is something that can make things happen and im sure the olympic values and olympic ideals will be considered
2864227 it is a national problem and the ioc is not supposed to comment on situations like this we just hope that its going to be solved fast and it seems they made progress today we hope for the best
2864228 this is a wonderful opportunity for two organizing committees who have the same common interests to celebrate a little bit the time we have together in beijing

2864233 the best lesson which we get from the tragedy of cerebella is that husain and his companions were rigid believers in god they illustrated that the numerical superiority does not count when it comes to the truth and the falsehood the victory of husain despite his minority marvels me
2864234 if husain had fought to quench his worldly desires then i do not understand why his sister wife and children accompanied him it stands to reason therefore that he sacrificed purely for islam
2864235 i congratulate muslims that from among them hussain a s a great human being was born who is reverted and honored totally by all communities
2864236 i learnd from hussein how to achieve victory while being oppressed
2864237 no battle in the modern and past history of mankind has earned more sympathy and admiration as well as provided more lessons than the martyrdom of husayn in the battle of karbala
2864238 a reminder of that blood stained field of karbala where the grandson of the apostle of god fell at length tortured by thirst and surround by the bodies of his murdered kinsmen has been at anytime since then sufficient to evoke even in the most lukewarm and the heedless the deepest emotion the most frantic grief and an exaltation of spirit before which pain danger and death shrink to unconsidered trifles
2864239 weeping and lamentation over the evils and persecutions suffered by the alid family and mourning for its martyrs these are things from which loyal supporters of the cause cannot cease more touching than the tears of the shiis has even become an arabic proverb

2864287 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2864288 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2864289 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2864290 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2864291 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2864292 going out first in the dressage was a disadvantage and after that my chances of winning an individual medal were slim so the best i could do was a strong effort for the team
2864293 i put a solid score on the board for the team and they can take a few risks now
2864294 my chances of an individual medal were slim so the best i could do was be a strong backup for the rest of the team
2864295 the most important thing was to have a clear round
2864296 if i had a silly run out there at the second last id have kicked myself
2864297 you just dont know how the horse is going to finish weve all been warned about the heat and the effect it has on them
2864298 the last thing i wanted to do was go out too fast early and have a very tired horse at the end
2864299 i went out as quick as i felt comfortable and the horse felt comfortable all the way around
2864300 on reflection i maybe could have gone out a little bit quicker but im happy

2864303 the real winner on the day will be armidale hospitals oncology unit
2864304 i predict that team torbay would need at least a three goal start against the strong graham parsons presidents xi
2864305 it is great to be involved in supporting the fundraiser as the oncology unit provide such fabulous support for cancer patients and their families
2864306 richard torbay does a great job umpiring the nsw parliament so i dont think he will have any problems in goals particularly if paul is playing striker
2864307 no es cierta la informaci n de que yo haya estado hablando diariamente con robinho
2864308 wagner ribeiro usa mi nombre para revalorizar las negociaciones o para asegurar un aumento en el contrato de robinho en caso de renovar por su actual club
2864309 debe tomar el rol de coloccini en el campo y en el vestuario
2864310 tiene condiciones para ocupar su vac o y conf o en que pueda hacerlo
2864311 estoy viendo a lopo muy recuperado haciendo cosas que la temporada pasada se cuidaba de hacer y esa es una gran noticia porque tengo la esperanza de que tome el relevo de coloccini en el campo y en el vestuario que ocupe el vac o que deja la marcha de colo

2864323 die deutsche einheit ist eines der sch nsten ereignisse der deutschen geschichte dieses jahr wird die wiedervereinigte bundesrepublik vollj hrig den vielen menschen die den deutschen einigungsprozess aktiv gestaltet haben und gestalten geb hrt unser dank von daher bitte ich sie nennen sie uns menschen und projekte die sich vor allem auch heute besonders verdient machen
2864324 ich habe diese partie als abwechslung zu einer normalen einheit gesehen wenn man nur vier leute im training hat ist das eben sehr schwierig
2864325 wie der junge in der abwehr gestanden und gek mpft hat das hat mich richtig gefreut ansonsten hat man nat rlich gesehen dass unser team ziemlich reduziert war
2864326 nat rlich habe ich mich sehr ber mein erstes spiel bei meinem klub gefreut trotz der hohen niederlage aber wir sind mitten in der vorbereitung und k nnen eben nicht auf einen kompletten kader zur ckgreifen noch haben wir gut drei wochen zeit bis die bundesliga wieder beginnt
2864327 das ergebnis liest sich nat rlich sch n f r uns aber der endstand war uns eigentlich egal wichtig ist dass wir als mannschaft fortschritte machen
2864328 man muss bedenken welche spieler heute bei den rhein neckar l wen gefehlt haben aber ich bin mit dem spiel meiner mannschaft zufrieden dieses testspiel hat seine aufgabe f r uns voll erf llt

2864336 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2864337 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2864338 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2864339 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2864340 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2864341 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2864342 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2864343 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2864344 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2864345 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2864346 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2864347 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2864348 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2864349 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2864350 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2864351 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2864352 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2864353 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2864354 dass die kleinen selbstst ndig arbeiten und wo sie es altersentsprechend k nnen auch eigene entscheidungen treffen und die konsequenzen daf r tragen und sie lernen hier auch ihre eigenen gef hle wahrzunehmen und auszudr cken
2864355 we believe our campaign will attract broad support from the local community and business
2864356 it is in all our interests for une to benefit from higher levels of government funding and better funding mechanisms protecting university independence and freedom of inquiry and making higher education more affordable and improving student services
2864357 following a period of neglect in terms of funding of the university sector by the previous government we hope to ensure that students from new england and surrounding regions continue to have access to a university that maintains its reputation for excellence in teaching and research

2864370 kopf nach hinten einen nassen lappen in den nacken oder auf die stirn nee auf den nacken nicht den kopf nach hinten halten wie man ja oft das so denkt noch und ich glaube kaltes wasser mit kaltem wasser sp len das machen wir einen kalten lappen in den nacken kopf hinter und kalten lappen
2864371 bleiben sie ruhig setzen sie sich aufrecht hin und beugen sie den kopf nach vorne nicht nach hinten denn dann k nnte blut in den rachen laufen und fangen sie die bluttropfen mit einem taschentuch oder eventuell auch mit einer schale auf meist h rt nasenbluten von alleine wieder auf
2864372 wenn es nach einer halben stunde immer noch blutet sollten sie auf alle f lle einen arzt aufsuchen und lassen sie sich begleiten denn durch den blutverlust kann es zu kreislaufproblemen kommen und sie k nnten eventuell in ohnmacht fallen sie sollten auch dann zum arzt gehen wenn sie h ufiger nasenbluten haben ganz wichtig dass die ursache abgekl rt wird
2864373 das kann durch heizungsluft aber auch durch klimaanlagen entstehen aber auch durch heftiges schn uzen durch heuschnupfen und durch nasenbohren kann es zu nasenbluten kommen
2864374 the healthy human mouth is home to a tremendous variety of microbes including viruses fungi protozoa and bacteria
2864375 the bacteria are the most numerous there are 100 million in every millilitre of saliva and more than 600 different species in the mouth around half of these have yet to be named and we are trying to describe and name the new species
2864376 interestingly this species was isolated from within the oral tissues both in oral cancers and normal healthy tissue
2864377 this confirms other work showing that oral bacteria can invade both tissues and individual cells
2864378 a detailed description and name for each species of bacteria are needed so that different laboratories can recognise all of the bacterial species present in the mouth
2864379 however we have seen in the past that when this soil sits for a while it disperses we intend to fill an oven with this material either by additional vibration of the same screen or by opening doors to one of the other tega cells
2864380 we need to design nanorectifiers that go with our nanoantennas
2864381 someday homeowners will even be able to print sheets of these solar cells with gt ultrathin dye sensitized solar cells called most efficient to date
2864382 body weight maintenance is made up of three basic stages
2864383 in the first stage the brain receives sensory input from the body including information provided by circulating hormones such as leptin and ghrelin and from fuels such as glucose and fatty acids
2864384 it is well known that agrp agouti related protein neurons play a critical role in feeding and energy balance regulation
2864385 however the deletion of agrp and npy two neuropeptides released from the agrp neurons produces little metabolic effect
2864386 the mice with agrp neuron specific disruption of gaba release were lean had higher energy expenditure and showed resistance to diet induced obesity
2864387 we also found that these animals showed reduced food intake response to the hormone ghrelin this suggests to us that the neurocircuit engaging gaba release from the agrp neurons mediates at least part of ghrelins appetite stimulating action
2864388 as these new findings demonstrate gaba release is an important component that mediates the function of agrp neurons
2864389 discoveries such as this will ultimately help us to design an efficient strategy to tackle the current epidemic of obesity and metabolic disease
2864390 we found one variant to be associated with weight and lean mass in both ethnic groups this variant was also associated with height total fat mass and hdl cholesterol but only in european american women a different variant was associated with triglyceride levels and hdl cholesterol in african american women
2864391 insects store fat like mammals do as lipid droplets accumulated in the fat body the functional equivalent of both mammalian liver and white adipose tissue
2864392 drosophila share many components of fat biosynthesis degradation and regulation with humans including many of those implicated in diabetes and obesity
2864393 it was an advantage to be more anxious in a dangerous environment
2864394 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety
2864395 still to identify the first candidates for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction
2864396 it might be possible to prescribe the right dose of the right drug relative to genetic makeup to treat anxiety disorders
2864397 icleis partnership with the carbon disclosure project underscores how crucial standards quantification methods and voluntary reporting are to local climate action
2864398 this project provides the opportunity for transparency and is essential in the emerging national and global policy dialogue as the priorities of local governments to achieve swift and deep reductions are identified and advanced by local government leaders
2864399 the city of new york joins the worlds leading corporations in providing a complete accurate accounting of its carbon emissions the strategies it is employing to mitigate those emissions and the results of its efforts through the carbon disclosure project and iclei this partnership between the worlds major corporations and increasingly its cities highlights the importance of the cooperative action needed to successfully counter climate change working together and with the best data we can manage this problem and leave our children and grandchildren a healthier and more sustainable planet
2864400 our study showed that functions can be maintained in older animals so long as damaged proteins continue to be efficiently removed strongly supporting the idea that protein buildup in cells plays an important role in aging itself
2864401 even more important these results show that its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
2864402 most people with these conditions are born with a mutation that gives rise to defective proteins but they dont experience symptoms until later in life
2864403 we think thats because their protein clearance systems can handle abnormal proteins when the person is younger but get overwhelmed as their efficiency falls with age by preventing this decline in protein clearance we may be able to keep these people free of symptoms for a longer time
2864404 theres reason to hope that drugs exerting a similar effect throughout the body may help us enjoy healthier lives well into old age

2864444 this is the start of the process of making decisions on how each company proposes to provide value for money long term high quality water services to its customers
2864445 we will now examine draft business plans in detail checking the proposed level of service and investment
2864446 we will make sure each plan includes everything we expect takes account of concerns expressed by customers and does so as efficiently as possible
2864447 thames customers have enjoyed the lowest bills in the industry for many years but we now need to make essential investment to secure their services for the future
2864448 this is particularly true for london where the water and sewerage infrastructure is ageing

2864494 sin embargo desde el punto de vista puramente psicol gico es sin lugar a dudas m s grave el adulterio en la mujer casi siempre la infidelidad en el hombre es fruto de un capricho pasajero o de un deseo moment neo su desliz no afecta de modo alguno el amor por su mujer el adulterio de sta sin embargo demuestra que se encuentran definitivamente rotos los lazos afectivos que la prendian al marido e irremediablemente compromete la estabilidad del hogar
2864495 una relaci n pasajera no tiene importancia sentimental sin embargo para la mujer si lo tiene adem s de eso los hijos que la mujer pueda tener del adulterio quedar n necesariamente a cargo del marido lo cual agrava la inmoralidad del hecho sin embargo los hijos del marido con la amante jam s estar n bajo los cuidados de la esposa en otras palabras el adulterio de la mujer transfiere para el marido el encargo y alimentaci n de prole ajena sin embargo no tendr esa consecuencia el adulterio del marido por eso la sociedad encara de modo mas severo el adulterio de la primera
2864496 no evidence that the gathering on 28 march 2008 was intended to be an enactment of nazi behaviour or adoption of any of its attitudes nor was it in fact
2864497 i see no genuine basis at all for the suggestion that the participants mocked the victims of the holocaust
2864498 legitimate public interest and one that i believe was legitimately published
2864499 someone must have just picked it up and walked off with it
2864500 out and out despicable i just dont have the time of day for her
2864501 instead of doing the decent thing and selling their properties and their car and paying back the people they owed they just wouldnt do it they thought it was beneath them they constructed this web of deceit
2864502 there is no doubt that this was a callous and calculated fraud both the darwins were willing to deceive and manipulate members of their family and friends and to waste considerable resources of the emergency services
2864503 in addition they were willing to exploit any compassion extended to them

2864509 smokings bad for you but keep drinking we need to make our money somewhere
2864510 stuff you havent worked through yet like how you molested your sister or caught your mother screwing the dog

2864519 gcse students can achieve a grade a without reading or writing a single note
2864520 research by bbc music magazine has revealed that none of the main examination boards awards more than 20 per cent of total marks for being able to read music
2864521 an o level music paper for the associated examination board in 1978 for example asked students to set a verse of poetry to music on a page of empty staves with credit given for good accentuation of the words and an appropriate melody
2864522 the music gcse exam is divided into composition performance and a listening paper
2864523 which will probably require you to be able to read or write music
2864524 compositions examined by the oxford cambridge and rsa exam boards need only to be in recorded form
2864525 the pressure of preparing youngsters in less than nine months means that insufficient time is available to bring sometimes very scant skills in music reading up to scratch
2864526 the idea of it reading musical notation being completely absent from the most important exams of your childhood is disgraceful
2864527 a system of notation that has been developed over hundreds and hundreds of years and has stood the test of time
2864528 its not educated is it it sounds like someone whos sat inside getting hammered for 8 hours on whisky cocaine speed and been reading every issue of the sun they could get their hands on
2864529 plus if anger is your ideal and only aim once you achieve it where can you go
2864530 do it again because i never really aimed to do much more than offend people and be a raging dickhead in the first place
2864531 if happiness is your ideal aim once you achieve it where can you go
2864532 you also seem to have romanticised what i like about the irish your nihilistic tendencies
2864533 i think all these self proclaimed nihilists are idiots if you were a true nihilist you wouldnt be alive i mean how does a nihilist cross the road
2864534 i bet with this you think your really socking it to them bet you think your finally the one writer to
2864535 you attempt to destroy everything your simply a human being in four walls numbing your boredom with various narcotics quivering too cowardly to create
2864536 your a human being with a brain how about you create something for somebody else to swear at
2864537 to me youve committed the worst crime possible for anyone who attempts their mind to order words
2864538 oh noes somebody on the internetz called me a boredom merchant time to stop having a blog foreverz ill never write anything again

2864541 respect for basic human rights in iran especially freedom of expression and assembly deteriorated in 2006 the government routinely tortures and mistreats detained dissidents including through prolonged solitary confinement

2864548 lets go fucking mental and ill wear a dildo and fuck you in the ear while you get a blow job from a thai hooker
2864549 the first problem is the title i want to believe not at all mysterious as an x files title should be
2864550 im a movie im not all that bad i wont shit on what you loved as a child if youre into that kind stuff why not check me out if not well im grand with that
2864551 but rather than going into more back story on what these two have been up to are they living together i want to believe jumps right into the middle as if x files just went off the air a few months ago and this movie is just a continuation of one of the episodes
2864552 the story centers around a missing fbi agent and a former priest turned convicted pedophile who seems to have psychic abilities in finding her of course it gets weirder but not in the ways you want or expect from an x files movie its more csi than ufo
2864553 oh it was decent but it wasnt violent enough for a film about the military
2864554 now if at some point after scully furrowed her brow at mulder her head were to split open and his long missing sister popped out that would be something
2864555 director creator of x files chris carter has taken the wrong approach with i want to believe instead of making a bigger x files movie to keep up with the first x files feature film with even more out of this worldliness he decides to bring it in and make it more well normal

2864563 the extent of current disagreement among second wave feminists is said by vicky randall to amount to nothing short of a crisis of identity
2864564 many women are oppressed their oppression is unfortunate not total but truly existing in some parts of society the agents of their oppression some men and even some women a few men receive economic sexual and psychological benefits from their oppression of a few women not all men have oppressed women many men have oppressed and abused physically psychologically or through lack of provision of equality women just as many women have oppressed and abused physically psychologically or through lack of provision of equality men we will always take the side of women against their oppressors even if in a hypothetical situation a woman was never oppressed by a man then claimed for instance rape despite his not raping her even then we will take the side of women because the man is a part of a male system and he is as such the enemy we will not ask what is revolutionary or reformist because we dont even know none of us have a clue anymore feminism has turned into a hideous ugly monster rampaging like a clumsy drunk lesbian through a crowd of men in order to take a shit in a urinal

2864602 being able to make us laugh is so much more important than how much you can bench press
2864603 the mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self denial that mars our lives we are punished for our refusals every impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us the body sins once and has done with its sin for action is a mode of purification nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure or the luxury of a regret the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it resist it and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden itself
2864604 an eye for an eye and soon the world is blind
2864605 once again the media is blamed because were making the kids famous
2864606 oh noes everyone blames us as usual its not our fault
2864607 at every level of our society and in every area of our lives fair play and common sense seem to have evaporated in the past decade
2864608 i was drunk and an angry man in a bad place with bad people around me feel sorry for me
2864609 this divorce could have been over like eddie murphys very dignified and quickly had i been protected

2864623 eastenders and coronation street have been accused of stereotyping ethnic minorities in a report
2864624 it found that us imports have more credible representations of minorities with viewers praising shows such as heroes lost er and even the simpsons
2864625 viewers cited asian corner shop owner dev in coronation street and black single mother denise who had two children by two different fathers in eastenders as examples of stereotyping and tokenism in soaps

2864629 creatures are not born with desires unless satisfaction for these desires exists a baby feels hunger well there is such a thing as food a duckling wants to swim well there is such a thing as water men feel sexual desire well there is such a thing as sex if i find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy the most probable explanation is that i was made for another world
2864630 the scripture saith the fool hath said in his heart there is no god it is not said the fool hath thought in his heart so as he rather saith it by rote to himself as that he would have than that he can thoroughly believe it or be persuaded of it it appeareth in nothing more that atheism is rather in the lip than in the heart of man
2864631 it is not possible for a man to be an atheist in the commonly accepted sense in his innermost conviction no amount of reasoning will erase from the human heart the god given conviction that there is a supreme being those who theoretically deny gods existence replace him with something else
2864632 i refuse to make a decision as there is no proof either way

2864638 i find it very very important to have some game situations during the preseason the 13 year veteran said
2864639 its hearing the contact in front of me feeling the contact in front of me and the adrenaline of being out there in a game there is no other preparation for that
2864640 the snap hold and kick obviously we can take care of on the practice field
2864641 but its the added element of being in a game situation the emotional preparation that goes into stepping on to a field during a game

2864651 the rock afire explosion videos went viral as they say and all hell broke loose
2864652 i decided to make an investment in the whole youtube phenomenon
2864653 developed by fechter puts internet users in the producers chair as they pay to get new songs produced
2864654 the company didnt want to license characters from me anymore they wanted to own my characters
2864655 but i believed i had a future with the rock afire explosion beyond what they wanted to do with it
2864656 nowadays it would cost several hundred thousand dollars to build a set
2864657 i sold them to fans for next to nothing to put them into the hands of people who loved them
2864658 my dream as far back as i can remember was to own a rock afire explosion stage show
2864659 our label sent me an e mail and said have you guys seen that rock afire website
2864660 its a story of two things the story of how rock afire came to be and how it came to disappear its sort of a tragic story there
2864661 but its also the story of chris thrash who single handedly brought it back into the public arena by putting shows on youtube
2864662 the question now is whether its a nostalgic flash in the pan or is there something there i say lets see if we can create quality content that will give us a new life
2864663 i knew from the very beginning if we could hang on long enough some day the rock afire explosion would live on again
2864664 how the hell am i going to do this without starving
2864665 games are an incredible language and system they should be everywhere

2864667 the sex peptide that was responsible for this effect was identified in 1988
2864668 there then followed first a trickle and then an ever increasing stream of identifications of the non sperm seminal fluid proteins
2864669 our results demonstrate an experimental method to identify transferred proteins in any system that is amenable to isotopic labeling and they underscore the power of combining proteomic and evolutionary analyses to shed light on the complex process of drosophila reproduction

2864671 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
2864672 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty
2864673 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2864674 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple
2864675 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2864676 it shows people are getting proficient at analysing apple software
2864677 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised

2864726 he promised action and delivered nothing thats why australians are so disillusioned
2864727 i dont think that we can construe from the northern territory some grand lessons for western australia ms gillard told abc radio today
2864728 obviously were going to wait and see the results to be finalised during the course of this week
2864729 obviously generally the public says to politicians they want them to serve their term and get the job done
2864730 but circumstances can bring early elections on and thats whats happened in western australia
2864731 fair bit of volatility because the territorys 25 electorates were so small
2864732 nevertheless when elections come and go theres always a lesson for politicians in them
2864733 what if i did this differently or what if i did this and not that
2864734 you only cook like you have the last three days when something is seriously troubling you
2864735 secret fresh and salt water fishing tricks of the worlds fifty best professional fishermen plus the professional secrets of fishing rods and how fishing rods are made
2864736 it was written by george leonard herter amp jacques p herter it was first published in 1949 in the introduction he states
2864737 this book was not written with the thought of expressing any personal opinions rather it was brought out to express the thoughts of many noteworthy men in the rod building field this book is not intended to be a literary piece of work in any sense of the word the author does not make any pretense at being a polished writer
2864738 what we are seeing is more people filling out requests for financial aid and for those who do more people are qualifying and the aggregate need is increasing
2864739 students who havent needed assistance before are coming in you had to expect that this was going to happen with all the news of companies laying off thousands of people
2864740 we expect uc undergraduates to receive about 1 billion in grants and scholarships from uc this year in state federal aid and other sources and that is about 100 million more than our students received in 2007 08
2864741 it is the economy i tried calling the financial aid office many times they say there is nothing they can do about it they said they just dont have enough federal aid and they dont have anything else to give me
2864742 because my fafsa free application for federal student aid says what my mom made last year the government wont give me aid either
2864743 we are talking to families who are seeing really bad economic times investments no longer hold their value i expect we will see more unemployed parents
2864744 we are seeing students whose parents in the past have been able to get money from equity lines those sources are drying up and the cost of living and tuition has gone up and so that contributes to it
2864745 last year and the year before it was a lot easier to get money
2864746 we have awarded aid to more students and more students are seeing the need to take out loans
2864747 we had a number of students who have had the economic hard times of parents losing jobs or their assets what they can liquidate now is different than in january or february when they filed their forms
2864748 the bluefluid surf racks are simple and quick to fit i had the racks and boards on the car in 5 minutes they worked perfectly on the weekend to carry 3 boards on our 2 door car we are about one and a half hours from the beach and most of that is freeway driving the boards stayed right where they should at 100km h
2864749 the education over there until the undergrad level is pretty good
2864750 but when it comes to grad school it just falls off the cliff in terms of quality
2864751 why should punjab get him we want to offer him even more
2864752 when someone gets some notoriety as sabeer did after selling hotmail they get bombarded with offers
2864753 if someone like sabeer is attached to a project then the thinking is other people will want to invest
2864754 but my reason for doing this is to leave behind a legacy
2864755 how many times in our lives do we get a chance to build a city
2864756 how many times do we get an opportunity to fix some of the problems that affect 1 1 billion people thats one sixth of humanity
2864757 the right partners do proper design provide basic things that you and i take for granted here
2864758 a lot of these rich entrepreneurs come to us thinking they have all the answers
2864759 a lot of these ideas have been tried before but not all together in one place
2864760 even my great grandfather was born here how can i sell this land
2864761 the state leaves it to the businessperson to negotiate his way through the thicket of corruption and lack of information that typically surrounds land records in rural areas
2864762 a piece of agricultural land will often have multiple claimants indebtedness and prior claims over the generations
2864763 every subsequent acre of land we were buying was more expensive than the previous one
2864764 we think that over 95 percent of all the farmers actually want to sell
2864765 we think this will put pressure on that remaining 5 percent of people who are maybe greedy for more money
2864766 we are ready to walk away you cant build a city around a farm
2864767 just for fun i tried to push something over with my eyes and i couldnt do it nothing moved i didnt even feel the hotness building up behind my eyeballs the power had gone i think ive lost it completely
2864768 its only a guess but heres what i think while you were in my class you had nothing to do nothing to make you struggle your fairly enormous brain was going crazy with frustration it was bubbling and boiling away like mad inside your head there was tremendous energy bottled up in there with nowhere to go and somehow or other you were able to shoot that energy out through your eyes and make objects move but now things are different you are in the top form competing against children more than twice your age and all that mental energy is being used up in class your brain is for the first time having to struggle and strive and really keep busy which is great thats only a theory mind you and it may be a silly one buti dont think its far off the mark
2864769 tavui is fully alert and neurologically sound the china japan friendship hospital is very happy we sent him there and they will continue to observe him and take some tests
2864770 all going well farani tavui is expected out of hospital in a day or two
2864771 this bout is the best for me because its a fairly tough draw with the world championship bronze medallist kilicci a cuban carlos banteaux correa and i think the 2007 world championship silver medallist thailands manus boonjumnong too ive got a long road ahead
2864772 i think that was a very mature performance by the youngest member of our team hes not even 19 yet hes got a good brain and hes tremendously quick
2864773 the guy hit me with so many right hooks in the last three fights but he didnt touch me this time i could see it in his eyes after two rounds he was surprised that i was still there
2864774 i couldnt lose to him anymore four times would have been bad i figured out that when he kate has finished attacking he just stands there and thats when i can attack
2864775 i have fought him three times and beaten him three times so im not sure what happened today his style was quite uncomfortable
2864776 i have dreamed of this day since i was a little girl
2864777 the journey here was harder than i could have ever imagined
2864778 its amazing especially considering how debilitated she was pre transplant
2864779 she has done very very well she is the reason we go to work every morning the wedding is a huge event for our lung transplant team its the dream we have for all our patients a normal life
2864780 these are the odds but if the odds were in place carrie wouldnt be here anyway
2864781 there was a point where i was ready to go
2864782 it was a week where i couldnt have food or water zach has lost one friend in a motorcycle accident ive lost at least 20 just by knowing so many people who were sick
2864783 today we celebrate many many miracles incredible generosity faith medical science and the fact that life always gives us second and sometimes third and fourth chances
2864784 it is a miracle and it really starts with the donor family lung transplantation is in its infancy its a procedure of the 1990s and were still battling problems we dont understand
2864785 in some ways it seems like another life in other ways it seems like just yesterday
2864786 im connected to it emotionally but im feeling the best i ever have
2864787 in the movies if someones sick and theyre honking and hacking ill move
2864788 they ask me to relive my experience im cautious what do i tell them and not tell them afterward i lie down and im done for the day
2864789 its truly like a brother and sister but on a different level
2864790 i dont ever forget that what i have is because of joel
2864791 the way i live my life is a thanks to you and joel
2864792 we wouldnt be here if it werent for the hanson family
2864793 not only did the hansons save carries life they changed every one of our lives
2864794 growth in real income was heavily concentrated at the very tip of the top that is the top 1 percent
2864795 the bottom 60 of u s households earned only 95 cents in 2004 for every dollar they made in 1979
2864796 c ongested highways overflowing sewers and corroding bridges are constant reminders of the looming crisis that jeopardizes our nations prosperity and our quality of life
2864797 we are recommending the exemptions be eliminated for political parties and for small businesses and employee records
2864798 progress the dictatorship is just as authoritarian and intolerant of dissent as ever on saturday the
2864799 when we come to resolving all our problems and democracy is returned we must take each and every police and military person to task who carried out an order they felt was wrong because they remained silent and carried out the job anyway they let people down and they should not be allowed to hide behind the i was doing my job or following orders excuse

2864801 my best years as a young man have been wasted
2864802 i havent had a social life for 10 years ive given the last penny in my pocket to the banks
2864803 we cant blame american hegemony for this we should learn to use credit cards properly
2864804 im going to take it to the supreme court until eventually i force cair to describe who their funding sources are
2864805 michael savage vows to take islam fight to supreme court popular radio host seeks to expose cairs international funding sources
2864806 im going to open up this case im going to sue cair im bringing a lawsuit back against them its going to cost me a fortune and when judge illston rejects it again which she will do because shes a minion of the bill clinton crowd im going to take it over her head and im going to go to the 9th circuit court of appeals where again im going to hit a stonewall and then im going to take it to the supreme court until eventually i force cair to describe who their funding sources are
2864807 how theyre targeting the midwest talk radio one talk show host at a time one company at a time dont you know that cair is going to come for you
2864808 first they came for michel savage and you didnt raise your voice and you laughed then they came after abercrombie and fitch and you didnt raise your voice because you werent in the retail business tomorrow theyll come after you and your business
2864809 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2864810 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2864811 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2864812 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2864813 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2864814 apparently a shareholder had assumed these yellow versions were not ripe and had left them on the kitchen counter to turn red after a few days all she had were moldy yellow tomatoes
2864815 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2864816 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2864817 houve dois bombardeios um contra a base militar de kojori e outro no monte makhata at onde sei n o h mortes

2864823 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2864824 attack took about half of the day i e a bit less than 10 hours
2864825 so if you have a gige lan any trojaned machine can poison your dns during one night
2864826 while i think its bad that anybody who can hammer you at gige speed for ten hours can poison your cache its not a threat to the real world the way 11 seconds at 10 megabit was
2864827 any dns server with a host based firewall can implement a 100 effective mitigation for the polyakov attack and its possible that an upstream outboard firewall could also be made to do it
2864828 at some point isc will have to put logic like this into bind of course but protecting against the polyakov attack is like synflood protection in that its a rate limit problem
2864829 its long past time for secure dns which is a combination of tsig tkey sig 0 and dnssec end to end crypto authentication

2864832 it was a big improvement and it was a big step and every canadian should have the opportunity to have it done
2864833 theres no doubt in my mind that the treatment the patients got in mexico was of benefit to those patients
2864834 we can make it work much better than those initial i think very courageous studies
2864835 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2864836 a lot of kids are going to have to rely on the regular routes and compete with adults for seats
2864837 the evidence right now on the link between brain tumors and cell phone usage is weak at best
2864838 theres never been anything thats proven in my opinion to show theres an association but things were hearing are noteworthy enough that make it reasonable for us to take preventative measures
2864839 basically they still do the activities but they decide that its worthwhile to enjoy the activity as opposed to worrying about the risk
2864840 i think all of our trees are paying for whats been happening over the last few years
2864841 if the scan shows there has been sufficient recovery and he is fit to compete in the olympics then he will catch a flight straight into beijing on monday evening
2864842 i think this is very important for all kids its good for their self esteem
2864843 so many people have done good things for me this is a good way to give back
2864844 we felt the need to kind of give folks a little relief with the economic situation

2864897 what i tell you in darkness that speak ye in light and what ye hear in the ear that preach ye upon the housetops
2864898 angel tours and iguana currently operate vehicles in a mechanically unsafe operating condition which if operated would pose an imminent hazard to the public
2864899 we dont know the answer to that question thats why were here
2864900 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
2864901 it was so thrilling that we actually got away with it
2864902 im glad it ended when it did it would have been a mess
2864903 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is
2864904 at some point in our lives you have to have some sort of accountability i cant see how people in my situation deny that
2864905 to know how truly sorry i am and i am willing to pay
2864906 i need to pay back i cant pay back monetarily this is the way
2864907 it was an experience its real strange to think on that and how i got here
2864908 i just heard shots pop pop pop i thought it was the police but no it was us
2864909 my wife was a wonderful person and didnt deserve this i fell for a coed it was stupid i sit in my cell and think how the heck did i get here
2864910 but i was a willing participant you can call it lust i really thought i would get off like a lot of people who are deluded
2864911 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2864912 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2864913 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2864914 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2864915 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2864916 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2864917 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2864918 what i tell you in darkness that speak ye in light and what ye hear in the ear that preach ye upon the housetops

2864921 kopf nach hinten einen nassen lappen in den nacken oder auf die stirn nee auf den nacken nicht den kopf nach hinten halten wie man ja oft das so denkt noch und ich glaube kaltes wasser mit kaltem wasser sp len das machen wir einen kalten lappen in den nacken kopf hinter und kalten lappen
2864922 bleiben sie ruhig setzen sie sich aufrecht hin und beugen sie den kopf nach vorne nicht nach hinten denn dann k nnte blut in den rachen laufen und fangen sie die bluttropfen mit einem taschentuch oder eventuell auch mit einer schale auf meist h rt nasenbluten von alleine wieder auf
2864923 wenn es nach einer halben stunde immer noch blutet sollten sie auf alle f lle einen arzt aufsuchen und lassen sie sich begleiten denn durch den blutverlust kann es zu kreislaufproblemen kommen und sie k nnten eventuell in ohnmacht fallen sie sollten auch dann zum arzt gehen wenn sie h ufiger nasenbluten haben ganz wichtig dass die ursache abgekl rt wird
2864924 das kann durch heizungsluft aber auch durch klimaanlagen entstehen aber auch durch heftiges schn uzen durch heuschnupfen und durch nasenbohren kann es zu nasenbluten kommen

2864938 in the 1950s few children with cystic fibrosis lived to attend elementary school today advances in research and medical treatments have enhanced and extended life for children and adults many people with the disease can expect to live into their 30s 40s and beyond
2864939 weve already done some work in that area and this request would take us from the corner of third and cedar and on up
2864940 of course that is our recommendation but the aldermen could send us in a different direction
2864941 dont get me wrong now i love downtown and i want to see downtown do well
2864942 but we have to remember that new bern is about more than downtown development there are places between first and third avenues that are still just in ruinous condition
2864943 last time we probably did work on 15 to 20 houses and that includes some demolition and relocation of families

2864954 ada pula yang kurang ajar waktu ibumu meninggal banyak pengemis yang datang bukan melayat tapi minta sedekah kepada para pelayat yang turut berdukacita
2864955 lihat pak piliek dia mengaku tak pernah memberi pengemis yang datang ke rumahnya sepeser pun dia merasa lebih tenang karena para pengemis tahu kalau ke rumah pak piliek dia tak mendapatkan apa apa maka mereka tak pernah datang lagi
2864956 namanya juga manusia biasa wajar ada ikhlas ada tidak ini bagian dari ujian memuliakan diri
2864957 kau tak ingin tangan yang biasa menadah lagi itu menghunuskan pisau dan menghunjamkan ke jantung kita yang merasa berkecukupan ini ia kelak bisa saja haus darah tak butuh uang atau beras dari kaum kaya atau kikir yang ketakutan karena tak seorang pun mau bersedekah
2864958 tuhan kadang aku bersedekah hanya karena takut mereka menjadi beringas oleh kemiskinannya yang panjang
2864959 jangan jangan ini kabar pertakut agar aku rajin bersedekah berbagi untuk apa yang dikatakan ibu baik untuk kehidupan
2864960 suamiku ingin sekali bersedekah ingin ada pengemis menghampirinya katanya setelah itu dia mati pun tak apa
2864961 itulah aku juga heran kalau sudah malam dia sering berkata ya silakan masuk makan dulu baru mengemis lagi ini sedikit uang untuk anak dan keluargamu hati hati di jalan ya mengemis itu halal kalau tak dikasih kerja oleh pemerintah tak dikasih modal oleh orang kaya mengemis halal lalu setelah itu dia tertawa
2864962 begini pengemis kan paling sering ke rumahmu ini kalau dia datang bawa dia ke rumahku biar suamiku tenteram
2864963 has been poorly thought through badly implemented and has produced many unintended costs that will linger for years if not decades but blanket criticism of bush misses an important reality
2864964 whatever reasons and through whichever path the foreign policies in place now are more sensible moderate and mainstream in many cases the next president should follow rather then reverse them
2864965 the administration that became the target of so much passion and anger from democrats republicans independents foreigners martians everyone is not quite the one in place today the foreign policies that aroused the greatest anger and opposition were mostly pursued in bushs first term the invasion of iraq the rejection of treaties diplomacy and multilateralism in the last few years many of these policies have been modified abandoned or reversed this has happened without acknowledgment which is partly what drives critics crazy and its often been done surreptitiously it doesnt reflect a change of heart so much as an admission of failure the old way simply wasnt working
2864966 consider as a symbol of this shift bushs appointment of the world banks president his first choice for the job was paul wolfowitz an arch neoconservative with little background in economics but by the time wolfowitz was forced to resign and the post opened up again bush realized that he needed a less ideological choice and he picked the highly qualified and respected robert zoellick where dick cheney was once the poster child for the administration today policy is being run by condoleezza rice robert gates stephen hadley and hank paulson all pragmatists change has not extended to all areas and in many places its been too little too late but that there has been a shift to the center in many crucial areas of foreign policy is simply undeniable
2864967 without diminishing the callous and brutal nature of this crime which was certainly committed partly for financial gain and with no regard to the sanctity of human life i believe that a determinate sentence is appropriate
2864968 my client states his instructions are that ben clark acted alone and that is what we maintained throughout the trial and unfortunately the jury did not accept that
2864969 care homes can be such miserable places you sit there all day staring out the window with no one to talk to
2864970 i thought it would be lovely to give a home and family life to one or two people who would otherwise be sitting around there
2864971 i started asking people if they wanted to move out of their care homes and live with me and ive had dozens of offers they are queuing up
2864972 its nice for me too because at my age its handy to have someone to live with now every book that sells will help towards making a home for someone
2864973 care homes can be such miserable places you sit there all day staring out the window with no one to talk to
2864974 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time said robert helman said on ctv

2864976 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2864977 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2864978 president saakashvili briefed the vice pesident on the russian campaign against military and civilian targets throughout georgia

2864985 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2864986 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2864987 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2864988 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem

2864997 they bit the complainant a couple of times in the leg area he refused any type of medical attention so didnt require any time of hospitalization
2864998 at that point by 2 p m we just exhausted all sorts of our search proximity of the lakeshore area and had not found any evidence to indicate that the gentleman had come to shore
2864999 it was a dark grey object and it was flying parallel to the ground
2865000 i dont want to get as i said last night prematurely stressed about it
2865001 he allegedly sent the e mail to air chinas office in tokyo from his computer last friday
2865002 the e mail threatened to blow up air china planes unless the company halted all its flights
2865003 it also threatened to force its planes to crash onto olympics sites
2865004 i keep my own personality in a cupboard under the stairs at home so that no one else can see it or nick it
2865005 we are encouraging people to get more involved in their communities
2865006 this is a good time for the leaders to express if they feel isolated
2865007 all the muslims i have met are busy with their jobs their businesses their faith and raising their kids
2865008 as a result they do not have a whole lot of time to be active in these volunteer positions
2865009 these are our homes now we are part of the local community and part of the muslim community
2865010 our children are growing up here it is definitely a healthy move to get more involved
2865011 if our community was more engaged if there was a commissioner who was a muslim there would have been fewer stereotypes there from lack of understanding
2865012 it was not a political issue it was an issue of discrimination by some
2865013 im proud of the city commission and grass roots organizations that were supportive
2865014 but if the minimum we accomplish is meeting each other and sharing our experiences and challenges that is an accomplishment in itself
2865015 so youre an obama supporter my lady what kind of change is he going to bring

2865050 from tolstoy to the poet anna akhmatova and the dissident physicist andrei sakharov the most respected russian intellectuals have traditionally functioned not just as cultural figures but as national symbols moral beacons and speakers of truth mr solzhenitsyn was one of several titanic figures who staked their lives on that mission to defeat the lie as he put it undeterred by exile and imprisonment
2865051 today in an atmosphere of far greater freedom in private life than existed in the soviet period there are no towering cultural figures who command the respect that mr solzhenitsyn did in his prime instead of moral clarion calls literary novelists write profanity laced satires of consumerism most opposition politicians have faded from the scene rather than push to the limits against growing authoritarianism
2865052 partly because a new generation of russians is now awash in the global tide of infinite consumer choice
2865053 but should someone ask me whether i would indicate the west such as it is today as a model to my country frankly i would have to answer negatively no i could not recommend your society in its present state as an ideal for the transformation of ours through intense suffering our country has now achieved a spiritual development of such intensity that the western system in its present state of spiritual exhaustion does not look attractive even those characteristics of your life which i have just mentioned are extremely saddening
2865054 an obvious conflict between people of conscience and the authorities today we dont have that kind of conflict
2865055 just please by loyal to me and then you will be totally free in what you do with your private life

2865058 the giants shoulders is a monthly science blogging event in which authors are invited to submit posts on classic scientific papers submissions are due on the fifteenth of each month and entries will be aggregated and linked to on the host blog of the month links to entries should be sent to that months host blog
2865059 what defines a classic paper this depends upon the field in question but one expects that the work should have somewhat stood the test of time we suggest perhaps 10 years old or more contributors should not only describe the research involved but also put it in a broader historical scientific context why is the work in question important groundbreaking revolutionary nifty
2865060 it should go without saying by the use of the word classic but papers should be in an accepted established scientific field contributions promoting non traditional science and pseudo scientific ideas are inappropriate

2865069 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
2865070 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
2865071 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
2865072 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
2865073 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health

2865080 i dont know how many people were watching the game but it was an honor to play in it
2865081 we were all excited and anxious this game was over the top
2865082 but we have a saying back home that when youre good you play for the name on the front of your jersey instead of the name on the back our guys all play for the name on the front of their jersey

2865086 one thing you should probably know is that holland peaked in 1617 and life over there is still pretty good also
2865087 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2865088 you have to get focused and give it a go
2865089 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2865090 they get in contention in a major and manage to get things going their way either because they play well or because somebody else comes back unfortunately it hasnt happened to me
2865091 what can i say i havent got the focus this week obviously im still just having a hangover after winning the open
2865092 i think i need to spend 24 hours in bed
2865093 i focused on friday evening and saturday and all through saturday and sunday in rehydrating myself and at least whether that was the cause or not whether it was it might have been tiredness as well
2865094 but at least i had something tangible that i could actually pin it on and try and put some effort into it and give me the belief that if i can get my hydration right basically my coordination would come back
2865095 it was my first time in the last group in a major and i dont think it will be my last time
2865096 i would have liked to obviously play better but i had a good week
2865097 i had my ups and downs had a little go of it early in the round and tried to make a move
2865098 hey you gotta see how i nailed dat fischer bum
2865099 it is not only about using profits made by petronas simply to lower the present petrol price to rm2
2865100 alright we just created this saw we know it works with hotdogs who wants to try it with their own hand just to make sure it works

2865103 oh i dont have any idea how my blackberry broke
2865104 that mobile phone fad might be something to look into
2865105 yeah just like coke needs to put pepsi in their cans
2865106 this is nothing like what i expected and its lacking key features i need but i cant directly say anything bad about it
2865107 if i dont love it i simply dont talk about it
2865108 and despite starring opposite brian cox and joseph fiennes in the excellent prison break film the escapist there is very little diva esque behaviour out of this grappler sos still takes no prisoners in the ring and even takes his scraps outside the apron and has to be restrained by several referees and officials in almost every match up
2865109 when someone yells out hey geek do you turn around
2865110 if we start putting computer science in we would have to be taking stuff out everybody already says there is not enough time to teach it all it would be a huge problem for teachers
2865111 i think most teachers would say im prepared to be a maths teacher
2865112 its the use of technology for learning maths rather than the writing of programs to do tasks thats a whole new set of skills and a whole new way of thinking
2865113 its really about making resources available if they want them in an ideal world computing would have its own syllabus but we also understand were putting schools through enough as it is
2865114 ive rented ten dvds from that and was always happy
2865115 anticipates it will be a reasonably sophisticated spreadsheet based application
2865116 there are also a number of staff working at maritime new zealand who are former kordia employees theres an overlap between staff
2865117 if you dont have multiple towers youre going to have dead zones
2865118 but no one can guarantee 100 per cent coverage even in a cellphone network there are some dead spots
2865119 but we have been contracted by maritime new zealand we are the preferred supplier to government departments and we have signed with the biggest port in new zealand if there was a problem with our service we wouldnt be getting blue chip customers
2865120 safety of our employees is our biggest concern and our prime responsibility is to provide a safe environment to our women employees we have 35 per cent women staffers in our company and we make sure of all safety precautions are in place for them
2865121 the bpo units in ahmedabad are in the process of implementing this code of conduct the industry is very conscious about these safety issues and efforts are moving in the right direction
2865122 however we always try to keep a check on vehicles passing late in the night women can dial 100 in case of emergency the nearby police officials on patrol will reach the spot
2865123 these madrasas and religious units have received funds from abroad mainly gulf countries we suspect that this money may have been used for the serial blasts and to finance the terror operatives other activities
2865124 the illegal hawala channel is used for this purpose where the financial transactions and transfer of funds are being carried out by word of mouth we have tracked down two possible channels that would have been part of such a transaction scrutiny of their records is on

2865144 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2865145 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2865146 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2865147 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2865148 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2865149 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2865150 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2865151 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2865152 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2865153 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2865154 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2865155 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2865156 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2865157 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

2865175 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2865176 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2865177 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2865178 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2865179 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2865180 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2865181 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2865182 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2865183 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2865184 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2865185 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2865186 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2865187 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2865188 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2865189 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2865190 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2865191 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2865192 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2865193 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2865194 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2865195 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2865196 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2865197 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2865198 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2865199 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2865200 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2865201 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2865202 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2865203 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2865204 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2865205 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2865206 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2865207 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2865208 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2865209 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2865210 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2865211 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2865212 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2865213 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2865214 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2865215 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2865216 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

2865226 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

2865230 her current favorite sign while she was sleeping this morning and tonight she wanted the cookie dough on the counter so she ran to her room grabbed a bin emptied it and used it as a stool to help her reach
2865231 she said she had fired 39 people to save money in the budget
2865232 this day shall we save thee in the body that thou mayest be a sign to those who come after thee
2865233 i dont think the people of guam have ever seen anything like this before and in some regards its shameful
2865234 but then thats what the whole investigation is looking at and from the reading ive been doing asbestos exposure can take many years to come through

2865238 some time in the future we will get around to it i am making no promises to when that might be but some time latter we will deal with this issue after we finish what ever we are doing then we will start to look into it any community speculations on these patches will help give us ideas in the right direction but once again i make no promises to when that might come
2865239 we just started our ladder season and patching in the middle is not wise for balance purposes
2865240 excellent backgrounder on social media user generated content and online communities through the lens of anthropology
2865241 what makes these efforts particularly interesting is that through a collaborative web based process they attempt to distill and document the current best knowledge about any topic in health care the goal is easily accessible state of the science information the equivalent of ongoing medical scientific review articles that detail what we know and dont know about life and care processes
2865242 for example the iphone shows a graphic of a slice of the human brain

2865430 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2865431 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2865432 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2865433 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2865434 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2865435 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2865436 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2865473 in my leisure moments i have meditated upon the subject and asked the question why it is that infants innocent children are taken away from us especially those that seem to be the most intelligent and interesting the lord takes many away even in infancy that they may escape the envy of man and the sorrows and evils of this present world they were too pure too lovely to live on earth therefore if rightly considered instead of mourning we have reason to rejoice as they are delivered from evil and we shall soon have them again all children are redeemed by the blood of jesus christ and the moment that children leave this world they are taken to the bosom of abraham the only difference between the old and young dying is one lives longer in heaven and eternal light and glory than the other and is freed a little sooner from this miserable wicked world

2865566 im always thinking i like growing business thats exciting i like developing energy but how does it affect the last and the least what can we do to make it better for those people who probably never will get to the front of the line how can we make their lives better how can we pull them along how can we make them the most they can be how can we make them build their self esteem and self respect what more can we do
2865567 democrats will win elections when they figure out how to talk to those families
2865568 every time ive compromised ive lost when i held firm i won the problem with too many environmentalists today is that they are trying to write the compromise instead of letting those we pay to compromise do it they think they get power by taking people to lunch or being taken to lunch when in reality they are only being taken
2865569 not only are many many australians on low levels of income they are on these low levels for a long period of time
2865570 what this demonstrates to us is that its very important that we get the maximum rate of income support at a level that enables people to have a reasonable standard of living
2865571 we understand that money will need to be spent but its important that we get this right because such a significant number of people are dependent on these pensions
2865572 that really is a matter that will be worked through in the first instance by the review as they make assessments about the best way forward
2865573 allegations of this type are always regrettable but to some extent inevitable
2865574 lord if it is you bid me come to you on the water
2865575 lord if it is you calm the sea ok some of us are getting real sick now
2865576 lord if it is you take us to the dry land immediately
2865577 lord if it is you bid me come to you on the water
2865578 he was afraid and beginning to sink and cried out lord save me
2865579 im not making any guarantees to anybody about which party i would support i certainly havent been happy about the labor party in various issues that have come before us during this last term of parliament
2865580 but id like to see what the clp would do about those issues obviously also people will have sent a message to the government theyre not happy with them theres a 9 per cent swing so i have to listen to what the people are saying
2865581 there has been a strong swing against the government certainly as the chief minister i have listened to that swing i will listen to what territorians have said
2865582 we will wait and see what the count will unveil in the coming days and there will be plenty of time to sit around and make an assessment about what went right and what went wrong
2865583 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2865584 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2865585 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2865586 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2865587 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2865588 if they want that title theyre going to have to earn it
2865589 ill see what i can do if my best is top eight great if not ill work on it
2865590 im very humbled that the people of braitling have put their faith in me to represent them in the northern territory
2865591 what i take out of it is a very resounding defeat by labor
2865592 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2865593 how exactly do i find out if my competitors links are relevant without visiting every one of their links
2865594 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2865595 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2865599 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities
2865600 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
2865601 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty
2865602 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2865603 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple
2865604 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2865605 it shows people are getting proficient at analysing apple software
2865606 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised
2865607 inflation has reached 4 5 per cent yet paramedics are being offered annual increases of 3 25 per cent basically theyre being offered a pay cut how can they accept that mr mcghie said in a statement
2865608 some way down the track if members were not offered something they were happy with they might stop billing patients and stop filling out paperwork
2865609 certainly i would think in the next four to five weeks if there has been little progress i think were left with no choice but to go to the industrial relations commission and mount a case for putting industrial action to a ballot of our members he said
2865610 the ultimate action would be stop work action if it got to a serious point
2865611 im sure all of our guys are having a rough time with it

2865616 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2865617 no not really because i was going on the side around them
2865618 the way they did it it was like they wanted to fight me
2865619 somewhere somebody got some talk going of somebody insulting or challenging somebody else
2865620 tarrod lost his temper and got angry he acted first and didnt think about the consequences im not sure myself that he realized the extent of what hed done
2865621 im not even sure to this day what they were fighting about
2865622 if we were gonna jump you we woulda jumped you
2865623 id fight for respect let em know i aint scared of em if you dont show that they keep bullying you
2865624 thats probably what most fights are about people saying you cant fight and then calling em out and fighting em
2865625 he probably felt like if it got back to school he got beat up by kristian and all that people are gonna say oh you got beat up youre soft
2865626 i would hate to see our teachers and classrooms lose out on money because the state doesnt have enough revenue
2865627 i understand why legislators want to give people a break because the economy is down and people are hurting and cant afford the things they want to buy
2865628 but they arent taking into account what that revenue could later buy for the states
2865629 weve given them the benefit of the doubt for a long time
2865630 a sales tax free weekend will be welcomed more than ever in this tough economy especially with the high prices of food and fuel

2865827 misleading the public with official looking but manipulated document images of doubtful provenance
2865828 without a valid birth certificate the primary record of u s birth obama cannot prove that he fulfills the natural born citizen requirement of the constitution throwing into doubt his eligibility to run for president and throwing the race into turmoil
2865829 his presumed kenyan born father was foreign born and his mother was too young at the time of birth to confer natural born status by virtue of her american citizenship thus his citizenship comes down to proving he was born in the usa and his campaign has staked its credibility on the authenticity of the daily kos derived birth certificate image

2865879 okay fair enough and secondly and a little bit of a follow up on jeff s question he asked a question on pricing for 2009 and what i would like howard to address if possible is the comments on value promotions in the fiscal first quarter a focus on value and exactly what that may entail i mean whether it would be actually advertising price points or discounting or combos if you could just give us a sense of where the brand may be heading over the next couple of months
2865880 we have no intention of doing things that would dilute the integrity of the premium position that starbucks occupies and what i mean by that specifically is we are not going to go down the fast food lane and do things that are what i believe not in the interest of long term interest of the value of the brand and the experience

2865913 the epa rejected on thursday a request to cut the quota for the use of ethanol in cars concluding for the time being that the goal of reducing the nations reliance on oil trumps any effect on food prices from corn ethanol the effect of the decision on fuel and food markets is hard to determine recently high energy prices have led to even more ethanol production than the quota required on the other hand rising corn prices made some ethanol operations unprofitable especially as oil prices started to fall so ending the quota might not have reduced the use of ethanol but it might decline even with the quotas in place still the debate is fraught with symbolism and the decision is an indication that washington is unwilling to retreat from a policy that is very popular among grain farmers if not among ranchers the long term hope backed up with generous government incentives is to make motor fuel from cellulosic sources private companies are feverishly pursuing technologies for using wood chips wheat straw waste plastic and even municipal garbage to make ethanol and other liquid vehicle fuels but none of these is commercial at the moment
2865914 the u s renewable fuel standard which mandates that 9 billion gallons of corn based ethanol be blended into the fuel supply this year rising to 15 billion by 2015 and holding steady at that rate until 2022 has been pretty definitively linked to a rise in global food prices that could push 100 million additional people into poverty consider also that corn is an extremely heavy user of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer which emits a greenhouse gas called nitrous oxide that the epa itself terms about 310 times more powerful than carbon dioxide finally consider that every gallon of ethanol that gets mixed into the fuel supply costs taxpayers 0 51 given the mounting challenges we face as a nation do we really have 4 5 billion 7 5 billion to drop on a program that most serious people consider environmentally worthless at best yet epa chief stephen l johnson sees nothing wrong of course getting a ringing endorsement from johnson on environmental grounds is like having al capone sign off on the legality of your gun running operation guys got a bit of a credibility problem and of course no one really challenged the rfs on environmental grounds texas gov rick perry requested the rfs waiver on economic grounds specifically on grounds that higher corn prices are crimping the profits of industrial meat producers governor hairdo as hes known in certain austin circles learned crony capitalism at the knee of his predecessor george w bush from the houston chronicle poultry producer lonnie bo pilgrim spent more than 9 000 on airfare in june so gov rick perry could attend a news conference promoting a waiver from federal ethanol mandates that pilgrim wants perry requested the waiver from the epa in april after meeting with pilgrim in march the houston chronicle reported this month that six days after that march meeting pilgrim donated 100 000 to the republican governors association which perry heads as chairman this is one of those pox on all your houses deals yes we need to gut the rfs turning half the u s corn crop into car fuel is insane but we also need to rein in the vast environmental abuses of industrial meat giants like pilgrims pride

2865916 mccains energy plan is a mixed bag at best and is nowhere close to what is needed he wants to build 45 new nuclear power plants by 2030 and 100 eventually like obama he supports so called non existent clean coal obamas program as publicly released on monday is significantly better than mccains but there are number of problems with it hence it is important that 1sky campaign and al gores we campaign have joined forces with many other groups working towards a national day of action on september 27th for green jobs now tens of thousands if not more will be taking part on this important day one day after the first presidential debate lets rock the country in support of green jobs and climate solutions demanding strong federal legislation in the first 100 days of 2009
2865917 sen john mccain toured a nuclear power plant in michigan on tuesday to highlight his support for the construction of 45 new nuclear power generators by 2030 a position he said distinguished him from his democratic rival in addressing the nations energy demands sen barack obama has focused on alternative energy sources like wind and solar as well as conservation which would apparently also be the main beneficiaries of the decade long 150 billion government investment effort he promises if elected he barely mentions nuclear power usually just alluding to it in a sentence here or there i think we do have to look at nuclear he said in an interview this spring on meet the press and what weve got to figure out is can we store the material properly can we make sure that theyre secure can we deal with the expense in his appearance at the nuclear plant mr mccain expressed none of those doubts or concerns asserting in his statement that the construction of the 45 new nuclear power plants by 2030 would create 700 000 jobs a figure that many experts find to be inflated he also said his experience serving on the nuclear fueled aircraft carrier enterprise had convinced him of the safety of nuclear power
2865918 the total cost of dumping nuclear waste at nevadas yucca mountain repository will hit 96 2 billion the department of energy estimated tuesday the estimate has jumped 38 percent excluding inflation since 2001 and it assumes no new construction of nuclear reactors to put that in perspective john mccain is pushing for the u s to build up to 45 new nuclear plants by 2030 the energy department ambitiously assumes that yucca will begin accepting waste in 2020 continue through 2070 and close in 2113 it also estimates that the site could take in as much as 122 000 tons of nuclear waste even though congress has limited yuccas capacity to 77 000 tons about 64 000 tons of used reactor fuel is already chillin at 121 temporary sites across the u s and more than 2 000 tons are added each year
2865919 barack obama and john mccain used an ongoing debate over energy policy to tack back to core themes of their campaigns tuesday with obama blasting his rival for the presidency as a clone of the current administration and the republican seeking to revive his reputation as someone willing to buck his party on major issues
2865920 many in the environmental community are annoyed by barack obamas change of position on offshore drilling even while they applaud his comprehensive energy plan
2865921 house speaker nancy pelosi on sunday ruled out a vote on new offshore oil drilling even as democratic presidential candidate barack obama said he might be open to a compromise that included it obama is scheduled to deliver a speech today monday in lansing mich on energy policy unveiling what spokesman bill burton called new short term and long term solutions to the energy crisis that were facing on tuesday presumptive republican nominee john mccain is scheduled to go to the enrico fermi nuclear power plant in newport mich to spotlight his proposal for more nuclear plants
2865922 the next president of the united states will arrive at the white house committed to a radical new approach to energy policy barack obama and john mccain have both pledged to take climate change far more seriously than the current administration has done they promise to curb greenhouse gases through a cap and trade system of emissions permits both advocate in addition an array of measures to promote energy conservation the use of alternative fuels and all manner of clean energy innovation their aim is to give the country what both candidates say it now wants energy security energy independence affordable fuels and the leadership role in fighting global climate change that the bush administration surrendered when it walked away from the kyoto protocol in 2001 yet both men in my view have failed to understand the main issue or more likely are deliberately obscuring it willingness to advocate an explicit carbon tax or at any rate to spell out the equivalent consequences of a binding cap and trade system is the real test of whether either candidate is ready to confront this issue so far both are failing that test as it happens i think the political toxicity of a carbon tax as against cap and trade assuming we are serious about this and contemplating a cap and trade system that makes a difference is exaggerated a revenue neutral package of a carbon tax and cuts in other taxes is surely within the bounds of domestic political salesmanship but also bear in mind the decisive international advantage of a straightforward carbon tax
2865923 south africas government has set out an ambitious proposal to deal with climate change in the coming years including slapping a possible carbon tax on carbon dioxide spewing industries saying the world faced a global climate emergency the environment ministry unveiled the strategy geared toward reducing greenhouse gases last week the plan which includes stringent energy efficiency measures has been endorsed by the cabinet though parliament must still approve it finance officials are investigating ways of implementing the tax our emissions per capita are higher than many other developing countries in part due to our coal based energy system professor harald winkler from the university of cape town climate change department told afp our analysis shows that putting a price on carbon has the single largest impact on emissions by using the price signal it sends signals to all actors in the economy and can shift behaviour said winkler
2865924 if youve already made the jump from plastic bags then bravo youve obviously recognized how bad they are and now realize how relatively easy it is to get them out of your life but for those of you who are still on the plastic bag fence lets look at a few facts around the world this year plastic bag consumption will exceed the 500 billion mark the average number of plastic bags consumed every minute around the world is roughly 1 million a minute to put that in perspective since you started reading this article over a million bags have been consumed of that number only 1 will actually be recycled while the rest will either end up in landfills or worse out in nature or in the ocean
2865925 the delhi high court thursday banned the use of plastic bags by shops in the national capital and asked the city government to enforce the ban at the earliest possible time the order came on a public interest suit by environmental activist v k jain who demanded the use of plastic bags be banned and contended that these were choking drains and leading to collection of dirty water that in turn created breeding grounds for disease jain also cited examples of germany singapore and bangladesh where the ban on plastic bags has been successfully implemented the court imposed the ban despite a government panel earlier telling the court that a blanket ban was not possible
2865926 around the world many of the most spectacular migrations have either disappeared due to human activities or are in steep decline the causes of all these declines vary depending on the species and the locale but in general the threats to migrants fall into four nonexclusive categories habitat destruction the creation of obstacles and barriers such as dams and fences overexploitation and climate change most of the migrants are in little immediate danger of extinction rather they are becoming less and less common given the panoply of environmental problems we now face is the fading glory of migration really a significant issue we would argue that it is protecting the abundance of migrants is the key to protecting the ecological importance of migration as the number of migrants declines so too do many of the most important ecological properties and services associated with them the challenges scientific economic and social associated with protecting migratory species are enormous but so too are the payoffs we can preserve phenomena that have awed and sustained us since the dawn of humanity we can protect ecological processes that are integral to many of the planets ecosystems and we can solve scientific puzzles that have baffled natural historians for millennia if we are successful it will be because governments and individuals have learned to act proactively and cooperatively to address environmental problems and because we have created an international network of protected areas that is capable of sustaining much of the planets natural diversity
2865927 nearly half of all primate species are now threatened with extinction according to an evaluation by the international union for the conservation of nature the study which drew on the work of hundreds of scientists and is the most comprehensive analysis for more than a decade found that the conservation outlook for monkeys apes and other primates has dramatically worsened in some regions the thriving bushmeat trade means the animals are being eaten to extinction the 2007 iucn red list has 39 of primate species and sub species in the three highest threat categories vulnerable endangered and critically endangered in todays revised list 303 of the 634 species and sub species 48 are in these most threatened categories the two biggest threats faced by primates are habitat destruction through logging and hunting for bushmeat and the illegal wildlife trade weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined said dr russell mittermeier chair of the iucn species survival commissions primate specialist group and the president of the picture in south east asia is particularly bleak where 71 of all asia primates are now listed as threatened and in vietnam and cambodia 90 are considered at risk populations of gibbons leaf monkeys and langurs have dropped due to rapid habitat loss and hunting to satisfy the chinese medicine and pet trade
2865928 the state of alaska sued interior secretary dirk kempthorne on monday seeking to reverse his decision to list polar bears as a threatened species under the endangered species act
2865929 she should be working for sustainable clean energy development in alaska instead of extinction for the polar bear kempthorne announced the listing may 14 the process started with the filing of the petition in 2005 a yearlong initial review another year of public comment and additional studies and court action to force a final decision kempthorne concluded that sea ice was vital to polar bear survival that sea ice had dramatically melted in recent decades and that computer models suggest sea ice likely will further recede in the future
2865930 clearing natural forests in australia would pose a greater danger to the global climate than previously thought because they hold three times as much carbon as estimated a report released tuesday said the australian national university report green carbon pdf 47 pp warns that all nations not just those in the developing world should prevent the clearing of their forests because this could release huge amounts of harmful carbon into the atmosphere from a scientific perspective green carbon accounting and protection of the natural forests in all nations should become part of a comprehensive approach to solving the climate change problem the report said while current international talks focused on reducing the destruction of forests in developing countries only the forests of nations such as australia canada russia and the us also needed to be protected it added protecting the carbon in australias and the worlds natural forests is no longer an option it is a necessity report co author professor brendan mackey said

2865932 in some places of the world that change is happening more quickly than in others so quickly that our fast thinking human mind as the university of copenhagen geologist minik rosing says can almost catch it one of those places is the coastal town of ilulissat the last stop on our climate tour of greenland climate change itself isnt a bad thing it isnt even unusual take a geologic step back and you can see that our climate has always changed alternating just within the past several hundred thousand years between ice ages when glaciers covered much of the northern hemisphere to eras warmer than our own change is the nature of the planet just as every winter and summer sermeq kujalleq advanced and retreated long before we were here to give the greenhouse effect an added push our own human period has been one of unusual climatic stability a fact that has been essential to our own species success what matters is not that change is happening but that it is happening so fast in ilulissat the ice that once covered much of the sea in the winter and allowed hunting fishing and travel by dogsled comes no longer in less than a human lifetime barely the blink of an eye in geologic time a way of life millenniums old will be lost here elsewhere we may see temperate and fertile areas turn dry and barren in the same time period what weve known and lived with may no longer exist and we may not be able to adapt in time for what is coming
2865933 up close the sound of global warming at the face of the urumqi no1 glacier is a simple steady drip drip drip just 30 metres from the main wall the flood of meltwater becomes so powerful that it cuts a tunnel under the floor of grey ice leaving only a blotchy wafer thin crust on the surface compared with the collapse of ice shelves in the antarctic the melting of the mountains in chinas far west is one of the less spectacular phenomena of global warming but it is a more immediate cause of concern and hope there is concern because this glacier more than almost any other in china is a natural water regulator for millions of people downstream in the far western region of xinjiang in winter it stores up snow and ice in summer it releases meltwater to provide drinking and irrigation supplies to one of the countrys most arid regions it brings hope because its rapid shrinkage is helping to set off climate change alarm bells in a country that emits more greenhouse gases than any other the urumqi no1 glacier is so named because it was the first icefield to be measured in china since 1953 scientists have been tracking changes in temperature here the results leave no room for doubt that this part of the tian heaven mountain range is melting according to the cold and arid regions environmental and engineering research institute the glacier has lost more than 20 of its volume since 1962 and the rate of shrinkage is accelerating
2865934 a major national park in canadas arctic has been largely closed after record high temperatures caused flooding that washed away hiking trails and forced the evacuation of tourists an official said on friday every year around 500 people visit auyuittuq national park which covers over 19 000 square km 7 340 square miles on baffin island and is dominated by the giant penny ice cap the park is popular with hikers and skiers the combination of floods melting permafrost and erosion means that the southern part of the park will remain shut until geologists can examine the damage said pauline scott a spokeswoman for parks canada the problems started last month with two weeks of record temperatures on baffin island that reached as high as 27 celsius 81 fahrenheit well above the july average of 12 c 54 f this scott said triggered massive melting which sent a huge pulse of water through the park washing away 60 km 37 miles of a trail used by hikers and destroying a bridge
2865935 unlike america denmark which was so badly hammered by the 1973 arab oil embargo that it banned all sunday driving for a while responded to that crisis in such a sustained focused and systematic way that today it is energy independent danes imposed on themselves a set of gasoline taxes co2 taxes and building and appliance efficiency standards that allowed them to grow their economy while barely growing their energy consumption and gave birth to a danish clean power industry that is one of the most competitive in the world today there is little whining here about denmark having 10 a gallon gasoline because of high energy taxes
2865936 in december 2009 the capital of denmark will host the 15th meeting of the conference of parties to the kyoto protocol better known as the un climate change summit the good news is that there may be no country in the world better prepared than denmark to play host to a climate summit that could just maybe decide the fate of the world with the signing of the post kyoto climate treaty as you leave copenhagens airport you see soaring wind turbines along the side of the road spinning in the nearly always present breeze get used to the sight denmark is a world leader in wind energy and produces more than 10 of its power from turbines the new ministry of climate and energy was formed last year to focus specifically on global warming and alternative energy with an eye toward preparing the way for denmarks leadership on climate change at the un summit and at home by further reducing its own carbon footprint but with americans obsessed over the price of gas but not rising global temperatures itll take real political leadership to from washington to make copenhagen a success

2865990 as a lifelong loyal democrat i am filing this complaint against the dnc because the road to social justice sometimes demands that our political family and friends be held accountable when they do not act for the common good respecting the democrats opportunity to regain the majority in both houses of congress i remained silent throughout the last year about my illegal termination and subsequent ongoing defamation from the dnc prior to filing this lawsuit i tried several times to settle this matter in a reasonable and professional manner but the dnc refused and continues to attempt to discredit me and my political opinions prior to my position at the dnc i worked for 10 years advocating for equality for the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender lgbt community when i was recruited by the dnc to serve as the director of its gay and lesbian leadership council i was told that my professional and activist background would be helpful to achieving governor deans goals once i joined the dnc however senior staff made it clear that they had no interest in lgbt equality instead democratic lgbt constituents and employees are treated as second class citizens whom the dnc tries to ignore unless fundraising is involved reducing the community to a little more than an atm as a dnc employee i tried to push the organization to treat the lgbt community with greater respect the dnc ultimately terminated me after my long term partner criticized the democrats lack of a strategy to combat anti gay ballot measures a critique made without my input and which the dnc recently admitted was accurate it is clear that the dnc fundraisers have no intention of ceasing their personal attacks against me their goal is to keep lgbt money flowing to the dnc no matter what for some if truth is not convenient they find it expendable for the cause they have spent time researching my political and charitable contributions and even claimed publicly that i was not a loyal democrat since i did not donate a part of my salary back to the party social justice is not for sale nor should it have to be bought the lgbt press has rightly criticized the dnc for its failure to recognize and promote basic human rights for the community rather than respond to legitimate questions about dnc policy and strategy impacting the lgbt community the dnc has retaliated against publications and former employees by attacking the messengers personally the dnc now has fewer openly gay and lesbian members than before the 2004 election this is not progress i expect my party to embody the democratic values of fairness and honesty it is important that the dnc be able to acknowledge its failings and live up to its promise to protect the human rights of the lgbt community as we move forward to help attain this goal i cannot remain silent on matters of policy and substance

2866016 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2866017 coming back to the table negotiations peace talks a political solution thats it easy to say very difficult to do
2866018 it is the most surreal world crisis i could ever imagine
2866019 it started with severe bombing with artillery and planes and helicopters our boys with their guns could do nothing
2866020 they bombed us so may times all the houses are destroyed on one street there is only one wall left
2866021 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war
2866022 weve got to get the job done there and that requires us to have enough troops so that were not just air raiding villages and killing civilians which is causing enormous pressure over there
2866023 kopf nach hinten einen nassen lappen in den nacken oder auf die stirn nee auf den nacken nicht den kopf nach hinten halten wie man ja oft das so denkt noch und ich glaube kaltes wasser mit kaltem wasser sp len das machen wir einen kalten lappen in den nacken kopf hinter und kalten lappen
2866024 bleiben sie ruhig setzen sie sich aufrecht hin und beugen sie den kopf nach vorne nicht nach hinten denn dann k nnte blut in den rachen laufen und fangen sie die bluttropfen mit einem taschentuch oder eventuell auch mit einer schale auf meist h rt nasenbluten von alleine wieder auf
2866025 wenn es nach einer halben stunde immer noch blutet sollten sie auf alle f lle einen arzt aufsuchen und lassen sie sich begleiten denn durch den blutverlust kann es zu kreislaufproblemen kommen und sie k nnten eventuell in ohnmacht fallen sie sollten auch dann zum arzt gehen wenn sie h ufiger nasenbluten haben ganz wichtig dass die ursache abgekl rt wird
2866026 das kann durch heizungsluft aber auch durch klimaanlagen entstehen aber auch durch heftiges schn uzen durch heuschnupfen und durch nasenbohren kann es zu nasenbluten kommen

2866028 it was an advantage to be more anxious in a dangerous environment
2866029 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety
2866030 still to identify the first candidates for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction
2866031 it might be possible to prescribe the right dose of the right drug relative to genetic makeup to treat anxiety disorders
2866032 we found one variant to be associated with weight and lean mass in both ethnic groups this variant was also associated with height total fat mass and hdl cholesterol but only in european american women a different variant was associated with triglyceride levels and hdl cholesterol in african american women

2866040 i wanted to be in bars finals really badly so when i fell i remember saying what am i doing on the floor
2866041 weve been over here a week training training training our team doctor said we were like a bunch of racehorses we were so ready to get out there we wanted to compete and i think everybody might have had some extra nerves
2866042 we dont want to dwell on the skills where mistakes were done because it may create a mental problem
2866043 we will do the routines that we have prepared for and then reinforce and try to build more confidence
2866044 we had kind of a sigh of relief like we didnt die its all good
2866045 its easier to deal with mistakes when youre in a better mood and you know how you can fix things

2866048 i was very disturbed in one of the places here in datu unsay because theres really quite number of young voters they came in truckloads i saw them and they were very young
2866049 for the next elections we should lobby for a new poll registration a general registration so we can get rid of these underage registrants these multi registrants
2866050 theres a very good turnout and there was no except for one report no untoward incidents involved and the turnout is very well
2866051 i dont have a full report yet on this mater but thats the only untoward incident that weve received but as ive said one life lost is too much still
2866052 so they said transfer but no escort but i was not very comfortable with that
2866053 there will not be enough time because of the swiftness of the transmission
2866054 if we didnt push through with this we wont be able to make it for 2010 at least we have a good pilot testing now

2866058 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2866059 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2866060 the additional cost of carrying unnecessary fuel adversely affects americans financial success
2866061 in this world of sin and sorrow there is always something to be thankful for as for me i rejoice that i am not a republican

2866070 i woke up to the sounds of blasts one after another
2866071 first i heard several blasts then i heard some gunshots one of my sons classmates who lives in another neighborhood even had a piece of a bomb fall on his doorstep
2866072 now i can see a lot of armed police patrolling on the plaza near my neighborhood
2866073 its happening now because of the olympics but i dont know who is doing it
2866074 at this time were focusing on the health and welfare of the guests involved in this tragic accident
2866075 i moved around on foot bicycle automobile tricycle what an odyssey
2866076 i love ben curtis a lot and i love the fact hes made the team
2866077 crable showed up in a couple different areas on special teams and against the run
2866078 he rushed it got an interception and jerod mayo the same thing
2866079 they really took the plays that we taught them and they practiced them and translated them over onto the field
2866080 im encouraged and glad they had the opportunity to play as much as they did
2866081 you only get a certain number before the preseason ends to show what you can do
2866082 when you have guys like mike vrabel and adalius thomas in front of you you have to make the coaches comfortable prove that if something happens to them you can perform
2866083 there were times when we looked good and times when we made mistakes and had a lack of aggressiveness
2866084 we were more physical up front then what weve seen in a little while
2866085 you could see a little confidence when we started out offensively
2866086 a couple young kids showed a little nervousness but as the game progressed they were getting used to the opponent and they were relying on what we talked about through the week
2866087 we were able to see some of our seniors step up and kind of take control of the team our team chemistry is pretty good
2866088 we have a new kicker and the kids have really accepted him it shows the type of kids that we have if theyre willing to work hard then they become a part of our football family
2866089 there were times when we had great initial contact but we just didnt finish its the kind of thing you can only simulate in game time decisions we need them attacking until the whistle and never giving up they need to have a high energy level whistle to whistle
2866090 we need to execute the way we know how to execute we need to increase intensity and physicalness from whistle to whistle
2866091 offensively we started slow the first 10 plays we didnt do well but when the adjustments were made then we were able to move the ball defensively we started off better then the offense we continued to get better as the game went on
2866092 there were a lot of positive things to come out of the scrimmage and the negatives that we saw on film are things that we can correct easily well do that monday when we show the film to the kids and then go out and practice those things the kids all gave great effort they hit and thats what we were really looking for they came off the ball well on both sides of the ball and we ran to the ball well on defense
2866093 ryan played defense last year and this year hes one of our wideouts
2866094 we have a pretty good group of receivers and we wanted to try to throw the ball some against massillon obviously they werent all deep passes but sometimes we were successful in establishing the short passing and sometimes we werent
2866095 michael is going to get more looks at fullback this season and we have a couple other kids there who didnt play who figure into the mix at that position
2866096 mike did a nice job for us and were very happy with that we also had some other kids step up for us and that was nice to see
2866097 whatever we didnt do right those are things that are correctable after looking at the film and get the kids back practicing
2866098 we were pretty vanilla on both sides of the ball and im sure massillon was as well
2866099 both teams just wanted to see who was going to run to the ball who was going to hit and who was going to be able to line up properly i thought we did a pretty good job of that on both sides of the ball
2866100 massillon is a pretty good football team no question and theyve got a lot of speed it was a really good scrimmage and it was nice for our kids to just get a chance to go against someone else after pounding on each other last week
2866101 les rappers sont arriv s et ont cr beaucoup de musiques sous mon influence
2866102 the plays were scripted so obviously we didnt come in game planning or anything
2866103 we just scripted our plays and ran them and ran a lot of kids in and out trying to evaluate them offensively and defensively i have an idea who i thought stood out and did some good things and obviously we did some bad things since it was our first live action i thought at the end our guys responded
2866104 we just lined up and played football with our defense we werent going to put anything in special for perrys wing t we just wanted to get our kids into a base formation which was solid and let them play you didnt see a lot of crazy stunts or anything like that we just wanted to watch our kids play next week when were in our preview down in columbus were going to let it all hang out
2866105 we gave up a bomb on third and 18 which is football awareness and as i talked to our kids about being football savvy in that situation
2866106 but then they come right back down and do a great goal line stand four straight plays from the 2 and we stopped them i was really proud of our defense and the way they responded
2866107 we actually made some adjustments in the game to how they were playing us on some of our run plays just to mix it up
2866108 they did some stuff we didnt even know what they were doing we kind of made some adjustments just based on the look they were giving us and our kids responded well
2866109 right now we just want to look at the film evaluate guys we had a couple of guys not playing tonight and a lot of our guys not out there the whole time we wanted to evaluate a lot of kids tonight and find out what their role is on this football team
2866110 i think the main issues is that a couple of times they didnt step into their throws but they both did some positive things
2866111 obviously sometimes it comes down to turnovers and stuff like that obviously were going to have to evaluate film and see what was going on and see what kind of pressure they were under when they were making throws
2866112 i was happy with both of them theyre both doing well i think were in a fortunate situation where we have two athletic guys i think there was a couple of times where they could have taken off running tonight in the future people are going to have to defend them when theyre running
2866113 j t s a guy who we know what were going to get from him athletically and stuff
2866114 a couple of those guys just need on the field experience in aaron white matt patterson

2866118 we are fortunate to be coming back to town at a time when a new wave of energy and desire is bubbling up in the retail community we are looking to capitalize on this force and to add to it with our hands on experience stemming from many different levels and roles within the industry we feel that there will be an enormous amount of support for jackson amp connor this spring
2866119 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2866120 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2866121 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2866122 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2866123 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2866124 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2866125 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2866169 war started today in south ossetia when georgia attacked russian peacekeepers in the disputed region
2866170 if its not war then we are very close to it the russians have invaded georgia and we are under attack
2866171 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2866172 this is a clear intrusion on another countrys territory we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight
2866173 about 1 400 people have died we will check these figures but the order of the numbers is around this we have this on the basis of reports from relatives
2866174 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2866175 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2866176 in accordance with the constitution and the federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2866177 we wont allow the death of our compatriots to go unpunished
2866178 most of south ossetias territory is liberated and is controlled by georgia
2866179 i want to acknowledge that several hours ago i as a supreme commander have issued a very painful order not to return fire in response to a very intensive shelling of georgian villages
2866180 despite our call for peace and a unilateral ceasefire separatists continued the shelling of georgian villages
2866181 we are forced to restore constitutional order in the whole region

2866190 in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same united states government that you aspire to lead and were talking about the attacks like the subprime mortgage that you spoke of that wasnt just a general ambiguous kind of phenomenon but a phenomenon that targets the african community and latino community attacks like the killing of sean bell by the new york police department and javon dawson right here in st petersburg by the st pete police and the jena six and hurricane katrina and the list goes on
2866191 in the face of all these attacks that are clearly being made on the african community why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community or black community in this country
2866192 i think youre misinformed when you say not one time
2866193 every issue youve spoken about i actually did speak out
2866194 ive been talking about predatory lending for the last two years in the united states senate and i worked to pass legislation to prevent it when i was in the state legislature and i have repeatedly said that many of the predatory loans that were made in the mortgage system did target african american and latino communities ive said that repeatedly
2866195 i was the first candidate to get out there and say this is wrong theres an injustice thats been done and we need to change it
2866196 when sean bell got shot i put out a statement immediately saying this is a problem so on each of these issues ive spoken out i may not have spoken out the way you may have wanted me to speak out which is fine applause what im suggesting is that on each of these issues that you mention i have spoken out and ive spoken out forcefully
2866197 obama is staking out a position to the right of not only populist john edwards but clinton as well
2866198 only obama has not called for a moratorium and interest rate freeze though he has been a proponent of mortgage fraud legislation in the senate he has remained silent on further financial regulations
2866199 on this day when we are outraged over the disparities of treatment in the criminal justice system in a time when in jena we are puzzled over by how it is that a schoolyard fight gets charged with attempted murder we wonder how it is scooter libby doesnt get any jailtime and youve got young men in a fight getting charged with attempted murder
2866200 obamas language was vastly stronger than it was two weeks ago when he was asked about the case in storm lake la obama appeared visibly uncomfortable by the question and said the teens appear to have been railroaded into a very difficult situation

2866203 truly it is one of the sweetest and most soul satisfying doctrines of the gospel it is also one of the great evidences of the divine mission of the prophet joseph smith in his day the fiery evangelists of christendom were thundering from their pulpits that the road to hell is paved with the skulls of infants not a span long because careless parents had neglected to have their offspring baptized joseph smiths statements as recorded in the book of mormon and latter day revelation came as a refreshing breeze of pure truth little children shall be saved thanks be to god for the revelations of his mind where these innocent and pure souls are concerned

2866212 not only are many many australians on low levels of income they are on these low levels for a long period of time
2866213 what this demonstrates to us is that its very important that we get the maximum rate of income support at a level that enables people to have a reasonable standard of living
2866214 we understand that money will need to be spent but its important that we get this right because such a significant number of people are dependent on these pensions
2866215 that really is a matter that will be worked through in the first instance by the review as they make assessments about the best way forward

2866218 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2866219 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
2866220 we must find the means for an immediate ceasefire accepted by both sides we must talk about negotiations and a political solution there is no military solution

2866230 possibly gilman ought not to have studied so hard non euclidean calculus and quantum physics are enough to stretch any brain and when one mixes them with folklore and tries to trace a strange background of multi dimensional reality behind the ghoulish hints of the gothic tales and the wild whispers of the chimney corner one can hardly expect to be wholly free from mental tension

2866254 this is a very exciting study because we were looking at a drug called dimebon that has the potential to be a much better treatment for alzheimers than we have right now
2866255 oh it was awful because to see a person that for maybe five minutes shes lucid and would talk to you then all of a sudden shes gone
2866256 its sort of like a band aid the drugs that are out there now this one would actually be not a cure of course but it would actually potentially halt some of the progression of the disease
2866257 the study is a six month study where its placebo controlled so subjects could be taking the placebo or they could be taking the drug dimebon in one of two different doses
2866258 its a big deal because on both sides of the family we have alzheimers so myself and my three siblings we are potentially good candidates to have some sort of dementia later on in life

2866421 and a portable box in everyones cubicle so that rivers could pick up and listen to the call it was very confusing at times because we had to stop listening to the person on the phone and listen to him
2866422 this is name of caller with the equal opportunity affairs department of core who is the owner or president there now
2866423 the matter of which i am calling is of a very sensitive nature and i am not at liberty to go into detail with anyone but the owner or president may i have his name so i may address him properly please
2866424 they ended the call they didnt want to be bothered but for those who stayed on the line we were told to say this was a civic matter a lot of people interpreted civic for civil and thought it was a legal matter
2866425 were asking you to make a decision not from your company policy but form sic your heart those in need dont know about boards committees or company policies they depend upon people like you and me who are concerned enough about them to make decisions so will you support core with the dollars the procedure is first we send you a pledge invoice and our letter of thanks and of course your beautiful patron membership certificate ok
2866426 the reason for the call is were setting up cores annual patron membership drive and i want to bring you up to date about your status with core ok ill tell you whats happened here our people in the field receive recommendations as well as complaints about the fair hiring practices and attitudes of companies in many areas across the country im happy to report that we have received no complaints about you or your company we hope this means that youre in full compliance in letter but most importantly in spirit
2866427 they were using the race card to hustle money from people
2866428 these guys are bitter they will use whatever means are at their command to destroy us
2866429 core has no functioning chapters it holds no conventions no elections no meetings sets no policies has no social programs and does no fund raising in my opinion core is fraudulent
2866430 were very proud of it we talk about our program a lot

2866443 james farmer the leader of core during the highpoint of the civil rights movement was a bright dedicated activist of unimpeachable integrity his immediate successor roy innis was seen as a chameleon prepared to change his political ideology as necessary there were rumors that he worked in later years as an fbi informant
2866444 you have the kind of principles this country needs more of

2866463 the passing of our great poet mahmoud darwish the lover of palestine the pioneer of the modern palestinian cultural project and the brilliant national leader will leave a great gap in our political cultural and national lives
2866464 words cannot describe the depth of sadness in our hearts mahmoud may god help us for your loss
2866465 h e translated the pain of the palestinians in a magical way he made us cry and made us happy and shook our emotions apart from being the poet of the palestinian wound which is hurting all arabs and all honest people in the world he is a master poet

2866472 this stamp is not recorded in any of the philatelic literature so for serious collectors it is like stumbling across a hitherto unknown find
2866473 interest will be high and the bidding is likely to be intense
2866474 i was horrified to learn that he hadnt been contacted about the change in arrangements
2866475 ive apologised and weve had a good discussion about that
2866476 so the vast majority of older australians are on the pension and a very very significant number of these people have very small additional amounts of private income as well as the pension
2866477 most pensioners also have very low levels of assets in fact 30 per cent report having bank balances of less than 1 000
2866478 our argument is that the fixed costs people face in terms of rent and utilities makes that quite inequitable
2866479 prices are rising inflation is an issue mr rudd had the opportunity to address pensions in the budget and he chose not to do so
2866480 mr rudd has the money he has the massive surplus delivered to him by many years of sound economic management by john howard and peter costello and he chose to forget the pensioners
2866481 weve been standing up and fighting for pensioners and retirees in opposition as we did in government
2866482 the benefits and the bonuses to superannuation all the measures taken under the howard years were designed to deliver better benefits for pensioners and older australians
2866483 mr rudd is the one who forgot pensioners in the budget and he is the one that should be answerable for it
2866484 it is more about weakness in other economies in the eurozone for instance
2866485 there was nothing really in the statement to confirm a 50 basis point cut come september when the rba meets
2866486 it is a bit of a relief rally for the aussie dollar
2866487 the rba appears to be turning more concerned about the prospects for growth in the developing economies china and india after they had been recently very upbeat about prospects there
2866488 the resources sector is dragging the market down but thats to be expected as metal prices were softer overnight
2866489 the banks are all higher but the market is still sceptical about the rally
2866490 gori is being bombed massively from the air and from artillery as well
2866491 are not there yet but it looks like they are getting ready for it
2866492 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2866493 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
2866494 we must find the means for an immediate ceasefire accepted by both sides we must talk about negotiations and a political solution there is no military solution
2866495 they were on a mass scale and were directed against individuals
2866496 lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia
2866497 we are here to continue recovering natural resources and the consolidation of nationalization
2866498 my big dream is to have unity among the bolivian people
2866499 they will either talk more in the language of de facto secession or start to negotiate
2866500 even if the government is strengthened it has to negotiate there is no other option
2866501 i like him as a captain as a player and as a leader
2866502 on my first day in the job he came to my office and said gaffer i am john terry i replied dont worry i know all about you he is the captain of the team and very important for us
2866503 pre season has been good actually it has been very different
2866504 under jose we never did any running but with scolari we have had our trainers on and done 1 000 metres which is similar to the former managers gianluca vialli and claudio ranieri style of thinking
2866505 and i feel great we are feeling good we are looking good and we are preparing well
2866506 there is a name every day that is the nature of the business
2866507 i cant answer it because ive not got a direct answer
2866508 its possible we could sign someone this week we are trying weve got one or two options we are looking at and hopefully we can get something done before the start of the season
2866509 it has been pressing since the end of last season we like to operate with four strikers and we have not been able to do that
2866510 rio is now the best centre half in the world by far
2866511 that was an exemplary performance he did not give one foul away and intercepted every ball that came towards him
2866512 he broke out of defence in comfort so many times it was unbelievable he is a magnificent player
2866513 he is 30 now and because he has experience his potential is now being fulfilled in a big way
2866514 i was down and he stamped on me i thought he could have avoided me there was no need for it that was why i reacted and why i grabbed his leg
2866515 we came here with just 18 players and we know we are going to need a bigger squad because of the extra demands on the uefa cup which is new ground for us
2866516 it is going to take a lot for players to play saturday thursday sunday but we have to be competitive
2866517 kaboul should help hes a been a long term target of the manager hes only 22 and is coming to a good place to learn with sol campbell and sylvain distin
2866518 this regulator has been of interest to researchers and clinicians for many years now because its controller or receptor found on the surface of blood cells is critical in regulating their many functions
2866519 because our discovery shows precisely what the receptor looks like and also how it works we can now begin to design new drugs to rein in the deadly abnormal blood cells
2866520 abnormal gm csf signalling is pivotal to a variety of serious and difficult to treat diseases
2866521 with this discovery rational design of targeted therapies can now be accelerated greatly
2866522 importantly on the inflation outlook which should be the key focus the rba has pushed up inflation for 08 and 09 without lowering the forecast for 2010
2866523 so the inflation outlook has deteriorated according to the rba which is a significant shift
2866524 it makes it less likely they are going to go half a point there was some talk in the markets they were going to cut a half point in september but i think that looks unlikely from this statement
2866525 there seems to be some tempering effect through this statement yes the reserve bank is getting towards a less restrictive monetary policy but it may not quite be in the time span or size that the market is anticipating
2866526 i think a november cut is more likely than in september and its more likely to be 25 points
2866527 the rba has stuck to the script they laid out last week they talked about conditions emerging that would allow a less restrictive stance
2866528 but they hedge their bets a little with inflation and it is not clear that inflation has peaked so a lot of this interest rate speculation is based on prospective developments rather than the evidence
2866529 im not sure that this adds to the case for a september cut and i dont think it adds to the case for 50 rather than 25 basis points but the trend will be to lower rates over the next few months
2866530 the rba are having a bet both ways here they have increased their inflation forecast but revised down their gdp forecast they say there is still scope to cut rates i dont think theres a material change to the general tone we got in the most recent monthly statement but its certainly a little more dovish than the last quarterly statement no changes on the timings for an interest rate cut were still looking for september
2866531 he was struck down with an ankle injury early in the game and played the whole game with injections so to kick that goal just before three quarter time was just exceptional
2866532 i just thought its been a pretty rough three weeks for him i just thought that playing on despite his injury is the effort required
2866533 sometimes its not about kicks marks and handballs its what you do for the team
2866534 the resolve of the group was very good today to be able to hold the bulldogs off and come out in front it was very good
2866535 weve worked a lot for this objective usually in competitions of this type you never feel you are 100 per cent but well have to do everything possible to be near to it
2866536 everyone knows what the level of football is in the czech republic something which was also seen at the european championships
2866537 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage

2866543 we can rise together and form a new kind of government
2866544 we will pledge to return to core moral principles like stewardship service to others personal responsibility shared sacrifice and shared opportunity for everybody
2866545 we believe that quality and affordable health care is a basic right
2866546 we believe that covering all is not just a moral imperative but is necessary to making our health system workable and affordable
2866547 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance
2866548 demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all

2866581 the man who has never wrestled with his early faith the faith that he was brought up with and that yet is not truly his own for no faith is our own that we have not arduously won has missed not only a moral but an intellectual discipline the absence of that discipline may mark a man for life and render all his work ineffective he has missed a training in criticism in analysis in open mindedness in the resolutely impersonal treatment of personal problems which no other training can compensate he is for the most part condemned to live in a mental jungle where his arm will soon be too feeble to clear away the growths that enclose him and his eyes too weak to find the light

2866601 but we are of one view on the issue before this court the fccs new indecent policy overreaches the agencys statutory and constitutional authority
2866602 we have been dismayed by a series of recent decisions that have transformed a hitherto moderate policy of policing only the most extreme cases of indecent broadcast programming into a campaign of regulatory surveillance that will chill the production of all but the blandest of broadcast programming unless the fccs current indecency enforcement policy is halted it will greatly curtail live broadcasts of virtually any event it will also unbalance competition in media by imposing far more stringent content rules on one group of competitors broadcasters than on other media and for no compelling policy reason

2866637 you know id really like to talk to a man can i talk to a man
2866638 now it is not by any means to be supposed that the good angels were confirmed by the fall of the evil but by their own merit for as the good if they had sinned with the evil would have been condemned together with them so the unrighteous had they remained steadfast with the just would have been equally confirmed in grace for if some of them were to be confirmed only by the fall of others either none would ever be confirmed or it would be necessary that one should fall who should be punished for the sake of the confirmation of the others both of which are absurd
2866639 so therefore when the angel had the power of depriving himself of righteousness and did not so deprive himself and had the power of causing himself not to be righteous and did not so cause himself he is rightly asserted to have given himself his own righteousness and to have made himself righteous in this way therefore has he his righteousness from himself for a creature can in no other way have it from himself and on that account is he to be praised for his righteousness and he is righteous not from necessity but from free will since that is improperly termed necessity in which there is neither compulsion nor prohibition
2866640 what do you say of god who cannot sin and yet he did not merit this by having had the power of sinning and not sinning is not he to be praised for his righteousness
2866641 horton if i recall is all concerned about protecting christs merit i dont see how that can fail to be proper merit without denying the absolute necessity of christs work there is a history of doing so among some of the reformed but i think it is now largely resisted and should be
2866642 for as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous
2866643 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god

2866752 when i made woman she had to be special i made her shoulders strong enough to carry the weight of the world yet gentle enough to give comfort i gave her an inner strength to endure childbirth and the rejection that many times comes from her children i gave her a hardness that allows her to keep going when everyone else gives up and take care of her family through sickness and fatigue without complaining i gave her sensitivity to love her children under any and all circumstances even when her child has hurt her badly this same sensitivity helps her make a childs boo boo feel better and share in her teenagers anxieties and fears i gave her strength to carry her husband through his faults and fashioned her from his rib to protect his heart i gave her wisdom to know that a good husband never hurts his wife but sometimes test her strengths and her resolve to stand beside him unfalteringly and finally i gave her a tear to shed this is hers exclusively to use whenever it is needed

2866758 our performances are more about the art of burlesque we try to stay true to what burlesque was back in its heyday the sometimes frilly sometimes shiny and always sexy burlesque costumes help turn back the clock and bring back the pin up era if only during the performances whether its a fan dance a snake charmer skit a holiday inspired routine or the classic shimmy vintage burlesque groups like babes in sin are the intelligent alternative to the modern girls gone wild burlesque has more visual foreplay and as cha cha pictured right notes
2866759 for me its been great being part of this troupe has really done a lot for me i have an outlet to be creative though my choreography and costume design i really have fun with my numbers i try to add a little humor or a trick to my performances i am also know to twirl my tassel like no other

2866763 for all of the last century the profit motive basically led in one direction toward machines methods and industries that used oil and gas
2866764 enormous good came from that industrial growth and we are all the beneficiaries of the national prosperity it built but there were costs we werent counting and often hardly noticed and these terrible costs have added up now in the atmosphere in the oceans and all across the natural world
2866765 i go with my best friend summer who is also in the show with me we go to places like bebe bebe sport charlotte rouse and guess we just like to go try on clothes and sometimes buy matching stuff we usually go get something to eat too

2866773 your performance tonight exceeded my expectations it was such a special evening
2866774 inside every empowered woman is a pussycat doll purring and hissing her way out they have that special kind of confidence every woman can understand what that means and live that philosophy every day every woman wants to be sexy and feel sexy its all about a girl who is very confident and loves to get dressed up like a doll not trashy or slutty but somebody who everyday whether walking down the street or going to the store just owns it with attitude and empowerment a pussycat doll gets up on stage and performs with that same confidence that every woman can have with the same feeling and same vibe about owning every day owning your womanhood its easier today for women to seize this empowerment and enjoy it it wasnt so easy in years gone by because they had to hide and cover up their strengths and just show weakness thank goodness times have changed and weve now got that power
2866775 in the pussycat dolls lounge everything is carefully choreographed but in the casino i didnt just want a go go dancer without dance training you can make go go dancing look so much better if you have that training its the same kind of girl but in the pit they have to provide a theatrical performance at the same time as the dancing i am really happy with them theyre energetic appealing and sexy in my wildest dreams i never would have imagined us being part of a casino its so incredible their outfits in the gaming pit pictured above are not exactly the same as in the lounge i designed uniform styled outfits that are just as sexy but somewhat different and now we will be selling merchandise and pcd lingerie inspired by those costumes
2866776 pure already is home to the las vegas pussycat dolls lounge and now this casino is the final part of a dream come true i began the pussycat dolls 12 years ago but only dreamed about opening a casino the last few years you always think something could go wrong and its not going to happen but honestly everything was completely smooth with this venture my partners at caesars and pure were great and i cant believe we are actually here this is such a new chapter in my life and the life of the dolls incidentally our tv show search for the next pussycat doll premieres on tuesday in the tv show we use all our vegas casino fun stuff to tie in with the show a lot of the lingerie will start in the pit and lead to the lounge and then to your own home
2866777 were tackling that competition head on its the same demographic and with a nightclub on the gaming floor weve got them beat these are just beautiful women they are not being suggestive or vulgar we watch that very carefully and dancing up a storm theyre even sexier with their clothes still on the reaction is incredible its far more than we ever expected the energy and excitement is terrific and everybody male and female young and old enjoys and welcomes their special brand of glitz and glamour we had our soft opening back on super bowl weekend and its just gone from strength to strength the numbers are really solid our dealers have great personalities and upbeat positive attitudes its become another must see attraction at caesars this has been such a big success leading up to tonights official celebrity opening that were now going to expand the 9pm 4am hours and start from noon everyday right throughout march madness well then keep the pussycats casino open much longer than we have been
2866778 im for senator clinton but i think the great likelihood is that obama will be the nominee
2866779 as soon as i determine when that is ill send him a check
2866780 i welcome the muslim worlds accurate perception that i am interested in opening up dialogue and interested in moving away from the unilateral policies of george bush but nobody should mistake that for a softer stance when it comes to terrorism or when it comes to protecting israels security or making sure that the alliance is strong and firm
2866781 you will not see under my presidency any slackening in commitment to israels security
2866782 i will be a candidate for the presidency of the united states and it is precisely to give the american people a voice to give them a meaningful choice so that they do not have to once again go into the polling booth on the first tuesday after the first monday in november hold their nose and pull a lever or touch one of those magical touch screens that seem to be so much in vogue now and vote for the lesser of two evils america deserves better
2866783 anybody who stands at the foundation of their domestic agenda mccain feingold to me can not ever lay legitimate claim at least with a straight face to calling themselves or being labeled as a conservative
2866784 i might not be important to them but they are important to me let me take this chance and prove myself
2866785 what if i am so what if i am not so what if i am taken off the current status i have right now why do i think that i need to be better doing better things elsewhere why not i concentrate on what i am involved in right now am i not believing in the fact that whatever i have got to do is directly connected with the current profession i am in now dont i have the belief that actions speak better and sharper than reading learning writing etc

2866818 the chinese people are becoming more aware of their human rights and more conscious of the law they can use
2866819 the performance was wonderful and the performers were beautiful we liked the drumming very much it gave people an impression of being upright the show is marvelous for everyone and the world divine performing arts clearly presents a positive message
2866820 the performers are so talented through listening to the music and with my understanding of the lyrics projected on the rear screen i could feel its inner meanings
2866821 the scene that touched me the most was the one with the little girl when the girl and her mother held a banner reading truthfulness compassion forbearance and the people surrounding them stood up to stop the police it was the most touching part for me the message it conveys is that if people can stand up against injustice their power will become strong
2866822 its really unbelievable that the chinese communist party does not want to see divine performing arts staged in china why are they so scared its incredible
2866823 we will definitely come to see the divine performing arts performance with our family and friends next year

2866837 when someone is in your life for a reason it is usually to meet a need you have expressed outwardly or inwardly
2866838 i think its fine to get other peoples opinions but when the external feedback becomes too distracting and overwhelming its time to turn inward and upward
2866839 if you could just let other moms know that this can happen i would at least feel somewhat victorious instead of feeling like such a victim

2866872 he hadnt been chief minister very long and that in itself was a difficulty because his record in office was quite short
2866873 a lot of people were probably quite upset by the timing of the election they werent convinced by the reason the chief minister gave

2866881 but according to indian laws a single father cannot adopt a girl child this is the major legal hassle arising in this case
2866882 but the question is when the child has 50 percent of its fathers dna where does the point arise of him having to adopt the child as he is her natural father

2866892 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2866893 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2866894 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2866895 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2866896 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2866897 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2866898 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2866899 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2866900 i never want to be finished or complete until i reach heaven

2866913 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hard core family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2866914 one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have
2866915 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2866916 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather
2866917 i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
2866918 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2866919 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2866920 he was just so alive i cant believe hes gone
2866921 it was such a popular show because of his bigger than life persona
2866922 race and class while lifting viewers with laughter compassion and cool
2866923 its great to be selected and a relief this will be my third olympic games and i believe it will be my best by a long way in the last few years ive been riding better than ever and i believe i will produce a personal best performance at these games
2866924 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is
2866925 at some point in our lives you have to have some sort of accountability i cant see how people in my situation deny that
2866926 to know how truly sorry i am and i am willing to pay
2866927 i need to pay back i cant pay back monetarily this is the way
2866928 today extremism in afghanistan and pakistan has turned into an irresolvable dilemma even for those who helped develop the ideology

2866930 i had searched the internet to find a cool community to publish my works
2866931 ive been working on this art for some time and have been a burroughs fan since college when i read naked lunch
2866932 as many writers and artists who study burroughs know its common knowledge that the beat generation was led by him
2866933 there quite possibly would never have been books like on the road by jack kerouac who was a very close friend of burroughs
2866934 hes a true legend and its only in the last decade that hes really getting the recognition he deserves
2866935 what compelled rosaleen to spit on the three mens shoes what does it take for a person to stand up with conviction against brutalizing injustice what do you like best about rosaleen

2866940 should any of these banners become detached the results could be deadly for anyone on the roadway below
2866941 as such it would seem that at minimum there would be special permitting and safety measures required before any group was allowed to dangle large objects over a public roadway is there anything in city or state law regulating this type of practice
2866942 if not is it legal for anyone to simply hang whatever they please over a highway
2866943 and if there is code that regulates this sort of activity who is charged with enforcement and why is it not being enforced is there a political agenda in local government that discourages enforcement due to the content of the activists message
2866944 mindful of the u s constitutions first amendment protection of free speech the city has reviewed this issue in the past and is aware of the practice at this location no permit is required as the banners in this instance are not being affixed to the overpass but rather are being held
2866945 is merely cautious in granting permits to affix anything to public property we are careful not to be seen as an advocate of a cause or product and dont want the responsibility for installation or maintenance
2866946 we would look to the police to investigate and assign potential blame
2866947 for signage that might intrude into the right of way
2866948 those are reviewed for compliance with safety guidelines prior to being issued a permit if the activity violates the law then it would be a matter for the police
2866949 particularly at rush hour the eastbound cars on northeast 50th try to make a right on red southbound onto the i 5 entrance ramp the westbound cars attempting to make a left onto the southbound i 5 entrance ramp have a green arrow but often the eastbound cars making their right on red take that right of way i propose a red right arrow on eastbound northeast 50th street during the time that the westbound left arrow is green
2866950 unless accompanied by a sign prohibiting a right turn on red it is legal for motorists to turn right on a red arrow after coming to a stop and making certain there is not a traffic conflict
2866951 restricting a right turn on red at all times would unnecessarily impede traffic during less busy times of the day
2866952 we like the idea of restricting turns during high volume times of travel and we are investigating signage that will allow us to do so
2866953 we believe it is safer to go around to the right and recommend drivers do so however we recognize that there are instances when drivers may need to turn left before a traffic circle such as when cars park too closely to the right side of a circle or a driver cant maneuver a larger vehicle around to the right this practice can be safely performed when the driver exercises reasonable care
2866954 once upon a time there was a man named daniel

2866969 the temples of angkor are the heart and soul of the cambodian nation and remain a source of pride and inspiration to all khmers as they struggle to rebuild their lives after the years of terror and trauma the majestic monuments of angkor built between the 9th and 13th centuries when the khmer civilsation was at the height of its extraordinary creativity constitute one of humanitys most audacious architectural achievements

2866978 i hear you we never really used it but it was good to know we could have had we wanted to still were moving to a city where we can have a different set of things like that
2866979 well have you ever looked at the back of the philly city paper there are ads there where you can pay people to come and torture your balls if you want or shove a bull whip in your bum or otherwise do whatever kind of kink youre into
2866980 it is kind of like the adirondacks i mean i never intend to call anyone to torture my junk or whip me or whatever but a part of me really likes knowing that it is there that theres enough weirdness and randomness and crazy humanity to sustain this stuff even if i never use it
2866981 and more importantly you can get vegan chinese food at 2 in the morning if you want it

2867053 there were corners we were better than him just not in the right spots we could never get close enough to get an opportunity like marcus said you can dive bomb a guy and probably make something happen but that wasnt the right way we never really close enough to make it right
2867054 i thought yesterday was great but when i would up there on that red flag i realized where i was
2867055 so i just tried to stay clean as best i could and pass cars cleanly and just pick away at it i really had no idea where i was until the last pit stops when we cycled through about sixth place im so proud of the wood brothers giving me a piece that i could really get out there and give it my best
2867056 i was happy we had a good car and we learned a lot at the saturday nationwide race
2867057 i lost a lot of foot brakes as the race got going and the car got real tight the splitter was on the ground a little bit too much but that did foil our strategy
2867058 my team worked really hard we had a good car we were fast in practice lead some of the race just ran out of car strategy got messed up there at the end we should have done something different but i dont know
2867059 we probably lost about 15 seconds on that probably 20 seconds total because there were guys coming in to pit earlier and we needed to pit
2867060 steve crew chief letarte was trying to tell me to pit and i had no idea
2867061 we just had a loose connection and finally they black flagged me but even when i was out there i was trying to fix it and i lost even more time doing that we finally got in there and shoot we came out and we were like 30th the car was a struggle already and the last thing we needed was to lose that much track position
2867062 its the type of track i have a little experience at
2867063 i tested there once in a busch east car i think it would be cool if we do that ill get both races sprint and nationwide in well just have to see it definitely would be fun
2867064 i kind of like the bigger tracks a little bit more than the short tracks nashvilles pretty cool kentuckys cool i kind of have more fun with those i like something new to me and thats sort of why i like them a little bit more to be honest its two different types of racing theyre both fun racings racing
2867065 if you can handle me you will reap great sexual rewards but boy be careful what you wish for
2867066 the pitch was just enough to where i could still get a jump on everybody thats perfect for a power rider like me
2867067 aug 11 bloomberg crude oil gained in new york on concern oil supplies from the caspian sea may be disrupted should the conflict in georgia escalate
2867068 its the start of something that can be great weve been waiting for years for this moment
2867069 i dont know how many people were watching the game but it was an honour to play in it
2867070 we were all excited and anxious this game was over the top
2867071 but we have a saying back home that when youre good you play for the name on the front of your jersey instead of the name on the back our guys all play for the name on the front of their jersey
2867072 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
2867073 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past
2867074 in 1908 denver was trying to have it both ways
2867075 i think thats part of our civic psychology its deep in our civic dna
2867076 were trying to show off the kind of flavor of what the west has to offer
2867077 its like monty python where all the characters seem to know whats going on you dont but its funny anyway

2867079 the committee recommends that the special facility for passport applications forwarded by members of the oireachtas should be retained
2867080 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
2867081 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
2867082 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
2867083 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
2867084 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
2867085 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
2867086 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
2867087 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
2867088 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
2867089 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
2867090 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
2867091 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
2867092 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
2867093 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
2867094 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
2867095 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

2867114 russian ground troops armed invasion has already transformed into a full scale occupation of parts of georgian territory the process of extermination of georgian population and annihilation of georgias statehood is in full swing
2867115 what legal terms can be used to describe what has been done by the georgian leadership can we use ethnic cleansing for example when about one third of the population of south ossetia left it during several days and went north risking their lives is it ethnic cleansing or not now when 2 000 is killed out of the total population of 100 000 is it genocide or not how many civilians must die before we describe it as genocide
2867116 acs sees only risks and no opportunities for convenience stores from scores on the doors
2867117 convenience stores are low risk businesses and we strongly believe that consumers will not use the rating system to make choices about where to shop it is a waste of local authority resources to extend the scheme to low risk premises given the strong potential for confusion about what a score relates to premises with low scores could be unfairly judged by the public who may mistakenly believe that the store is in some way unsafe even though the store is fully compliant with food hygiene law
2867118 we support the foods standards agency taking action to harmonise the various sotds schemes that have been operating across the country this is important because right now there are numerous different schemes operating around the country run by individual local authorities many of which include convenience stores this is a burden on businesses and is highly confusing for authorities businesses and consumers alike

2867140 apparently since scott is no longer on staff at uni he doesnt feel the need to look at both sides of an issue anymore and search for a fair correct answer
2867141 wait scott theyre not angry no they just like to insult and demean come up with borderline racist taunting catchphrases and whip up contempt in their base for certain demographics of people but see theyre not angry theyre just having fun
2867142 scott you might be going a bit to far comparing us conservatives to the nut case in tn
2867143 i wish to thank the courier for this editorial it has some explanations for the anger of the radical right that i had not contemplated before
2867144 if anyone doubts that those on the hard right are angry then go over to the responses to prof
2867145 it should be pointed out too that there is a semantical element to this notion the hardright may not recognize their feelings as anger which will invariably have them defensive about this issue
2867146 wow scott apparently has no clue as to what conservatism is all about
2867147 wow scott apparently has no clue as to what conservatism is all about to equate a nutjob who kills people to the entire conservative movement is nothing short of defamation
2867148 finally the hard right knows what theyre against liberals progressives big government gays who want to get married gun control advocates diversity lovers pro immigrant amnesty seekers equal opportunity pushers atheists agnostics secular humanists professors and intellectuals just using any of these phrases or terms will call forth vitriol and ridicule borne of anger but what do they stand for small government wholesome entertainment man woman marriage america always yet these seem unreachable indefinable or no longer relevant damn thats maddening eh cons

2867152 we have their phone numbers but we havent been able to reach them these are people we know and we are all hoping for their success
2867153 the military bases where we trained the soldiers are practically gone the russians have been bombing them over the past few days
2867154 the bases where we trained the forces were not in the areas of conflict but its not a huge country and the russians are bombing bases in central georgia and in the area of the capital tbilisi
2867155 it looked interesting relative to israel the money was excellent too
2867156 there was an atmosphere of war about to break out we received basic background about tensions between georgia and russia but most of what i learned came from talking to the soldiers from my point of view the battles of the past few days were to be expected
2867157 israel ziv and gal hirsch would come from time to time and watch us in action but we managed day to day operations ourselves
2867158 its not the standard we know in israel but when we left them they were at a good level they took the training very seriously there is a wider age range than in israel from 18 to 35 but they function very well over the past few days ive been following the news and i think they grasped a little of how to use strategy like we taught them it looks like we did a good job
2867159 we taught them counterterror and house to house fighting but that was very basic
2867160 i dont think the georgians would start fighting as long as the israeli forces where there
2867161 once when tension was high after russia shot down a drone we were evacuated to tbilisi
2867162 we were at some of the soldiers homes for dinner theyre very emotional and warm and tried to compare the situation in israel to their situation they were very excited that we had come to help them
2867163 when we found ourselves in a similar situation we expected the world to act differently

2867172 when people tell me that im crazy to work for others i remind them that not all gain can be stored in a bank i tell them that i cant live in this country with a clear conscience unless im working to make it better i tell them that people i know are directly affected and i want this world to be better for both them and for my fellow humans i tell them that the feeling i get as i realize that im changing things is a rush

2867268 inflation has reached 4 5 per cent yet paramedics are being offered annual increases of 3 25 per cent basically theyre being offered a pay cut how can they accept that mr mcghie said in a statement
2867269 some way down the track if members were not offered something they were happy with they might stop billing patients and stop filling out paperwork
2867270 certainly i would think in the next four to five weeks if there has been little progress i think were left with no choice but to go to the industrial relations commission and mount a case for putting industrial action to a ballot of our members he said
2867271 the ultimate action would be stop work action if it got to a serious point
2867272 why wont america and nato help us if they wont help us now why did we help them in iraq
2867273 a true friend is someone who lets you have total freedom to be yourself and especially to feel or not feel whatever you happen to be feeling at the moment is fine with them thats what real love amounts to letting a person be who they really are
2867274 blessed are they who hunger and thirst for justice for they shall be fiilled
2867275 then what are you doing about it physician heal thyself may he who is without blame cast the first stone
2867276 therefore if you are presenting your offering at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you leave your offering there before the altar and go first be reconciled to your brother and then come and present your offering
2867277 what i tell you in darkness that speak ye in light and what ye hear in the ear that preach ye upon the housetops
2867278 there is no water no light no bread no gas nothing its a nightmare
2867279 i think the best way we can honor them at this juncture is the only thing we can do and that is to go out and compete everyday and play hard everyday and enjoy and love the game of volleyball
2867280 you know you cant live in fear or anger about what happened
2867281 all you can do is send your prayers and sympathies to the family and try to continue what hugh would want us to do and thats try to win a gold medal
2867282 aku bukan anak kecil yang bermain main dengan pohon lagi
2867283 aku ingin sekali memiliki mainan tapi aku tak punya uang untuk membelinya

2867288 duh maaf aku tak punya kapal tapi kau boleh memotong batang tubuhku dan menggunakannya untuk membuat kapal yang kau mau pergilah berlayar dan bersenang senanglah
2867289 tak apa aku pun sudah tak memiliki gigi untuk mengigit buah apelmu
2867290 aku juga tak memiliki batang dan dahan yang bisa kau panjat
2867291 aku benar benar tak memiliki apa apa lagi yang bisa aku berikan padamu yang tersisa hanyalah akar akarku yang sudah tua dan sekarat ini
2867292 oooh bagus sekali tahukah kau akar akar pohon tua adalah tempat terbaik untuk berbaring dan beristirahat mari marilah berbaring di pelukan akar akarku dan beristirahatlah dengan tenang
2867293 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time said robert helman said on ctv
2867294 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
2867295 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2867296 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community

2867298 you couldnt stage a realistic rehearsal of an evacuation because people are not going to panic appropriately
2867299 as fine a book as one will find on the subject
2867300 fascinating thrilling zimmer has produced a top notch work of popular science
2867301 among the joyous heartless ever juvenile eternities pip saw the multitudinous god omnipresent coral insects that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs he saw gods foot upon the treadle of the loom and spoke it and therefore his shipmates called him mad
2867302 i claim that i never put together such an odious mixture of bad grammar and delirium tremens in my life
2867303 was the ford pinto with all its imperfections revealed in crash tests not designed
2867304 to take the concept of complexity and imply it is a result of the toolkit of nature rather than from the spoken word of the creator
2867305 the truth of the origins of species genetic diversity and design in all living things in the book of genesis
2867306 how factual are statements that have words such as presumably may may have think kind of yet to determine and probably
2867307 zimmer has suggested the transition of fly larva to man with the only evidence being that we have nearly identical genes for some structures
2867308 we knew that some fish in the middle devonian 375 million years ago were experimenting with their fins in ways that would allow for the evolution of the weight bearing structure of tetrapod limbs
2867309 how do they know fish are capable of experimenting what has science come to
2867310 i think it is the worst i ever saw and yet the french are called a polished nation if i had a boy that put sentences together as they do i would polish him to some purpose
2867311 certainty took me a much much longer time to shake off i think the humble attitude of uncertainty is sciences strongest weapon in this fight crap there i go myself with the war metaphors
2867312 how do they know fish are capable of experimenting what has science come to
2867313 a crisis fueled by increased enforcement and detention bad or non existent lawyering for immigrants facing deportation as well as overwhelmed immigration judges and appeal judges
2867314 decried the huge and growing gap in the rule of law
2867315 there are studies out there which would suggest that people who sleep less over long periods of time are at much higher risks of car accidents and also some medical disorders like high blood pressure potentially heart or stroke disease
2867316 they are called the energy pod and the alpha pod the alpha pod has more of a spa experience feel to it
2867317 to have a designated place to be able to come and take a nap and relax away from the office and not being afraid somebodys going walk in on you is nice
2867318 and you get on the ball quicker after the nap instead of feeling like youre exhausted
2867319 initially i was skeptical youre paying for something that you can do at home for free but it wasnt until i actually tried it and realized the difference
2867320 for people who are chronically sleep deprived there is evidence that as little as 15 to 30 minutes of napping during the day can improve performance for two to four hours after the nap
2867321 its ridiculous to assume that a 15 to 20 minute nap during the day even if its every day is going to compensate for a two hour deficit each night
2867322 this time we were able to drill into layers representing the period between five and 12 million years ago
2867323 the ice caps are substantially more mobile and sensitive than we had assumed
2867324 much like it is predicted to be in the next 50 to 100 years by many climate models
2867325 the world was only about 5 to 6 degrees warmer celsius on average when there was no ice on the antarctic at all a couple degrees change can lead to quite dramatic changes across the world
2867326 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
2867327 do not think that i came to bring peace on the earth i did not come to bring peace but a sword
2867328 some situations take courageous decisions with regard to the political future
2867329 sometimes there are democratically elected or semi democratically elected leaders who do things which create grave problems for their countries
2867330 so sometimes those leaders should contemplate how useful they have become to their people
2867331 for me it confirms that what the russian federation is seeking through this military aggression and invasion is to change the democratically elected georgian government
2867332 the days of overthrowing leaders by military means in europe those days are gone
2867333 this statement ambassador is absolutely unacceptable particularly from the lips of the permanent representative of a country whose actions we are aware of including with regard to civilian populations in iraq and afghanistan and serbia
2867334 shows that the secretariat of the united nations and its leadership was not able to adopt that objective position that is required by the substance of this conflict
2867335 why wont america and nato help us if they wont help us now why did we help them in iraq
2867336 the president and mr putin were in animated conversation two seats in front of us and i imagine they had a few things on their agenda
2867337 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2867338 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2867339 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2867340 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2867341 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2867342 we hope that there is no further bloodshed there has been too much bloodshed already
2867343 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2867344 it has to be condemned and the world needs to stand against it
2867345 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2867346 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states

2867349 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2867350 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2867351 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2867352 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2867353 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2867354 clearly there have been incidents on both sides but this is obviously a planned georgian operation a contingency plan they have had for some time to retake south ossetias capital tskhinvali
2867355 possibly the georgians calculated that with putin in beijing they could recapture the capital in two days and then defend it over the next two months because the russians wont take this lying down
2867356 russia should not be blamed for the fighting but russia should now be pressured not to go beyond its peacekeeping mandate and to ensure that armed militia do not cross the border into south ossetia
2867357 this pushed georgia into a philosophy of self reliance the idea that georgia will be able to regain breakaway entities only by its own means
2867358 the elephant in the room behind this whole story is georgias nato prospects
2867359 it might be a signal to the russians saying that the sochi olympics will not go the way russia wants if there is no progress on the settlement in abkhazia
2867360 and taken to tbilisis notorious isolator number 7 the scene of well documented torture of political prisoners since 1991
2867361 the style of saakashvilis governance has made dishonesty injustice and oppression a way of life everyday repression demolition of houses and churches robbery kulakization and murders i would stress murders have become common practice for the authorities
2867362 the request for a previous withdrawal of the invaders is just and our government supports it
2867363 the autonomous republic of south ossetia historically formed part of the russian federation
2867364 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one

2867369 the nano structure silicon thin film transistors are very promising for design of low power electronics however carrier transport in such devices is very complicated and results in electrical characteristics that may not be described by conventional field effect transistor fet models this work reveals the key physical properties of the devices which will help to further optimize and model the devices for circuit design

2867373 i would not chase the dollars strength versus the euro as the pair has moved beyond interest rate support
2867374 the dollar is not out of the woods it will take the market a while to come around to our point of view
2867375 we have no plans to insert money into either of those two institutions
2867376 given that fannie mae and freddie mac are solely involved in housing thats their sole business and given the magnitude of the housing correction weve had its not a surprise to me to see those losses
2867377 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor here in treasury
2867378 we have got some serious issues that were dealing with in our economy
2867379 i believe its going to take us well beyond the end of the year to work through all the housing problems
2867380 at least two bombs were dropped said interior ministry spokesman shota utiashvili
2867381 care homes can be such miserable places you sit there all day staring out the window with no one to talk to
2867382 i thought it would be lovely to give a home and family life to one or two people who would otherwise be sitting around there
2867383 i started asking people if they wanted to move out of their care homes and live with me and ive had dozens of offers they are queuing up
2867384 its nice for me too because at my age its handy to have someone to live with now every book that sells will help towards making a home for someone
2867385 media speculation with regards to the proposed capital restructure for strategic finance and some of this reporting has been inaccurate and we wish to clarify the position
2867386 the bank was very clear that whilst it was prepared to provide capital and additional funding for the business this was not in any way intended to substitute or underwrite the debenture holders position
2867387 on my hands and knees in a bid to let blackburn to allow him to stay for the rest of new zealands olympic involvement
2867388 ive left a message for him but i havent heard back yet
2867389 i am going to try to stay i really want to help these guys and id like to get through to the second round myself but blackburn have been very understanding
2867390 when we played with one man down for most of the game had taken a toll on the oly whites but he was proud that his team mates
2867391 that a democratically elected president of georgia and i quote must go
2867392 is your governments objective regime change in georgia the overthrow of the democratically elected government of georgia
2867393 id like to say straightaway that regime change is an american expression
2867394 we do not use such an expression but sometimes there are occasions and we know from history that there are different leaders who come to power either democratically or semi democratically and they become an obstacle
2867395 without the departure of saakashvili it is impossible to stop the conflict in south ossetia
2867396 russias intention to erase georgian statehood to exterminate georgian people
2867397 something that we believed always that russia had in mind
2867398 lets state clearly that we are ready to put an end to the war that we will withdraw from south ossetia that we will sign an agreement on nonuse of force
2867399 instead we will be going one better and will focus on long term unemployed by requiring them to get paid work and get off the benefit
2867400 where people have been for want of a better term breeding for a business
2867401 paid work is the route to independence and well being for most people and is the best way to reduce child poverty
2867402 i see theyve got the hoary old beat up on single parents
2867403 ive got one view on that whatever we do with single parents we have got to be guided by what is in the best interest of the children and its not always in the best interest of every child that mum is at work all day
2867404 and the truth is most people on the dpb are not there for very long
2867405 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2867406 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2867407 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2867408 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2867409 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2867410 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2867411 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2867412 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2867413 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2867414 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2867415 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2867416 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2867417 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

2867421 i dont think its the music that im concerned about its obviously that i look really different and there really arent any completely asian people who are popular singers in the u s right now

2867432 someone in japan heard it at a japanese record company and he said
2867433 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
2867434 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
2867435 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2867436 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2867437 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2867438 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2867439 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2867440 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2867441 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2867442 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2867443 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2867444 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2867445 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2867446 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2867447 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2867448 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2867449 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2867450 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2867451 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2867452 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2867453 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2867454 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2867455 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2867456 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
2867457 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
2867458 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
2867459 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
2867460 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
2867461 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2867462 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2867463 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2867464 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2867465 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2867466 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2867467 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2867468 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2867469 you dont need any proof you just see it its in here everyday
2867470 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish
2867471 i see where i live i live in costa rica at the moment and its very beautiful and clean
2867472 i see the difference about how the us is treating all its resources
2867473 i ride a bike i dont drive a car little things but i still us too much
2867474 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
2867475 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
2867476 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
2867477 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2867478 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2867479 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2867480 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2867481 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2867482 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2867483 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2867484 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2867485 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2867486 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2867487 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2867488 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2867489 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2867490 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2867491 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2867492 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2867493 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2867494 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2867495 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2867496 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2867497 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2867498 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2867499 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2867500 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2867501 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2867502 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2867503 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2867504 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2867505 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2867506 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2867507 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
2867508 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
2867509 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
2867510 the jonah factor 13 spiritual steps to finding the job of a lifetime
2867511 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
2867512 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2867513 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2867514 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
2867515 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
2867516 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2867517 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2867518 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2867519 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2867520 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2867521 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2867522 just so you all know we did set a record
2867523 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2867524 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2867525 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2867526 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2867527 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2867528 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2867529 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2867530 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2867531 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2867532 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2867533 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2867534 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2867535 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2867536 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2867537 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2867538 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2867539 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2867540 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2867541 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2867542 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2867543 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2867544 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2867545 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2867546 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2867547 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2867548 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2867549 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2867550 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2867551 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2867552 politics has its puzzling moments john mccain and most of the gop experienced one
2867553 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2867554 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2867555 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2867556 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2867557 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2867558 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2867559 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2867560 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2867561 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2867562 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2867563 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2867564 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2867565 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2867566 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2867567 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2867568 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2867569 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2867570 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2867571 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2867572 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2867573 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2867574 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2867575 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2867576 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2867577 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2867578 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2867579 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2867580 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2867581 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2867582 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2867583 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2867584 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2867585 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2867586 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
2867587 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
2867588 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
2867589 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2867590 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2867591 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2867592 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2867593 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2867594 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2867595 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2867596 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2867597 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2867598 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2867599 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2867600 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2867601 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2867602 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2867603 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2867604 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2867605 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2867606 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2867607 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2867608 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2867609 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2867610 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2867611 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
2867612 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2867613 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2867614 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2867615 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2867616 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2867617 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2867618 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2867619 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2867620 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2867621 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2867622 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2867623 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2867624 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2867625 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2867626 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2867627 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2867628 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2867629 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2867630 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2867631 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2867632 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2867633 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2867634 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2867635 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2867636 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2867637 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2867638 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2867639 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2867640 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2867641 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2867642 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2867643 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2867644 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2867645 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2867646 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2867647 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2867648 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2867649 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2867650 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2867651 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2867652 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2867653 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2867654 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2867655 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2867656 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2867657 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2867658 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2867659 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2867660 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2867661 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2867662 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2867663 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2867664 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2867665 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2867666 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2867667 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2867668 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2867669 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2867670 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2867671 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2867672 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2867673 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
2867674 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
2867675 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2867676 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2867677 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2867678 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2867679 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2867680 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2867681 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2867682 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2867683 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2867684 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2867685 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2867686 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2867687 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2867688 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2867689 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2867690 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2867691 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2867692 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2867693 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2867694 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2867695 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2867696 theres something about a charismatic leader rallying huge crowds of germans in a large public square
2867697 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2867698 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2867699 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2867700 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2867701 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2867702 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2867703 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2867704 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2867705 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2867706 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2867707 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
2867708 theres no doubt in my mind that we were supposed to be there at the time we were there and it just so happens we knew each other
2867709 out of the corner of my eye i see the cdot worker jump over the median and i just had the worst feeling of my life
2867710 i just looked in my mirror and the semi truck didnt slow down it just started hitting cars they were just bouncing off his front bumper
2867711 and i looked ahead of me and there was a guy already on his cell phone calling 911 it was josh
2867712 i could hear him screaming and i knew i wasnt going to be able to live with myself just standing there and not doing something
2867713 every time wed get it a little bit out it would be just ten times worse than before
2867714 the real heroes are the men in the suits the police officers firemen firewomen theyre the real heroes because they do it every day
2867715 our deepest prayers are with him hes going to make it if he made it through what i saw the rest is going to be a cakewalk
2867716 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2867717 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2867718 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2867719 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2867720 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2867721 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2867722 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2867723 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year

2867776 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2867777 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2867778 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2867784 this study demonstrates that resveratrol and quercetin have novel nonsteroidal anti inflammatory activity that may have applications for the treatment of inflammatory diseases
2867785 it may be that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts
2867786 weve carefully examined this aspect our data suggest that even considering all main confounding factors as dietary habits physical activity or the health of people studied a moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages keeps on showing a real positive effect
2867787 the core of this study is not just about alcohol
2867788 it is also the way we drink that makes the difference little amounts preferably during meals this appears to be the right way this is another feature of the mediterranean diet where alcohol wine above all is the ideal partner of a dinner or lunch but thats all the rest of the day must be absolutely alcohol free the message carried by scientific studies like ours is simple alcohol can be a respectful guest on our table but it is good just when it goes with a healthy lifestyle where moderation leads us toward a consumption inspired by quality not by quantity

2867798 muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam is not the father of any man among you but he is the messenger of allah and the last end of the prophets
2867799 this day i have perfected your religion for you completed my favor upon you and have chosen islam for you as your religion
2867800 and whoever seeks a religion other than islam it will never be accepted of him and in the hereafter he will be one of the losers
2867801 by whom the soul of muhammad is in his hand no member of this nation no jew or christian hears of me and does not believe in what i was sent with but he will be of the people of the fire
2867802 and we have sent down to you o muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam the book this quraan in truth confirming the scripture that came before it and dominant over it
2867803 suitable for implementation at anytime anywhere and by any nation
2867804 it is he who has sent his messenger muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam with guidance and the religion of truth islam to make it superior over all religions even though the disbelievers hate it
2867805 allah has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds that he will certainly grant them succession to the present rulers in the earth as he granted it to those before them and that he will grant them the authority to practice their religion which he has chosen for them islam and he will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear provided they the believers worship me and do not associate anything in worship with me but whoever disbelieved after this they are the rebellious disobedient to allah
2867806 and if the people of the towns had believed and had piety certainly we should have opened for them blessings form the heaven and the earth but they belied the messengers so we took them with punishment for what they used to earn of evil deeds did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of our punishment by night while they were asleep or did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of our punishment in the forenoon while they play did they then feel secure against the plot of allah none feels secure form the plot of allah except the people who are lost
2867807 righteousness is not that you only turn your faces towards the east and or the west in prayers but righteousness is the quality of the one who believes in allah the last day the angels the book and the prophets
2867808 verily we have created all things with qadar and our commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye
2867809 every newly born will be born having fitrah however his parents will either convert him to judaism christianity or majocism fire worshipping
2867810 were they created by nothing or were they themselves the creators
2867811 were they created by nothing or were they themselves the creators or did they create the heavens and the earth nay but they have no firm belief or are with them the treasures of your lord or are they the tyrants with authority to do as they like
2867812 my heart almost flew from the power of this reasoning mentioned in the surah this was the first time that iman entered my heart

2867815 an arabian bedouin man entered the masjid on friday while the prophet was delivering the speech he said o messenger of allah our possessions are destroyed our children are hungry ask allah for us he the prophet sallallahu alaihi wa sallam raised his hands in supplication to allah all of a sudden mountain like clouds were formed he did not descend from his minbar the podium until i saw rain falling through his beard on the second friday this arabian man or someone else stood up and said o messenger of allah sallallahu alaihi wa sallam buildings have collapsed and possessions are flooded ask allah for us he the prophet sallallahu alaihi wa sallam raised his hands and said o my lord around us and not on us wherever he pointed to an area of the sky they the clouds dispersed
2867816 and i bring the dead to life by allahs leave
2867817 and when you o jesus brought forth the dead by my permission
2867818 the hour has drawn near and the moon has been cleft asunder
2867819 such is allah your lord his is the kingdom and those whom you invoke or call upon instead of him own not even a qitmir the membrane over the date stone
2867820 o chiefs i know not that you have a god other than me
2867821 and they belied them our signs wrongfully and arrogantly though their own selves were convinced thereof
2867822 verily you know that these signs have been sent down by none but the lord of the heavens and the earth as clear evidences of his oneness and might and i think you are indeed o pharaoh doomed to destruction
2867823 who is the lord of the seven heavens and the lord of the great throne
2867824 in whose hands is the sovereignty of everything and he protects all while against whom there is no protector if you know
2867825 how then are you deceived and turn away from the truth
2867826 and if you ask them who created them they will surely say
2867827 and your lord is one lord there is none who has the right to be worshipped but he the most beneficent the most merciful
2867828 allah bears witness that none has the right to be worshipped but he and the angels and those having knowledge also give this witness he is always maintaining his creation in justice none has the right to be worshipped but he the all mighty the all wise
2867829 that is because allah is the truth the only true god and what they the disbelievers invoke besides him it is falsehood and verily allah is the most high the most great
2867830 they are but names which you have named you and your fathers for which allah has sent down no authority
2867831 are many different lords gods better or allah the one the irresistible you do not worship beside him but only names which you have forged you and your fathers for which allah has sent down no authority
2867832 yet they have taken besides him other gods that created nothing but are themselves created and possess neither hurt nor benefit for themselves and possess no power of causing death nor of giving life nor of raising the dead
2867833 say o muhammad call upon those whom you asset to be associate gods besides allah they possess not even the weight of an atom either in the heavens or on the earth nor they have any share in either nor is there for him any supporter from among them
2867834 do they attribute as partners to allah those who created nothing but they themselves are created no help can they give them nor can they help themselves
2867835 o mankind worship your lord allah who created you and those who were before you so that you may become among the pious who has made the earth a resting place for you and the sky as a canopy and sent down rain from the sky and brought forth therewith fruits as a provision for you then do not set up rivals unto allah in worship while you know that he alone has the right to be worshipped
2867836 and if you ask them who created them they will surely say
2867837 and all the most beautiful names belong to allah so call on him by them and leave the company of those who deny his names they will be requited for what they used to do
2867838 his is the highest description in the heavens and in the earth and he is the all mighty the all wise
2867839 there is nothing like unto hint and he is the all hearer the all seer
2867840 and those who are near him the angels are not too proud to worship him nor are they weary of his worship they glorify his praises night and day and they never slacken to do so
2867841 this was jibreel he came to you to teach you your religion
2867842 all the praises and thanks be to allah the only originator of the heavens and the earth who made the angels messengers with wings two or three or four
2867843 and if you could see when the angels take away the souls of those who disbelieve at death they smite their faces and their backs
2867844 and if you could but see when the unjust disbelievers are in the agonies of death while the angels are stretching forth their hands saying
2867845 until when fear is banished from their the angels hearts they the angels say
2867846 and angels shall enter unto them from every gate saying peace be upon you for that you preserved in patience excellent indeed is the final home
2867847 when allah likes a slave he calls on jibreel saying allah loves so and so person therefore love him
2867848 when the day of friday comes there stand angels at each of the masjids doors they record the first then the next one to come to the masjid when the imam sits down waiting for the call to prayer to end so he can start the speech they close the books and they come to listen to the thikr the remembrance of allah contained in the friday speech
2867849 and we have sent down to you o muhammad the book this quraan in truth confirming the scripture that came before it and dominant over it
2867850 to each among you we have prescribed a law and a
2867851 verily we have inspired you o muhammad as we inspired noah and the prophets after him
2867852 mankind come to adam to intercede on their behalf but he declines saying
2867853 muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam is not the father of any man among you but he is the messenger of allah and the last end of prophets
2867854 and verily we have sent among every nation a messenger proclaiming
2867855 and there never was a nation but a warner had passed among them
2867856 verily we did send down the torah to moses therein was guidance and light by which the prophets who submitted themselves to allahs will judged the jews
2867857 it is not in my power to cause you harm or to bring you to the right path
2867858 none can protect me from allah s punishment if i were to disobey him nor should i find refuge except in him
2867859 and it is he who feeds me and gives me to drink and when i am ill it is he who cures me and who will cause me to die and then will bring me to life again
2867860 i am only human just like you i forget as you forget therefore when i forget remind me
2867861 blessed be he who sent down the criterion of right and wrong this quraan to his slave muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam that he may be a warner to the alamin mankind and the jinn
2867862 and remember our slaves abraham isaac and jacob all owners of strength in worshipping us and also of religious understanding verily we did choose them by granting them the remembrance of the home in the hereafter and they are in our sight verily of the
2867863 he was not more than a slave we granted our favor to him and we made him an example to the children of
2867864 and remember when we took from the prophets their covenant and form you o muhammad sallallahu alaihi wa sallam and from noah abraham moses and jesus son of mary
2867865 he allah has ordained for you the same religion islam which he ordained for noah and that which we have inspired in you o muhammad sallallahu alaihi wa sallam and that which we ordained for abraham moses and jesus saying you should establish religion by implementing the commandments and make no divisions in it
2867866 and indeed we have sent messengers before you o muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam of them some we have related to you their story and some we have not related to you their story
2867867 but no by your lord they can have no faith until they make you o muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam judge in all disputes between them and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions and accept them with full submission
2867868 and nothing prevented men from believing when the guidance came to them except that they said
2867869 if there were on the earth angels walking about in peace and security we should certainly have sent down for them from the heaven an angel as a messenger
2867870 as we began the first creation we shall repeat it it is a promise binding upon us truly we shall do it
2867871 after that surely you will die then again surely you will be resurrected on the day of resurrection
2867872 on the day of resurrection mankind wilt be resurrected while they are bear footed and naked
2867873 did you think that we had created you in play without any purpose and that you would not be brought back to us
2867874 verily he who has given you o muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam the quraan will surely bring you back to the maad place of return
2867875 verily to us will be their return then verily for us will be their reckoning
2867876 whoever brings a good deed shall have ten times the like thereof to his credit and whoever brings an evil deed shall have only the recompense of the like thereof and they will not be wronged
2867877 and we shall set up balances of justice on the day of resurrection then none will be dealt with unjustly in anything and if there be the weight of a mustard seed we will bring it and sufficient are we as reckoners
2867878 allah will bring the believer closer to him and will shield him form being exposed for his evil deeds in front of everyone he will say do you remember such and such evil deed do you remember such and such evil deed he will say yes o my lord when he gets his confessions for his evil deeds and he the salve thinks that he is close to destruction he will say i have preserved you from being exposed in front of others for these evil deeds during your lifetime today i forgive them for you then he will be given his record of deeds as for the disbelievers and the hypocrites they will be called in public these are the ones who lied on their lord did not follow his guidance sent down with their prophets therefore allahs curse will befall the unjust ones
2867879 then surely we shall question those people to who it the book was sent and verily we shall question the messengers then surely we shall narrate unto them their whole story with knowledge and indeed we were not absent
2867880 what no eye has ever violated what no ear has ever heard of and what no mind has ever imagined of joys that allah hid for the believers
2867881 verily those who believe in allah and do righteous good deeds they are the best of creatures their reward with their lord is gardens of eternity underneath which rivers flow they will abide therein forever allah well pleased with them and they with him that is for him who fears his lord
2867882 no person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do
2867883 and fear the fire which is prepared for the disbelievers
2867884 we have prepared for the wrongdoers a fire whose walls will be surrounding them and if they ask for help relief water etc they will be granted water like boiling oil that will scald their faces terrible the drink and an evil dwelling
2867885 verily allah has cursed the disbelievers and has prepared for them a flaming fire hell
2867886 oh would that we had obeyed allah and obeyed the messenger muhammad
2867887 allah is my lord my religion is islam my prophet is muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam
2867888 i do not know i heard people say something and i followed them
2867889 and if you but see when the wrongdoers are in the agonies of death while the angels are stretching forth their hands saying
2867890 the fire they are exposed to it morning and afternoon and on the day when the hour will be established it will be said to the angels
2867891 i would have asked allah to let you hear what i am hearing from the punishment in the grave but for the fear that you would not bury each other after that
2867892 seek refuge in allah from the torment of the fire
2867893 we seek refuge in allah from the torment of the fire
2867894 seek refuge in allah from the torment of the grave
2867895 we seek refuge in allah from the torment of the grave
2867896 seek refuge in allah from all calamities apparent or hidden
2867897 we seek refuge in allah from all calamities apparent or hidden
2867898 seek refuge in allah from the calamity of ad dajjal the false messiah
2867899 we seek refuge lit allah from the calamity of ad da jjal
2867900 fear you not nor grieve but receive the glad tidings of
2867901 then why do you not intervene when the soul of a dying person reaches the throat
2867902 a caller from heaven will say my slave has said the truth therefore furnish him his grave from paradise dress him from paradise and open a door for him to paradise
2867903 he will receive from its tranquility and perfume his grave will be enlarged for him the distance that his sight reaches
2867904 the disbelievers pretend that they will never be resurrected for the account
2867905 yes by my lord you will certainly be resurrected then you will be informed and recompensed for what you did and that is easy for allah
2867906 we will no believe in you unless we see allah without a barrier
2867907 and remember when you killed a man and fell into dispute among yourselves as to the crime
2867908 strike him the dead man with a piece of it the cow
2867909 did you o muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam not think of those who went forth from their homes in thousands fearing death
2867910 oh how will allah ever bring it to life after its death
2867911 perhaps i remained dead a day or a part of a day
2867912 nay you have remained dead for a hundred years look at your food and at your drink they show no change and look at your donkey and thus we have made of you a sign for the people look at the bones how we bring them together and clothe them with flesh
2867913 i know now that allah is able to do all things
2867914 take four bird then cause them to incline towards you slaughter them cut them into pieces and then put a portion of them on every hill and call them they will come to you in haste and know that allah is all mighty all wise
2867915 and he is who originates the creation then will repeat it after it has been perished and this is easier for him
2867916 as we began the first creation we shall repeat it it is a promise binding upon us truly we shall do it
2867917 and among his signs in this that you see the earth barren but when we send down water rain to it it is stirred to life and growth of vegetation verily he who gives it life surely he is able to give life to the dead on the day of resurrection indeed he is able to do all things
2867918 and we send down blessed water rain from the sky then we produce therewith gardens and grain all harvests that are reaped and tall date palms with ranged clusters a provisions for allahs slaves and we give life therewith to dead land thus will be the resurrection of the dead
2867919 the prophet passed by some walls in madinah he heard the screams of two persons who were being punished in their graves
2867920 one of them did not protect himself his clothes form urine the other one was spreading sawing differences between people
2867921 it is allah who takes away the souls at the time of their death and those that die not during their sleep he keep those souls for which he had ordained death and sends the rest for a term appointed verily in this are signs for a people who think deeply
2867922 there are many who refute a truth while the problem lies with their limited comprehension
2867923 the seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein glorify him and there is not a thing but glorifies his praise but you understand not their glorification truly he is ever forbearing oft forgiving
2867924 o children of adam let not satan deceive you as he got your parents adam and eve out of paradise stripping them of their raiment to show them their private parts verily he and his soldiers see you from where you will not see them verily we made the devils protectors and helpers for those who believe not
2867925 know you not that allah knows all that is in heaven and on earth verily it is all in the book al lawh verily that is easy for allah
2867926 allah recorded the measurement of all matters pertaining to creation fifty thousand years before he created the heavens and earth
2867927 he it is who shapes you in the wombs as he pleases
2867928 had allah willed indeed he would have given them power over you and they would have fought you
2867929 and if allah had willed they would not have done so so leave them alone with their fabrications
2867930 allah is the creator of all things and he is the guardian over all things
2867931 he has created everything and has measured it exactly according to its due measurements
2867932 so whosoever wills let him take a return to his lord by obeying his commandments
2867933 so go to your tilt have sexual relations with your wives when and how you will not in the anus
2867934 so keep your duty to allah as much as you can listen and obey
2867935 allah burdens not a person beyond his scope he gets reward for that good which he has earned and he is punished for that evil which he has earned
2867936 to whomsoever among you who wills to walk straight and you will not unless it be that allah wills the lord of the worlds
2867937 those who took partners in worship with allah will say
2867938 if allah had willed we would not have taken partners in worship with him nor would our fathers and we would not have forbidden anything against his will
2867939 likewise bellied those who were before them till they tasted of our wrath
2867940 have you any knowledge proof that you can produce before us verily you follow nothing but guess and you do nothing but lie
2867941 messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that mankind should have no plea against allah after the messengers and allah is ever all powerful all wise
2867942 ones final destination in hell or paradise is already determined for each one of you
2867943 should we depend on this fact o messenger of allah meaning to abandon working deeds
2867944 no perform deeds because everyone will be helped to go on the path that he chooses and reach his destiny
2867945 as for him who gives in charity and keeps his duty to allah and fears him
2867946 so keep your duty to allah and fear him as much as you can
2867947 wait o leader of the believers i only stole because this was in the qadar of allah
2867948 and we are cutting your hand because it is in the qadar of allah
2867949 no calamity befalls on the earth or in yourselves but is inscribed in the book of decrees al lawh before we bring it into existence verily that is easy for allah in order that you may not be sad over matters that you fail to get nor rejoice because of that which has been given to you and allah likes not prideful boasters
2867950 pleasing is the attitude of the believer all of his matters are righteous this is only for the believer if a joy is brought to him he thanks allah for it this is better for him if a calamity befalls him he is patient this is also good for him
2867951 then whosoever wills let him believe and whosoever wills let him disbelieve verily we have prepared for the unjust a fire whose walls will be surrounding them
2867952 whosoever does righteous good deeds it is for the benefit of his own self and whosoever does evil it is against his own self and your lord is not at all unjust to his slaves
2867953 allah had willed succeeding generations would not have fought against each other after clear verses of allah had come to them but they differed some of them believed and others disbelieved if allah had willed they would not have fought against one another but allah does what he likes
2867954 and if we had willed surely we would have given every person his guidance but the word from me took effect about evil doers that i will fill hell with jinn and mankind together
2867955 for all there will be degrees or ranks according to what they did
2867956 the strong believer is better and more liked by allah than the weak believer
2867957 only those are the believers who have believed in allah and his messenger and afterwards doubt not but strive with their wealth and their lives for the cause of allah those they are the truthful
2867958 whoever works righteousness whether male or female while he or she is a true believer in allah verily to him we will give a good ljfe in this world and we shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do paradise in the hereafter
2867959 i think the georgian issue is helping the market to focus back on the supply side that has really changed the market quite a bit
2867960 a paradigm that assumes that firms can and should use external ideas and internal and external paths to market as the firms look to advance their technology
2867961 un paradigma que asume que las empresas pueden y deben utilizar ideas externas rutas internas y externas hacia el mercado como las empresas miran el avance de su tecnolog a
2867962 sebenernya ulang tahunku besok ya tapi sebenernya yang belum tercapai itu indonesia ini terbebas dari kelaparan dan belum adanya penghijauan itu yang belum tercapai
2867963 artinya jika kita ulang tahun saya harus memulai dengan sesuatu yang bagus contohnya seperti hari ini sebenernya saya juga gak tahu saya bisa berada di situasi ini ini mungkin kebetulan atau anugerah dari allah
2867964 jadi saya bersyukur sekali bisa memulainya dari sesuatu yang bagus
2867965 sebenernya ulang tahun itu ketika ibu kita sedang prihatin pada saat melahirkan kita dan saya sudah merasakan itu jadi saya rasa ulang tahun itu dekat dengan keprihatinan bukan dengan pesta
2867966 ya pestanya hanya rasa syukur dengan cara yang lain lah pokoknya lebih pada koreksi diri mudah mudahan ini bukan sesuatu yang berlebihan saya merayakan seperti ini
2867967 el parque vive un momento crucial para su existencia la mayor a de las poblaciones animales a excepci n del rinoceronte blanco del que no se puede asegurar su supervivencia pueden salvarse todav a s lo depende del grado de protecci n que tengan a partir de ahora
2867968 si los rinocerontes aparecen una soluci n ser a cruzarlos con los que hay en dos zool gicos en la rep blica checa y san diego ee uu o con rinocerontes blancos surafricanos creo que es mejor tener un rinoceronte h brido que nada si no aparecen tenemos material gen tico suyo conservado en sur frica y quiz podr an clonarse como pretende la universidad de edimburgo como ltima soluci n no lo veo mal aunque si me dan a elegir entre gastar un mont n de dinero en protegerlos o clonarlos yo opto por la protecci n me parece un poco triste que los ni os acaben conociendo a los animales en los parques tem ticos o cibern ticos
2867969 lo primero es salvar el parque y darlo a conocer que la gente vuelva a o r hablar de garamba
2867970 me parece algo normal a todo te acostumbras claro que con los hipop tamos hay que tener cuidado porque cuando salen a pastar por la noche son peligrosos cargan cuando menos te lo esperas
2867971 no creo que encontremos ejemplares si acaso uno o dos
2867972 aunque encontremos los cinco ser an insuficientes para recuperar la especie creo que el rinoceronte blanco del norte de frica est muerto
2867973 se debi actuar hace cinco a os cuando todav a quedaban 35 rinocerontes y era posible hacer algo
2867974 aunque hay que ser realistas por lo menos habr a que cruzar 10 para tener xito
2867975 aunque entonces no tuvo xito creo que es una buena idea
2867976 desde hace 50 a os han perdido mucho h bitat en toda frica primero fueron las guerras luego los safaris los pu os de las dagas de los millonarios yemen es y ahora los f rmacos chinos en estos momentos hay en china mucho dinero y muchos chinos en frica que son un peligro para los elefantes y rinocerontes
2867977 ahora mismo si no disminuye su n mero vamos bien el paso siguiente es tenerlas muy controladas lo bueno es que el h bitat del parque no est desapareciendo porque est protegido si logramos erradicar a los furtivos la jirafa se recuperar lo importante es que se sepa su situaci n
2867978 me gustan m s los rinocerontes negros son muy combativos
2867979 intent subirme a un rbol pero me embisti con el cuerno
2867980 hay que tener instinto de rastreador a veces cuando sigues una huella y el animal est cerca lo sientes
2867981 en general caminan en l nea recta pero llega un momento en que empiezan a hacer eses y a moverse sin sentido porque buscan comida entonces es cuando hay que tener m s cuidado pueden estar muy cerca de ti
2867982 con o sin rinocerontes ste es un parque magn fico un espacio salvaje de una belleza incre ble dif cil de encontrar ya en frica y con una fauna y flora variad simas tiene agua todo el a o lo cruzan dos r os el garamba y el dungu afluentes y zonas pantanosas
2867983 y una poblaci n de chimpanc s bastante desconocida y a la que deber a de prestarse m s protecci n
2867984 desde guilas marciales y volatineras hasta el ibis sagrado pasando por los coloristas abejarucos escarlata o de garganta roja y el enorme gran c lao
2867985 algunos parques africanos apenas tienen animales pero eso no impide que la gente quiera visitarlos porque son enormes reas de naturaleza intocadas garamba adem s de los rinocerontes blancos hipop tamos elefantes y leones tiene muchas especies a conservar y es bueno que haya fondos para hacerlo incluso si se pierden los rinos porque su naturaleza es de una gran belleza
2867986 porque frica no va a cambiar en bastantes a os
2867987 en el congo todos los parques funcionan con ayuda internacional no hay fondos del estado
2867988 es mucho m s natural y ecol gico pasear en elefantes que en todoterreno puedes atravesar los r os y los hipop tamos no se molestan ya se hace en otros parques africanos y nadie se rasga las vestiduras
2867989 el tener una buena red de pistas resulta fundamental para la seguridad el turismo y los estudios que queremos hacer
2867990 de vez en cuando todav a hay furtivos que matan alg n ant lope o b falo pero en general el furtivismo ha descendido bastante el verdadero problema es la guerrilla la lra ugandesa que cuando se topa con los guardas tira a matar
2867991 ha sido lo m s duro lo peor de mi trabajo en frica
2867992 es absurdo dan fondos para todo menos para que los vigilantes defiendan su vida no tiene sentido pero acabamos de sumar 50 guardas a los 137 que ten amos
2867993 el problema principal de estos pa ses es que a veces piensan que la cooperaci n internacional se tiene que encargar de todo pretenden que te conviertas en estado que hagas de polic a de m dico de maestro de obras p blicas yo no quiero ocuparme de la c rcel de furtivos una herencia de tiempos pasados de la seguridad tiene que ocuparse el gobierno congole o el otro d a cogieron a un paramilitar que hab a matado un elefante para quitarle los colmillos lo trajeron aqu y por la noche se presentaron sus colegas armados hasta los dientes a sacarle del calabozo los guardas est n aqu para vigilar la naturaleza pero no para jugarse la vida tontamente
2867994 para intentar cambiar la mentalidad de mi pa s siempre eran los hombres los que hac an este trabajo y quise tener la valent a de dar ejemplo a otras mujeres
2867995 al contrario est n contentos nuestro salario es igual que el de los hombres y nos consideran como a ellos no me importar a quedarme as 30 a os
2867996 estuve tres a os de centinela de patrulla pero cuando hubo problemas con los rebeldes decidieron que me quedara a cargo de la armer a
2867997 si hay furtivos no dudar en utilizar las armas me gusta el parque y quiero defenderlo
2867998 sabemos que es un buen trabajo todos creemos en la importancia para la regi n de un buen parque con muchos animales
2867999 ahora las mujeres son m s fuertes y din micas que los hombres pueden hacer patrulla lo mismo que nosotros sin perturbar al grupo ni ser un problema para la familia
2868000 si en europa hay mujeres militares por qu no en el congo
2868001 conozco bien el medio y me gusta es dif cil vivir aqu sin buenas escuelas comercios o tel fono pero es importante tener una estructura capaz de hacer una medicina b sica porque estamos en una provincia subdesarrollada no hay cerca hospitales y las carreteras son malas
2868002 hay mucha promiscuidad sexual y tenemos un nivel alto de sida en los poblados y en el parque hombres y mujeres son promiscuos y nadie quiere usar preservativos aunque los regalamos se niegan a aceptar el problema
2868003 tener un buen centro de salud es necesario para los habitantes de la zona y para los turistas
2868004 en la campa a de recuento de 2006 hab amos trabajado 15 d as sin ver ni un rinoceronte y el ltimo d a en la ltima hora cuando ya no esper bamos nada sali uno
2868005 tenemos un margen hasta diciembre cuando pasen las lluvias seguiremos rastreando por tierra y aire con la avioneta y el ultraligero y si para entonces no aparece alg n rinoceronte los daremos por extinguidos no podemos pasarnos la vida persiguiendo algo que quiz ya no existe
2868006 i tried to put a good solid swing to the middle of the 16th green and hopefully it goes there if it drifts a little bit perfect but i came out of the swing just a touch and just went in the water
2868007 but then i hit a great putt on 17 i dont know why it didnt break i feel like i hit a good putt i hit it left edge and it just didnt break and it lipped out on the left and then 18s just a tough hole
2868008 i felt like i responded well and padraig harrington was obviously very good on the back nine and things just happened his way
2868009 ive said it before there are guys that get a little bit fortunate they get in contention in a major and manage to get things going their way either because they play well or because somebody else comes back
2868010 and unfortunately it hasnt happened to me i feel like i played well enough to win probably more than two majors throughout my career
2868011 die dritte stufe f r eine deeskalierung w re der r ckzug der truppen auf beiden seiten aber ein r ckzug der von beobachtern begleitet w re

2868016 first one chinese player dunked the ball into the net then another then another the way the chinese mens basketball
2868017 the city watchdog the financial services authority has told the uks banks to make sure they are strong enough to
2868018 since june the uk top 40 has featured a hidden advertisement for chewing gum it turns out that chris browns
2868019 lor told the people they were owed a refund according to prosecutors
2868020 especially in our culture mostly elderly like old people they really need the young people who speak english very well he said
2868021 he said that hed seen other people in other states where hed lived reporting ssi income similarly and getting refunds
2868022 this decade a national push to increase homeownership among latinos coincided with one of the longest most dramatic periods of appreciation for home values
2868023 because a widened lending gate allowed many more latinos and other minorities into the housing market than had entered previously lawmakers and special interest groups championed the lenders efforts to extend homeownership to those groups
2868024 that bush was putting the presidential imprimatur on the no money down mortgages that so exacerbated the bubble
2868025 he also proposes to make zero down payment loans available to first time buyers whose mortgages are guaranteed by the federal housing administration
2868026 among minorities the pull toward using an agent or a loan broker from the same minority group is strong people tend to go with a loan broker or officer that they know said gabe del rio director of homeownership for
2868027 but sometimes the broker the borrowers know is also the broker who takes advantage of them abusing the trust of their client by tacking on fees or inadequately explaining the terms of the contract theyre signing
2868028 any place where theres a high density of lower income and less educated hispanics and african americans youll see a larger decline in values because many of these families were put into subprime loans they didnt understand and shouldnt have qualified for more so than in other zip codes said clifford arellano a real estate broker whose office is in barrio logan
2868029 a large share of those who took out risky loans were recent immigrants who spoke little english said gabe del rio vice president of lending and homeownership at community housingworks a nonprofit developer of affordable housing many who have come to his agency for counseling say
2868030 residents forced to vacate their homes leave a void in the neighborhood said enrique gandarilla executive director of the city heights business association its only getting worse
2868031 typically a severe housing slump is preceded by a recession and job losses but that is not the case this time around
2868032 although it is not true that all conservatives are stupid people it is true that most stupid people are conservative
2868033 this is a grave challenge to the united states and europe
2868034 the united states and its nato allies must together impose a price on russia

2868038 the chief executive of the mortgage giant freddie mac rejected internal warnings that could have protected the company from some of the financial crises now engulfing it according to more than two dozen current and former high ranking executives and others that chief executive richard f syron in 2004 received a memo from freddie macs chief risk officer warning him that the firm was financing questionable loans that threatened its financial health
2868039 syron yesterday defended his loan decisions arguing that freddie needed to take additional risk to meet its government mandate to provide affordable housing
2868040 indeed the quotas for freddies mortgages reserved for underserved areas
2868041 low income census tracts or in low or middle income census tracts with high minority populations
2868042 in addition freddies commitment to affordable housing had declined to the point it employed gimmicks to meet congressional goals for example said syron freddie would essentially rent loans to meet affordable housing goals buying them from lenders to carry on the books at year end then selling them back syron ended that practice and re emphasized the
2868043 syron added the cause of freddies problems isnt those loans but a deep and extended housing downturn spreading into the broad mortgage market us home prices are falling for the first time since the great depression and the economy is weakening affecting even creditworthy borrowers
2868044 but to meet affordable housing goals freddie had to engage in activities that helped push house prices higher and thus more unaffordable and the more their numbers indicated that freddie was dedicated to affordable housing the more housing was allowed to balloon artificially
2868045 am i way off the mark or is this as crazy as it sounds gives you something to tell the people you are doing for their benefit while achieving the exact opposite
2868046 syron encouraged the boston feds research department to wade into important but contentious public policy issues perhaps best known was its study of lending discrimination which found race not lending risks driving loan decisions
2868047 t he market in short worked the mortgage lenders somehow weeded out the extra credit risks among minorities down to the point where white and minority defaults were at an equal apparently acceptable rate
2868048 its perverse that freddie mac and fannie mae the two biggest providers of money for u s home loans have been encouraged to put people into homes that they end up losing

2868082 i am here because master cannot afford to move to another province i am here because someone with power said i am vicious and a killer someone who never met me master took me for a walk one day and some lady started to scream when she saw me i got frightened and barked at her the dog police came and they took me away i have been with master for 10 years the last time i saw him he just held me and cried he kept telling me he was sorry i worry for him whatever will he do without me
2868083 popper how did you come to be in this place
2868084 i am not certain why i am here i think maybe my family will come back for me they bought me when i was only 6 weeks old i remember they said how smart border collies are and how it would be so easy to train me they were very excited at first the little ones played with me all the time but the trouble with little masters is they refuse to stay in a group i constantly had to nip their heels to keep them together
2868085 so i did what i thought i should do i am not quite sure why the little ones screamed when i did my job but they did and the masters got very angry at me they also got angry when i had to relieve myself and did so in the house i am not sure where they expected me to go all they said was that i was the smartest breed in the world and i should just know better then they left me in the yard for a month or so i got bored a lot and i dug holes in the grass the next thing i knew the masters brought me here
2868086 will you please let them know i want to come home please tell them i promise i will be good
2868087 most certainly my name is spartan you can come in i wont bite
2868088 why am i here well about two years ago i was born in the backyard of some person i cant even recall i had 11 brothers and sisters i recall a day when a big man came and gave that person some money and took me away from my mother they had to chain her up as she was very angry that he took me they chained her and beat her i came to know the man by the name of jim i overheard him telling his friends that i would grow up to be big and mean like my mother but as i grew older all i wanted to do was play and be friends with everyone jim said i needed to be taught how to be mean so he chained me up in the yard no more house for me he said i was too spoiled when people came by to visit i was so happy to see them i wanted them to come and play but that made jim angry so he beat me with sticks and chains when he came near i would roll onto my back so he would know i wasnt a bad dog that made him beat me more
2868089 i am so sorry spartan some people are just plain evil
2868090 i cant say spartan maybe someone kind will come and get you we can only hope
2868091 my owner surrendered me she said she wanted a cute little dog like the one on the tv show frasier she didnt bother to look into the type of dog i am
2868092 i suppose she expected me to just lie about and only need a short walk each day just like eddie but my energy was so high that i needed to run and play
2868093 now i am here i suppose it could be worse i could be like her
2868094 she was found tied in a back yard she only had a three foot chain some days there was no water rarely was there any food one day a nice neighbor came by and brought her some meat by then it was too late she was already mad she broke off her chain and bit the poor man badly we know she will be going behind the steel door i am sad to say i think it will be best perhaps then she will know some peace
2868095 who is that why have all the dogs gone quiet
2868096 compassion love sorrow it emanates from her pores she is here for one of us but nobody knows who just yet
2868097 no more beatings by man no more you are coming with me from here on in its all going to get better
2868098 but you are a little dog and everyone loves little dogs i am convinced you will be rescued soon

2868109 lord you know my inadequacies you know my weaknesses not only in parenting but in every area of my life im doing the best i can to raise my kids properly but it may not be good enough as you provided the fish and the loaves to feed the five thousand hungry people now take my meager effort and use it to bless my family make up for the things i do wrong satisfy the needs that i have not met compensate for my blunders and mistakes wrap your great arms around my children and draw them close to you and be there when they stand at the great crossroads between right and wrong all i can give them is my best and i will continue to do that i submit them to you now and rededicate myself to the task you have placed before me the outcome rests securely in your hands
2868110 i want you to recognize that this jar represents your life the golf balls are the important things your family your children your health your friends and your favourite passions things that if everything else was lost and only they remained your life would still be full other things that matter like your job your house and your car the sand is everything else the small stuff if you put the sand into the jar first
2868111 there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls the same goes for life if you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff you will never have room for the good things that are important to you pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness play with your children take time to get medical checkups take your partner out to dinner play another 18 holes do one more run down the ski slope there will always be time to clean the house and fix the disposal take care of the golf balls first the things that really matter set your priorities the rest is just sand
2868112 im glad you asked it just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem theres always room for a couple of glasses of wine with a friend
2868113 this is my final message to jon regarding the most recent voice mails that were left on keiths phone up until today we have all tried to hold our tongues to protect lus feelings however after hearing your most recent voice mails i cant ignore this nonsense anymore apparently you dont know much about the hall family the dumbest thing you could possibly do is to threaten one of my children i dont care if you were drunk when you left the message or what your excuse might be now the phone calls better stop now you can blame everybody else for your immature behavior but the fact is that the only one that has hurt anyone in this matter is you your insecurity has caused you to develop these crazy stories to make lu believe that everyone is against her no one has anything but pity for lu and the situation that she has found herself in once again the phone calls better stop now it was kind of funny at first but now youve crossed the line like i said if you knew anything about the hall family you would know better than threatening one of our children which includes keith now believe me you dont want to go there it ends now

2868120 holy meetings we have no magisterium no legal framework that can bring discussion to an end
2868121 used to describe the committed relationship between god and his people
2868122 talk about the sort of committed relationship that holds the anglican communion together
2868123 we will have to work this out if a province declines and a diocese says yes
2868124 enhance the beauty of anglicanism which is its capacity to absorb different views
2868125 the theological ground for a plea for moratoria is the need to avoid this confusion so that discernment continues
2868126 and in the months ahead it will be important to invite those absent from lambeth to be involved in these next stages
2868127 continue to put our relations as a communion under strain and some problems wont be resolved while those practices continue
2868128 one complication in discussing all this is that assumption readily made that the blessing of a same sex union and or the ordination of someone in an active same sex relationship is simply a matter of human rights
2868129 thats an assumption i cant accept because i think the issues about what conditions the church lays down for the blessing of unions has to be shaped by its own thinking its own praying

2868153 with those bills and the tuition coming due and hanging over your head it does put you in a bit of a panic
2868154 only to find out the lenders theyve chosen are no longer going to be offering loans this fall
2868155 some of these rates have no caps which means if interest rates rise you could be up to paying 15 to 18 percent on these loans
2868156 you know when he comes out so its very scary
2868157 i did a lot of stealing and got a lot of good hands to get to the final table
2868158 at the final table i was very lucky early i tried to play my best and i was able to get heads up with alex four hours of heads up is very hard but when you get all in with a 10 vs a 9 it feels very good he flopped a nine but i turned a 10 i feel fortunate to have won
2868159 i started playing poker because i have a lot of friends who were playing every day
2868160 i saw them winning money so i tried to learn how to play it seems like they taught me pretty well i played my first live tournament in the bahamas and i learned a lot i learn a lot every day i play ill try to keep learning now
2868161 i think ill invest the money and keep playing tournaments
2868162 i play in tournaments every day this will keep helping me do that
2868163 not only is brenes the first name in latin american poker the costa ricans are the first nation of latin american poker most of the costa ricans are the best players there arent as many players from costa rica as brazil and argentina because of population but i think were still the best we are very proud in costa rica my brother started teaching us how to play a long time ago and you can see the costa rican players doing good in tournaments but there arent so many of us we are very proud of how latin america has learned from our example
2868164 every event and the lapt as a whole have exceeded my expectations by a wide margin im very excited weve made it to this point and its going to fuel us for season 2 were really looking forward to that
2868165 in season 2 were looking to double the size of the tour if you can believe it
2868166 we plan on being in six different countries the three were in brazil costa rica uruguay and three more well announce with our complete schedule when we go back to costa rica in november to start season 2
2868167 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2868168 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2868169 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2868170 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2868171 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2868172 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2868173 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2868174 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2868175 i am deeply sorry for the losses of lives in the accident

2868274 c mo puedo posicionarme para acercarme al ideal de felicidad que yo mismo he creado para m
2868275 ive gotta get to a dry cleaners in l a
2868276 its going to come down to who has the hot hand and who matches up the best
2868277 i dont think this is a situation where you need to have complete games out of everyone the nice thing about this staff is they all bring something different
2868278 lisa was kind of our pitchers security blanket in greece
2868279 its time for these kids to step up and leave their own legacy
2868280 shes someone i totally admire because shes like a caged animal people are always watching her
2868281 theyre always wanting a piece of her and no matter what you get a smile and a happy face even if its not her best day or something is going wrong you would never know it i dont know if i could have the patience as much as people expect out of her but shes totally giving to the fans
2868282 i love the game and the impact that we are able to have on little girls is so incredible
2868283 thats the best feeling in the world leaving the park and knowing that you made some little girls day or helped them have a dream
2868284 you would never think that she was the international superstar that she is the way she carries herself
2868285 and i felt like my competitiveness would keep me on there but it was too much thats not my arena to be nasty or harsh it just wasnt me
2868286 people see the pretty face and they see her all over tv and dont realize how dominating she is on the field and what a great athlete she is
2868287 every day she pushed me i became a better athlete because of her
2868288 yeah you were a kid like me in some ways a kid who got in way too deep and couldnt get back out a kid you were trapped you still are ive been trapped
2868289 was i one of your game pieces were all six of us just game pieces
2868290 i did not cause you to be one of the six you are you were a happy accident an unwitting contribution from the human race to its own survival
2868291 i cant ask if we win i cant ask if it will all turn out okay
2868292 okay then answer this ellimist did i did i make a difference my life and my my death was i worth it did my life really matter
2868293 yes you were brave you were strong you were good you mattered
2868294 this is an extremely difficult time for all of us that knew and loved ryan and i would ask that we are given the time and space to grieve in private
2868295 i would urge anyone that knows or saw anything to come forward and assist officers from operation trident in their ongoing efforts to trace witnesses to this cold blooded and reckless act
2868296 we advise against non essential travel to georgia if you or your family have no urgent need to remain in georgia you should leave as soon as possible it is wise to do so while some air services are still available and the border remains open
2868297 we advise against all travel to the separatist regions of south ossetia abkhazia and also the upper kodori valley also known as upper abkhazia
2868298 serious fighting continues in the conflict zone of south ossetia there have also been aerial bombardments of georgian military installations outside the conflict zone at the black sea port of poti the military bases at vaziani senaki and marneuli
2868299 i decided if there was a need at camp taji then other forward operating bases might be in need also
2868300 realizing that there are hobby and woodshops on most overseas bases we envision being able to supply their noncommissioned officers in charge with hard to get requested items as well
2868301 im sure the need for certain items is still great no matter where troops are stationed
2868302 home depots are not worldwide yet and the army and air force exchange service doesnt have bulk nails screws sandpaper paint brushes replacement saw blades in their online catalog
2868303 ive created a superhero with stan lee which is based on me

2868305 scenes of crime officers pathologists and other specialists are working to establish the circumstances and the identities of the deceased
2868306 we are here to continue recovering natural resources and the consolidation of nationalization
2868307 my big dream is to have unity among the bolivian people
2868308 they will either talk more in the language of de facto secession or start to negotiate
2868309 even if the government is strengthened it has to negotiate there is no other option
2868310 ummmm im obsessing over my internet pages and stupid peoples reactions to them no longer existing move on
2868311 de eerste offici le boodschap waarin zawahiri zich uitdrukt in het engels
2868312 de bevolking op de jihad in pakistan te steunen en somt hij een reeks grieven op tegen de pakistaanse regering en het amerikaanse engagement in dit land
2868313 if he turned any more cheeks hed have to pull down his pants
2868314 those who delivered us into this mess can not be trusted to get us out of it
2868315 if you have a green party i want to join
2868316 the agent said we are going to be watching him we cant be watching you
2868317 they are humans no matter what they do all i was trying to do was the right thing i was just trying to do my job
2868318 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats actions plans threats amp actions towards therapist
2868319 believe it or not even with all this i was still trying to protect bruces anonymity
2868320 he was going to go out in a blaze of glory that he was going to take everybody out with him
2868321 he is a revenge killer when he feels he has been slighted and especially towards women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
2868322 he very calmly thanked me for ruining his life and letting the fbi now be able to prosecute him for the murders and it was all my fault
2868323 expect intel to focus even more marketing resources around that name and the core i7 products starting now
2868324 una reforma constitucional de fondo como la que requiere la naci n en estos momentos podr a desviar la atenci n nacional de los problemas econ micos sociales que nos amenazan y generar un clima m s de desacuerdos que de concertaci n comenzando por la forma misma de emprender esa tarea
2868325 when i heard about it all it totally made me numb in a state of shock because so many people out here are working for these people im just not understanding its left me in a state of shock
2868326 by your number of posts ill assume youre not trolling here
2868327 what do you like about living in the us especially about living in texas arizona nevada or connecticut
2868328 quand jai touch je ne savais si javais fait 3e 6e 8e
2868329 there certainly is a level of isi complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organisations such as the taliban
2868330 i cant say to what level of leadership that goes to but there are indications of complicity on the part of isi to the extent that they are facilitating these militant groups that come out of the tribal areas in pakistan
2868331 unfortunately we see a higher number of non pashtun non afghanistan fighters this year than this time last year
2868332 they are really from a variety of ethnic groupings some are from areas in pakistan some are from places like chechnya some are from europe and some are from other arab countries
2868333 but when you have a problem of porous borders and fighters and weapons and resources and command and control and logistics being brought in from outside of afghanistan that adds a complicating context to the insurgency
2868334 we come with militaries that have advantages in command and control in speed in lethality in logistics in intelligence in all those things
2868335 if nations provide forces with restrictions what it does is it decreases those advantages
2868336 how fast we can get there i dont know but it is important that the international community remain committed to afghanistan
2868337 were cheering for both countries because china welcomes the u s
2868338 i dont know the rules of archery very clearly actually i dont even know how many members are on a team

2868342 orders will still be done through manaccom who publish and distribute our products locally we think its important our distributor is involved in the process
2868343 were very open to partnerships with similar companies as the home and smb market is a big part of our business
2868344 nine out of 10 customers dont have adequate backup solutions
2868345 making the software available for the technicians will help us solve one of the biggest areas where customers are falling down

2868394 ive come along way ive dragged my family halfway around the world away from my dad and mum and everybody who needs me back in australia and today it just feels like its worthwhile
2868395 it feels like ive conquered a huge mountain and its just a great day
2868396 there is a strong desire among world trade organisation members to conclude the doha round
2868397 it would be odd if australia were to suddenly signal that it wanted that unwound
2868398 its tremendously difficult to hot wire a car thats fitted with an engine immobiliser
2868399 the electronic device disrupts critical components needed to start the vehicles engine
2868400 the mandatory installation of immobilisers in new cars and improved vehicle safety is driving down car theft
2868401 all motorists should invest in an immobiliser and remain vigilant with their keys
2868402 tough laws and heavy penalties send a strong message to potential offenders but prevention is still the best cure
2868403 each stolen car is factored into car insurance premiums and hits the hip pocket of every driver
2868404 in our earlier study areas of stress were largely located at the outer suburban mortgage belts where car dependency is high
2868405 in this study we have seen the number and geographical range of vulnerable households creep inwards as fuel costs and interest rates rise
2868406 worse the deficits in urban infrastructure and services meant the more vulnerable households had less ability to adapt to higher fuel costs by taking public transport
2868407 across australias cities public transport is bursting at the seams during peak hour which gives clear evidence people will use public transport when it becomes just too costly not to
2868408 state governments nationwide are debating measures such as underground loops and light rail which is great but will only assist inner urban residents who are already the least vulnerable in society we need to get new trains and buses into our outer suburbs
2868409 since world war ii australias cities have been planned on the presumption that cars running on low priced fuel would be the dominant means of transportation
2868410 the australian senate estimates peak oil to occur by 2030 so a broad comprehensive plan to reconstruct australian suburbs to reduce petrol reliance must begin now
2868411 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
2868412 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2868413 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2868414 president saakashvili briefed the vice pesident on the russian campaign against military and civilian targets throughout georgia
2868415 the vice president praised president saakashvili for his governments restraint offers of ceasefire and disengagement of georgian forces from the zone of conflict in the south ossetian region of the country
2868416 id never thought about the size of a characters hands ever

2868449 i think the military conflict in georgia is the key factor in pushing up oil prices this morning so much has happened so quickly since we first heard of russias attack last week
2868450 i think there is also some degree of a technical rebound after oils sharp fall on friday

2868459 care homes can be such miserable places you sit there all day staring out the window with no one to talk to
2868460 i thought it would be lovely to give a home and family life to one or two people who would otherwise be sitting around there
2868461 i started asking people if they wanted to move out of their care homes and live with me and ive had dozens of offers they are queuing up

2868487 he declared he also wrote poems attacking traditional christianity and the work of christian missionaries
2868488 through frank marshall davis obama had an admitted relationship with someone who was publicly identified as a member of the communist party usa cpusa the record shows that obama was in hawaii from 1971 1979 where at some point in time he developed a close relationship almost like a son with davis listening to his poetry and getting advice on his career path but obama in his book dreams from my father refers to him repeatedly as just frank the reason is apparent davis was a known communist who belonged to a party subservient to the soviet union in fact the 1951 report of the commission on subversive activities to the legislature of the territory of hawaii identified him as a cpusa member whats more anti communist congressional committees including the house un american activities committee huac accused davis of involvement in several communist front organizations
2868489 obamas victory was more than a progressive move it was a dialectical leap ushering in a qualitatively new era of struggle
2868490 the black book of communism a scholarly accounting of communisms crimes counts about 94 million murdered by the supposed champions of the common man 20 million for the soviets alone and some say that number is too low
2868491 we need instead to put up a fight show our determination to change what is wrong with this country put our case with clarity and conviction and ensure the public realise what is at stake when it comes to elections rather than opinion polls we know what will ensure default first if we try to do too many things and dont do enough of them well second if we dont follow through the things we have started third if we worry too much about our opponents fourth if we argue among ourselves failing to defend each other and our leader fifth if we water down our core convictions gordon brown has strong values and convictions the route to victory needs us to do more first see the world through the eyes of voters the best way of defending our record is by offering and honest assessment of it people will only listen to what we have done right if we are candid about what we have not employment has never been higher but people are worried about housing crime is down but people think its up universal nursery education has been delivered but people worry about care for the elderly second we need ideology not just pragmatism labour needs to stake out its ground as the party of fairness and freedom we must promote fairness but also give people the power to shape their own lives so in the economy in public services in community life we need to give people more power third tell a compelling national story britain is no longer a country in decline we have one of the largest economies in the world the nhs has been rescued from third world standards we won the 2012 olympics because people respect us not pity us we must engage with the world not retreat from it finally political institutions become trapped and we were created to challenge what exists and change it we need to open up politics since 1997 new labour has redrawn the political map britain is richer and fairer but there are new issues that challenge us to think afresh building on our record but also learning from it the tories are betting the house on labour giving up the fight theyve got another thing coming
2868492 were quite used to fascist countries not allowing freedom of speech
2868493 italy suffer from a really bad background as one of the ifpis was formed in italy during the fascist years and now they have a fascist leader in the country silvio berlusconi
2868494 berlusconi is also the most powerful person in italian media owning a lot of companies that compete with the pirate bay

2868507 explic bush que mencion una conversaci n telef nica con el presidente ruso
2868508 has nothing to do with the preparation of the games
2868509 its very sad whats going on in the world and we share the concern of the ioc but i would refer to the politicians for that
2868510 but personally i do believe that the olympics is something that can make things happen and im sure the olympic values and olympic ideals will be considered
2868511 it is a national problem and the ioc is not supposed to comment on situations like this we just hope that its going to be solved fast and it seems they made progress today we hope for the best
2868512 this is a wonderful opportunity for two organizing committees who have the same common interests to celebrate a little bit the time we have together in beijing
2868513 this is about our friendship our partnership our willingness to work together for the good of the olympic movement
2868514 last week furlong told the ioc all but three venues in vancouver will be completed by the end of this year and the ioc told the sochi officials that they have much work to do killy said sochi must build 70 percent to 80 percent of its venues
2868515 they in my opinion are not late but they do not have one single day to lose or to waste
2868516 tusd has been cutting back on programs but tanque verde is still offering art music and spanish
2868517 at soleng tom elementary where the boys had been the pta bought a mobile computer lab for the school there was not enough room for a whole computer lab
2868518 but at tanque verde elementary there is a permanent computer lab a science room i just think it will be a better less stressful education for them and they will get the extras tusd is not able to offer anymore
2868519 they also will have smaller class sizes and that all adds up to teachers who arent as stressed and to a better education
2868520 this year flowing wells did something that we didnt do before
2868521 we sent out postcards about our high school to a targeted area in tusd that was close to our boundaries
2868522 some students leave and come back leave and come back
2868523 were seeing that there are a lot more choices out there
2868524 we absolutely expect to get kids for school from the letter
2868525 it was a straightforward message making families aware that we were now an option
2868526 did not tie our promotion to a tusd related activity
2868527 the majority of tusd resident families who applied to us have children who are not now attending tusd schools
2868528 that all of the rest of the districts have participated in open enrollment for many years now so any significant increase in new application numbers would likely come from a district like tusd that has prohibited participation through local school district governing board policy
2868529 amazed at the number of student applications that are crossing my desk that indicate students returning from charter and private schools
2868530 we always receive students from outside the district each year but i have no sense of how many may have enrolled this year
2868531 i cant wait to see the numbers after the first day of school to assess whether through returning students and students from other districts we have made up for the number of students who have left the district in recent years
2868532 the decision was hard because we were very happy where we were
2868533 the agent said we are going to be watching him we cant be watching you

2868537 he was going to go out in a blaze of glory that he was going to take everybody out with him
2868538 he is a revenge killer when he feels he has been slighted and especially towards women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
2868539 he very calmly thanked me for ruining his life and letting the fbi now be able to prosecute him for the murders and it was all my fault
2868540 he has never taken formal classes at all he just paints and has learned by himself
2868541 most young people they are interested in painting like cartoon characters he paints like he has in mind something different he paints like he is much older
2868542 i told him do you know that you are exceptional
2868543 i told him you are talented and we are going to work together to get you a show
2868544 its great im too young to have an art show so its like ive never imagined
2868545 i knew how to draw horses and people would ask how did you draw that and i would say that i didnt know
2868546 i dont know how to explain it but it was just there i just painted with my eye
2868547 it was my hobby my education and my life he said
2868548 my brother tells me every day to paint or draw something little from the corner of my mind
2868549 my art is more symbolic to show an emotion or a feeling or a concept or give a message my art is only symbolic and surreal
2868550 n o disse isto apenas a vladimir putin mas tamb m a dmitri medvedev

2868558 this fund is an excellent choice to anchor most investors bond portfolios especially those unwilling to take on substantial credit risk it boasts low expenses broad diversification and experienced management
2868559 compare the growth of a hypothetical 10 000 investment in this fund with the growth of the same amount in up to 2 other vanguard funds and a benchmark to get an accurate comparison choose a time range that covers the number of years all funds have been in existence move your mouse over the graph to see the changes in returns

2868603 this is exactly what we needed to do a lot of people wondered if we could emotionally handle the ups and downs theres a lot of room for improvement but that final day is going to be the day we put it all together

2868615 you have made the good profession you have declared among many that you are a believer but now you are beginning to live like an unbeliever it is very very possible that you never knew him that up until this point it has all been a very deceiving work of the flesh
2868616 why do i dress the way i do what are my motives why do i wear a bikini why do i wear tight low cut clothing is it what i want or what god wants

2868620 at our shows not all is so electronic the keyboard is organic and in a 85 of the presentations we have a drummer

2868625 blah blah blah blah blogger is juvenile blah blah blah blah be careful what you say blah blah blah eventually someone wont be able to take it anymore blah blah blah not a threat blah blah not amusing to us blah blah blah im incredibly boring
2868626 im not sure what bothered me more about this show the frankly exploitative treatment of its clients some of whom are obviously people in great emotional turmoil or its patently right wing christian solutions for everyones problems either way there are better examinations of paranormal phenomena on most cable channels without the smarmy elements contained in this particular series and if youre interested in this sort of thing i recommend you start with those as for paranormal state skip it
2868627 lets face it scaring classmates witless is a tried and true method for attempting to get laid
2868628 we are students we are seekers and sometimes we are warriors
2868629 having watched the first few episodes of paranormal state i am willing to say they are just as ridiculous as scooby doo was and not nearly as entertaining
2868630 keep up the excellent work have you noticed that when listening to shows most of the people in the chatrooms arent even following along with topic instead they all sit there and namedrop and to try and be somebody
2868631 i agree with the blog comment you left for chip regarding his august 16th event how sad that only the people who can blow an extra 50 or 75 get to go see him i beleive that those given the gift should share it freely to help people and not fill their bank accounts
2868632 so you know the way into the palace how does someone like you know such information
2868633 youd only have enough money to buy the passage not many can buy the later
2868634 too bad your feet cant climb walls for you boy
2868635 so you think me trapped as in a cage but this cage does not have a roof
2868636 ha ha ha it really seems like im supposed to go to the dungeon huh
2868637 odd how a secret entrance would be in the dungeon
2868638 damn seems my luck isnt gonna take me all the way and back
2868639 i am not here for you what have you done to deserve this sentence
2868640 nothing you or i can ever know of my young friend
2868641 i am pained to not know the fate of my children or of my wife which has been far more painfull then all the lashings i have recieved
2868642 i have let all these people remain captives i have not helped all the people of this land to maintain freedom and equality
2868643 you sound like a sultans wife who has power common people have no power but what we make
2868644 it is our job to make our power and to wield it to much a task it would seem for some and that is the reason for our lack of power
2868645 she is no longer a prisoner but a free person so long as i live
2868646 stay here for a bit ill be back with some clothes for you
2868647 i intend to steal back what a thief has already stolen
2868648 i had a map to get into the palace thats how i found that passage that lead to the prison but i didnt expect to come upon all the people locked up and beaten unfeed and mistreated
2868649 if i should achieve my goal all will be well again for this land and the sultan exposed for the traitor he truely is
2868650 so the boy returns i will have him shackled before the king by sunrise
2868651 malakaha is my name boy i congratulate you on such a feat as you have done but now your time ends
2868652 this boy is the heir to the throne that you stole
2868653 i was mistaken to take you for the true sultan of this land
2868654 sir their is a rebellion lead by a clothed soldier with hundreds fighting against us we cant hold the doors much longer and many are deserting or joining this rebellion what should we do sir
2868655 not many can shake off such a powerful desire to have a ruler to rule them least of all one with a tongue as sharp as a sword and mind as quick as an arrow
2868656 you are just in time to see this land be born anew
2868657 you get off at the terminal and your luggage will be there waiting for you
2868658 well did you make sure to put sugar in his coffee
2868659 ok so what in heavens name stopped anyone from hurting me up here
2868660 were a nation of laws and we must enforce our laws were also a nation of immigrants and we must uphold that tradition which has strengthened our country in so many ways these are not contradictory goals america can be a lawful society and a welcoming society at the same time an immigration reform bill needs to be comprehensive because all elements of this problem must be addressed together or none of them will be solved at all
2868661 the raids in postville have plainly shown that the administration is acting neither lawfully nor welcomingly
2868662 we are not lawful when we interrupt investigations spearheaded by our own department of labor we are not lawful when we implement fear tactics and deportation only policies or railroad men and women through the judicial process without adequate representation or a full understanding of their rights
2868663 and we are most certainly not welcoming when hardworking mothers and fathers are not allowed to raise their us citizen children in the country of their birth or when those who work the longest hours at the most undesirable jobs are treated like terrorists simply for waking up and going to work
2868664 these measures have nothing to do with the comprehensive reform president bush promised so today i am demanding that he remember his promise and his commitment to justice by placing a moratorium on raids
2868665 a transfer of fabio to trigoria i dont want to comment this rumour which appeared in the press

2868669 the scissors didnt cut to his liking he was trying to cut suture material he said they were dull he tossed them across the room one of the nurses had to dodge the scissors
2868670 these incidents happen because the or environment is so high stress
2868671 surgeons hold patients lives in their hands yet theyre dependent on equipment and people who are outside their control this incident was over a year ago and there has not been another incident with this physician
2868672 you have an industry in crisis where people are having to do much more with limited resources that combination can be a potent one

2868676 i wanted to make a really big noise about the show
2868677 torchwood really represents the essence of the channel its sexy action packed and a little bit subversive
2868678 so rumor has it that the bbc was unhappy and russell had to rush to write her out of series 3
2868679 personally id be very happy if they didnt add any more principle characters between jack ianto and gwen there are plenty of possible stories to tell for a season thats only having a five episode run
2868680 its very unjust never once did i attempt to thrust atheism on these children i was scrupulously careful not to do that i was simply trying to persuade them to look at the evidence it was a pro evolution point rather than an anti religious point
2868681 i do get a bit exasperated at people hearing what they expect me to say rather than what i do say
2868682 perhaps the most powerful idea ever to occur to a human mind
2868683 we find no vestige of a beginning no prospect of an end
2868684 if you actually look at the god delusion including those bits people think are strident and shrill and so on i like to think theyre actually funny
2868685 a petty unjust unforgiving control freak a vindictive bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser a misogynistic homophobic
2868686 its a bit like the dilemma of a doctor who has a patient who has terminal cancer and the doctor has to decide whether to tell the truth or regard the patients private consolation as outweighing the truth if i were talking to an individual who had recently been bereaved i probably would hold my tongue in a way that i dont for anybody who chooses to read the book
2868687 you cant appreciate english literature for a start unless youre pretty knowledgeable about the bible if you dont understand what it means when someone alludes to
2868688 just glorious and its not just the music the drama of the passion of jesus as a work of fiction is something you can lose yourself in just as one can reading a novel you dont have to believe that heathcliff and cathy really existed to get caught up in the emotion
2868689 but if your main object is to understand how the universe works the question of whether or not theres a god in the universe is profoundly important
2868690 so i wouldnt wish to muzzle myself or anybody else for the sake of a skirmish in american schools about evolution
2868691 it was the taming of the shrew yesterday and that was a lovely day of calm
2868692 no we just put that on there for a laugh

2868702 the doctor is scarred by losing his race he cant seem to hold on to anyone he is entirely alone even with the ones who do stick with him he is to all intents and purposes eternal thats his tragedy
2868703 its too easy to become defined by your press cuttings
2868704 im much happier going on a radio show and talking nonsense for 20 minutes i am an actor after all
2868705 he was 22 and had only just started acting yet his confidence and determination were extraordinary
2868706 often when we go out together large groups of women will visibly go weak at the knees
2868707 assume that growing up in a manse must be a puritanical existence
2868708 i was a junkie a doctor who junkie every saturday evening at 5 35 i could not be disturbed any noise or distinctive movement would be met with the wrath of a furious nine year old i was worshipping at the shrine
2868709 i didnt say a word to anyone apart from my doctor who doll
2868710 he was a very bright boy quick and witty he was an accomplished actor from early on
2868711 im the only scottish actor alive who hasnt been in taggart
2868712 you feel the weight of history there and its scary
2868713 wed established that we were both fans and he seemed the obvious choice i think david brings to it a fantastic sense of humour he can find lightness even in the darkest of scenes
2868714 the hijab has never been a problem for me in bahrain you grow up with it
2868715 there are more women in sport all the time from countries like qatar and kuwait you can choose to wear the hijab or not for me its liberating

2868730 i dont know who you thinks going to by this thing
2868731 im always thinking i like growing business thats exciting i like developing energy but how does it affect the last and the least what can we do to make it better for those people who probably never will get to the front of the line how can we make their lives better how can we pull them along how can we make them the most they can be how can we make them build their self esteem and self respect what more can we do
2868732 democrats will win elections when they figure out how to talk to those families
2868733 every time ive compromised ive lost when i held firm i won the problem with too many environmentalists today is that they are trying to write the compromise instead of letting those we pay to compromise do it they think they get power by taking people to lunch or being taken to lunch when in reality they are only being taken
2868734 this regulator has been of interest to researchers and clinicians for many years now because its controller or receptor found on the surface of blood cells is critical in regulating their many functions
2868735 because our discovery shows precisely what the receptor looks like and also how it works we can now begin to design new drugs to rein in the deadly abnormal blood cells
2868736 abnormal gm csf signalling is pivotal to a variety of serious and difficult to treat diseases
2868737 we are seeking the intervention of both the prime minister raila odinga and president mwai kibaki to save mr wachiras land who has been rendered homeless
2868738 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2868739 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2868740 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2868741 passadinha r pida alias conta se de onde saimos e at chegarmos
2868742 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2868743 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2868744 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2868745 well i had better go do that before i post this
2868746 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2868747 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2868748 while emcee jesse jackson just completely loses his shit screaming
2868749 we are looking at some options at the moment three or four different options about the strike department which we hope will come to a happy conclusion
2868750 hopefully we will have someone in for the start of the season
2868751 we have one or two options were looking at and its possible well sign someone this week
2868752 the strikers position is something thats been pressing since the end of last season but now there is some light at the end of the tunnel

2868756 my big dream is to have unity among the bolivian people
2868757 they will either talk more in the language of de facto secession or start to negotiate
2868758 even if the government is strengthened it has to negotiate there is no other option
2868759 gori is being bombed massively from the air and from artillery as well
2868760 are not there yet but it looks like they are getting ready for it
2868761 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2868762 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
2868763 we must find the means for an immediate ceasefire accepted by both sides we must talk about negotiations and a political solution there is no military solution
2868764 they were on a mass scale and were directed against individuals
2868765 completely committed to helping senator obama become the next president of the united states and urging all of you to do the same
2868766 you could argue that no ones ready to be president
2868767 the constitution sets qualifications for president and then the people choose who they think would be the better president i think we have to choose i think that he obama should win and i think we will win
2868768 you dont get to cut down the net until youve won the championship
2868769 that allows anyone to file a case not even show up and then not have to pay a price for it

2868772 any proof of concept demonstrative code partially or fully functional or malicious mobile agent such as malware that is publicly available
2868773 the public availability of proof of concept code increases the likelihood that the vulnerability will face live exploitation either through targeted attempts or through a mass distribution method like in an exploit toolkit
2868774 common outlets for these public exploits are exploit testing tools like metasploit and canvas
2868775 everything looks good to me for next weeks confederation cup at flamboro
2868776 if he comes out of this the way he should well be at flamboro next week
2868777 its a cool night and the track hasnt got a lot of bounce to it he was impressive
2868778 he doesnt take much training ill probably train him a little tighter this week with going the half mile next weekend and probably take him over to flamboro for training
2868779 if he comes out of the confederation cup without being bruised up too much well probably race him here at mohawk in the simcoe stakes and then go to kentucky in september if he happens to get beat up you never know whatll happen on a half mile track then well probably skip the simcoe and go right to kentucky with him
2868780 the hijab has never been a problem for me in bahrain you grow up with it

2868802 ive been running a lot i might as well do it for a reason
2868803 our goal is to have vacation rental properties located along the entire coastline of oregon since the founding of oregon beach vacations in 2004 we have been approached by many homeowners along the southern oregon coast to manage their properties with the opening of our new florence office this august we will be able to give property owners and those interested in vacationing from florence to bandon and all areas in between the service they deserve and expect from our organization
2868804 we have kept a list of homeowners that have expressed interest in joining our rental program and we are just getting to the point where we can reconnect with these homeowners and offer our services to them within twelve months we are looking to have upwards of 40 properties on the south oregon coast from organic growth and we will be looking into acquisitions in this area
2868805 heres a hot intelligent chick ive said hi now what
2868806 i like you let me take you out for a nice dinner
2868807 weve worked a lot for this objective usually in competitions of this type you never feel you are 100 per cent but well have to do everything possible to be near to it
2868808 everyone knows what the level of football is in the czech republic something which was also seen at the european championships
2868809 i think everybody should come to minneapolis its the most beautiful city in the united states and everybody is going to want to come here i think it will be tough to keep away from this city its going to be so great
2868810 this has gone way beyond rodney dangerfield i get no respect disrespect
2868811 we wanted lots of blood and guts and gore as much as you did
2868812 illegal means illegal we need strong enforcement of the law
2868813 we wanted lots of blood and guts and gore as much as you did
2868814 i made a decision on my own without talking to edwards or anybody to try to help them move to a community or to try to get away from those folks
2868815 freds the kind of guy thats very helpful to friends hes just a big hearted guy
2868816 when i heard his statement i didnt put any black heartedness on fred who was concerned about what these staffers were going through
2868817 i want to see him first before i make any judgment there
2868818 i know hes been working out but i just want to sit down and talk to him face to face and make sure everythings set up for him here so he can be successful
2868819 im sure theres some apprehension there but i know he wants to get back going get back up here with the guys
2868820 we took him out and are just easing him back in
2868821 he feels good and i want to make sure he keeps feeling good
2868822 there certainly is a level of isi complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organisations such as the taliban
2868823 i cant say to what level of leadership that goes to but there are indications of complicity on the part of isi to the extent that they are facilitating these militant groups that come out of the tribal areas in pakistan
2868824 unfortunately we see a higher number of non pashtun non afghanistan fighters this year than this time last year
2868825 they are really from a variety of ethnic groupings some are from areas in pakistan some are from places like chechnya some are from europe and some are from other arab countries
2868826 but when you have a problem of porous borders and fighters and weapons and resources and command and control and logistics being brought in from outside of afghanistan that adds a complicating context to the insurgency
2868827 we come with militaries that have advantages in command and control in speed in lethality in logistics in intelligence in all those things
2868828 if nations provide forces with restrictions what it does is it decreases those advantages
2868829 how fast we can get there i dont know but it is important that the international community remain committed to afghanistan
2868830 crunch why do i feel so squeezed and other unsolved economic mysteries is a highly readable and witty stroll through the forests of economics and tax and budget policy
2868831 she had a neckline as low as the nasdaq in 01 curves like sine waves and a dress tighter than the global oil supply bernstein sorts through the statistics that show overall economic growth but dead in the water status for a vast majority of americans in the middle around the median income of about 50 000 a year and on the bottom
2868832 the share of income going to the top 1 percent of households in 2005 was at 22 percent higher than in any year since 1929 the year of the crash and the onset of the great depression
2868833 turning economics into a tool for the rich and powerful
2868834 what this barrage of percentages is telling us is that if you feel squeezed chances are its because you are squeezed
2868835 most of the indicators that matter most to us in our everyday lives jobs wages mid level incomes prices at the pump and the grocery store health care retirement security college tuition are coming in at stress inducing levels
2868836 we can invest early and try to get good trajectories for our families children and communities
2868837 we can do these things or we can engage in damage control
2868838 you need a more robust better run and better endowed public sector to pull off more investment in education and more economic security for ordinary citizens
2868839 to treat those cancerous inequities our minds our spirits our sense of community our concern and love for our children and those of others our votes lets use these tools wisely lets use them now
2868840 we wanted lots of blood and guts and gore as much as you did
2868841 there was a lot of economic prosperity under the bill clinton administration and they latinos needed someone to bring that back
2868842 i dont think now that the polls show that latinos are going for barack that we can skip as quickly over what happened back in the primaries versus hillary
2868843 latinos are voting 79 percent democratic in the primaries but cant find a single story on lou dobbs and other cnn shows
2868844 we see the latino population is growing with clout and importance the swing vote and a number of other things without necessarily throwing up their own jesse jackson and al sharpton
2868845 the latino hispanic america has moved into the american mainstream at an exceedingly rapid rate
2868846 that is a very superficial analysis of what was happening
2868847 then you saw 80 percent of blacks voting for obama and 80 percent of latinos voting for clinton so the numbers were supporting this
2868848 there are latinos who are racist toward blacks and there are african americans who are racist or prejudiced toward latinos but i dont think that is the majority of latinos i do think there is a certain ignorance among certain segments of latinos in the community because we dont do a good enough job in introducing these communities to each other
2868849 these arent mexicans who just arrived from mexico a while ago but first and second generation latinos
2868850 it was so clear from the reported story that they werent for mccain but they were against obama
2868851 he has been in the senate a lot longer than obama has
2868852 the state of schools the economy the war those issues do cut across differences
2868853 the latino vote is definitely something that both candidates will court
2868854 we wanted lots of blood and guts and gore as much as you did
2868855 we wanted lots of blood and guts and gore as much as you did
2868856 sheep and cattle constitute 11 per cent of australias total greenhouse gas emissions
2868857 kangaroos however produce relatively little methane because they are not ruminants
2868858 eating more kangaroo has an incredible array of benefits for our environment for dietary health and as a tasty red meat
2868859 the soft padded feet of kangaroos are far kinder to the land than the hooves of sheep and cattle which have caused untold damage and consequent land erosion
2868860 negotiations with shell to sign a deal to process oil shale in jordan are nearing an end

2868862 america must reduce its dependence on the coal and petroleum products that contribute to global warming
2868863 theyre waiting to see what ethanol reallys going to do

2868934 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
2868935 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
2868936 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop

2869028 but then i hit a great putt on 17 i dont know why it didnt break i feel like i hit a good putt i hit it left edge and it just didnt break and it lipped out on the left and then 18s just a tough hole

2869140 your concern about weaponization of the system and environmental risks are proper and deserve solid answers for the answers and a whole bunch of other great information let me point you to a special edition of ad astra magazine produced by the national space society if you look on page 29 youll see the answers as to why space based solar power satellites cannot be weaponized let me add to that list the following items the dod will not own or operate sbsp satellites energy production and distribution is outside of its title x authority in my opinion the dod merely wants to be a customer of safe clean energy and is most comfortable purchasing its energy from commercial vendors just as it does today the interest shown by the national security space office nsso in hosting the work done by the space based solar power study group interest was largely because nasa does not do energy and the doe does not do space in other words it was a ball being dropped along organizational lines the security related interest of the nsso as it stepped in to host the study was three fold provide more energy sources to hopefully alleviate energy competition as a trigger for war between the major powers in the 21st century achieve american energy independence from foreign oil suppliers who attract us vital interests in areas and with peoples with whom we really would prefer to interact with in ways other than a dependent customer supplier relationship provide a source of clean energy that provides america with broader options regarding carbon contamination and clean up as well as improved ability to make progress on treaties such as kyoto simple inspections of the waveguides for either laser or microwave transmitters on the satellites can easily verify that the beam cannot be focused narrowly to create a weapons effect such inspections can and likely will be conducted at time of insurance inspection licensing and registration before launch international inspectors would be welcome and encouraged the goal is to have international corporations own and operate these satellites and provide power to international the key to defense of these huge birds deterrence by mutual defense through broad international ownership and international customership an attack on a satellite is an attack against all as for environmental safety especially when transmitting power into disaster areas and feeding power to forward bases i envision spreading the several kilometer in diameter rectifying antenna on air bases or other relatively secure areas in the theater of operations and using ground broadcasting from there to the forward forces first responders or relief workers that way we keep the beam from space very broad and desaturated no way do we want any accusation of this being a weapon keep in mind that there are two forms of power broadcasting that can be done from satellites the first form is by microwave at 2 45 ghz and 5 8 ghz these are the same frequencies that are used by internet wifi cordless phones and blue tooth since the beam is fairly well focused on the rectifying antenna we will prevent interference with those systems in addition the intensity of a cellular telephone placed next to the head delivers more radiation to the user than space based solar power possibly can the second form of power transmission from space is by laser at 1 0 microns silicon or 0 86 microns galvium arsinide laser transmissions are obviously more focused that microwave but still must be spread to prevent overheating of the system which also removes the risk of weaponization as for multinational approaches when it comes to space government led multinational ventures are risky for a very strange and almost counterintuitive reason the international space station is a case in point we assembled it with our very best allies and partners but everybody got their feelings hurt in the process in my opinion it is far less likely that we will cooperate on such projects government to government in the near future because of the miserable experience of the iss everybody was waiting for various governments to cut their red tape and stood around tensely waiting for last minute funding and various approvals for go aheads budgets changed frequently which drove some dramatic redesigns that impacted several other players as a result the project had all the joy of loaning money to relatives with gambling problems i personally believe that in order to make space based solar power a reality that business must lead the way however government does have a role governments should conduct some r amp d to improve efficiencies inherent to the system remove bureaucratic barriers and fund experiments to incrementally buy down some of the risk that business must take on examples include increasing the efficiencies of solar cells lowering the cost and increasing the turnaround rate for launch vehicles advancing the development of an international space traffic control system securing the orbital parking slots and frequency allowances for these satellites and conducting concept demonstrators it is also my opinion that it is best if commercial companies take government research and lead the development effort for space based solar power and then own and operate such systems in the first instance they partner more broadly and far easier than governments do take a boeing aircraft for example nearly 40 of the components on the latest boeing aircraft are made by airbus conversely nearly 40 of the components on the latest airbus aircraft are made by boeing that did not take massive government negotiations business is international by its very nature take a look at the products in your home they are likely a hodgepodge of gadgets with parts made all over the world and assembled somewhere else its nothing personal its just business the problem with government leadership is that it often gets personal best of all when business is enabled to get the job done they do so on their own dime not the taxpayers i like it when the taxpayers get a break i want space based solar power in the worst way but not on the backs of the taxpayer and only when the business case is sufficiently made that industry can profitably sustain the effort over the long run we must avoid the fits and starts in industry that did such great damage to the overall space industry in the 1990s when wild enthusiasm collided with reality on several projects in the end i want the commercial sector to do it and i want my government to clear the obstacles such as itar which i hate with a passion out of the way so americans can work with their international business partners to start bending the steel to make it happen space based solar power is a huge undertaking i need fleets of reusable rockets and spaceplanes to get er done since these birds must be launched into a prograde orbit i need lots and lots of lift coming out of florida and hopefully other domestic launch sites to make it happen that said current sites cannot accommodate the full compliment of launches that i will need without massive expansion i will need launches from international partners as well if led by american industry this will make america the hub of commercial space launch once again with the busiest launch industry in the world think jobs jobs jobs the shuttle is peanuts compared to this project i want to hit on the fact that space based solar power transcends other projects because it crosses the lines of 5 major policy areas energy environment commerce space and education every dollar spent on sbsp addresses five sets of policies where else can government and the business sector collaborate to get a 5 to 1 return on investment for our future space based solar power as part of an energy diet that should be rich with a variety of safe clean energy sources for america its allies and the world it is not the answer to all problems but it is part of solution

2869163 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2869164 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2869165 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2869166 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2869167 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2869168 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2869169 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2869170 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2869171 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2869172 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2869173 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2869174 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2869175 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2869176 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2869177 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2869178 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2869179 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2869180 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2869181 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2869182 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2869183 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2869184 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2869185 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2869186 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2869187 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2869188 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2869189 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2869190 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2869191 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2869192 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2869193 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2869194 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2869195 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2869196 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2869197 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2869198 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2869199 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2869200 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2869201 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2869202 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2869203 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2869204 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2869205 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2869206 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2869207 who are open to doing something on the production side
2869208 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2869209 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2869210 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

2869212 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2869213 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2869214 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2869215 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2869216 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2869217 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2869218 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2869219 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2869220 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2869221 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2869222 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2869223 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2869224 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2869225 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2869226 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2869227 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2869228 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

2869232 i think the intentions are great but i think it is going to be an extremely difficult process
2869233 probably the biggest challenge is going to be not only getting lender approval but also the approval of the investors who bought the paper
2869234 half the time these mortgages were sold in big blocks how do you pull one mortgage out of the block
2869235 it is another tool for lenders to help keep borrowers in their homes
2869236 we want to ensure there are appropriate safeguards to help deserving borrowers while keeping the program voluntary for lenders
2869237 i would take the guarantee of the government any day
2869238 its unjust if you were in the mortgage industry for a long time employers think youre used to making so much money that youre not going to take 50 000 or 70 000 a year they also think mortgage lenders are all money hungry pigs but its not true employers are missing out on some really outstanding employees

2869260 you put the ball on the ground you have to run and thats the way when we talked about it he wanted it and thats the way i wanted it
2869261 its more of a team unity thing nick and i ran it i told eric day 1 that unless i pass out i am going to try to do everything that everyone else does
2869262 im no different aside from being a little gray headed and a little bit older
2869263 you get used to a new guy and it takes a little bit of time and usually you get the luxury of doing it in the spring where no ones really around or cheering for laps
2869264 i need to call my mom and have her tape espn
2869265 hopefully i got on there today with a penalty lap it was weird because its a penalty lap and youre running it because youve done something wrong and people are cheering it was a little different
2869266 you have to get used to a guys voice his placement of his hands how quickly hes getting out you try to make it look as effortless as possible
2869267 i think its kind of funny but yet serves its purpose i think things like that are important in the fact that everyone is involved in it
2869268 when you come out here and the fans are going crazy and having fun it just helps you get through the day
2869269 weve just got to make sure were handling everything around him so we have the chemistry we need to have before the season starts
2869270 the ball comes out hard and fast and straight and long so thats always good
2869271 its been a whirlwind for him and theres a lot of new information going in were progressing quickly

2869279 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2869280 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2869281 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2869282 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2869283 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

2869285 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2869286 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2869287 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2869288 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2869289 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2869290 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2869291 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2869292 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2869293 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2869294 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2869295 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2869296 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2869297 the flights are ongoing to redeploy the elements of the georgian contingent so that they can deal with the security issues in their country
2869298 we can accommodate that obviously it was not expected but it is something the effects of which we can certainly mitigate
2869299 ive struggled with my skin since i was very young
2869300 not have a clear position on resolution 1 10 personally
2869301 ignores the fact that the essential anglican stance towards the nature and use of the bible has already been provided by the thirty nine articles of religion and expounded in the first book of homilies to which those articles refer
2869302 appeal to a scholarly use of the bible is far too often a device for evading the plain teaching of the scriptures the words mean what they say
2869303 just pull up on the reins straighten her out you cant let her do that

2869339 not long ago we came up with an interesting set of facts a billion hours ago human life appeared on earth
2869340 i started thinking an interesting way for me to push my documentary practice would be to become part of what i was looking at i started to think about things im just not supposed to be a part of and how i could become a part of it during the process of photographing it i keyed in on building a car and becoming a lowrider
2869341 when you look at lowrider magazines im too skinny for it its more chunky more cleavage i dont need to look like a body builder i just need to look hot
2869342 the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light
2869343 sometimes the first duty of intelligent men is the restatement of the obvious
2869344 in a series of e mails i patiently explained that bush couldnt be hitler since hitler was dead
2869345 when my grandfather left europe in 1937 the graffiti on the walls read jews go to palestine today the graffiti reads jews out of palestine how soon europe forgets

2869350 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community

2869376 just as obama has touched black democratic voters he has engendered conflicting emotions among black republicans
2869377 the candidate has been imposed on the african american polity by corporate forces in the democratic party of which he is a loyal harvard vetted operative
2869378 hes getting help from panicked and unprincipled black left misleaders who contort their former politics beyond recognition in order to attach themselves mostly uninvited to a corporate campaign that tries to masquerade in movement clothing
2869379 obama goes race specific negative on black people whenever it is useful in attracting white electoral support
2869380 african americans are expected to circle the wagons at the merest hint of racist threats to the candidate
2869381 at the commonsensical level the entire obama black folks relationship is so bizarre as to seem insane
2869382 has shamefully packaged obama as a progressive knowing full well he is not
2869383 as if that somehow in and of itself is significant or is a qualification for the u s presidency
2869384 better qualified than a politically conscious and time tested black american of black parentage raised inside black america
2869385 equating genuine and much needed economic social and political change with skin color
2869386 obama has repeatedly stated his support for unilateral u s military actions in other nations he has indicated that he opposes how the u s is waging the war in iraq not the u s waging of this bloody illegal and amoral war itself
2869387 vast amounts of people in america and on this planet
2869388 just rough it for the next two years then we will send another 1 4 trillion dollars out of the country for energy while we wait it will be the young guys like you that get stuck with paying that bill not the old farts like me that will shortly be drolling in our oatmeal at the old folks home
2869389 just rough it for a while that doesnt mean fuck everything it means kepp developing new ideas that are more efficiant instead of quickly mass produce something shitty
2869390 i was horrified to learn that he hadnt been contacted about the change in arrangements
2869391 ive apologised and weve had a good discussion about that
2869392 there were signs of violence both suffered severe head injuries whoever did this continued to hit them while they were on the floor a police spokesman said
2869393 i really cant believe this has happened mrs goulding said
2869394 when the dustbins had been emptied he would have courtesy to move my bin from the nature strip to next to post box it was very decent of him
2869395 he always walked past my house and around the block he last did that about three or four days ago he waved and gave me a little bow she said
2869396 i read a lot of agatha christie but i didnt want a real one on my doorstep she said
2869397 they were the best of people you couldnt get better ken wouldve given you the shirt off his back she said
2869398 he was really intelligent fit and a really lovable guy with a great sense of humour she said
2869399 my little brother i love you so so much amp cant believe they have taken you from us how cruel you will always be with me such a wonderful special person so kind and caring and loved by so many
2869400 mate what can i say im gutted more then gutted you will always be a brother to me you lived your dream life in oz with the person you loved and it got taken away
2869401 i saw him lying on the ground there were several people treating him and they had his shirt off and someone yelling to runners to keep moving it was quite unsettling she said
2869402 he seemed fit he wasnt rippling with muscles but he had a slim build he wasnt fat
2869403 in people over 50 its almost always due to coronary heart disease in a younger person it is still frequently due to coronary disease but more often due to other problems he said
2869404 an arrhythmia is almost always the cause of sudden death he said
2869405 the heart develops this chaotic rhythm it quivers and doesnt pump out blood and the person loses consciousness
2869406 this type of occurrence happens at least once in most city2surf races
2869407 people shouldnt undertake this sort of activity without training for it it tends to stress themselves out
2869408 it can still happen because some people have inherited predisposition to having problems of rhythmic generation or with the muscles of their heart
2869409 the real winner on the day will be armidale hospitals oncology unit
2869410 i predict that team torbay would need at least a three goal start against the strong graham parsons presidents xi
2869411 it is great to be involved in supporting the fundraiser as the oncology unit provide such fabulous support for cancer patients and their families
2869412 richard torbay does a great job umpiring the nsw parliament so i dont think he will have any problems in goals particularly if paul is playing striker

2869424 next question please lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2869425 i obviously played nicely i shot 69 68 on a tough sunday at a major so im pretty happy about that
2869426 unfortunately i obviously came up a little bit short but i guess thats the way things go sometimes so the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2869427 i hit it left edge and it just didnt break and it lipped out on the left
2869428 i said it before theres guys that get a little bit fortunate they get in contention in a major and manage to get things going their way either because they play well or because somebody else comes back
2869429 ive had my fair share of crash and burns over the years but it just makes this so much sweeter i had such a clean practice and when the season started i knew that i would do well on oneida
2869430 sunday was a prime example that were capable of doing it
2869431 i just got hit around thats all there is to it
2869432 with the prospect of ben not being available you see heightened intensity at the quarterback position
2869433 everybody is understanding that holy cow this could really happen i could be in there when that happens its amazing how the light turns on and people really start focusing
2869434 p em em tal lugar aperta na velocidade tal empurra para frente e para tr s enfia c l

2869436 who would have thought that john edwards and his wife would be so arrogant and so disconnected with reality that they would embark on a presidential campaign even though they knew about his affair and the crazy nature of his paramour well that kind of audacity and bamboozlement is not limited to the edwards family meet the obamas you dont know them dont worry republican operatives are loaded for bear and you are going to meet a barack obama that was hidden and disguised during the democratic primary and when the introduction is over the obama supporters will wish the only thing they had to worry about was a video with michelle saying disparaging things about caucasians
2869437 we wanted our daughter to know her parents were married that was the big thing for us
2869438 our journey to parenthood was not easy cheap or fun
2869439 the result however has been the most amazing experience in the world being called daddy and dad by our loving daughter
2869440 all the realms involved with men are much more complex
2869441 for future generations knowing they can fall in love get married have a child absolutely that will become a way of life more than it is
2869442 as a couple with kids you really see the importance of it trying to get as many protections as you can
2869443 my relatives were screaming with excitement when they found out we were going to be parents
2869444 i think we still have something to prove to show america we can do a great job with these kids
2869445 legally being able to get married will help in some states but not others
2869446 i would never tell clients to get married but i tell them straight out if you do get married its going to be easier
2869447 the treadmill was running but he was unresponsive lying on the floor
2869448 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2869449 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2869450 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that
2869451 i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2869452 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the whack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2869453 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
2869454 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2869455 gee everyone we know is going to sturgis wanna go to sturgis
2869456 wanna go to new jersey its a three day ride then a few days out there then 3 days back
2869457 spend the whole trip on the bikes i wanna do stuff and fish and stuff like that
2869458 were going up to my brothers for the weekend and we can fish and stuff and then sunday well head up to your parents and maybe ride with them for a bit after that i dont know yet whichever way the wind takes us i guess
2869459 didnt you want to get some of that special cleaner
2869460 lets head over to duluth and well decide from there
2869461 if we can get to new jersey by tomorrow night lets go
2869462 this is it honey no more stops were going to push for home we should just be able to make it on this tank
2869463 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2869464 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2869465 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2869466 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2869467 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2869468 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2869469 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2869470 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2869471 wait til they are 3 is a popular response ive gotten that but if anyone has any other ideas id be forever grateful
2869472 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2869473 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2869474 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2869475 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2869476 there has been no increase in the number of parents drawn into the swedish criminal justice system for minor assaults in the past 25 years
2869477 7000 reports of child abuse per year in sweden but only 10 are prosecuted
2869478 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2869479 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2869480 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2869481 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2869482 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2869483 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2869484 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2869485 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2869486 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2869487 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2869488 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2869489 to be named the best team in the tournament is fantastic especially as we were competing in asia where professional gaming leagues have operated for years the team has done new zealand proud this is new zealands first gold medal for video gaming and bodes well for 2009

2869515 john mccain does not want dick cheney to attend the republican convention because he says hes too unpopular yeah and when asked to comment cheney said i hope the senator reconsiders then he turned into a bat and flew away
2869516 the mccain campaign is running that commercial where theyre comparing barack obama to various hollywood celebrities and as you know if theres one thing the republicans will not stand for its electing some hollywood celebrity to public office except for ronald reagan fred thompson arnold schwarzenegger clint eastwood you know except for those
2869517 you ever notice that congress doesnt even call it a vacation you know what they call it a recess you ever notice the only people that get recess are congress kindergarten and juries those are the only three
2869518 why do the other republican presidential candidates hate mitt romney
2869519 the mccainocrats crossed over 2 to 1 for john mccain
2869520 georgia does not stop its treacherous actions on abkhazias border and continues to intensify its military presence the armed forces of the republic were forced to enter the security zone and advance towards the georgian border
2869521 we decided to redeploy our troops to be able to resist the russian armed forces which outnumber our troops
2869522 it doesnt look like this was premeditated with a massive staging of equipment
2869523 until the night before the fighting russia seemed to be playing a constructive role
2869524 having a document does not make you a russian citizen
2869525 washington is a city of southern efficiency and northern charm
2869526 this is positive to the market in the short term but we still have to keep an eye on how this story will end finally
2869527 it will jump at the openning trade but it might not go far beyond 705 points
2869528 the jobs market has been one of the few bright spots in the uk economy but cracks are appearing in the face of an increasingly uncertain economic outlook
2869529 even if we avoid the scale of jobs fallout suffered in previous downturns the era of the candidates recruitment market is already over with people in work becoming increasingly anxious that their p45 might soon be on its way
2869530 companies are now reacting to deteriorating market conditions with sales slowing and input costs rising but scope to raise prices limited by weakening demand finances are under pressure
2869531 the request for a previous withdrawal of the invaders is just and our government supports it
2869532 the autonomous republic of south ossetia historically formed part of the russian federation
2869533 we are here to continue recovering natural resources and the consolidation of nationalization
2869534 my big dream is to have unity among the bolivian people
2869535 they will either talk more in the language of de facto secession or start to negotiate
2869536 even if the government is strengthened it has to negotiate there is no other option
2869537 you go into some of these small towns in pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the midwest the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothings replaced them so its not surprising then that they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them
2869538 there is nothing in islam to prevent them from practicing sex before that night as they are officially wed

2869541 your goodness is so great you have stored up great blessings for those who honor you you have done so much for those who come to you for protection blessing them before the watching world
2869542 haughty eyes a proud heart and evil actions are all sin
2869543 some economists are disdainful of their colleagues in other social disciplines
2869544 until you learn how to submit completely to god you will never learn how to submit to a husband or wife
2869545 god is not mocked whatever a man sows that he will reap
2869546 if it pleases the king let letters be given to me for the governors of the region beyond the river that is the euphrates river that they must permit me to pass through till i come to judah 8 and a letter to asaph the keeper of the kings forest that he must give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel which pertains to the temple literally house for the city wall and for the house that i will occupy

2869557 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2869558 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
2869559 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2869560 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2869561 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation
2869562 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2869563 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
2869564 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of cheques with our show making fun of christians
2869565 we were actually getting ready to schedule a trip to memphis to talk to isaac
2869566 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2869567 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2869568 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2869569 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2869570 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2869571 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2869572 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2869573 making money but doing it legitimately and not seeking out the gangs and keeping away from violence
2869574 things had been getting better but were in some sort of mad rash of shootings
2869575 he came home he did his homework i didnt have to be behind him because he loved doing his homework
2869576 i mean you couldnt ask for more than that it was not a lot of hard work to get him to do what he had to do
2869577 he knew what he needed to do to provide for his family
2869578 what this is is one of those incidents thats just senseless
2869579 bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone forgive as the lord forgave you
2869580 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2869586 y oull never find john mccain changing his stripes just because of an election
2869587 i know his grandmother lives in hawaii and i know hawaii is a state
2869588 you cant run a beer company out of the white house
2869589 you cant run any company from the white house mccain is leaving a live hand grenade on the table a major embarrassment
2869590 total opposition to the manufacturing advertising distributing and consuming of alcoholic beverages
2869591 i am sure for some individual southern baptists the mccain familys involvement in the beer business would be a concern
2869592 we strongly oppose any proposal that would back a display of alcohol content in terms of fluid ounces or pure alcohol per standard serving
2869593 well the 360 cant play the same games the ps3 does
2869594 you have far more going for you than you think
2869595 you seem to be somewhat morose is all which is understandable since you just lost a good friend and in such a strange way
2869596 yes to survive being shot in the stomach only to go from such an odd thing
2869597 i am afraid said the doctor that you have a terminal case of epidermophyton floccosum
2869598 i cant believe someone would bring a yippy dog like that to a wake isnt it illegal or something to have a dog in a pub anyway
2869599 how dare you tell me what to do with chesterton he has just as much right to be here as any of these neanderthal
2869600 this pub is full of dirks friends and were here to celebrate his life not listen to some useless little bit of fur yap its fool head off i knew dirk for 20 years and never once did he mention any of you and you certainly never visited him now i suggest you take that dog and leave
2869601 take this dog to mr paulsons house hell know what to do
2869602 are you crazy how can we have idea to write original content each day
2869603 not only are many many australians on low levels of income they are on these low levels for a long period of time
2869604 what this demonstrates to us is that its very important that we get the maximum rate of income support at a level that enables people to have a reasonable standard of living
2869605 we understand that money will need to be spent but its important that we get this right because such a significant number of people are dependent on these pensions
2869606 that really is a matter that will be worked through in the first instance by the review as they make assessments about the best way forward
2869607 sometimes the tank just rockets like a rocket going to the moon
2869608 youve got to have an awful lot of respect for propane storage
2869609 in canada the miacc system was a very poor cousin of the american system
2869610 image in my own blog lol im looking forward to the next clubbing session just wondering when the workload is pilling up waiting to be completed too tired to do anything now maybe just sleep the pain off lah
2869611 i am proud to support barack obama for president and work hard for his election because we share a commitment to equality for all americans this is our quest and our common goal
2869612 from now through november we will reach out aggressively to our fellow lgbt americans to ensure that they know there is only one candidate in this race who will stand up for equal rights and build a coalition that can deliver the change that we desperately need
2869613 on every issue facing the lgbt community john mccain promises a third bush term
2869614 hes promised to appoint judges to the supreme court like scalia and alito and we cant afford that
2869615 its been twelve long years since john mccain cast the deciding vote that killed the employment non discrimination act
2869616 its time we elect a president who fights for the basic principles of non discrimination on the basis of both sexual orientation and gender identity
2869617 barack obama has come out in strong opposition to the divisive and discriminatory amendments in california arizona and florida
2869618 thats important to me and to my family theres no question that lgbt voters need to work hard to help elect barack and im excited to be part of this effort
2869619 im proud to have the support of congresswoman tammy baldwin the obama pride co chairs and so many leaders across the lgbt community
2869620 i believe that we can achieve equality for the millions of lgbt people in this country and with this team i know that the lgbt community will play a major role in our campaign to bring change to washington
2869621 there are two great sins in the world the sin of ignorance and the sin of stupidity only the former may be overcome
2869622 we need to have a greater understanding of what is happening now in our schools
2869623 for a long time acer has published pieces from educational researchers decrying the lack of transparency about funding systems and about who attends and what happens in australian schools
2869624 i know you have concluded that politicians lack the will to put a spotlight on this vital information
2869625 can i assure you the rudd labor government does not lack the political courage
2869626 consequently the use of national testing data should be contained to the purpose of informing teaching and learning in the classroom and individual reporting to parents
2869627 data collected for one purpose is often inappropriate for another purpose
2869628 the essence of league tables is you take one little thing and whack it in a list and say thats all you need to know about your local school
2869629 what we want to know is very comprehensive information about who is in each school because that would tell you something about educational need
2869630 we need to know where that disadvantage lies and we need to know the best methods of addressing it
2869631 it was a must win game because of the circumstances
2869632 i think it was extremely important for us to get a positive result
2869633 china and japan will fight for gold and silver and it is up to the rest of us to fight for a bronze medal said germanys fabian hambuechen who finished second behind chinas yang wei in the all around qualifying
2869634 to make a major team personnel change compete in the first subdivision and qualify for the team finals is a huge accomplishment u
2869635 we just need to keep doing what were doing tan said
2869636 this is exactly what we needed to do a lot of people wondered if we could emotionally handle the ups and downs theres a lot of room for improvement but that final day is going to be the day we put it all together
2869637 i know were not supposed to be doing that he said sheepishly
2869638 but i couldnt believe what people were saying it fired us up
2869639 let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilize this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
2869640 dont allow the fruits of the victory achieved through the sacrifices of the mujahedeen fighting in afghanistan iraq and the tribal belt of pakistan to be hijacked by the politicians who sat passively while the girls and boys of the red mosque perished and burned
2869641 these are the same politicians who follow the tenets of an alien western democratic system and judiciary and exploit islam to fulfill their own greedy aims
2869642 vanaf dat ik klein was droomde ik ervan om de beste van de wereld te worden
2869643 nu kan ik als ik ouder ben in elk geval zeggen dat ik minimaal een dag nummer een ben geweest dat neemt niemand me meer af ik sta in de geschiedenisboeken en dat is een geweldige prestatie
2869644 het gaat gewoon niet zo goed ik ben niet echt in vorm
2869645 het valt mij ook wel tegen maar het gaat in de wedstrijd niet harder het moet ergens aan liggen maar waaraan weet ik niet daar komen we later wel achter
2869646 el triunfo de la revoluci n democr tica de bolivia y del pueblo boliviano est dedicado a todos los pueblos revolucionarios de latinoam rica y el mundo
2869647 por primera vez en esta historia del pueblo boliviano hubo un referendo revocatorio y cont con la participaci n masiva de todo nuestro pueblo
2869648 no solo elige a sus candidatos adem s de eso los ratifica o los revoca
2869649 estamos ac para seguir avanzando en la recuperaci n de nuestros recursos nacionalizaci n de las empresas fundamental en la retoma de las empresas del estado
2869650 este mandato del pueblo boliviano ser respetado y aplicado en los distintos niveles sectores y regiones del pa s para que bolivia cambie tenga igualdad y dignidad
2869651 i ve found that recently on anglican blogs i haven t been writing the words preach the gospel i write instead preach christ and
2869652 bishops from around the anglican communion to discover the deeper realities of the
2869653 the job of an archbishop is to preach a clear and anointed message
2869654 and your primary calling is to build the people of christ
2869655 for a technology that has been in stable release since may 22 2000 php 4 has finally
2869656 were quite used to fascist countries not allowing freedom of speech
2869657 italy suffer from a really bad background as one of the ifpis was formed in italy during the fascist years and now they have a fascist leader in the country silvio berlusconi
2869658 berlusconi is also the most powerful person in italian media owning a lot of companies that compete with the pirate bay
2869659 recently with our successful art installation where we had to storm fortezza in order to get our art done and as usual we won we will also win this time
2869660 the baseline has been elevated not only did the spike happen but the bar was raised
2869661 we recognize that we are in a difficult position as regards references to people at present on the detached islands we know that a few were born in diego garcia and perhaps some of the other islands and so were their parents before them we cannot therefore assert that there are no permanent inhabitants however much this would have been to our advantage in these circumstances we think it would be best to avoid all references to permanent inhabitants
2869662 we must surely be very tough about this the object of the exercise is to get some rocks which will remain ours there will be no indigenous population except seagulls
2869663 unfortunately along with the birds go some few tarzans or man fridays whose origins are obscure and who are hopefully being wished on to mauritius
2869664 be indifferent to the imposition of foreign rule on people who have no desire for it
2869665 the islands are virtually uninhabited and the erection of the base would thus cause no indigenous political problems
2869666 there is nothing in our files about inhabitants or about an evacuation
2869667 you know bagram air field diego garcia guant namo 16 camps throughout iraq
2869668 a good economic development plan for our community would be if we make sure folks werent throwing their garbage out of their cars
2869669 what about the black community based on their response we will consider endorsement of a u s presidential candidate
2869670 youre talking about cars sitting on lots for 90 days
2869671 the dealers are saying i have cars that wont move and i cant advertise its because of cash flow
2869672 what were seeing in the automotive industry is a major pullback in advertising
2869673 and we think theyre going to take a more conservative approach for some time
2869674 if the economy were better newspapers would be better and wed be having a slightly different conversation
2869675 the collapse in u s automobile consumer demand will materially damage the advertising growth rates of traditional media owners
2869676 we have other avenues to be able to reach this same audience without bearing the expense of being an official sponsor of the u s olympic team
2869677 unmark as hanselminutes podcast 125 accessibility in web and rich applications
2869678 everything looks good to me for next weeks confederation cup at flamboro
2869679 if he comes out of this the way he should well be at flamboro next week
2869680 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2869681 my whole room lights up orange and i look out i live on the top floor so i had a perfect view and i just seen a huge ball of flame hundreds of metres in the sky big black pillars of smoke
2869682 we got freaked out my family woke up they thought it was a plane that went down
2869683 i saw the explosion in the morning nobody was there to protect me and now were not getting protected
2869684 its messed up here and i gotta work in the morning
2869685 at present we do not know anything about how the explosions occurred and we are waiting to learn about its cause
2869686 it wasnt impacted by anything it was just in the course of him performing some operations that he went down
2869687 i dont know of any pre existing medical conditions that could have contributed to this tragic accident
2869688 im sure that all of our all of our guys are having a rough time with it
2869689 there was a very very large amount of fire when we arrived and the extent of the explosion if the blast was heard as far away as it was could have been much more serious
2869690 hopefully we wont find that there are a lot of people missing or injured but so far it looks like we got off very lucky
2869691 he was going to check on my parents but the explosions were getting louder and louder so the three of us just ran and ran and ran
2869692 everyone was just running down the street it was like something from a movie
2869693 we were concerned when this company moved at the end of the street
2869694 but we werent even advised that they were going to be there they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen
2869695 the last campaign robert f kennedy and 82 days that inspired america
2869696 chris was inspired by the fearlessness robert showed in those 82 days
2869697 he refused to call it off or surround himself with police
2869698 most of that crowd learned of dr kings murder from him and he gave a moving off the cuff speech here the second hero of his life had been murdered and rather than crawl behind bulletproof glass he stood tall
2869699 there are so many layers and people who need to sign off in studio deals that it can push a deal back weeks
2869700 here we talk to one person ceo amit khanna being able to develop and package a project allows us to take it to the studio best suited for it
2869701 what happened today is important not only for bolivians but for all latin americans
2869702 i dedicate this victory to all the revolutionaries in the world
2869703 to try to go ahead with the fight against poverty or it could just entrench the situation further
2869704 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2869705 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2869706 i am very concerned about the expansion of hostilities well beyond the region of south ossetia rather than acting as a neutral peacekeeper russia has escalated the hostilities through its attacks on georgian towns and cities outside the conflict zone
2869707 calls on russia to respect georgias borders and to desist from any further encroachment on georgias territorial integrity
2869708 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2869709 not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armour and increased attacks on tskhinvali
2869710 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on an unprecedented scale
2869711 so i turned to raj and said this is a state meet
2869712 here lies my beloved zo my autumn flower somewhat less attractive now that shes all corpsified and gross

2869714 if your brother sins against you go and show him his fault just between the two of you if he listens to you you have won your brother over but if he will not listen take one or two others along so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses if he refuses to listen to them tell it to the church and if he refuses to listen even to the church treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector

2869729 the mindless slaughter is being conducted by a russian military that seeks to reassert itself not only in the former soviet union but also to extend its reach throughout what used to be the former soviet union in an attempt to fold back into the russian empire those countries that have broken away from it most notably georgia
2869730 we wish this special little girl a joyful and blessed school year

2869751 my grandfather collected for years to see this church built at the time in 1916 this was a poor mining village but everyone gave something i have been a member of this church all my life i was born into the parish and i never thought i would live to see the day when this church closed
2869752 i think its disgusting we have a strong congregation and an excellent priest we are self sufficient there is no need to close us down
2869753 my dad was buried here me and my sister were married here and our children were baptised here they are splitting up a family by closing this church were all devastated

2869772 no matter how hard they try they cant stop us now
2869773 whenever i get a chance to put on cleats and play football offensive football im happy im just blessed to be out here
2869774 ive never had a problem with the pressure or expectations
2869775 they drafted me to be a running back so whatever that entails however they feel i can help the team running catching doing both thats what theyll work me into doing
2869776 im just trying to work hard show where i can help the offense at then its up to the coaches to see when they want to put me in
2869777 even if you work so hard you can still get injured and your season can be over with just like that it humbled me as a person and basically let me know ive got to work harder
2869778 know what type of player i am they just havent really seen it what theyre doing is holding people accountable i think im accountable im out here working trying to better myself
2869779 no matter how hard they try they cant stop us now
2869780 the business elite should be the ones who decide who runs the world not the common people
2869781 10 books that screwed up the world and 5 others that didnt help
2869782 it was possible half a century ago and even 20 years ago among the academic elite to maintain that marxism was a positive force in history
2869783 the two go together the denial of spiritual entities means the affirmation of all reality as purely material what then is a human being he is an animal that like every other animal must provide for his own material well being
2869784 utellus has a unique level of in depth experience and knowledge of impulse radio uwb based systems specifically their knowledge of uwb technology for high accuracy real time tracking in exceptionally challenging environments is very exciting for us here at xsens
2869785 uwb based tracking technology is complementary to xsens inertial based motion tracking essentially adding the equivalent of an indoor gps system to xsens current range of products
2869786 with xsens there is a strategic fit on a technological level the opportunities for accurate 6dof tracking solutions combined with the freedom of movement that inertial sensors offer open up new possibilities for wide area tracking solutions with this incorporation we will combine our knowledge and implement best of both worlds solutions for our customers
2869787 und es war auch wichtig dass wir 0 1 hinten lagen wir haben danach ruhig weiter gespielt und 4 1 gewonnen

2869790 nancy polikoff sees as part of a rhetorical shift that
2869791 may it be your strength though it be the last of mine
2869792 i didnt think we were very good against melbourne last week either so we have hit a bit of a flat spot we started poorly today full credit to the eagles who were good but we need to be much better than that it was disappointing when you consider what was on the line today
2869793 i still think we have made some reasonable improvement in recent weeks i am happy to keep pushing some younger players through to be honest given the injury list at the moment i dont have much choice
2869794 we think he can be a quality player for us and to see him return and get 25 touches was really pleasing he moves well and uses the ball well for a player who hasnt played much football that was exciting for our fans
2869795 nu vine fraiero nu vine nu vine nu va veni niciodata
2869796 he wasnt giving us anything he was struggling and hes been struggling for a while
2869797 i would think he probably saved his bacon in the second half
2869798 harvey had 17 possessions to halftime with two blokes rotating on him so you put a bloke who is not getting the ball on a player who is and it worked out pretty well
2869799 if he had continued on with what happened in the first half he might have been considered for a vfl stint
2869800 what i tell you in darkness that speak ye in light and what ye hear in the ear that preach ye upon the housetops

2869802 kagen returns from mission to iraq says our troops deserve to come home too rep steve kagen column iraq trip showed its time for troops to leave appleton post crescent iraq trip showed its time for troops to leave
2869803 its the decisions you make when you have no time to make them that defines who you are
2869804 do you think that the situation with iraq is a distraction from the war on terrorism
2869805 i dont think its a disaster i mean any decision i dont question a decision of the president of the united states on his timing or on the priority he gives a threat
2869806 iam running against two of the most dangerous women in america
2869807 why not go out on a limb thats where the fruit is
2869808 i may disagree with what you have to say but i shall defend to the death your right to say it
2869809 the sundance institute documentary film program and the skoll foundation have partnered in a three year initiative to explore how independent feature length documentary film can advance knowledge about social entrepreneurship
2869810 the stories of change fund will consider independent feature length documentary projects in all categories of development production and post production completed films are note eligible film projects must be completed by 2010 grant awards will be made on a case by case basis and may range up to 150 000 us per film
2869811 not yet we are not through but we will continue tomorrow
2869812 best temporary measure to extricate the country from its worst situation
2869813 how does a western country publicly pronounce that they will not recognise a government unless it is led by a particular leader without undermining the credibility and integrity of that individual
2869814 i dont think we have to worry about invisible people walking around any time soon to be honest we are just at the beginning of doing anything like that
2869815 in naturally occurring material the index of refraction a measure of how light bends in a medium is positive
2869816 when you see a fish in the water the fish will appear to be in front of the position it really is or if you put a stick in the water the stick seems to bend away from you
2869817 instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water it would actually appear to be above the waters surface
2869818 what we have done is taken that material and made it much thicker
2869819 we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
2869820 we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film
2869821 we have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organizations and look forward to working with them closely in the future however no changes or cuts to the film will be made
2869822 tropic thunder is an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities
2869823 coming back to the table negotiations peace talks a political solution thats it easy to say very difficult to do
2869824 it is the most surreal world crisis i could ever imagine
2869825 it started with severe bombing with artillery and planes and helicopters our boys with their guns could do nothing
2869826 they bombed us so may times all the houses are destroyed on one street there is only one wall left

2869832 with those bills and the tuition coming due and hanging over your head it does put you in a bit of a panic
2869833 only to find out the lenders theyve chosen are no longer going to be offering loans this fall
2869834 some of these rates have no caps which means if interest rates rise you could be up to paying 15 to 18 percent on these loans
2869835 you know when he comes out so its very scary
2869836 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river and all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength
2869837 this tree was just growing taller and stronger above the rest of mother nature around it it was gorgeous
2869838 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2869839 race and class while lifting viewers with laughter compassion and cool
2869840 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2869841 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2869842 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2869843 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2869844 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2869845 so you learned the ways of a knight from that
2869846 from that perhaps a little from stories mostly there were troubadours who would travel the land the church had forbidden them to perform as they used magic and were outlanders but they would set up their stage in the deep woods and i would steal away from the farm to go it was an open secret where they were and once there i cut my teeth on the stories of knights of old sir eoin who rescued the queen of lunargen and helped restore her to the throne sir karn who with his dragon lover killed the dark lord solphar then became a star dame angren and her sword of faith
2869847 and yet they were just tales you know now as an adult that bards tales and the truth are rarely the same thing
2869848 aye but that doesnt matter the fanciful i know but i know that there is a better way to be a higher standard there is justice there is mercy there is honor and there is duty these arent fancies theyre real they breathe and they live in me if nowhere else
2869849 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
2869850 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
2869851 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
2869852 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
2869853 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health
2869854 a philosophical position which argues that existence is without objective meaning purpose or intrinsic value
2869855 just put your fingertips on the polar bear noses strum
2869856 its the start of something that can be great weve been waiting for years for this moment
2869857 i dont know how many people were watching the game but it was an honor to play in it
2869858 we were all excited and anxious this game was over the top
2869859 but we have a saying back home that when youre good you play for the name on the front of your jersey instead of the name on the back our guys all play for the name on the front of their jersey
2869860 how often we look at god through our difficulties or rather we try to for the difficulties hide him keep the eye on him and the difficulties will not be seen but alas what self centered skeptical sinful creatures we are at best
2869861 for my thoughts are not your thoughts nor are your ways my ways
2869862 you may not be a scholar but you better be a student
2869863 if we obey god it is going to cost other people more than it costs us and that is where the sting comes in if we are in love with our lord obedience does not cost us anything it is a delight but it costs those who do not love him a good deal

2869880 im sorry but you are not going to like this
2869881 im not too happy about it i mean i shouldnt have been there in the state that i was in but i wasnt really thinking there would be someone driving past with a video camera on the roof filming me either
2869882 come monday morning i got out of the taxi and rolled over on the grass and went to sleep on the footpath
2869883 what do you do when you lose a mate like that you know
2869884 i know what he would have done if i left he wouldve partied too thats what i wouldve wanted him to do so thats what we did
2869885 i was absolutely horrified i was horrified that anybody had even heard about it
2869886 while recognising that google time is never real time the image renews the raw loss
2869887 while others may have legitimate complaints about google publishing pictures of their house i was delighted to views ours with me pictured hard at work in the garden complete with broom and bucket thereby dispelling any uncertainty as to who is the gardener in the family
2869888 and this is very illegal so the following material is for educational use only
2869889 it is extremely important to maintain the security and integrity of the fare media systems
2869890 with an insecure compromised system even basic revenue controls to name one example become significantly challenging
2869891 if you prevent legitimate researchers from talking about their findings its not going to stop people from finding vulnerabilities its going to stop the good guys from talking about them and from learning from each other
2869892 the bad guys are still going to be looking for the vulnerabilities and still be finding them
2869893 we should find out early about our team since we play a louisiana power john curtis of river ridge on labor day in a televised game at texas stadium
2869894 after that we will face two area rivals in cedar hill and allen you cant take any weeks off but we hope to keep things going in the right direction
2869895 wow that one looks like a house i drew one time
2869896 what i tell you in darkness that speak ye in light and what ye hear in the ear that preach ye upon the housetops
2869897 i never reach my goals therefore i dont like me im not worth it i dont like me and im not worth it therefore im not going to reach my goals
2869898 the hijab has never been a problem for me in bahrain you grow up with it
2869899 there are more women in sport all the time from countries like qatar and kuwait you can choose to wear the hijab or not for me its liberating
2869900 we will make money in india for the losses in sub prime
2869901 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2869902 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2869903 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2869904 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2869905 induce the test mode drain the device battery and turn off therapies
2869906 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2869907 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2869908 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2869909 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2869910 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2869911 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2869912 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2869913 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2869914 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2869915 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2869916 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2869917 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2869918 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2869919 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2869920 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2869921 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2869922 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2869923 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2869924 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2869925 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2869926 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2869927 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2869928 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2869929 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2869930 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2869931 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2869932 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2869933 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2869934 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2869935 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2869936 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2869937 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2869938 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2869939 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2869940 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2869941 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2869942 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2869943 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2869944 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

2869949 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
