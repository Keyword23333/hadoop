7930010 when we began planning ie8 we took a hard look at our customers concerns about privacy on the web
7930011 many users are concerned about so called over the shoulder privacy or the ability to control what their spouses friends kids and co workers might see
7930012 if you are using a shared pc a borrowed laptop from a friend or a public pc sometimes you dont want other people to know where youve been
7930013 you know as well as i do this feature is built for porn

7930015 we want users to not only be able to enter a private browsing session but tell the browser that they want to delete all evidence starting a couple of hours ago
7930016 the key part is getting privacy tools into the browser
7930017 rather than as add ons or extensions microsofts announcement is significant not because its a major technological breakthrough but because its a breakthrough into making it easier for users to have real control over their privacy
7930018 but well have to wait to see how easy it is to use

7930043 the search for happiness is one of the chief sources of unhappiness
7930044 one cannot divine nor forecast the conditions that will make happiness one only stumbles upon them
7930045 we are never happy we can only remember that we were so once
7930046 ask yourself whether you are happy and you cease to be so

7930094 the peace process is not and should not be affected by any kind of settlement activities at the end of the day the role of leaders is to try and find a way to live in peace in the future and to avoid any kind of not to let any kind of noises that relate to the situation on the ground these days to enter the negotiations room
7930095 this is a conflict that goes back at least 40 years if not much longer than that
7930096 in other words imagine that in addition to this year another four years will be under your management work with this in mind act and plan accordingly
7930097 even if ayatollah khamenei would want deep down in his heart ahmadinejad to be the winner of irans future presidential elections he wouldnt express his wish so clearly and publicly
7930098 government officials officials in charge of irans official news agency were probably so happy about khameneis comments that they didnt realize the way they published his comments was not in the interests of the islamic republic
7930099 the remarks by irans supreme leader are a sign of his unconditional support for ahmadinejads government a government that came to power with his special backing
7930100 the problem ahmadinejads government is facing and to a certain degree khamenei is that gradually significant numbers of hard liners have turned into ahamdinejads critics because of his economic policies and his performance on the international scene which has put iran under the shadow of sanctions isolation and even military attack
7930101 the problems that exist in iran cannot be ignored by those living there
7930102 if we interpret ayatollah khameneis comments as a done deal meaning that ahmadinejad will be irans next president whether we like it or not then this is tantamount to the end of the republic system of the establishment
7930103 but i dont think this is the case even if the leader supports such view in the end i think its up to the citizens to decide whether they want ahmadinejad to be president for a second time or not
7930104 its nothing unusual not just one term or two terms ahamdinejad can remain in power for as many terms as khamenei would want him anyhow i hope the people of iran will have a say
7930105 plans are only good intentions unless they immediately degenerate into hard work

7930146 with this law we are taking additional steps to make sure cigarettes stay out of the hands of our children
7930147 senate bill 2546 along with the recently passed smoke free illinois act both help to move us closer to an illinois where we can all breathe safely and easily
7930148 tobacco addiction can start at a very early age and public health experts agree it is important to keep tobacco out of the hands of adolescents to avoid this with the governors signature this legislation will provide new tools for the illinois liquor control commission to ensure that tobacco retailers are not selling cigarettes to minors in the form of single cigarettes
7930149 every day 3 000 young people under the age of 18 become regular smokers if we can help stop minors from becoming addicted even by one cigarette at a time we will be helping to save lives
7930150 this law was introduced to help ensure cigarettes stay out of the hands of the children of our state
7930151 it is important that we take the additional steps necessary to make sure that minors do not take that first puff
7930152 reducing youth access to tobacco products is a top priority of the american lung association because it results in fewer children becoming addicted to cigarettes for life
7930153 by further limiting vending machine sales and eliminating the sale of single or loose cigarettes this new law helps us meet our mission to prevent lung disease and promote lung health
7930154 the health of the children in our communities is of vital importance smoking can cause numerous health problems such as coronary heart disease lung cancer respiratory diseases and premature death

7930156 illinois has become a leader in the nation for emergency preparedness efforts exercises like this test our ability to respond at the local level and strengthen the states overall preparedness we can identify our strengths and weaknesses during these exercises build better partnerships and gain valuable knowledge to respond to emergencies
7930157 these exercises will not only require a tremendous amount of coordination between state agencies but also between the state and local level
7930158 on the local level we have trained with and depended heavily on coordination with local health departments and hospitals for dispensing medications during a pandemic flu now we will look at what security measures will be needed at hospitals and medical facilities during an emergency to ensure everyone safely receives the medical help they need and avoid mass chaos
7930159 this exercise series is about strengthening working relationships among our partners in law enforcement emergency management communities and the healthcare industry its about increasing preparedness by sharing information and processes
7930160 i have waited more than three years to get the illinois general assembly to send me a vehicle that i could act on that would reform a system that takes care of itself at the expense of the people

7930183 section 1306 a does not mention the confirmation of the debtors plan as an event relevant to what assets are property of the estate
7930184 if congress had intended for confirmation to so dramatically affect the expansive definition of property of the estate found in section 1306 it knew how to draft such a provision
7930185 t he disclosure of postconfirmation assets gives the trustee and creditors a meaningful right to request under section 1329 a modification of the debtors plan to pay his creditors
7930186 we do not hold that a debtor has a free standing duty to disclose the acquisition of any property interest after the confirmation of his plan under chapter 13 neither the bankruptcy code nor the bankruptcy rules mention such a duty
7930187 but the bankruptcy court has the discretion under rule 1009 to require a debtor to amend his schedule of assets to disclose a new property interest acquired after the confirmation of the debtors plan

7930196 until carter ruck and partners and englands stifling libel laws got to work the few american journalists not caught up in obama mania were turning to the archives of the british press to answer an intriguing question who is nadhmi auchi
7930197 a libel claimant does not have to prove that the words are false or to prove that he has in fact suffered any loss damage is presumed
7930198 as far as he can remember he has had no direct contact with mr obama
7930199 mr rezkos lawyer said his client had longstanding indebtedness to mr auchis general mediterranean holding gmh by june 2007 he owed it 27 9 million under a loan forgiveness agreement described in court m auchi lent mr rezko 3 5 million in april 2005 and 11 million in september 2005 as well as 3 5 million transferred in april 2007 that agreement provided for the outstanding loans to be forgiven in return for a stake in the 62 acre riverside park development
7930200 mr auchi first met mr rezko after the 2003 iraq war and they have a business relationship
7930201 mr auchi was convicted of corruption given a suspended sentence and fined 1 4 million in france in 2003 for his part in the elf affair described as the biggest political and corporate scandal in post war europe he in a statement from his media lawyers claims he is appealing against the sentence
7930202 a 2004 pentagon report obtained by the washington times identified auchi as a global arms dealer and iraqi billionaire who behind the facade of legitimate business served as saddam husseins principle sic international financial manipulator and bag man
7930203 the report to the pentagon inspector general stated that significant and credible evidence has been developed that nadhmi auchi has engaged in unlawful activities working closely with iraqi intelligence operatives to bribe foreign governments and individuals prior to operation iraqi freedom to turn opinion against the american led mission to remove saddam hussein

7930227 organisations going for the informal approach can lack structure in their environmental policies and this can affect the level of success that they achieve in reducing both energy costs and co2 emissions
7930228 while computers may drive efficiency the data centres that run businesses are often far from efficient they are at the heart of environmental challenges created by it but the average retailer just does not have the necessary knowledge to bring about change they need specialist help and the actions we offer in our thought leadership initiatives are designed to illustrate how they can improve their carbon footprint and wider environmental position while also reducing operating costs and improving it service delivery

7930349 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
7930350 its becoming increasingly expensive for both fannie and freddie to fund their business
7930351 if thats not addressed fairly soon the companies will continue to be under stress

7930359 as you know these kids are online and wired more than ever before
7930360 in general its a tough economy out there for retailers but online seems to be the area where retailers are getting whatever growth theyre getting they are doing whatever they can to maximize that growth

7930363 its becoming more elaborate than people realize between parent and child shopping online
7930364 we dont think theres necessarily an internet only shopper or a store only shopper
7930365 our goal as what we call a multichannel retailer is to offer customers this seamless experience regardless of how theyre choosing to shop with us
7930366 we know that a lot of customers will use the web site as a tool shop from it sometimes and then purchase online
7930367 other times they use it to look at what came in and then they come into the store and buy something theyve been looking at
7930368 being on bainbridge island requires us to take a ferry and or deal with driving in so many of the shopping situations
7930369 as time is fleeting we try to take advantage of the few opportunities we have to actually engage in an activity with them
7930370 with kids its difficult to shop for long periods of time
7930371 the biggest advantage for me was being able to shop on my own time
7930372 i think halloween costumes will be the next thing that will be coming around

7930401 while job outsourcing corporate bankruptcies layoffs and unfair negotiations are rampant this years labor day list employers and their employees unions tell another story they are proving that tumultuous labor relations are a thing of the past not the future

7930420 pens que efectivamente hab a una adaptaci n y que toda la parte literaria de la novela era asumible si rafael y l consegu an hacer unos personajes poli dricos con profundidad y sustancia interpretados por actores que supiesen demostrar al m ximo las zozobras las inquietudes y la imposibilidad de vivir dignamente
7930421 por decisi n propia es una pel cula sustantiva sin ning n abalorio que empieza con unos t tulos de cr dito en un plano fijo de cinco minutos de un retablo barroco
7930422 la guerra civil tuvo muchas cosas terribles y para m lo m s terrible es que una vez terminada las fuerzas franquistas ya en el poder y sin enemigo armado siguieron matando a miles y miles de personas que no ten an manera ya de defenderse

7930432 now it may sound as though im about to preach atheism and i want to reassure you that thats not what im going to do in an audience as sophisticated as that as this one that would be preaching to the choir
7930433 wieso sie sind doch christ sie m ssen an alles glauben was in der bibel steht

7930436 tonight when hillary clinton speaks she will be an articulate voice for the working men and women the middle class families that have been squeezed and she will make the case as she uniquely can for why barack obama is the right choice for the presidency
7930437 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7930438 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7930439 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7930440 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and me our country will be committed to his cause

7930454 reflection of the fascistic mindset of these organisations that they could attack a place housing innocent unprotected children

7930456 the road was blocked by felling three huge trees when my vehicle was passing through dense forest areas on kalingas ghat road the obstruction was obviously part of a plot to attack me

7930459 the government is committed to ensuring all possible measures for the security of the diplomatic community

7930490 llenar el vac o que dej bush ofreciendo otra visi n y otra relaci n con todos los pa ses de la regi n
7930491 hablar directamente con ch vez en el momento adecuado escogido por obama y en un lugar que tambi n elija
7930492 el concepto es muy distinto al que ha tenido esta administraci n y que promete continuar mccain
7930493 lo que es bueno para el pueblo de las am ricas tambi n lo es para estados unidos por tanto tenemos que ser un socio y no un salvador
7930494 la tradici n de los ltimos a os de imponer un modelo desde arriba y decir que washington tiene todas las respuestas para las preguntas de la regi n
7930495 si respetas la democracia tambi n debes hacerlo con los resultados
7930496 por la manera antidemocr tica en que gobierna el presidente hugo ch vez en venezuela su ret rica y pol tica antiestadounidense y sus intentos por influir en los procesos internos de otros pa ses
7930497 parte del problema ha sido el mal manejo por el gobierno bush que se enfrent ret ricamente a ch vez y celebr el intento de golpe de estado de 2002 eso le dio un impulso al presidente venezolano
7930498 la falta de pol tica concreta y de atenci n dej un vac o en la regi n para que ch vez tratara de llenarlo con su ret rica antiamericana con una diplomacia en base a d lares del petr leo
7930499 el senador obama no est decidido a quitar de la mesa cualquier herramienta que podr a ayudar a aumentar la libertad del pueblo cubano
7930500 ser a una oportunidad para decir a los gobernantes cubanos que si son serios y quieren cambiar las cosas en cuba el primer paso ser a liberar a los presos pol ticos sin condici n
7930501 estados unidos estar a entonces dispuesto a empezar un proceso de normalizar nuestra relaci n
7930502 sin proponer nada que cambiar a la situaci n actual en la isla
7930503 absolutamente seguras de que no hay una amenaza cre ble sobre el candidato
7930504 dispararle a obama desde una posici n estrat gica con un rifle desde una distancia de 750 metros
7930505 iluminado que alucinaba bajo los efectos de la droga y que se hablaba a s mismo
7930506 if at first you dont succeed call it version 1 0
7930507 obama represents a return to the old idealism for america that weve lost
7930508 young people we desperately see the need for a return to greatness ive seen everything in this country plummet as ive grown up
7930509 mccain is old fashion hes out of touch they say hes a maverick hes totally aligned sides with the bush administration
7930510 with conviction and dedication arborone works together as a family celebrating success providing support during trials and believing in each other and our purpose to improve life in rural america
7930511 its a tremendous honor for us to be recognized on a state wide level like this weve seen a lot of growth and transition in the last year but we havent lost sight of whats important our people and our relationships im proud that the great team we have assembled here to serve the families and farmers of the pee dee region are getting some of the acknowledgement they deserve for providing an exceptional place to work
7930512 we treat our employees like we want them to treat our customers and this award is an indication of just that

7930515 when i was closing the short sale at the ritz carlton in washington dc i was faced with 3 mortgages past due condo fees and tax liens but because i was able to prove that the short sale would benefit the bank i was able to stop the foreclosure and get the entire deal done from start to finish in 28 days
7930516 having a knowledgeable and savvy realtor is essential to negotiating the short sale process with a bank
7930517 if you want to improve the chances of your bank accepting a short sale you ultimately need to prove that a foreclosure on the property is imminent
7930518 there is a popular misconception that homes sold through a short sale are

7930521 the current government aims to revive the culture of the early years of the revolution and make the culture of the koran and mosques a priority
7930522 comparisons to hitler have no place in a music concert or in the presidential campaign
7930523 doing so trivializes the and is an insult to the memories of the victims and their families
7930524 life is too short to learn all these things the hard way most of us got in to this business because we are technicians and have to learn how to be businessmen and managers sessions like this are the closest thing we can get to having a mentor or hiring a professional corporate president to run the company

7930528 i think the guy will do a great job of managing our team and the team has responded really well to him and thats where we are going
7930529 weve worked extremely hard over the last two weeks and im proud to be a miami dolphin
7930530 i mean he doesnt know any of us from the man on the moon right now but he comes into the huddle and says give me your eyes
7930531 we didnt break the huddle good one time and he was like nah nah nah next time weve got to stand and break the huddle just stuff a veteran with great leadership would do its pretty exciting
7930532 he brings management skills to the table he can manage a game really well hes a little bit calmer in there hes seen more situations
7930533 i think the guy will do a great job of managing our team and the team has responded really well to him and thats where we are going
7930534 weve worked extremely hard over the last two weeks and im proud to be a miami dolphin
7930535 i mean he doesnt know any of us from the man on the moon right now but he comes into the huddle and says give me your eyes
7930536 we didnt break the huddle good one time and he was like nah nah nah next time weve got to stand and break the huddle just stuff a veteran with great leadership would do its pretty exciting
7930537 he brings management skills to the table he can manage a game really well hes a little bit calmer in there hes seen more situations
7930538 the guy has seen some of these critical situations that are going to come up
7930539 and he understands the speed its going to be a whole lot faster when we play the jets the first game of the season
7930540 the christian church must be a place that powerfully conveys compassionate truth to hurting women
7930541 my goal is to help more women find real hope and help as they journey towards wholeness in their femininity in christ and to equip others to do the same
7930542 scientific method thats super annoying both to lesbians and biology teachers ex gays
7930543 rich people pay your own darned bills like the rest of us
7930544 the other thing that was really important to us from the beginning was that we wanted to give back to the community
7930545 and in particular we wanted to watch out for the environment
7930546 we think we have the same company values as microsoft
7930547 like them we believe in community so were a great example of a small company growing up with microsoft and microsoft technology
7930548 that was really great because time is always of the essence and theres never enough of it
7930549 this allowed me to have him focus on the food not on the technology
7930550 i think the reason microsoft stuck with me is that the products are already so familiar everybody uses them partly because they are so friendly and familiar
7930551 excuse me you are talking to a woman that had a hard time walking and listening to a walkman
7930552 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late
7930553 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
7930554 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
7930555 a lot of the fall is due to the increase in public coverage
7930556 when diversity is too much new librarians of color and expectations for involvement in library diversity initiatives
7930557 we get a guaranteed signing on fee and each year we have a guaranteed revenue stream
7930558 the race series the drivers the tracks all of that is covered by the race organisers and the series organisers
7930559 were hopefully supporting the series and hopefully bringing some of our sponsors along to support it but we have no financial burden
7930560 were taking it very seriously but unfortunately the on track performance is largely in the hands of the driver and the team
7930561 weve got a professional race team and weve got a great driver so were very excited and are expecting results
7930562 its been great when we are out there talking to potential partners in all sorts of categories liverpool football club just opens doors and that makes life a whole lot easier
7930563 montenegro is the new magnet for people seeking picturesque villas on the mediterranean
7930564 its hard enough to take care of myself let alone a kid
7930565 i received a call from an 18 year old high schooler and that was a no no
7930566 its the only way to be responsible for myself and my behavior
7930567 every once in a while you get this weird thought of im never going to be a father
7930568 its equal parts terrifying because youre not like everyone else and also because you made this extreme decision at 27
7930569 we want men to look at vasectomy as a permanent solution
7930570 somebody whos in their 20s can easily decide to have children
7930571 its ridiculous that they cant make the decision to not have children
7930572 montenegro is the new magnet for people seeking picturesque villas on the mediterranean
7930573 when his friends among world celebrities suggest that one should support candidate of the democratic party barak obama they do not hesitate to use unacceptable slander and attacks bounds added news
7930574 montenegro is the new magnet for people seeking picturesque villas on the mediterranean
7930575 and where did the pot go in that hole or this one and why would you
7930576 why didnt you answer me i sent you a message yesterday about going to that midnight
7930577 the little boy that would stare into your eyes and laugh when you played with him turned into a boy that wouldnt even respond when you called his name
7930578 i think people have a hard time separating out whats reliable information and whats not reliable
7930579 what gets attention is not the statistics but the story
7930580 the number of people who are trying to make changes in the vaccination schedule based on what they have heard or seen or read on the internet is climbing every year
7930581 even those who ultimately decide not to alter the schedule have questions about it and every year we spend more time talking about immunizations with parents
7930582 it is important for people to protect themselves as well as others who come in contact with them
7930583 as long as there are pockets in the community that remain unvaccinated that certainly increases the risk of ongoing transmission of measles in the community
7930584 the childhood vaccination schedule shouldnt be a one size fits all because every child is different
7930585 we hope the agreement will end the differences between the somali leaders
7930586 ten days ago the very existence of tfg transitional federal government was at a critical point the differences were a deciding factor that makes or breaks the transitional period including the peace agreement in djibouti
7930587 we were not expecting msf to stop its humanitarian assistance because it means thousands of children and pregnant mothers will lose medical care
7930588 were confident that the cabinet will not be defeated in the exercise that is going on in the somali parliament
7930589 a show where balls water balloons and even pumpkins are tossed out a third floor window and the audience gets to guess which one will fall the fastest
7930590 so when are you planning to meet with this guy
7930591 im just curious as to why this guy doesnt know about me

7930595 this is my dance space this is your dance space
7930596 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
7930597 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
7930598 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
7930599 their big challenge is convincing people that they will continue to be active in politics and theyre going to continue to have a voice
7930600 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported
7930601 an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections and was seeking to redeem himself to those closest to him yes that is who i supported
7930602 she knew she should not have participated in him running for president with this bomb waiting to go off she did she kinda loses my sympathy
7930603 i believe we are all owed a huge apology not self serving claims for pity by both john and elizabeth edwards who both knew about the affair and both decided to go forward and seek the democratic candidacy regardless of the titanic risk
7930604 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
7930605 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
7930606 i thought it was very naive on both their parts
7930607 it would be very sad if he were the nominee of our party right now
7930608 that everyone on the set knew that the vehicles were in terrible shape

7930611 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year declines in the present situation index both in term of business conditions and the labor market appear to be moderating the expectations index which posted a significant gain this month suggests better times may be ahead however overall readings are still quite low by historical standards and it is still too early to tell if the worst is behind us
7930612 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level
7930613 they had one goal for tonight that americans would wake up tomorrow morning and say you know the obamas are a lot more like us than i thought they were
7930614 and a daughter raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed home to raise my brother and me
7930615 you work hard for what you want in life your word is your bond you treat people with decency and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7930616 the only limits are the reach of your dreams and the ability to work hard for them
7930617 and you see that is why i love this country
7930618 the overall mood is still one of caution theres not much out there to get investors excited
7930619 but the bigger picture is that there hasnt really been a major breakdown considering all the bad headlines out there from higher oil prices to the credit crisis and troubled housing sector
7930620 the market almost always marks time ahead of a fed announcement and the minutes coming out later has people on the sidelines

7930623 the market almost always marks time ahead of a fed announcement and the minutes coming out later has people on the sidelines
7930624 there was a strong suspicion that it came from that particular maple leaf foods product that we had on hand
7930625 that had left a small group of staff to effectively be operating the program and we decided in our best interests to shut down the camp a few days early
7930626 our inspectors have gone and done a regular inspection that they would do when an outbreak is notified which is looking at the food handling practices
7930627 today is an extremely sad day for the trail blazers family
7930628 kevin will be remembered by fans as one of the most popular and recognizable players to ever wear the blazers uniform but to people who knew him hell be remembered as one of the warmest and biggest hearted
7930629 to this day duck is adored throughout this state and remains a brother to his teammates and to trail blazers staff we will forever miss our beloved 00

7930659 students want access to certain things wireless internet a place to study late and eat something and our student union should be able to provide that

7930718 the georgia aquariums success in moving whale sharks across the world gave us confidence that this was the right thing to do
7930719 we see this as a perfect opportunity to create an international partnership and continue nandis incredible story raising worldwide awareness about manta rays
7930720 flying the worlds largest ray a manta ray from one side of the world to the other and housing it in a u s aquarium for the first time is incredible having the opportunity to work with this animal and grow our understanding of this strange yet gentle giant will be an opportunity of a lifetime

7930726 seven years ago these little sookiess got their nose in the extended trading hours trough by starting with one application on the gold coast then extended it to the sunshine coast then to brisbane and away they went

7930731 im actually seeking professional counselling myself i need to be able to unravel a lot of emotion thats bombarding me at the moment i owe it to myself to work through that properly and to him
7930732 i had questions after the shock of it all but my initial thoughts after hearing that were a sense of sorrow for the church and that a lot of people were going to be hurt because of it
7930733 i was the first one he told he confessed everything to me
7930734 he just went through it where it had started everything in his life as a young kid the patterns he was crying sobbing actually absolutely sobbing he just said i dont have cancer
7930735 he was terrified i still remember the look on his face it was a very hard moment for him as it was for me hearing it
7930736 i could just see a really broken unwell man at that point i found it really quite hard to get angry
7930737 seeing your husband of seven years absolutely sobbing in front of you risking everything coming forward and telling the truth in that instance it was really hard to be angry or mad
7930738 i never questioned it when you love someone you trust them i had no reason not to trust him
7930739 perhaps i feel a little bit foolish in this hindsights a fabulous thing but im trying not to beat myself up
7930740 in the middle of the night he was in so much pain i would put towels in the microwave to try and give him some relief in his back
7930741 before i stopped working to care for him i was busy hed have doctors appointments when i couldnt be there and he would say its fine you dont need to be there
7930742 or i would just drop him off at the hospital
7930743 were only talking two weeks since admitting his lies theres a lot of stuff to deal with
7930744 that sort of side of things hasnt really hit me yet theres many levels and layers to everything i can almost talk about it like im removed from it thats where the professional help will help me work through that it hasnt hit me yet

7930756 from the beginning when barack was a community organizer on the south side of chicago devastated by steel mill closures he saw the challenge
7930757 it is important to not see the future as only

7930760 the liver donors are getting fatter and the problem there is the livers arent so good
7930761 once theres a certain amount of fat in the liver were reluctant to transplant because theres a high risk that its never going to work properly
7930762 we were not aware then that people with severe fatty infiltration of the liver when you took that liver cooled it down and transplanted it the liver just doesnt function
7930763 since the united states is a permanent member of the u n security council this simply will be dead on arrival in the security council
7930764 and therefore in accordance with other security council resolutions that are still in force abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
7930765 we cant allow what russia has done to go without there being some consequences we have not yet determined what those consequences will be from our standpoint but as i said we are looking at a number of possibilities

7930782 we can hire from anywhere and not have to incur the costs of trying to buy a computer to ship it to the agent to have them set it up and install the computer or to send a technician out there to install the computer
7930783 today we have call center agents working across the nation we can cover shifts more flexibly employee productivity and satisfaction is up job retention is higher
7930784 and since the agents can use their own computers weve reduced the equipment it needs to purchase send out or support
7930785 and we dont need to burden the agents with hardware and software specs now whether their pc was purchased back in 2002 or a brand new box as long as they have a web browser connection that is java or rdp enabled we dont have any problems
7930786 the sonicwall aventail ssl vpn let us allow our vendors into our network but only to the specific servers they need to access
7930787 that has really helped us work with vendors to isolate and troubleshoot problems quicker

7930799 i would not probably buy any of that product for at least six months
7930800 because of the type of product it is it wont be for good
7930801 but people are going to be more cautious and want to look at the labels and see where its made
7930802 people will start buying again from safeway or lucerne and then certainly theyll start buying from the chains like macs and that and then maple leaf will be the last one where well see people starting to buy them but limited

7930806 we worked with tw telecom engineers to create a 14 site ip vpn network utilizing their collocation facility in seattle
7930807 the design dramatically simplified our network enabled us to cut our network administration time by one third and allows us to manage the network remotely at any time before network administration was done after hours since our network didnt allow both business transactions and network administration activities to happen simultaneously
7930808 our old low capacity circuits negatively impacted the performance of our network applications and email communications
7930809 with limited network capability we needed to create technology workarounds that added complexity to the administration of our network tw telecoms solution eliminated those issues with a simplified network that increased our primary connection capacity by 12 times for about the same cost as we were paying our previous provider
7930810 additionally the collocation service from tw telecom greatly improved our systems availability and significantly reduced our business risk
7930811 having a fully secured location with continuous power and advanced fire protection all of which was not economically feasible for us to build out ourselves we find ourselves with the ideal data center application additionally with a sonet protected network we now have a truly reliable business continuity disaster recovery solution for our 16 locations an unexpected benefit is that we are now re evaluating our business interruption insurance because of these capabilities
7930812 being able to migrate our network to an ip vpn was a driver in our selection
7930813 no other provider could do that and provide economical service to hawaii during the selection process i contacted various tw telecom customers including one i know personally and they all had very positive things to say about the services as well as the companys account management capabilities
7930814 class of service enables us to deploy mission critical applications that arent affected by email or employees using the internet
7930815 the proceeds are being used to retire term loans from jp morgan and subordinated notes from aramid entertainment fund

7930842 other agencies such as the department of internal affairs dia and the new zealand food safety authority nzfsa are conducting projects that impact on the border too
7930843 enabling clients to interface with government authorities via a single entry point in order to comply with regulations relating to the import export and transit of cargo and the arrival and departure of commercial ships and aircraft

7930857 the path we took was to roll out v5 in exactly the same format as the users previous version then after a couple of days start introducing the new features and benefits of v5
7930858 so long as you are clear on what you are trying to achieve the system can be designed to reflect this

7930885 the radios can be a concern if someone were to figure out how to use them to confuse us at an emergency scene
7930886 all we know is we were notified of a possible gunman
7930887 the numbers of true emergencies is far smaller than that
7930888 its a small number of true emergencies though there are some there are times when we have true emergencies and we need things quickly
7930889 with the sad loss of danish kaneria for the rest of the season it became necessary to consider our options for the rest of the campaign in terms of whether to sign another overseas player

7930905 part of that is to fit complex software into as small an arm processor as possible with even lower cost arm processors handling subsystems of the robot
7930906 these processors are on their way to ramping up in mobile devices and in home consumer electronics and will be applicable to lower cost personal robotics as well as shipments of such processors grow their falling prices would make them increasingly attractive we would likely see very small lower power x86 processors used as the main processors alongside arm processors

7930948 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002

7930958 we have a real problem when underprivileged citizens are forced to spend nights in homeless shelters or in church but the issue of housing is more than just creating affordable homes for people in our community its also about making sure our neighbors have the opportunity to become financially literate in order to maintain the economic stability necessary to stay in their homes
7930959 thats what organizations like fair tide contribute to our community
7930960 fair tide relies on community support and involvement and in turn provides the community with productive and active citizens thats why this partnership with riverrun is so meaningful
7930961 challenging times such as these leave many parents wondering if they will be able to save for education

7930964 we have contacted town attorney pat scully to assess things and see if there were any valid concerns
7930965 the preliminary assessment by pat was that we were ok but thats not good enough for me
7930966 the only way is to have an unbiased group look at this
7930967 the budget review committee will be supplemented with an accountant and financial analyst theyll calculate the last 10 years of expenses from the parking lots and also project out the next 10 years to see what all the expenses are

7930973 portuguese players like all the glamour perfume look all nice and here people just get down and get dirty
7930974 this is bizarre but when you think about it it makes training so much more fun

7930980 the tiniest boys and girls should be loved and protected
7930981 but as nominating barack obama emphasizes the dnc even supports killing kids in the womb old enough to know their mothers voice sleep and dream suck their thumbs and play with their toes
7930982 when we tell kids that unborn children can be killed if their parents dont want them
7930983 we rob them of the knowledge of the god given right to life and we destroy their moral foundation abortion is wrong because its a baby its always wrong to intentionally kill an innocent baby

7931003 what i think is exciting about hope therapy is the way we are learning from people who are doing very well we have been figuring out what hopeful people are doing right and taking those lessons and developing therapies and interventions for people who are not doing as well
7931004 is that it seems to work we can teach people how to be more hopeful

7931013 in polling the anglers a lot of them have family plans and that labor day is an important weekend for a lot of folks

7931017 is obviously very much in contrast with roman catholic theology and from our perspective did not seem appropriate for this chair
7931018 theres just a huge conflict going on between whether people can discuss controversial issues or whether you can only give the official position

7931026 they seem to care for the welfare of those they know
7931027 subjects systematically favoured the prosocial option provided their partner was a familiar b visible and c receiving rewards of equal value
7931028 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7931029 we believe prosocial behaviour is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices
7931030 capuchin monkeys spontaneously share food in both nature and captivity and commonly sit next to each other while eating
7931031 the group continues to perform strongly and the outlook remains positive
7931032 we expect prices for rio tintos major commodities to remain substantially above the long run trend in 2009
7931033 it was a great result and it keeps the pressure on bhp as it continues the chase
7931034 the only black spot was that copper earnings were down slightly after they had some mining issues during the year
7931035 rio tinto is in great shape and is getting stronger
7931036 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year

7931038 the acquisition represents an important addition to ovls operations and we believe ovls financial strength and technical expertise will further enhance the attractive growth potential of the business in the tomsk region
7931039 additionally we view this as an important opportunity to expand on the continuing co operation between russia and india in the energy sector
7931040 as imperial energy moves into the next phase of its development with production increasing further over the coming years it makes strategic sense to be part of a larger group
7931041 the share offer fairly reflects imperial energys achievements and represents an excellent opportunity to realize a compelling value in cash
7931042 wholly exempts agricultural producers from the payment of enterprise income taxes with regard to the rearing of livestock including pork
7931043 it appears that sales of agricultural commodities produced and sold by farmers in china such as wheat cotton and corn are exempted from the vat
7931044 when these same products are imported it appears that they are assessed the vat at the rate of 13 percent
7931045 if they are there then that is what the plan would be
7931046 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late

7931049 a lot of the fall is due to the increase in public coverage
7931050 the consumer climate was depressed further by the very subdued economic outlook even significantly lower crude oil prices did nothing to brighten the consumer mood

7931052 the german economy is encountering an increasingly more difficult situation
7931053 the german consumer is clearly no match for the rapid slowdown of the global economy
7931054 high energy prices are reducing the purchasing power of consumers with manufacturing and wholesale prices rocketing most recently there is little hope of an easing in the price trend of other fast moving consumer goods
7931055 real disposable income for consumption will therefore hardly see an increase this year
7931056 that is severely impacting our business and is a large factor in terms of where our results are both this quarter and last quarter
7931057 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance
7931058 to therefore determine the type of investment needed for the company we need a strategy and that is what we intend to do
7931059 with that strategy in place we will very easily invest wisely and everybody will be happy
7931060 it was very emotional when he brother came up to me and said my sister was named selena and i said i was named after her it was a really powerful moment

7931062 i would love to bring back that person to life and educate people on her because a lot of people dont know who she is and i think shes wonderful

7931078 interrogators often get detainees with little or no information along with them and even after they are interrogated there is little feedback to help the interrogators know whether the detainees were honest in their statements
7931079 interrogators and analysts alike rarely get information about follow on operations based on their work again making it impossible to evaluate how theyre doing further when units send a detainee to be interrogated they rarely get the results so they dont know whether they got a bad guy or somebody who was in the wrong place at the wrong time

7931115 this is because small scale fisheries employ more than 12 million people world wide compared to half a million in the industrial sector
7931116 and because small scale fisheries use less fuel to catch fish
7931117 small scale fisheries use fishing gear that are more selective and far less destructive to deep sea environments
7931118 as a result they discard very little unwanted fish and almost all of their catch is used for human consumption
7931119 for the amount of resources invested we havent seen significant decrease in demand for species for which the global stocks are on the edge of collapse
7931120 market based initiatives while well intentioned unduly discriminate against small scale fishers for their lack of resources to provide data for certification
7931121 its an unfair disadvantage that in any other industry would have had people up in arms
7931122 but small scale fishers are often in developing countries and have very little political influence

7931142 i left my last battle with the fantastic four supercharged with hate for you earthlings and your heroes and so i made this video its a little ramble filled in places and just for claritys sake id like to simplify things a little i think theres a way for the glorious skrull empire to invade earth conquer it kill your heroes and make everyone happy doing it i dont claim to be right but i think there could be something to this
7931143 the question im sure ill be asked the most is
7931144 why should we do it why let the skrulls invade our world destroy our heroes and generally become slaves to their shape shifting superiority
7931145 right now earthlings are backwards no one watches a movie decides that they wanna be an action star and only aspires to ever be rambo or die hard or that dude from the
7931146 the way that the invasion should work uh is that we start out replacing low profile heroes like spider woman and low profile supporting characters like jarvis and eventually graduate up over long drawn out years to captain america and work our way up and when we hit a certain level when we can take over s
7931147 i know that people are watching this yknow and are saying
7931148 what the hell is wrong with this dude this is the worst thing for earth he should not be telling earths heroes to embrace skrull domination let green aliens with weird chins take over the world
7931149 the more people that embrace change the easier change will be im one skrull im out there im taking your heroes and making new ones im making a new wolverine um yknow and if there were two of wolverine itd be even better and if there were six of him wed be huge and if there were twenty of wolverine yknow x men fans would come along and embrace what were doing and it could happen change would be selling better marvel heroes would be better because youd have skrull heroes like the 1970s sweet christmas
7931150 were doing great right now um the replacing is going great numbers are up skrull spies are killing folks like elektra you know
7931151 welp at least were not being eaten by galactus these days thats great
7931152 and so i hope this didnt infuriate too many earthlings i hope that you see the intent and why you and all your heroes must die embracing change um and i think thats enough from me ill sign off but yeah youre all dead
7931153 we get little messages on the phone from the boiler room hey wisconsin youve got your sign up

7931156 what could this book be about if you think that it involves someones death then yes you would be correct but youll never see it coming and it will leave you thinking about just what transpired for days or hours depending on your attention span
7931157 you can write this story but that doesnt mean that its a story
7931158 i kind of think we are hyping it i wonder if well look back in three days and say why did we waste all our time with that i think its a much smaller group than we make them out to be
7931159 its a free country but the noisiest people get the coverage
7931160 barack obama must convince voters hes not a far left ideologue

7931164 she can do it but that doesnt mean we have to do it

7931166 this is not an easy decision but it is the only way to protect peoples lives
7931167 c s lewis is definitely one of the writers i admire most
7931168 he wrote as well as possible knowing that the truth would speak for itself
7931169 theres no christian way to write just as there is no christian way to boil an egg writers whether they are christian or agnostic have to follow good rules of writing and he did and because of that the truth spoke for itself
7931170 going back to 1999 john mccain did an interview with the san francisco chronicle saying that overturning roe v wade would not make any sense because then women would have to have illegal abortions

7931318 during that time we found that an inordinate amount of piracy involved students on college campuses

7931321 a lot of people believe that people in music have these huge deep pockets
7931322 illegal file sharing affects everyone in the industry from truck drivers delivering the finished product to engineers and technicians many of these people are trying to earn a living just to fee their families
7931323 this is no different than going into a retail store picking something up off the shelf putting in your pocket and walking out
7931324 thats theft thats essentially whats happening with illegal file sharing and illegal downloading of music
7931325 number one they believe its ok because everyone else is doing it and thats not true
7931326 the second thing is the belief that im anonymous and i cant get caught i think this lawsuit works as a good example that they can get caught and will get caught
7931327 as students arrived we took time to explain the cases going on at arkansas tech
7931328 of course we let them know that it was illegal but we also told them that everything they downloaded at arkansas tech could be monitored and traced
7931329 i explained that there is a lawsuit pending not against the university but against students who illegally downloaded or shared files some students were a little nervous but i think they understood the gravity of how the entertainment industry was fighting back

7931340 and the lord the god of their fathers sent word to them again and again by his messengers because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place but they continually mocked the messengers of god despised his words and scoffed at his prophets until the wrath of the lord arose against his people until there was no remedy
7931341 hear now my words if there is a prophet among you i the lord make myself known to him in a vision i speak to him in a dream not so with my servant moses he is faithful in all my house i speak with him face to face even plainly and not in dark sayings and he sees the form of the lord why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant moses

7931385 maybe if the live action star wars tv series goes ahead i might try and wheedle my way back into the affections of lucasfilm and write an episode
7931386 the weird thing and i think this goes for both star trek and doctor who is that neither of them are remakes i often see star trek being referred to as a remake and it really isnt its another star trek film its another movie in the series its the continuing mission
7931387 doctor who is like that as well and because of the nature of how doctor who evolves you become part of that tradition rather than a re handling of it
7931388 both of those are perfect examples of taking the spirit of the original material and entirely maintaining it

7931416 jim is very lucky to be alive and is getting a little bit better each day but he has serious head injuries which is obviously a concern
7931417 he didnt have insurance because he has served in iraq and kosova and basically thought if he survived that he wouldnt have any problem in warsaw
7931418 we didnt think it was too much to expect for the army to help bring him home they are always banging on about our boys but they basically washed their hands of jim when he needed their help and they have just left him over there
7931419 his injuries are horrific and he is in a foreign country it is true to say he was not on active service with the army and it is not the armys responsibility to repatriate everybody who finds themselves in difficult circumstances when they are not on duty
7931420 but having said all that this lance corporal is a war hero his family are looking at a bill of around 30 000 to have him repatriated and i think the ministry of defence could and look at any opportunities that they have to bring him home
7931421 unfortunately because this soldier was on personal leave we are unable to offer help
7931422 when he is back he will get the same care as anyone would while off sick
7931423 the end of inylchek glacier was somewhat extraordinary with water spring up in different locations making terrible noises some of them ran down the glacier slopes while other gushed forth from deep cracks in the glacier surface our horses were so frightened by the great roar and glacier pulsation that we hardly managed to get them down the slope there was a moment when the glacier seemed to be at the point of breaking away and rushing downward destroying everything in its way

7931491 this young woman who calls herself lover of al quds has set out more than once on combat operations some of which were successful and others not but she is determined to continue
7931492 this is the belt we wear around our waists so that we can detonate ourselves at the push of a button this is a safety button and so is this we wont explode unless we press this button when god instills the will in our hearts our strength lies not in the body but in the heart if the heart so desires and we are inspired by god to set out every female martyrdom seeker is inspired by allah

7931512 with the extra money the larger boat will bring you can buy a second one and a third one and so on until you have an entire fleet of trawlers instead of selling your fish to a middle man you can then negotiate directly with the processing plants and maybe even open your own plant you can then leave this little village and move to mexico city los angeles or even new york city from there you can direct your huge new enterprise
7931513 afterwards well my friend thats when it gets really interesting
7931514 when your business gets really big you can start buying and selling stocks and make millions

7931648 lo que rusia est haciendo frente a la otan y a la uni n europea ue al reconocer la independencia de osetia del sur y abjasia es la misma medicina que occidente le hizo tomar cuando reconoci la independencia de kosovo de serbia sin la aceptaci n de rusia
7931649 lleg el momento de utilizarlo como tal es una r plica
7931650 tanto la ue como la otan no pueden dejar de reconocer la independencia de un estado soberano tampoco pueden evitar que osetia del sur y abjasia pidan a rusia que estacione tropas en su territorio ese es un desaf o a la otan que ser dif cil de resolver
7931651 no se debe olvidar que la crisis la inici en forma clara georgia y que adem s fue la primera en violar el alto al fuego y que lo que hizo rusia fue reaccionar a lo anterior

7931658 inflation is the sum of all products services consumers use not solely a portion
7931659 core inflation is more indicative of long term price changes the problem occurs when you have periods of large price changes in food and energy such as today which pushes total inflation way up then the cry occurs that the fed is not measuring inflation accurately
7931660 but what people have to realize is that those food and energy prices can also drop just as quickly depressing overall inflation and that volatility underscores the reason the fed uses core inflation as a gauge core inflation is a more accurate measure of long term price pressures in the economy and we evaluate these long term pressures to determine if inflation is getting out of hand
7931661 history says that will not be the case that periods of record energy price increases have been followed by price busts
7931662 obviously the ultimately proof of this will be how energy prices perform following this extraordinary oil bull market

7931736 its probably pretty accurate but you have to also look at the area it covers if you look at what its forecasting for the texas panhandle its actually a forecast that runs from the canadian border all the way to the texas panhandle so its a pretty broad area

7931867 i think the speaker spots are filling up which is great
7931868 we have observed previously that the idea of smoking a cigarette becomes increasingly attractive to smokers while they are craving
7931869 this study suggests that when smokers are not craving they fail to appreciate just how powerful their cravings will be this lack of insight while not craving may lead them to make decisions such as choosing to attend a party where there will be lots of smoking that they may come to regret
7931870 these findings suggest that smokers are likely to underpredict their own future desire to smoke when theyre not craving a cigarette
7931871 australian horses must spend a period in quarantine which is longer than the known incubation period for this disease
7931872 we are constantly monitoring the situation given the additional measures due to equine influenza ei of three weeks pre export isolation we are confident in our measures for live horses as they currently stand
7931873 evidence indicates that humans can only get the disease from contact with acutely ill horses so the risk of human disease from contact with horses that appear healthy is likely very low
7931874 the solomon islands is very different culturally to new zealand and the environment takes some getting used to especially the heat i thoroughly enjoy hunting diving and snowboarding so this deployment is a long way from any of those activities and that all takes time to get used to
7931875 whats great about this posting is getting the chance to put all my army skills into practice and seeing how the training is coming together
7931876 a bad guy comes into town and tries to take it over
7931877 the sheriff is a bit of a wuss but he has to try to get the town back

7931891 that would be a valuable contribution to the south island in the next month to six weeks as the coldest part of the winter rolls out
7931892 youd probably do it in a couple of catchments to see if the model will work
7931893 in most of canterbury the issue is mainly about allocation but not quality so you may not be able to use the whole of the model there might be places where nutrient concerns as well as quantity could be used
7931894 obviously with the number of takes you have got in canterbury you probably are a reasonable place to start and see if this model could work if the government could help provide metering set up the registry
7931895 indications are that for example a national registry might be 30m to put in place thats a one off cost
7931896 for an era when our supply of water was vastly greater than our needs
7931897 the safety and security of our users is a top priority for facebook
7931898 yet we continue to think theyre suffering from some sort of malnourished form of capitalism we think they need our business thats just not true

7931900 listen the price of cotton has quintupled we have to get out of this business completely were going bankrupt here i know were in a relationship with you where we have to supply you cotton for the next five years so how about i find you some cotton from turkey and vietnam and you and i both take some of that margin that we were initially going to take from the cotton field and we invest it in a joint venture to process it wouldnt that be better for both of us
7931901 if its going to be that way then im going to steal your intellectual property

7931903 michael fully deserves this contract and it shows that a player can progress through club cricket to become a fully contracted canterbury player

7931905 once people over there see the game they are hooked on rugby
7931906 they just love it because the ball is in play so much more compared to football nfl and the players dont wear things like crash helmets
7931907 the key thing would be to get the media interested in the game to create tv and newspaper coverage beforehand
7931908 it was pitch dark and he couldnt see anything it was lucky he did not have an accident himself
7931909 it is so bad i have seen a lot of things i am 58 but this is so bad
7931910 some of the cows were going away at 50 to 60km h the river was so wild
7931911 we are so lucky that the guy smit getting the cows in didnt get hurt it could have been much much worse if he had fallen into the river

7931918 that would be a valuable contribution to the south island in the next month to six weeks as the coldest part of the winter rolls out
7931919 it is not going to make a significant contribution to our results
7931920 our overall outlook is that you can expect a performance from pgc which is in line with the year weve just reported on we will know more about that in february
7931921 if theyd mentioned the word growth in the year ahead then we would have seen some more share price upside but i think investors are reluctant to pay out too much on that stock
7931922 maracs result was particularly pleasing against a backdrop of the wider finance sector performance and global and local credit conditions
7931923 to show him the evidence of corruption he had against peter simunovich and stated that through a payment of 50 000 we would just slowly get rid of it
7931924 in exchange for winston peters shutting up about his allegations of wrongdoing against simunovich fisheries and sure enough within a couple of weeks winston peters did shut up
7931925 and kept the bank records just in case something went wrong
7931926 when youre losing the case in court you try to win it outside
7931927 i think it is a sad day if youre going to shut down a question from a member of this house over a most important matter

7931947 numarul actual al angajatilor este suficient pentru demararea productiei utilitarei transit connect in 2009 cel mai probabil majorarea numarului angajatilor va incepe in 2010 dupa intrarea in productie a viitorului model de clasa mica
7931948 la comisi n nacional de comunicaciones se encuentra investigando el tema
7931949 voy a comenzar por contarte que en el momento de tu ca da al ver que te tomabas la pierna les dije a los que estaban viendo el partido conmigo en casa mart n se jodi l nunca se agarra nada
7931950 vuelvo 10 a os atr s cuando nos conocimos en tandil junto a todos los componentes de un grupo extraordinario con una capacidad de inteligencia muy grande ya te conoc a futbol sticamente pero como se puede conocer a un adversario vi ndolo jugar contra uno por alg n partido en la televisi n o cuando se asiste al estadio como simple espectador
7931951 te ve a algo que me gusta de los 9 y es que te sent as muy bien dentro de los 18 metros del rea donde no todos se encuentran bien hay para todos los gustos en ese puesto los que se tiran atr s para llegar tocando o los que van por los costados pero vos no tu sector era y es el rea grande teniendo adem s una gran virtud saber d nde va a caer el bal n para anticipar al defensor que no lo sabe
7931952 contar con un goleador como vos adem s de otro que desbordaba al nivel de guillermo y otro que constru a y distribu a como rom n significaba que m s de la mitad del trabajo que ten a que hacer para armar el equipo ya estaba hecho
7931953 bendito 98 que nos juntamos todos en el lugar indicado y en el momento justo para cumplir nuestros sue os m s preciados como componentes de un grupo con apetito de triunfos
7931954 futbol sticamente pienso que esos momentos tuyos fueron irrepetibles porque te consolidaste como goleador ante todos los que dudaban y cuestionaban tus cualidades de definidor
7931955 hasta que lleg ese partido en santa fe contra col n el 13 de noviembre de 1999 en el que te rompiste los ligamentos cruzados de la rodilla derecha
7931956 a partir de ah viviste momentos de dudas terribles haci ndonte todas las preguntas posibles despu s de cada sesi n de kine luego pasaste a trabajar en el campo donde de a poco ve as la puerta de salida a medida que empezabas a tocar el bal n y a participar de los picados
7931957 y no me olvido ese entrenamiento al d a siguiente de la derrota por 2 1 contra river en la libertadores en el cual le convertiste dos goles a tu amigo abbondanzieri
7931958 recordar siempre que te agarr al final del mismo y te avis vas a ir al banco el mi rcoles pr ximo y vas a calentar al comienzo del 2 tiempo para entrar cuando falten 30 20 minutos
7931959 te dije adem s que en eso no hab a nadie que deseara tanto que las cosas te salgan bien m s que yo recordar s tambi n a los que no estaban seguros de tu posible vuelta
7931960 si no tomaba esa decisi n no hubieras vivido los momentos que llegaron luego
7931961 a partir de ah en la cuenta regresiva hasta la semana siguiente ten as un gran quilombo en la cabeza porque no esperabas que te dijera eso
7931962 la historia termin bien con el muchachito de la pel cula diciendo aqu estoy de vuelta
7931963 pasamos momentos de charla de todo tipo seg n tus estados de nimo entre ellas una en el t nel de una cancha donde conversamos 30 minutos mientras jugaba la reserva un rato despu s convertir as el gol de la victoria por 1 0
7931964 repasamos tu lesi n de espa a tras la cual tambi n apretaste los dientes y te dijiste por segunda vez voy a volver desde tu regreso a boca llegamos a un presente lleno de satisfacciones preparado para batir todos los r cords de eficacia una cuesti n que esta lesi n quiere impedir pero no lograr porque la vuelta vas a ir program ndola de a poco seg n tu evoluci n en la recuperaci n
7931965 sos un tipo ganador por naturaleza con mucha confianza en vos mismo cualidad que no todos poseen
7931966 sab s muy bien que el sacrificio f sico vas a tener que hacerlo vos pero que seremos muchos los que desearemos volver a verte en un campo de juego conviertiendo en gol una situaci n que para otros no lo era
7931967 mart n como te dije vamos a pele rsela al destino que sepa que sos vos el que decid s cuando vas a dejar de golear no va a ser l con sus piedras en el camino el que nos complicar el final
7931968 volver s y despu s de un par de r cords entre ellos los 206 goles que convert en v lez levantar s los brazos y tendr s todo el derecho de dar las hurras para disfrutar de haber sido el m ximo goleador de los ltimos 15 a os
7931969 toda mi admiraci n y respeto deseando y esperando tu retorno para poder festejar otro gol
7931970 todays ruling means more people will be forced to take potentially more polluting forms of transportation to work school or church mta should make it easier not harder for riders to use public transportation when people switch from buses to cars due to higher bus fares the result will be dirtier air theres no question that the cost of a bus ride impacts the environment

7932016 judging by the growing response from buyers on our models especially on our inokom i10 and plus the newly launched extended warranty package we are optimistic on our sales outlook for the second half
7932017 exceedingly high inflation and political instability will have significant downside impact on domestic consumption and investment
7932018 purchasing power of consumers and profit margins of firms will be squeezed due to rising costs while political uncertainties will depress consumer and investment sentiments which have started to wane since the election in march

7932038 i had fantasised about being a taxi driver i believe that women can and should take up vocations that are traditionally regarded as male preserves
7932039 society did not care about me and my sons for three years ago it showed no empathy towards me as a battered woman so why bother about its customs regulations and rules now
7932040 initially i was apprehensive to ride in a cab driven by a woman having been raised in a conservative culture it is not easy to break paradigms and accept a woman in a mans job however in the end economics and daily needs are stronger than religion and rigid rules

7932044 the country might have turned the corner the situation has finally started to improve
7932045 but whether this is a long term permanent reduction the answer is hard to say the situation is vulnerable to a relapse
7932046 in three years afghanistan has gone from 82 percent of provinces growing poppy to approximately 60 percent being poppy free
7932047 this geographical overlap between regions of opium and zones of insurgency shows the inextricable link between drugs and conflict
7932048 since drugs and insurgency are caused by and effect each other they need to be dealt with at the same time and urgently
7932049 the reduction this year that were seeing overall we think is probably largely due to the weather the climate and economics
7932050 the economic foundations of the opium economy have finally been undermined
7932051 judging from the fact that there are now 18 opium free provinces a growing number of governors are really playing by the rule book
7932052 generally speaking it takes 12 25 years a generation to wipe out opium cultivation in a country
7932053 in afghanistan until and as long as it and those assisting it do not have full control of the territory opium eradication will remain a far away mirage

7932057 this decision is completely illegal and has no legal basis
7932058 russia has made unimaginable mistakes and inflicted unimaginable harm to its own position in the international community and its international relations
7932059 my appeal to the free world is to condemn and reject russias dangerous and irrational decision not only for the sake of georgia but for the sake of preserving the fundamental basis of international law and order

7932064 until recently we tried to help restore georgias state unity but the last nail was driven in following georgias decision to attack
7932065 as to our involvement in other conflicts we naturally are not going to do this
7932066 however russia is a state which has to ensure its interests along the entire length of its border this is absolutely clear
7932067 according to our information they are even starting to supply new types of weapons restoring the military infrastructure that was used in the aggression
7932068 virtually all states that are supplying arms to georgia are nato member countries
7932069 these weapons which were supplied to georgia both overtly and covertly were eventually used against russian citizens

7932085 its stunning where this election is going to be decided on
7932086 what obama needs to do is to give that definition
7932087 the financial crisis this time is a lot scarier and more profound
7932088 it was tricky because the waves were crashing over his head one minute you saw him the next he was under a metre of water his fists were white from clinging on

7932091 once the team management and the swimmers and nzoc get back in the country well meet with them and review everything and decide at that stage whether any further action is necessary
7932092 im just really keen to make sure something silly like this doesnt overshadow the incredible performances that they had
7932093 whether its a cycling team or a swimming team its made pretty clear to them what the code of conduct is and clearly something like this probably breaches that
7932094 for something like this to put a dampener on it is a real shame
7932095 inappropriate and foolhardy behaviour at the end of a long campaign
7932096 its something that both swimming new zealand and the nzoc will have to address its not something that can be ignored
7932097 any time protocol isnt followed it has to be addressed
7932098 a change in government if it comes at all could see the stock market rattled because during the transition period we dont know what to expect
7932099 one of the things investors look for is predictability the political situation in malaysia is not the most predictable
7932100 its not as clear as it could be and i think that is keeping people wondering
7932101 from the feedback i get from the ground so far fund managers are all waiting to see what is going to happen
7932102 its not just the political backdrop the inflation the global economic slowdown the crude palm oil prices are all major concerns
7932103 if you are looking at long term investment then now is a good time to accumulate but if you have a trading mentality then its difficult
7932104 its good for the country in the long term development but all these initial pains are part of the development of a open economy
7932105 in the long run ibs adoption will benefit the construction industry through faster completion time better productivity and reduce unskilled workers
7932106 the products resulting from these r amp d ventures must now be used to help industry overcome the problems it faces
7932107 mras put in place the mechanism that allows for mutual recognition of qualifications and standards of professionals and provides a platform for the exchange of information and best practices
7932108 this removes barriers to trade in services through transparency of asean member states regulations and procedures to facilitate the movement of professionals
7932109 the fallout of the credit crisis will continue to dampen the global economy over the next 24 months with sharply escalated oil and food prices beginning to test inflation expectations
7932110 member states should finalise their reservation lists within six months from the signing of the agreement
7932111 the acia has taken into account international best practices and the benefits will extend to asean based foreign investors that are investing in other asean countries as well as contribute towards increasing intra asean investments
7932112 foreign direct investment fdi from these countries will help to complement efforts under acia to promote and increase intra asean investments

7932115 we have the fridge sitting here in the lounge because there is no space to get it in the kitchen
7932116 its critical for brands to reach this market they realize that
7932117 this is something new that kind of already requires awareness because a lot of this is driven through peoples perception of the product
7932118 when youre sharing an affinity for something its kind of hard to grasp exactly what new products encompass without knowing what they already are
7932119 so thinking that theyre going to do engagement ads and that its going to be success alone isnt going to be sufficient
7932120 global warming isnt a pretty suv ad its a frightening reality
7932121 the brands should roll with the negative feedback and listen and incorporate some of that feedback in their upcoming products
7932122 the last thing they should do is shut the ads down
7932123 theres a large amount of social responsibility that comes into play here
7932124 when youre sharing peoples opinions and associating them with certain things it takes a personal attachment that hasnt been used in advertising before
7932125 what they need to do is develop resources for the marketers that will help them be more confident
7932126 maybe the company could develop a marketing conference for marketers on facebook their developer conference in san francisco was huge why arent they doing this for the brands
7932127 facebook is throwing all kinds of pasta at the wall when it comes to marketing and to see what sticks
7932128 they havent figured it out and unfortunately theyre using brands as the guinea pigs and their customers they really have to make it clear to their community what works and what doesnt and develop best practices sooner or later
7932129 the iraqi security forces working with coalition forces in baghdad contributed immensely to the rashid districts decrease in the levels of violence

7932140 tonight when hillary clinton speaks she will be an articulate voice for the working men and women the middle class families that have been squeezed and she will make the case as she uniquely can for why barack obama is the right choice for the presidency
7932141 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7932142 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7932143 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7932144 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and me our country will be committed to his cause

7932168 zugleich hat eine massive umverteilung von unten nach oben stattgefunden
7932169 in keinem anderen europ ischen land ist der niedriglohnsektor so stark gewachsen wie in deutschland
7932170 das deutsche tarifsystem hat eine gro e schw che es gibt keine verbindliche lohnuntergrenze
7932171 anders als politiker behaupten kommt der aufschwung also bei vielen menschen nicht an
7932172 ich widerspreche der annahme dass auch im aufschwung die spreizung zugenommen hat
7932173 tengo una posici n muy buena la gente conf a en m al cien por ciento

7932179 me agarr a mi sill n no hice nada especial fui consciente de que era un accidente cuando el est mago me subi y me baj y sent un golpe
7932180 ich habe zu viel respekt vor der intelligenz der italiener um zu glauben sie k nnten solche trottel
7932181 nur napoleon hat mehr getan als ich aber ich bin definitiv gr er
7932182 ich bin der jesus christus der politik ich bin ein geduldiges opfer habe mich selbst f r alle geopfert
7932183 gehen sie und lesen sie im schwarzbuch des kommunismus und sie werden sehen dass im china maos keine babys gegessen wurden aber gekocht um damit die felder zu d ngen
7932184 nicht einmal die wirtschaft l uft wirklich schlecht von meiner villa aus habe ich eine herrliche panorama sicht die auch dieses jahr durch den blick auf viele yachten besticht niemand kann mehr mobiltelefone mehr autos mehr fernseher sein eigen nennen als die italiener wissen sie wie viele unserer frauen sich sch nheitsoperationen leisten k nnen
7932185 mussolini hat nie jemanden get tet mussolini schickte menschen in lager in den urlaub
7932186 herr schulz ich wei dass ein mann in italien einen film ber konzentrationslager der nazis produziert ich w rde sie gern f r die rolle eines aufsehers vorschlagen sie w ren perfekt
7932187 ich habe ein segelboot aber in den vergangenen zwei jahren war ich nur einen tag darauf und in meinem haus auf den bermudas war ich seit zwei oder drei jahren nicht mehr mein leben hat sich ver ndert die qualit t ist schrecklich geworden was f r ein brutaler job
7932188 die kl gsten k nnen sicherlich einen zweiten job finden vielleicht inoffiziell
7932189 manchmal funktionieren tretboote gut keine der leichen hat sich beschwert
7932190 vor dem gesetz sind alle b rger gleich aber vielleicht ist dieser hier noch ein bisschen gleicher als die anderen angesichts der tatsache dass ihm 50 prozent der italiener die verantwortung bertrugen ihr land zu regieren
7932191 globalisierung technischer fortschritt und arbeitsm rkte ursachen und folgen der schere zwischen l hnen und einkommen
7932192 ein gro teil der wirtschaft handelt von der relativen effizienz der marktaufteilung
7932193 die zulagen kommen in der masse nicht der altersvorsorge zugute
7932194 bei banksparpl nen gibt es meistens nur einen zinssatz und eine j hrliche kontof hrungsgeb hr das versteht jeder
7932195 die sind unbeliebt bei den anbietern denn hier verdienen sie zu wenig
7932196 die berater verkaufen am liebsten die produkte mit den h chsten provisionen und das sind die versicherungen
7932197 da fallen sowohl auf fonds als auch auf versicherungsebene geb hren an
7932198 deshalb besser direkt in einen fonds sparplan oder eine klassische rentenversicherung investieren
7932199 dina tousled her hair a lot like you see her do on tv

7932203 it will allow us also to address the seismic strengthening work in the first 10 years of the project
7932204 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7932205 because this matter is currently under investigation there is little we can say right now we can say this were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7932206 we must be watchful of any back sliding and resist the temptation to raise trade barriers or resort to protectionist practices for lack of an overall agreement
7932207 our purpose is not to create a trade bloc we are committed to open regionalism and adopt an inclusive approach
7932208 but our actions would demonstrate the practical benefits of economic openness and contribute in a modest way to maintaining global momentum for trade liberalisation
7932209 we have done reasonably well these last few years total foreign direct investment fdi inflows to asean have grown steadily over the last few years and exceeded us 60 billion rm202 billion in 2007
7932210 but other competing regions in the world are moving rapidly to transform their economies particularly china which attracted almost us 83 billion rm279 71 billion of fdi last year ahead of all developing countries and more than the whole of asean
7932211 we hope the government will render some assistance especially on tax structures as construction cost has escalated by some 30 per cent
7932212 there must be flexibility it should be lower in areas with the least bumiputera concentration and can be more if otherwise if really there is no demand there is no point implementing it
7932213 developers lose rm15 000 for every low cost unit they build with the rise in raw materials by 30 per cent which the ministry has recognised they are bound to lose much more
7932214 the other concern is due to the drastic increase in raw material prices smaller developers will be in the doldrums hence there is a strong likelihood of a dramatic rise in abandoned projects
7932215 the market for medium to high end houses is superb we are experiencing a growth in this sector
7932216 he is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose
7932217 its really great to be able to provide an opportunity for year 9 and 10 students to do different funky stuff they might not get to do at school
7932218 nearly all the high schools in taranaki turned up and the team from patea left at 6 30am to get here
7932219 i was going too fast into some grass and i came off it was fine though i kept going
7932220 i was lucky enough to get a professional contract when i was 21 so ive never really worked
7932221 itll be great to try and help some young taranaki rugby players on a similar sort of path
7932222 someones paying you some reasonably good waddage for something you love
7932223 you get to travel all around the southern hemisphere and all around the world
7932224 you get so many opportunities these days and some of the things ive done its just been fantastic
7932225 over the last few years taranakis produced a lot of good rugby players and they havent always played for taranaki
7932226 so like we already said there is no point in rating all audio parameters of the w980 via rmaa tests
7932227 tft based displays have a transistor for each pixel on the screen
7932228 i just feel that robotic nurses and robotic doctors are completely contrary to what medicine is about

7932234 the whole point of the redevelopment is to improve the lives of those who live in marfell and strengthen the local community
7932235 although the two options are quite different we believe both will introduce a new mix of households to the area improve the quality of housing and the publics perception of marfell
7932236 youd probably do it in a couple of catchments to see if the model will work
7932237 in most of canterbury the issue is mainly about allocation but not quality so you may not be able to use the whole of the model there might be places where nutrient concerns as well as quantity could be used
7932238 obviously with the number of takes you have got in canterbury you probably are a reasonable place to start and see if this model could work if the government could help provide metering set up the registry
7932239 indications are that for example a national registry might be 30m to put in place thats a one off cost

7932254 the opium flood waters in afghanistan have started to recede
7932255 this is a remarkable accomplishment the first time it happens in the countrys modern history
7932256 until they all face the full force of the law the opium economy will continue to prosper with impunity and the taliban will continue to profit from it

7932317 may compromise the integrity of these education programs for practicing physicians
7932318 under the present system in many circumstances a cme course will be held only if a commercial company is willing to sponsor it
7932319 while for profit enterprises may occasionally engage in philanthropy it should not be surprising that the core motivation of pharmaceutical and medical device industries in supporting cme is to market their products and services
7932320 this leads to a cme curriculum which is at least in part designed to address market needs rather than being entirely focused upon improving performance of practicing physicians
7932321 clearly it would be preferable for stanford faculty to design our cme curriculum solely based upon the needs of our learners as they seek to address the health care needs of their patients

7932330 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7932331 we believe prosocial behaviour is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices

7932389 subjects systematically favoured the prosocial option provided their partner was a familiar b visible and c receiving rewards of equal value
7932390 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7932391 we believe prosocial behaviour is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices
7932392 capuchin monkeys spontaneously share food in both nature and captivity and commonly sit next to each other while eating
7932393 we were budgeting and everything and it was getting really close to going
7932394 but the new head of hbo felt it was just too dark and too violent and too controversial which of course is kind of the point

7932399 imperial energy has grown significantly from a pure exploration company and as imperial energy moves into the next phase of its development with production increasing further over the coming years it makes strategic sense to be part of a larger group

7932434 to show him the evidence of corruption he had against peter simunovich and stated that through a payment of 50 000 we would just slowly get rid of it
7932435 in exchange for winston peters shutting up about his allegations of wrongdoing against simunovich fisheries and sure enough within a couple of weeks winston peters did shut up
7932436 and kept the bank records just in case something went wrong
7932437 when youre losing the case in court you try to win it outside
7932438 i think it is a sad day if youre going to shut down a question from a member of this house over a most important matter

7932459 this latest evidence needs to be considered in light of two separate tests conducted by the transport accident investigation commission which each reached different conclusions and which the commission itself accepted could therefore not be relied upon
7932460 the inconsistency of the results reflects the difficulty experienced by both authorities in assessing the seaworthiness of the vessel after the accident
7932461 this was due to the kotuku being badly damaged after sinking and saturated after spending a week on the sea floor prior to it being transported via road and subjected to further tests while drying out in the open air

7932523 edward decide di opporsi ai propri istinti primari di negare lidentit stessa dellessere un vampiro
7932524 lunica differenza che le scene dazione non ci sono nel libro che scritto dal punto di vista di bella e spesso bella svenuta o non capisce cosa succede perch i vampiri si muovono velocissimi invece nel film lazione visibile
7932525 no affatto ho sempre visto molti film americani quindi in un certo senso se reciti in un film sembra pi naturale adottare quellaccento ti d pi limpressione di star recitando di interpretare qualcuno che non sei tu
7932526 e facile trasformarli in un clich visto tutti i libri e i film sui vampiri degli ultimi centanni ma questi non sono vampiri convenzionali non ne hanno laspetto e non muoiono allo stesso modo quindi ho cercato di semplificare al massimo ti mordono e diventi anche tu un vampiro diventi immortale e hai una forza sovrumana eccetera e neppure tu sai il perch
7932527 ci abbiamo provato in tutti i modi e li hanno sperimentati tutti su di me a un certo punto avevamo utilizzato dei sali minerali che riflettevano la luce unaltra volta avevano dipinto di blu la faccia di un assistente di produzione ma non ha funzionato molto bene

7932547 there were three or four hundred people on the sidewalk perfectly within their rights to be on the sidewalk we were illegally detained and we may bring suit against the city

7932567 youd probably do it in a couple of catchments to see if the model will work
7932568 in most of canterbury the issue is mainly about allocation but not quality so you may not be able to use the whole of the model there might be places where nutrient concerns as well as quantity could be used
7932569 obviously with the number of takes you have got in canterbury you probably are a reasonable place to start and see if this model could work if the government could help provide metering set up the registry
7932570 indications are that for example a national registry might be 30m to put in place thats a one off cost

7932588 this is a serious issue rightly rated critical by red hat and while there may not be cases of widespread exploitation of it it does require prompt and direct response i think red hat is doing that and in the end i think this issue will be highlighted by the companys response
7932589 that would be very bad indeed although red hat says that no updates appear to have been compromised
7932590 the debian openssl issue was another significant security matter both illustrate some of the security concerns internal breaches or code corruption that may be more specific to open source
7932591 most enterprise users of linux and open source software are coming to trust it and increase their use in general i dont think this will impact that trend
7932592 red hat customers have cause to be aware and to be concerned but with any enterprise grade operating system there are going to be security issues this is why i believe it is the vendors response that is most critical customers are being kept aware and updated with patches so i would say the issue is being handled adequately
7932593 you dont know what party they are with they have no political principles whatsoever they may need a job about that time who could i be referring to
7932594 what a bunch of sore losers i didnt win the book either but im not here whining about the test questions
7932595 this is a great honor being nominated vice president of the united states and it is an honor and im proud of it i dont mean in any way to diminish it
7932596 but it pales in comparison to the honor that ive had representing you
7932597 i didnt always comport myself the way looking back i want to when bad things happened to me when tragedy hit me like it hit many of you
7932598 i dont know whether i would have made it through a lot of the tough times in my life without you guys
7932599 i know you all know me and sometimes you think im just too optimistic but my optimism isnt borne out of some congenital problem i have
7932600 its borne out of that i actually do understand the history of this country and the american people have never never never never never ever let their country down never in all our history
7932601 ive never been team ive sort of a been a one man band
7932602 mark my words when this convention is over and three or four years from now theyre commenting on why the democrats won theyre gonna go back and point to the single most significant event that occurred at the democratic convention was michelle obama
7932603 the only reason i reason i accepted the nomination one reason so the delaware delegation could be moved up front
7932604 that kind of gave him a spark for the films
7932605 hes one of those filmmakers who wants to be a musician and i think that the way his films are trying to capture little fresh moments is a cool approach
7932606 its very important to me to not let the musician try to make the song perfect
7932607 its so much more human when a musician is doing this beautiful version of a song but messes up and then continues yeah thats beautiful to me
7932608 as far as the modern world is concerned these are natural environments
7932609 its filmed in its own elements from where it came from the streets and the bars and peoples apartments
7932610 lets put the final nail in the coffin on the term music video and allow it to be something of the past because thats exactly what it is
7932611 it served its purpose very well in the 1980s and 1990s music videos time came and went
7932612 i dont think music or film has been in a more exciting place in 20 years
7932613 i was just blown away by their beauty and how raw they were
7932614 we were just getting a little bit bored of watching the music promos
7932615 we didnt have much clout or really any money so the idea was to try to find a way to get our vision out there and get people to buy into it
7932616 a significant shift in the way people are watching music film
7932617 its just one person with a guitar and a couple people banging on parking signs or whatever to try to make a song
7932618 observation to alpha romeo and romeo 3 there is a fight in section 143 police are on their way

7932621 farmers have lots of obligations livestock is at stake their business is at stake its extremely stressful
7932622 this policy is making an already desperate situation far worse
7932623 what farmers cannot do is recruit foreign workers as skilled assistant herd managers in order to get around the immigration rules then pay them and treat them as lower skilled farm workers
7932624 we found some to work but couldnt get them visas
7932625 i meet other players who played under him and we have all got our own stories but he was a genius an absolute genius and certainly the best manager i played under without a shadow of a doubt i just feel very lucky like other players who played under him to have had that opportunity he was a genius and he has still left his mark on the football club
7932626 it was the most emphatic display of selflessness i have seen on a football field
7932627 pounding over every blade of grass competing if he would rather die of exhaustion than lose he inspired all around him i felt it was an honour to be associated with such a player
7932628 lots of people are looking for them ill save you the trouble they are not there
7932629 we are in this because unless someone does something there will be no sheep meat industry left in five years we wish there was another way and we did not have to stump up with 220m but we do not see any other choice
7932630 this is a partnership partners do not rip each other off the day we try to put one over these guys is the day it ends

7932634 we were not good on saturday and we lost the game it is as simple as that
7932635 you cannot want the supporters not to take it to heart because we do we are all very disappointed with our performance
7932636 we completely understand the critics because we were not good but we promise we will come back and play well tomorrow to put a good performance in
7932637 we did not play well as a team everybody knows that and william is no more guilty than anybody else
7932638 we lost as a team and we want to respond as a team
7932639 we have talked about everything needed to be successful in a team and commitment is needed for any success no matter how much quality you have
7932640 we live in world now where you have to accept the critics and a definite conclusion from everybody
7932641 but i know my squad is good my team is good our spirit is good
7932642 we are intelligent enough to know we did not play well on saturday but we know as well we have the needed quality to respond
7932643 i believe we have a strong squad and i believe in the players i have instead of always looking at who might be coming in
7932644 it is up to us as team to show personality strength and belief within the squad that will make the difference
7932645 we just look at the right player and if we can get him we get him if we dont we dont
7932646 if nothing is done it will not limit our ambitions because of it
7932647 the names do not impress me what is impressive for me is the attitude the quality
7932648 there is only one thing important and that is what you do on the pitch
7932649 i agree that what we did on the pitch on saturday was not good enough but all the rest to compare with names is not very interesting and not very useful
7932650 we have done the job well at twente but the job is not over
7932651 we have to respect twente and come into the game with a desire to win

7932666 the whole steve being out the first couple of games and with our numbers being depleted its a good thing that our running backs are running as well as they are right now
7932667 im disappointed for our football team but im also disappointed for him
7932668 hes a guy who was on our practice squad most of last year he made it onto the active roster and worked his tail off all offseason and was really having a good camp and had a real strong possibility of making our football team
7932669 therell be a lot of guys that we can look at and well just see what our potential is on our football team and obviously the other people out there
7932670 weve been really pushing him hard to work just to work hard
7932671 that way you dont have to turn it on or try to turn it on in a game thats what you do all the time and hes done that hes really working hard its kind of showing up in the games
7932672 steve is just a game breaker and he has those superstar capabilities
7932673 i may file an appeal for him or something and see if we can get him back out there
7932674 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7932675 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7932676 how can you make sure you fill it with the most fun and that you visit all the coolest places on earth before you pack those bags for the very last time
7932677 he didnt have enough days but he lived them like he should have
7932678 onde o mar e o c u se fundem no horizonte
7932679 ok maam youre safe now i locked the tiger in the cage
7932680 jim is very lucky to be alive and is getting a little bit better each day but he has serious head injuries which is obviously a concern
7932681 he didnt have insurance because he has served in iraq and kosova and basically thought if he survived that he wouldnt have any problem in warsaw
7932682 we didnt think it was too much to expect for the army to help bring him home they are always banging on about our boys but they basically washed their hands of jim when he needed their help and they have just left him over there
7932683 his injuries are horrific and he is in a foreign country it is true to say he was not on active service with the army and it is not the armys responsibility to repatriate everybody who finds themselves in difficult circumstances when they are not on duty
7932684 but having said all that this lance corporal is a war hero his family are looking at a bill of around 30 000 to have him repatriated and i think the ministry of defence could and look at any opportunities that they have to bring him home
7932685 unfortunately because this soldier was on personal leave we are unable to offer help
7932686 when he is back he will get the same care as anyone would while off sick
7932687 is this the best book on the subject or is there a better one
7932688 i wouldnt much weight into reports that there are windows of possibility
7932689 there are those who say that our day as the free worlds leader has passed that our moment is waning
7932690 no challenge too great for a world that stands as one
7932691 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point

7932695 former clinton advisor james carville on the democratic national convention
7932696 greg meyers is the pro small business candidate in this race he is keenly aware of the issues facing small business owners
7932697 his policy positions have indicated his support of many of nfibs priority issues including workforce development job growth lawsuit reform and changes to the newly devised business tax
7932698 im honored to receive the support of the voice of small business as a small business owner myself i know that we are the backbone of the economy
7932699 ive seen firsthand many of the challenges confronting the texas business climate im committed to lowering our tax burden promoting the free enterprise system and reducing frivolous lawsuits that drain our economic resources
7932700 a violent education corporal punishment of children in u s public schools
7932701 more than 200 000 u s public school students were punished by beatings during the 2006 2007 school year
7932702 the other kids were watching and laughing it made me want to fight them when you get a paddling and you see everyone laugh at you it make you mad and you want to do something about it
7932703 all corporal punishment whether or not it causes significant physical injury represents a violation of each students rights to physical integrity and human dignity it is degrading and humiliating damaging the students self esteem and making him or her feel helpless
7932704 in the 13 southern states where corporal punishment is most prevalent african american students are punished at 1 4 times the rate that would be expected given their numbers in the student population and african american girls are 2 1 times more likely to be paddled than might be expected
7932705 even the mere threat of drilling will bring down the price of oil
7932706 mob wars is my creation and the legal process is moving forward
7932707 bad year last year 3 13 they had a lot of problems on offense and a lot of problems on defense pretty much across the board in my mind marc bulger is a very good quarterback very accurate can really throw the football hard to throw the football when youre under siege which he was last year and i think in great part the reason for that is the injuries in the offensive line and that started with the loss of orlando pace at the beginning of the season that had kind of a ripple effect in their protection and then subsequently in their run game and then marc bulger taking a beating its interesting theyve brought in al saunders to run the offense and scott linehan being an offensive coach can now focus more on being the head coach well i feel like they can have a better defensive front front 7 obviously they drafted my son with the 2 pick hes the rookie as coaches mentioned yesterday rookies tend to have peaks and valleys as he is in the process of having right now
7932708 frank gore is a very physical gifted back coming off of an injury at the end of the season last year interestingly marshall faulk went down to florida and spent a great deal of time going over the mike martz offense with him defensively they are very physical very tough patrick willis is a rising star in the league had an immediate impact for them manny lawson who i enjoyed watching at nc state is coming back from an injury and they bring in justin smith they like their secondary
7932709 arizona is a team that started to rise last year obviously they have a quarterback situation there with matt leinart and kurt warner warner still has something left in his tank hes very intelligent they want matt leinart to be the guy and i think this is kind of a seminal year for him edgerrin james is still running effectively i think for the first time in a number of years their offensive line returns in tact defensively clancy pendergast is one of the more gifted coordinators in the league and i like what they do defensively
7932710 its an interesting dynamic there with mike holmgren having announced that its his final year was that a decision that he made was it an organizational decision his successor is in place in jim moore jr sic its mora no jr and that in and of itself is an interesting dynamic matt hasselbeck is there one of the top tier quarterbacks in the league and they spent a lot of money on julius jones some people say thats a good investment some not time will tell defensively its as talented a group as mike holmgrem has had in seattle but as i mentioned perception within the division maybe optimistically is that seattle might be coming down to the pack and that arizona might be ready to challenge and if youre going to make a run as a lower tier team in a division it would be the division to do that
7932711 ottawa is urging the vancouver winter olympics organizing committee to put the afghanistan war at the heart of the symbolically laden torch relay saying that the first torch carriers could be veterans of the seven year old conflict

7932739 while we continue our debates and disagreements wouldnt it be wise to take steps particularly when many of them are financially attractive that reduce both the risk of mass terrorism and the chance of catastrophic climate change
7932740 at times the united states may have to use its military to prevent wars and advance its interests not simply to fight and win wars when they occur accordingly the application of the military should in some cases be not of last resort but should sometimes occur at an early date when it is still possible to prevent security problems from metastasizing and affecting the broader international security system and u s interests more directly
7932741 such a preventive approach would represent a departure from the so called weinberger doctrine on the use of the military as a last resort and only when vital interests are threatened and a reorientation toward earlier involvement in problem areas by working with and through others to address security challenges so that large scale intervention by the united states is less likely at a later time
7932742 if theres a 1 percent chance that pakistani scientists are helping al qaeda build or develop a nuclear weapon we have to treat it as a certainty in terms of our response its not about our analysis its about our response

7932750 entering the labor day weekend we are seeing what labor and management can accomplish when they work together on behalf of the states students
7932751 new labor agreements reflect the needs of students as well as taxpayers and the needs of workers to earn competitive salaries and benefits to protect their families the taylor law is working and at the end of the day this benefits children
7932752 this period of stability enables unions and management to focus on programs to continue to raise standards improve test scores and close the achievement gap for children in poverty
7932753 we cannot let election year gimmicks and cuts to higher education undo the progress weve achieved or undermine the ability of education especially higher education to reignite our states economy
7932754 while we indeed are seeing many school boards and unions working collaboratively to create programs to improve student achievement there are still some school boards that place little value on the labor of their hard working teachers and support staff
7932755 these school boards do not represent the majority of new yorkers who understand that investing in education paying teachers and support staff fairly is the best way to build their communities and enhance their property values
7932756 teachers and support staff are professionals who work tirelessly on behalf of their school districts and the children they serve
7932757 they deserve to be treated with fairness dignity and respect at the bargaining table

7932796 the conservatives are really thumbing their nose at the rules
7932797 when canadians realize that communications from their mps are really just junk mail they will simply throw them away
7932798 the conservative party is using taxpayers money to fund the printing and mailing of electoral material
7932799 what it cant be is a solicitation for a membership in a party or for fundraising or for re election
7932800 everything that goes out from the house of commons goes through house of commons printing services

7932821 the game requests the player to be a hero and save black balloons by performing a number of energy saving actions such as switching off lights and appliances before the snowman melts because of the effects of climate change
7932822 we have designed this game to appeal to late primary school and early secondary school students but i think lots of adults may also enjoy playing it
7932823 the game really gives kids the understanding and empowers them by letting them know that their individual actions can reduce their impact on climate change

7932835 whatever it ends up as to ever get a chance to jam with two people like that it is a phenomenal thing for me its my life its what ive dreamed about doing
7932836 lots of politics would need to get ironed out before an album could be made
7932837 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7932838 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7932839 there may be parts of the speech that arent going to get a lot of applause but ive got to say what i believe will get our country back on the right path
7932840 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
7932841 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
7932842 didnt always comport myself in the way that i wanted to
7932843 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7932844 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7932845 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7932846 well you know he took american flag decals off of a jet and put on one from the other country he belongs to
7932847 the 22 250 is a very legitimate cartridge that is used for hunting all over america i dont want anything you or i say to demonize this cartridge or the rifle for that matter the guy was already a criminal for selling and or using meth and thats the problem it is not the lawful and legitimate use of the rifle or the caliber that is the problem if he was in the commission of a crime it is the crime and not the equipment that is what the focus should be on such is the case will almost all gun crime in america it is not the law abiding going out and doing wrong or bad things it is the criminals and that should be the focus the guy had numerous outstanding warrants so it wasnt his first time being in trouble
7932848 furthermore this is the first time i have heard of this cartridge associated with any criminal activity and it would be misrepresenting the cartridge and scoped rifles presenting the story that way
7932849 the focus should be on the individual his criminal history and whatever he was doing that made him not a credible threat
7932850 wait a minute this happened in denver where obama and biden are good luck lady having anyone pro 2a talk to you biden claims to have authored the assault weapons ban also foolishly demonizing legitimate firearms
7932851 furthermore i am too busy to talk to you further about this nor do i have time to meet you at the range

7932859 part of a cooperative arrangement in which iran is one of many countries
7932860 iraqs neighbors to provide weapons to iraqis fighting u s forces in iraq
7932861 suppose the u n security council were to say that it would accept iran having a full fuel cycle nuclear program limited to the enrichment levels necessary for nuclear energy if iran agrees to allow the iaea permanent and full access throughout iran to ensure that its nuclear program is limited to energy production
7932862 how much of what happens in the world today is controlled by the u s

7932866 given the deep roots of the conflict over kashmir it is surprising that the conflict does not muster clearly polarized majorities in pakistan and india falling in line behind their governments positions
7932867 instead many show openness to considering different possibilities for resolving the conflict
7932868 suppose the majority of all kashmiris including those on both sides of the line of control and refugees want kashmir to be an independent state

7932881 the last time tens of thousands of armed sunni men were humiliated in iraq by disbanding the baath party and iraqi army in may 2003 an insurgency began costing thousands of u s lives and throwing iraq into chaos yet maliki and his advisors risk provoking iraqs sunni community into another round of violence
7932882 it doesnt take 100 000 of these guys to revert to insurgents to cause big trouble remember at the height of the insurgency the u s estimated that there were 8 000 20 000 fighters

7932970 faced with recent disappointing results including steeper than expected volume declines and higher than expected increases in pet polyethylene terephthalate resin costs we initiated a comprehensive financial review of our business
7932971 it has now become clear that our previously announced target is out of reach
7932972 management believes that certain charges are not pertinent to day to day operational decision making in the business
7932973 in north america volume is declining at a higher rate than previously expected mainly due to heavier than anticipated national brand promotional activity
7932974 at the same time packaging costs are increasing more than previously anticipated driven by pet resin costs and the impact of the recent rapid strengthening of the u s dollar against its canadian counterpart
7932975 additionally higher than anticipated start up costs and shipment delays associated with the north american water project have lowered the expected profit contribution from this project for the balance of 2008
7932976 we are no longer on track to deliver our targets
7932977 we were able to say we had a successful convention so we could add to that experience and successfully bid for an olympics

7932997 realistically 90 percent of the people who are using netbeans are probably using it for java development
7932998 but because of its support for these other languages netbeans has become more like a workbench along the lines of eclipse and id say its one of the top two ruby ides on the market and has been for a while theyre making a stronger play against eclipse in that respect
7932999 not everyone is excited about downloading and assembling eclipse plug ins
7933000 as far as im concerned were still wide open for good ruby tooling
7933001 i dont see anyone out there yet who has taken that market and there are large numbers of ruby developers still doing everything on the command line or even in textmate theyre ready for some great tools to support them
7933002 it used to be that you were a java shop a net shop or maybe both
7933003 but the world isnt that simple anymore yeah there are still lots of java shops out there but there are also javascript shops and php shops microsoft reckons that there are 8 million php developers out there worldwide thats a lot of developers that are essentially up for grabs
7933004 the netbeans community is playing catch up right now with php support in this version
7933005 but there isnt a solid ruby solution in eclipse today so youve got to give them props for looking ahead of the curve on that one
7933006 if they were competing on the basis of how much money you make on an ide netbeans would certainly be dead
7933007 but vendors provide ides today to capture the hearts and minds of developers thats a lesson that microsoft learned years ago win the developers win the platform battle sun has come to that same conclusion and theyre going to continue to invest in great developer tools even though they dont make money on them

7933147 archie williams provided us the communication sets that failed us during the coup because they couldnt work and fahnbulleh provided the bullet prove jackets

7933149 taylor was known as the most advanced rebel leader in the sub region with multiple personalities and he was a genius in planning warfare but his mission to liberia was glaringly of a revenge so we were forced into exile in huge numbers and that condition drove the exploitation into sierra leone
7933150 agnes told me that a mafia guy who was in prison with taylor was given money by ramsey clarke to have him freed that is what i was told if she was wrong then im wrong
7933151 coming back to liberia could not be negotiated or compromised eventhough the us state department sent a lady to talk with us to cease the fighting and wait till 2003 for a democratic process we had to negotiate because we only wanted to come back home and repossess our country we took it and now gave it to you six hundred of us had to pay with our dear lives just to be where we are today

7933155 that was when we realized that it was better that we had sekou conneh as our leader than a sophisticated alhaji kromah
7933156 in order to have a compromise we took sekou to italy and had him sit there with the girls taking care of him and thinking that he was a world leader while we went on to have a conference for peace in accra
7933157 no peace no war is a recipe for war the sub region is sitting on a time bomb the surrounding is not safe
7933158 do you think we have sufficiently and honestly achieved peace anything that is a possibility is a potential reality this country is possible to relapse into war politics makes strange bedfellows but it is for pros not amateurs

7933346 you know its interesting the california decision as well as the massachusetts decision i dont think should ever have been implemented by the governors schwarzenegger and romney
7933347 they were both decisions that the governors simply could have said the court has said that we have to do it but let them enforce it because those were administrative decisions that had to put that in place and there was no mandate
7933348 well you know ive not probably been an advocate for him in that position and you know i am going to let him defend himself and i dont want to relive the primary but i think that that was a very unfortunate position that he took in saying that well i cant do anything about it oh yes you can

7933364 it could happen but the stakes would be so high that nintendo wouldnt let it happen
7933365 the reality of it is one of two things is going to happen either theres no merit to hillcrests suit and theyll lose or nintendo will settle

7933387 youre right but here are some other things to consider if they have been able to find this information they can find more they can find enough to send all of us to jail without even touching the events of that night i have no desire to end my days in prison so im inclined to take the offer and run
7933388 you are a bunch of serpentine cowards i cant believe you would give into such threats well you do what you have to do im going to fight them now if you will excuse me i have other business
7933389 theyre buying into to the plan ive gotten e mails from everyone except bushman which is what i expected i guess its time to start his phase three

7933421 the study results show that current australian guidelines for prescribing antibiotics for pneumonia are appropriate dr charles said
7933422 it shows that australian doctors should resist the push which is occurring in some parts of the world particularly the us to prescribe broad spectrum antibiotics to treat essentially all possible causes
7933423 the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens is one of the biggest threats to australian health care standards and is closely linked to the inappropriate use of antibiotics dr charles said
7933424 by continuing to use more traditional antibiotics to treat most cases of pneumonia australian doctors can limit or delay the emergence of more resistant strains of bacteria
7933425 by using the broad spectrum antibiotics less often we can also prolong the effective lifespan of these drugs
7933426 the cane toads cannot survive in much of southern australia because they would be too cold to move about and forage or spawn
7933427 we found that cane toads can barely hop once they get below about 15 degrees celsius

7933429 these are perfect conditions for growing wine but you are unlikely to meet a toad at a winery
7933430 our study is particularly helpful in predicting where cane toads could live under climate change because we have identified a cause and effect way that climate limits the toads
7933431 in one way it is obvious why dry conditions are bad for frogs they lose too much water
7933432 but having wet skin also provides frogs with a thermal challenge because the evaporating water takes heat away from their bodies and often makes them colder than the air

7933516 the debate on when and how to treat early parkinsons disease patients has been ongoing currently treatment would typically be initiated when symptoms have caused disability however providing the medical evidence for a treatment to retard or prevent the progression of pd is a major therapeutic priority and the proud study aims to shed more light into this question pramipexole was considered an optimal candidate for this study due to evidence suggesting possible benefits to pd patients beyond treating the well known core symptoms based on the unique technique used in this study proud may provide a major breakthrough in our understanding of early pd treatment which would offer hope to the ever increasing number of patients diagnosed with parkinsons disease

7933621 and every friday and saturday night we have to deal with the ethanol drug abuse fuelled problems
7933622 and while ethanol drug dealers do their best and are protected by us even when they dont they cant control their drugs consumers behaviour
7933623 take the hint call it a night without the fight
7933624 you do realize dont you mate that we can serve you ethanol drugs until you get drunk intoxicated quarrelsome disorderly then we have to throw you out for other people to deal with
7933625 one of the most serious ethanol drug related problems is the gathering of under age ethanol drug consumers at beaches and local reserves teenagers often approach strangers or get an older brother sister or friend to buy them the drug ethanol
7933626 those supplying the drug ethanol dont think about the chain effect of their actions with malicious damage noise complaints and police resources being tied up
7933627 and thats not to mention the damage kids do to themselves healthwise and the lack of control they display when under the influence of this drug unfortunately thanks to drug abuse things happen while under the influence of this class a drug on par with heroin that wouldnt normally occur
7933628 including being unable to find employment because of past actions abuses
7933629 parents need to know where there kids are their kids are not in a controlled environment so anything could happen including sexual assault and malicious damage
7933630 recently underage ethanol drug fuelled beach parties have become a serious problem for police with gatherings getting larger and more out of hand

7933634 whats going on in russia at this moment in time is not a very predictable story im not sure id want to get caught in that market id worry about a little bit about liquidity and id worry about what kind of actions the country is going to take
7933635 youre going to see continuing concerns about the financial sector and i believe they are going to say more about weakness in the economy as well inflation theyll mention but inflation is going to start to fade here but its what the fed says that i think is most important the housing data its sort of there and all of that lets listen to what the fed says i think what they are going to say is that we have still got some problems ahead of this and it means they are not going to take precipitous action

7933682 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level
7933683 the middle of next year is when we would expect to see some improvement
7933684 for the financial sector to recover and the economy to revitalize the housing market has to stabilize and home prices have to stop falling
7933685 come nel caso dei fagioli in scatola dove limballaggio incide per il 26 per cento sul prezzo industriale di vendita mentre per la passata in bottiglia da 700 grammi si arriva al 25 per cento per il succo di frutta in brick al 20 per cento e per il latte in bottiglia di plastica sopra il 10 per cento

7933694 i think the speaker spots are filling up which is great
7933695 there is absolutely no cause for this no reason for this continuing divide
7933696 wilder said adding later that he came to the morning panel to
7933697 we learned coming out of the caucuses that sound bites can in fact be detrimental
7933698 so irrespective of what may or may not happen on the convention floor the problem is you might have two or three people who will say something and that may become the headline
7933699 the longer youre divided the longer it takes for us to get the ball rolling
7933700 weve only got four good prime time hours at this convention and were using one of them for this
7933701 all i can say is obamas a bigger man than i am
7933702 when former presidents come to a convention they talk about what they want to talk about
7933703 i know this is going to happen because hillary clinton is a professional
7933704 they might have a statue with hillary clinton and barack obama embracing
7933705 im waiting for a rush of dead shadows to come up behind the runt and hurl him off the podium into the devouring cannibal pit
7933706 remember what is unbecoming to do is also unbecoming to speak of
7933707 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the
7933708 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7933709 there may be parts of the speech that arent going to get a lot of applause but ive got to say what i believe will get our country back on the right path
7933710 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
7933711 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is

7933724 we willen volwaardige constructieve betrekkingen met onze westerse partners waaronder de vs
7933725 het is geen gemakkelijke keuze maar het is de enige manier om de levens van de burgers te beschermen
7933726 met de huidige crisis werd het noodzakelijk om een beslissing te nemen
7933727 rekening houdend met de vrije uiting van de wil van de ossetische en abchazische volkeren en geleid door het vn handvest en andere elementaire internationale wetgeving heb ik een resolutie getekend met de erkenning van abchazi en zuid ossetti
7933728 in de nacht van 8 augustus had tbilisi een keuze saakasjvili koos voor genocide met deze keuze vernietigde saakasjvili alle hoop voor een vreedzame co xistentie van zuid osseti en abchazi onder een regering
7933729 de evidente russische intentie om twee zones te erkennen twee regios die in een conflict verwikkeld geweest zijn en die zich manifest binnen de georgische landsgrenzen bevinden die door verschillende resoluties erkend zijn door de verenigde naties lijkt me betreurenswaardig

7933870 drug release from polymeric materials often follows a burst first order kinetic profile which may not be clinically desired
7933871 traditionally the burst effect has been reduced by confining the api to a reservoir within the device but this adds complexity and cost to production
7933872 microencapsulating the drug enabled the use of simple molding processes to fabricate devices containing tens of thousands of microreservoirs and the devices exhibit constant drug release profiles equivalent to traditional reservoir devices this approach greatly simplifies production and adds tremendous flexibility to both single and multi drug devices

7933879 theres a book floating around now called none of the above that advocates exactly the position that you talked about when we do that we have advocated the antithetical position to what we know to be biblical truth because when we sit it out what were saying in essence is our vote doesnt count we dont care to influence and occupy the other persons vote takes precedence the other person de facto gets the vote
7933880 scripture says if you know whats right and you dont do it thats called sin
7933881 it seems janet parshall has set herself up as some sort of high priest who can read into scripture a commandment to vote for john mccain in 2008
7933882 i must have missed the commandment that says though shalt not sit out a presidential election or vote for any non republican presidential candidate janet parshall is certainly adding to scripture another unbiblical action when she makes that suggestion furthermore it is clear she has not read my book because she completely distorts the reasoning and purpose behind the none of the above movement which very much follows the biblical edict to influence and occupy
7933883 it says first go and tell him his fault in private
7933884 if he doesnt hear you then take one or two witnesses with you if that doesnt work you should tell it to the whole church parshall seems to have skipped steps one and two and taken political disagreement which she has twisted into an accusation of heresy and sin against me and gone straight to the television audience of a major religious broadcaster
7933885 it is nothing short of idol worship for christians to deify the republican party and its nominees for the presidency as somehow beyond reproach by discerning believers or to lift them up to the equivalent of holy writ
7933886 it is alarming to me that some within evangelicalism are using the bible to spiritually condemn other believers over political disagreements

7933890 during the time when we cut taxes to today our economy has grown by more than 1 9 trillion
7933891 this marks the first time this has happened since world war ii in a business cycle lasting anywhere near as long as the most recent cycle
7933892 the economy is not doing as well as wed like to do like it to do today but theres no question that the tax cuts provided economic vitality
7933893 raising taxes in a bad economy is about the worst thing you could do because it will kill even more jobs when what we need are policies that create jobs

7933913 the uneven and inequitable state of recovery of the gulf coast is a national embarrassment
7933914 although the force of the storms was an act of nature the failures of the recovery are an act of our government if we refuse to address this as a nation it will go down in history not only as a failure of leadership but also as a failure to hold our government accountable
7933915 it was the perfect storm of worker exploitation and wage suppression
7933916 we should have found ourselves in a situation where because of the dearth of employees workers could have found wages that equaled or exceeded those of workers in places like new york and new jersey but instead you had people brought in trafficked in through artificial government support
7933917 the transition to a new administration is a critical opportunity to rebuild the gulf coast better and stronger
7933918 not only can we help the gulf coast recover we can take the opportunity of the rebuilding effort to address the long standing root causes of poverty and vulnerability that existed in these two states long before the storms of 2005

7934136 inflation is the sum of all products services consumers use not solely a portion
7934137 core inflation is more indicative of long term price changes the problem occurs when you have periods of large price changes in food and energy such as today which pushes total inflation way up then the cry occurs that the fed is not measuring inflation accurately
7934138 but what people have to realize is that those food and energy prices can also drop just as quickly depressing overall inflation and that volatility underscores the reason the fed uses core inflation as a gauge core inflation is a more accurate measure of long term price pressures in the economy and we evaluate these long term pressures to determine if inflation is getting out of hand
7934139 history says that will not be the case that periods of record energy price increases have been followed by price busts
7934140 obviously the ultimately proof of this will be how energy prices perform following this extraordinary oil bull market

7934149 ireland does not have the problem of forced sales as yet but our analysis of the stock of homes for sale does suggest a significant overhang of properties in the market
7934150 irish house prices are tumbling and construction is contracting after a doubling of european central bank interest rates burst a decade long property boom early last year
7934151 the property slump has since deepened after the largest lenders raised rates and tightened loan to value ratios on mortgages in response to the seizure in credit markets
7934152 there are around 55 500 second hand homes advertised for sale on irelands daft ie property website according to oleary clearly to reduce this stock further price declines are needed with more extensive reductions in the areas with the most acute oversupply issues

7934162 hes a dogged hockey player and a smart hockey player
7934163 he can make plays at top speed he can play the wing or center ice there is nothing not to like about him
7934164 everybody comes to camp to compete for a job and hell have to do the same thing
7934165 hes been one of the best college hockey players in the country he was a first round draft pick those are the things that build the expectation and i think he has those expectations for himself but it does come down to how he does in september
7934166 hes got a good chance to be on our club next season
7934167 he has a great chance to be a top six forward in the nhl
7934168 there are obviously high expectations for him and hes really committed to getting great results
7934169 hes already a tall guy almost 6 4 and having seen the commitment he has made to getting bigger and stronger is great to see for a guy who has all the skill and talent
7934170 hes a creative forward centerman mostly hes got real good skating legs our scouts are really high on him
7934171 hes one of those guys that wasnt real big when we drafted him or even going into first pro year but he is making great strides the second year of pro will be a great challenge for him those guys that keep getting better and bigger and stronger have a chance
7934172 he didnt have a great season last year in london but he had the good tournament
7934173 i think hell have a great couple years in london and really develop and be ready to turn some heads in a couple years
7934174 he had a disappointing year and he would be the first one to admit it now
7934175 he needs to have a great summer and go back to get back to the level he was at hes a skilled player a scorer and not very big only 5 9 160 pounds so he has to be strong and explosive maybe he expected things to happen on their own after having a great year those small guys need to keep beating the odds all the time
7934176 we see a power play we see a lot of good things it was a real good pick for us it fit what our need was
7934177 we dont have to worry about him committing to strength and conditioning program
7934178 hes a bull strong as an ox he just needs some more hockey under his belt going back to notre dame next year will be good for him hes a great prospect
7934179 hes a small guy and he needs to know he has to be strong
7934180 he might be quick and explosive enough for college or world junior stage but to do that in the nhl is different so he needs to get bigger and stronger
7934181 he came to our development camp so hes committed to getting stronger
7934182 he knows what he needs to do i think were really pleased with what we saw in his first year i think hes a great prospect
7934183 he has a great attitude and hes a great kid
7934184 he plays solid defense hes not flashy but a competitor and a real good team player hes a classical defensive defenseman who takes care of his own end and battles hard
7934185 he was able to get a big role on his team that went almost all the way he also played some games on the mens national team at the age of 20 and thats a heck of a year for a young defenseman from sweden we have big expectations for him coming into camp but its a different game and he wont be able to live on his skill and hockey sense anymore

7934210 the biggest problem has always been the lack of budget we all have plans but it you dont have the budget nothing comes out of these
7934211 the solution is for us to have the proper budget
7934212 but whats happening is that we get the five percent of only whats left after the franchise tax is removed and the 50 percent of the gross goes to the national treasury
7934213 if we get all these then sports officials will find no other reason to give if we fail
7934214 if this amendment is passed then we double the psc budget to at least a billion pesos a year then we can double everything from the international exposure and training to equipment and infrastructure
7934215 and if we dont pass this law then it will be a never ending debate with pagcor we will try to formulate a law so even the psc administrations after the arroyo government will get the same budget unless the law is amended
7934216 we will make the law very clear were going to start our road to redemption we cannot stop whether pagcor agrees that they are right or wrong is not the issue anymore a debate will not solve the problem

7934218 the impact of higher gas prices on drivers accident severity and insurance costs is anything but simple
7934219 our findings indicate that higher average claim costs associated with lighter vehicles have the potential to offset to some extent whatever beneficial effects might occur from less driving its far too early to know how all these effects together will influence insurance claim costs

7934227 taxpayers usually cant write off the full market value of a vehicle they donate to charity but many taxpayers dont realize that the federal rules changed in 2005
7934228 taxpayers have to meet strict irs requirements in order to claim more than a 500 deduction
7934229 they dont have a high resale value and the charities dont get much money for them
7934230 its a good idea to check with the charity to find out its plans for the vehicle before you donate it so youll know whether a fair market value deduction is possible
7934231 dont forget to get the necessary paperwork to substantiate the deduction
7934232 get extra mileage out of the deduction by making a bigger down payment on a new car or by putting the money in your automobile repair fund
7934233 youll have reduced the overall cost of financing the new car or saved some money for future costs

7934248 nuestra labor es tratar de restablecer el servicio lo antes posible pero nos encontramos que hoy d a ellos est n tratando de contrarrestar las medidas que tenemos en favor de los contribuyentes lo cual nos parece muy lamentable y esperamos que depongan esa actitud
7934249 est n tambi n tratando de hacer colapsar la l nea 800 haciendo llamados s lo para saturar las l neas lo cual est provocando demoras a los contribuyentes que de verdad quieren operar en es l nea que hemos dispuesto
7934250 se trata de acciones que no se justifican y no tienen ning n sentido
7934251 el di logo est disponible para resolver y apurar el proyecto que interesa al servicio pero necesitamos naturalmente que se vuelva a atender a los contribuyentes como corresponde
7934252 lo que importa es volver r pido a atender a los contribuyentes
7934253 even with the 64 bit power mac g5 hardware there were still software limitations in 2003s mac os x panther the 32 bit os allowed the system to support more than 4gb of memory but still corralled each application into its own 32 bit 4gb space with 2005s mac os x tiger apple enabled desktop apps to spin off processes and servers that could handle enormous memory addressing of their own up to a theoretical 16 eb of 64 bit virtual memory and a conceptual 42 bits or 4tb of physical ram although shipping macs still could only support 8gb of ram
7934254 to enable this tiger supplied a 64 bit version of libsystem the system library handling most of its unix apis this followed the lp64 model to allow broad compatibility with 64 bit versions of linux and commercial unix it also delivered a 64 bit powerpc abi application binary interface for accommodating native 64 bit apps on the g5 tiger still used a 32 bit kernel although it was not limited to 32 bit memory addressing so it could actually make use of the 8gb of ram installed in g5s and it was also still missing a 64 bit version of the cocoa or carbon apis which meant apps with a user interface had to be 32 bit
7934255 however a 32 bit graphical app on tiger could spin off a faceless 64 bit background process to perform number crunching on a vast data set requiring a 64 bit memory space which could then communicate the results back to the 32 bit foreground app running in parallel apple also delivered a mechanism for deploying applications using a bundle of both 64 bit and 32 bit code allowing the system to automatically run the appropriate version for the mac hardware in use tiger itself also supplied both 32 and 64 bit underpinnings allowing one os to run on any mac
7934256 this has made it easier for apple to rapidly migrate mac users toward 64 bit hardware
7934257 when apple began migrating to intel in 2006 it actually had to take a step backward as it only initially supported 32 bit intel systems with the core solo and core duo cpus apple had to cope with the same 32 bit pc limitations microsoft had been dealing with in the intel transition mac developers lost the features supplied by powerpc including its liberal supply of registers however intels new 32 bit core duo was fast enough in other areas to skirt around the problem particularly in laptops where the aging g4 was holding macs back
7934258 by the end of the year apple had widened support to include the 64 bit x64 pc architecture in the new mac pro and xserve and subsequent desktop macs using the core 2 duo also delivered 64 bit hardware support with updates to tiger apple delivered the same level of 64 bit support for x64 intel processors as it had for the powerpc g5
7934259 within the course of one year apple had not only adroitly moved its entire mac product line to intel but also paved the way forward to rapidly push its users to 64 bits narrowly escaping the disaster of being left the last member of the desktop powerpc party in its spare time the company also threw the iphone together while also working to develop its next jump in 64 bit operating system software
7934260 in contrast a separate 64 bit version of windows is required to run 64 bit windows apps on 64 bit x86 pcs and any 32 bit apps have to run in a special compatibility environment below
7934261 software compatibility a lack of drivers and other problems have also complicated the move to 64 bit windows leaving mainstream windows users stuck at 32 bits windows 7 was initially supposed to move users to 64 bits in perhaps 2010 but reports indicate that it too will be delivered in separate 32 and 64 bit versions

7934273 we knew there were issues with stefan going back to last spring weve talked through it with him and we havent had any success
7934274 considered to be one of the top prospects in all of hockey and a well known player in canada because of his high energy agitating play and his off ice humor
7934275 look hes a kid with an enormous amount of talent and skill well a lot of other people have the skill to be a great doctor and yet they decide they dont want to be a doctor anymore hes a 19 year old who maybe has to grow up a little bit yet its not a health issue not as far as i know he wont be attending training camp hes taking time to think things over in my opinion stefan just wants to take a break hes tired from all the things hes gone through the last two seasons all the tournaments the games the shoulder injury all that stuff he feels like he needs some time and space
7934276 when does training camp start sept 19 or 20 until sept 20 he hasnt quit anything
7934277 absolutely yes i think were dealing with a case of burnout here you cant be filled with that much passion for the sport of hockey and decide right like that that youre done with it i think hes going to play again in fact i think when the frost hits the ground hes going to get the itch
7934278 i cant say hes in the process of reconsidering no hes not in the process of anything right now to be honest with you
7934279 i can tell them that we bought the team to have it here in columbus were dedicated to keeping it in columbus but i cant offer guarantees i am reasonably comfortable that well be here for a long time certainly every fiber of what we try to do is to fulfill that original thought my father worked on various sports commissions for probably 35 years to get a pro team for this town it was one of his dreams now sometimes in life you have to do what you have to do but i would consider it a personal defeat if we ended up in that situation

7934292 over the last year since the last budget was enacted weve been hearing from the community and from the city council as to what the key priorities are for them and what theyd like to see improved
7934293 we have gone from months to weeks and we can narrow that so that its even faster
7934294 this year were providing them with their full budget and theyve got to stay in line with their budget now

7934336 were taking this one game at a time after everything weve been through were still there and we have a lot of guys who have experience down the stretch
7934337 that totally deflated everyone that was the straw that broke the camels back
7934338 but the idea is to keep moments like that to a minimum
7934339 youre paid to do a job and you keep moving forward you just find a way to win that days game

7934342 we do realize that there will be more failures but its something that we can manage
7934343 we have a pretty significant fund and we have the ability to replenish it
7934344 for a lot of banks the die has already been cast
7934345 the banking industry goes into this mess much stronger than it was
7934346 as the fdic incurs losses those losses will be passed back to the banking industry
7934347 we had one of the largest and certainly what we think will be one of the most expensive failures at the beginning of the cycle
7934348 although its going to be challenging its not going to be all that bad
7934349 if anyone has a deposit of less than 100 000 they can sleep as soundly as always
7934350 i was shocked that the fdic did not have indymac on its watch list until a month before
7934351 you may have an inexperienced team remember for the last 13 or 14 years the banking industry has been pretty benign
7934352 they knew their funds were insured they still lined up and took their money out
7934353 weve had three failures since indymac and they all went smoothly
7934354 were making out hard core while waiting in line for margaritas
7934355 they were holding hands and were all over each other
7934356 walking around linuxworld this year it was interesting to see the number of apple notebooks in the halls and various sessions it wasnt necessarily that there were more apple notebooks than linux machines but it was a good number and begs the question why do open source people seem to cut apple some slack when it comes to their very closed proprietary platform
7934357 staying at a five star hotel with the only catch being that you cant ever leave
7934358 were finally at that taken a little time but were finally at the stage where you take a guy out and put the next guy in and you dont feel like oh god whats going to happen now
7934359 matt romine has come on pretty nicely as a pass blocking tackle which is what he came here as hes been banged up since he got here and then he was down to 270 now hes back up to the 290s again and hes playing pretty well
7934360 weve been very happy with trevor robinson were not going to be afraid to put him in a game the bemenderfer cave battle is going on right now if you had to flip a coin bemer would be the first guy because of his experience alone but thats a battle that will be ongoing
7934361 taylor dever at right tackle is a prospect that weve been high on all along the question would then be if something happened to sam would i take paul and put him at right tackle at this point right now i dont know yet
7934362 its to the point now with bemenderfer that i dont look at him as a walk on
7934363 forget the fact that he was a scholarship player at northwestern hes just been a solid player for us if we had to put him in a game i would not be concerned that the game would fall apart
7934364 i know one thing all three of them are going to play and they all know it one of the reasons it has not been divisive is because they all know theyll play because we interchange them so much but still let them get into a flow in practice they can see how this can work
7934365 i think we have at least four that can play realizing that there are different levels of experience
7934366 but right now the four guys we have are clearly the four guys we have
7934367 i told them there was a depth chart coming out monday based off of their performance to this point
7934368 you have to come out with a depth chart sooner or later monday was the first day for san diego state
7934369 the coordinators went over all the personnel packages to let people know what theyre doing and the position coaches went over with the guys what their roles are too they are told first generically by me then more specific by the coordinators then more specific by the position coaches
7934370 i did ask no one from the athletic department can go
7934371 well use sunday and well knock out that tape on that game cal polys offense is a wishbonish offense but on offense defense and special teams it will give us an opportunity to get their personnel up to date
7934372 these are not individuals who are going to be released because of this treatment they are offenders who have served their time
7934373 this isnt part of the punishment but aims to reduce the likelihood that they will need to be punished again the question is do you want them out there with treatment or without it
7934374 whilst psychological intervention will remain the preferred method of treatment for most sex offenders in certain cases this could usefully be supplemented by medical treatment
7934375 evidence suggests that certain types of medication can be useful in reducing the risk from certain sex offenders
7934376 in june last year the home office published the review of the protection of children from sex offenders which sets out plans to strengthen the disclosure registration accommodation management and treatment of child sex offenders the probation circular on 30 october 2007 gives effect to one of the recommendations in that review
7934377 personal adjustment problems showing up in all kinds of places it was fairly clear that we were going to be seeing more of those things
7934378 were busier than ever and we havent had any recent publicity or visibility
7934379 and we havent seen the full bore of the housing crisis
7934380 you can really see how full your schedule is getting
7934381 financial stress job layoffs housing problems transportation all of which can complicate and heighten an already existing diagnosis of depression or anxiety
7934382 the standard percentage paid by the insurance company used to be 80 20
7934383 whose family is under such financial stress that she cant come anymore which is horrible ill reduce my fee but its the gas to get here theyre going down to one car and they cant spare the car
7934384 families where the main breadwinner is in the mortgage and housing industry are just being killed by this therapy is a luxury for every family
7934385 its harder to pick up the phone especially for those who have never been seen in the mental health system theres still a stigma add economic barriers and that takes it to another level entirely
7934386 definitely seeing more prospects coming in specifically looking for additional help
7934387 if im laid off how do i manage my money for a few months
7934388 someone who could come alongside them and give them guidance and emotional confidence

7934391 dream come true i was an actor for a while but im back to being funny im a comic but its been a long time since i could tell jokes before a tv audience to walk into a scene tell five jokes and walk out to applause thats great for a comic from new jersey
7934392 there wouldnt have been time for it and gary unmarried too
7934393 i was becoming further and further entrenched in the show and really wanted to do films and i didnt want to walk into movie auditions as that reality show guy i did the groomsmen with ed burns and once i made the decision to walk away from last comic i landed this years street kings with keanu reeves a pretty fair trade
7934394 told me that those with the biggest chance for anxiety problems are interns and actors because we are taken out of very structured environments and thrown into unstructured environments for me saturday night live didnt have a lot of structure and that led to my attacks with the doctors help i was also made to see i should have no fear of flying that it is the most structured environment in the world you are given a ticket given a seat told when to leave when you will arrive and so on now flying doesnt bother me at all
7934395 we need people to look at any suspicious activity write down license plate numbers and work with the police
7934396 theres no weird science no magic wand to solve robberies
7934397 weve arrested 52 robbery suspects in the last 60 days almost solely based on the publics help
7934398 we have a walking officer in our neighborhood and he keeps us in the loop
7934399 hes pretty much here five days a week from 1 to 9 p m
7934400 we advocated very hard to bring him back and its made all the difference in the world
7934401 i like to call it putting cops on the dots
7934402 we look at where these crimes are happening what days of the week and what time of day and thats where we put our police
7934403 if we say hey i got you on tape for example suspects will sometimes confess
7934404 but if the suspect has seen a small clip of footage on tv theyll look and say oh they didnt get me its happened three or four times recently reporters pressuring store owners to release their video and in turn hurt some of our investigative techniques
7934405 when we make arrests the media doesnt care so the people dont know that makes these guys more bold more brazen
7934406 but the people of oakland can make all the difference here we need their help

7934408 with a 100 percent channel business model it is essential that our channel partners share our passion for customer service and can tell the shoretel uc story to the wider business community
7934409 cohort is an integral part of the shoretel family and has been instrumental in growing our presence and reseller network in the uk experience has shown that more training leads to increased sales and improved customer service so this is great news for our reseller partners
7934410 we are extremely pleased at this latest accreditation for our training division and have worked closely with shoretel to ensure our trainers provide the same high level of tuition and coaching that shoretel has given in the past
7934411 the provision of quality vendor endorsed training is a major part of our continued support services for our channels and the value add model in general the uc market is growing at an exciting rate and with the backing of shoretel we are in an ideal position to help all our partners benefit through education and our other support offerings

7934413 this latest research confirms we have a serious problem of self harm in the uk particularly among women
7934414 although we have made excellent progress in improving support services we still have a long way to go conferences such as this provide an opportunity to share our understanding of suicidal behaviour and to develop better care
7934415 i think it is quite startling that within a six month window you have got 6 of our young people our 15 and 16 year olds who self harm
7934416 its become more essential but it hasnt become easier i know what i have to do but doing it is still a challenge
7934417 i know that if i want to be good i have to find a way to focus every day in practice do the little things and i have to take care of my body if i do those things then ill be good i dont have to reinvent the wheel
7934418 i play this game because im driven to be the best at what i do and this is what im good at
7934419 i neither like it or dislike it its just what it is i like the fact that i have an opportunity to be the best at what i do and thats what my motivation is thats what drives me im just starting to realize that thats why im out here still playing thats why im doing this thing thats why i push myself i dont feel comfortable not striving to be the best not that im always going to be the best it at least has to be a dream something i can get a glimpse of
7934420 any kind of success whether its personal or team if i dont have the kind of success i want i can take pride in me being on this team had something to do with us winning games when i came back in 2005 the fact that we won six games in a row and exceeded expectations to me that felt good thats what i want again
7934421 for the most part im confident that i can play in this league i can only control what i can do i go out on the field and focus my energy on working hard i dont focus on who is the starter i have to compete i have to do this i have to do that if i just go and do my job and ronnie brown does his job its only going to make the team better ive seen players compete against each other and it gets kind of dirty for me i know ronnie can play and i love watching him play i know i can play and im having fun so theres no need to get into the competition
7934422 its good because hes the boss i feel like i have some security but at the same time i feel like hes always looking in one way thats a lot of pressure but it keeps me sharp i know if i do something small the fans wont see my coaching might see but i know ill hear it from coach sparano and i know ill hear it from bill it keeps me on edge he says something about everything even the little things especially the little things its support he believes in me so it makes it hard for me not to believe in myself

7934533 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7934534 graffiti can be seen on the walls in shiite districts of baghdad saying iraq for sale see maliki
7934535 so iraqi officials will resort to using the dates mentioned in the agreement to sell it to the public even though they might be intended to be used in a guidance way
7934536 if you ask the prime minister what happens if the situation on the ground changes before 2011 then he would obviously say that the dates might need to be changed

7934547 suggests that canadian gdp growth in the second quarter was likely somewhat weaker than expected

7934549 theyre committed to an election well before then if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behooves the government to provide some responsibility
7934550 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty and if its not this government or not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
7934551 the opening is to talk at any opportunity not to wait three weeks to have a meeting obviously that indicates a fundamental difference between the government and the opposition parties

7934562 i dont think music or film has been in a more exciting place in 20 years
7934563 i was just blown away by their beauty and how raw they were
7934564 we were just getting a little bit bored of watching the music promos

7934566 a significant shift in the way people are watching music film
7934567 its just one person with a guitar and a couple people banging on parking signs or whatever to try to make a song

7934588 sophos will own a suite of technologies that addresses broad end user data protection needs
7934589 sophos will have to work hard to ensure that this premium priced deal pays off in the long term the mobile data protection market is growing fast compared with traditional end point security and with higher price points but mobile data protections higher price points will likely decrease substantially as encryption functions are bundled into endpoint suite licenses
7934590 moreover av providers including symantec and trend micro will likely accelerate their encryption end point strategies partly due to pressure from this acquisition
7934591 the sophos acquisition will likely eventually terminate ultimacos relationship with trend micro under which the two companies have used each others data loss prevention and encryption technologies
7934592 despite the ongoing convergence in these markets enterprise it buyers should not expect a rapid integration of newly acquired products into mature product releases

7934644 we worked with tw telecom engineers to create a 14 site ip vpn network utilizing their collocation facility in seattle
7934645 the design dramatically simplified our network enabled us to cut our network administration time by one third and allows us to manage the network remotely at any time before network administration was done after hours since our network didnt allow both business transactions and network administration activities to happen simultaneously
7934646 our old low capacity circuits negatively impacted the performance of our network applications and email communications
7934647 with limited network capability we needed to create technology workarounds that added complexity to the administration of our network tw telecoms solution eliminated those issues with a simplified network that increased our primary connection capacity by 12 times for about the same cost as we were paying our previous provider
7934648 additionally the collocation service from tw telecom greatly improved our systems availability and significantly reduced our business risk
7934649 having a fully secured location with continuous power and advanced fire protection all of which was not economically feasible for us to build out ourselves we find ourselves with the ideal data center application additionally with a sonet protected network we now have a truly reliable business continuity disaster recovery solution for our 16 locations an unexpected benefit is that we are now re evaluating our business interruption insurance because of these capabilities
7934650 being able to migrate our network to an ip vpn was a driver in our selection
7934651 no other provider could do that and provide economical service to hawaii during the selection process i contacted various tw telecom customers including one i know personally and they all had very positive things to say about the services as well as the companys account management capabilities
7934652 class of service enables us to deploy mission critical applications that arent affected by email or employees using the internet

7934713 the guam delegation is seated on the floor of the pepsi center unlike in past conventions when guam was located in the bleachers from my understanding

7934723 its not our job to worry about where the money is coming from or who going to fund the busing that is an issue busing overtime for teachers and support staff but we as stakeholders shouldnt worry about thats why we have the legislature and downtown to go and fight for them to give us the money
7934724 i dont know why theyre making an issue out of this
7934725 theyre saying were illegal here how can we be illegal when everybody here went through a legal procedure
7934726 where can we go if we all get evicted out of here
7934727 we dont want to all wind up in a tent city at nimitz beach
7934728 i have instructed my staff in the interest of safety of the public and in the interest of limiting or avoiding any liability to the government of guam to compose eviction notices for my signature
7934729 very confident that there are no contracts out there that have not expired

7934731 what are we going to do if they kick us out

7934750 desta forma que a atual gest o acabou com as salas de lata deixadas por marta que prejudicavam 75 mil estudantes vale ressaltar que os ceus entregues nesta gest o funcionam efetivamente diferentemente do per odo marta que deixou para a administra o serra kassab funcion rios em greve por causa de atraso de seis meses nos sal rios

7934777 apparently weve moved past racism in america but we havent moved past sexism
7934778 i am hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7934779 the fact is that our teams are working closely to ensure a successful convention
7934780 anyone saying anything else doesnt know what theyre talking about period
7934781 by rule as a delegate i must support the nominee im going to follow the rule
7934782 i wont get to cast my vote my state wont reflect what the vote was that would be very unfortunate if you are going to disenfranchise half of the people at the convention its going to be very hard to find unity
7934783 the largest portion of it is media spin and groups that have no association with her campaign
7934784 theyre groups that are more into making a statement about themselves rather than about the democratic party or senator clinton
7934785 were going to see a rousing speech from her she can give such a great speech its going to bring the convention together and its going to be a united convention

7934799 i felt i pitched well the majority of the time
7934800 i had four to five really bad outings i was able to see that as long as i pitched well i could get guys out at the same time i was able to see things that got me into trouble and what i needed to work on to be able to do consistently better its mainly throwing my off speed pitches for strikes and locating my fastball and not overthrowing it
7934801 we never had a housing bubble here because of the lingering effects of the tech recession and ironically it was the depth of our local recession that then gave us protection from the ruinous fallout from a bursting bubble in residential real estate that has dramatically altered the economic landscapes of florida california arizona new england and the midwest

7934806 el compromiso del proyecto de ley de paritarias para el sector docente
7934807 nos parece interesante que se planteen dos negociaciones salariales al a o y no una
7934808 la oferta es superadora de la situaci n porque se ven a hablando de sumas fijas superadora de la historia porque por primera vez se distribuye la masa salarial respetando la cantidad de trabajadores y reconociendo que amsafe tiene la mayor a y superadora porque hay un compromiso de tomar el ndice del ipec instituto provincial de estad sticas y censos que goza de veracidad cient fica para evaluar futuros aumentos
7934809 el otro tema muy positivo adujo es que se mejor el b sico y eso repercute en la jerarqu a en la antig edad y en los jubilados

7934829 shahbaz hussain alias shanu has played a very important role in the blasts that claimed 68 lives in jaipur and he has got strong linkage with abu bashar arrested from azamgarh uttar pradesh and sajid mansoori from gujarat in connection with ahmedabad blasts
7934830 the modus operandi of the entire blasts in jaipur is a part of investigation and interrogation but this is for sure that shahbaz is the main link in planning conspiring and execution of the bomb blasts

7934855 i might have been born at night but it wasnt last night
7934856 once the team management and the swimmers and nzoc get back in the country well meet with them and review everything and decide at that stage whether any further action is necessary
7934857 im just really keen to make sure something silly like this doesnt overshadow the incredible performances that they had
7934858 whether its a cycling team or a swimming team its made pretty clear to them what the code of conduct is and clearly something like this probably breaches that
7934859 for something like this to put a dampener on it is a real shame
7934860 inappropriate and foolhardy behaviour at the end of a long campaign
7934861 its something that both swimming new zealand and the nzoc will have to address its not something that can be ignored
7934862 any time protocol isnt followed it has to be addressed

7934873 tonight when hillary clinton speaks she will be an articulate voice for the working men and women the middle class families that have been squeezed and she will make the case as she uniquely can for why barack obama is the right choice for the presidency
7934874 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me

7935021 protecting small businesses is critical to growing south carolinas economy
7935022 small businesses drive job growth and income growth in our state and we need more leaders who will stand up for small business in the state house
7935023 last year these legislators fought for south carolina small businesses pushing for reforms that will unlock enormous job creating potential and reduce the exorbitant premium increases businesses have been forced to pay in recent years
7935024 we obviously still have a long way to go in south carolina on issues like legal reform and further workers comp reform but with these leaders standing up for them the needs of small businesses will be heard in this vital economic debate

7935030 by silence the artist frees himself from servile bondage to the world once he has surpassed his peers his pride has only one place left to go the craving for silence is to be superior to everyone else it suggests that the artist has had the wit to ask more questions than other people and that he possesses stronger nerves and higher standards of excellence
7935031 theres a book floating around now called none of the above that advocates exactly the position that you talked about when we do that we have advocated the antithetical position to what we know to be biblical truth because when we sit it out what were saying in essence is our vote doesnt count we dont care to influence and occupy the other persons vote takes precedence the other person de facto gets the vote
7935032 scripture says if you know whats right and you dont do it thats called sin
7935033 it seems janet parshall has set herself up as some sort of high priest who can read into scripture a commandment to vote for john mccain in 2008
7935034 i must have missed the commandment that says though shalt not sit out a presidential election or vote for any non republican presidential candidate janet parshall is certainly adding to scripture another unbiblical action when she makes that suggestion furthermore it is clear she has not read my book because she completely distorts the reasoning and purpose behind the none of the above movement which very much follows the biblical edict to influence and occupy
7935035 it says first go and tell him his fault in private
7935036 if he doesnt hear you then take one or two witnesses with you if that doesnt work you should tell it to the whole church parshall seems to have skipped steps one and two and taken political disagreement which she has twisted into an accusation of heresy and sin against me and gone straight to the television audience of a major religious broadcaster
7935037 it is nothing short of idol worship for christians to deify the republican party and its nominees for the presidency as somehow beyond reproach by discerning believers or to lift them up to the equivalent of holy writ
7935038 it is alarming to me that some within evangelicalism are using the bible to spiritually condemn other believers over political disagreements
7935039 if theyre really going to look at a solution on how to solve this they need to find ways to make it convenient and cost effective for people to get that plastic bag and recycle it

7935076 compassion empathy and fairness can come naturally to children but these qualities need to be nurtured or they may be lost as children mature

7935094 some men may be reluctant to talk about their feelings
7935095 i just wanted to know what it feels like to be bjorn
7935096 theres something about the words im proud of you coming from a father that cannot be duplicated and clears away any wreckage in the relationship
7935097 he was impressed with my work and that meant a lot to me
7935098 he took the time to get to know what its like for me and to appreciate my work
7935099 a man must love his father and yet be free of his fathers expectations and criticisms in order to be a free man
7935100 they were covered with wild beasts skins and torn to death by dogs others were covered by inflammable matter and they were set on fire to serve as torches during the night some were tied to stakes in neros gardens while he drove around in his chariot naked gloating over the dying agonies of his victims
7935101 if the reason you are asking why is for clarification i will explain myself but if it is to be arguementative then my answer is because i said so thats why

7935104 the state exists simply to promote and to protect the ordinary happiness of human beings in this life a husband and wife chatting over a fire a man reading a book in his own room or digging in his own garden and unless they are helping to prolong and protect such moments all the laws armies and courts are a waste of time
7935105 whats right for you may not be right for me
7935106 it is the only correct map of the human heart that ever has been published all systems of morals and government not founded upon it must perish
7935107 the law given from sinai was a civil and municipal as well as a moral and religious code it contained many statutes of universal application laws essential for the existence of men in society
7935108 the god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the furnace of blazing fire and he will deliver us out of your hands o king but even if he does not let it be known to you o king that we are not going to serve your gods or worship the golden image you have set up
7935109 he gave orders to heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated
7935110 look i see four men loosed and walking about in the midst of the fire without harm and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods
7935111 daniel servant of the living god has your god whom you constantly serve been able to deliver you from the lions
7935112 one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all
7935113 never before has god given american evangelicals such an awesome opportunity to shape public policy disengagement from politics is not an option instead girded by biblical principles evangelicals should march boldly into the public forum
7935114 the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in god for pulling down strongholds casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of god
7935115 therefore i exhort first of all that supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men for kings and all who are in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and reverence for this is good and acceptable in the sight of god our savior

7935122 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy
7935123 this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy a new era of technical politics has begun
7935124 se or rajoy ni usted ni ning n miembro de su ejecutiva tiene autoridad hoy para mendigar votos a cuenta de un accidente tan atroz como el de barajas ellos tendr n a sus muertos seguro y las familias est n siendo atendidas como pudimos ver el d a que fuimos a darles nuestro m s sincero p same qu cruel diferencia en el trato a las familias de los militares muertos
7935125 pensando en las familias de las v ctimas de un accidente tan atroz
7935126 el proceso de recuperaci n de los cad veres es tan complejo
7935127 la identificaci n de las v ctimas debe de ser la prioridad del gobierno
7935128 que esta exigencia tenga que ver con los problemas de identificaci n que se vivieron en su d a con el accidente a reo del yak 42
7935129 queremos recordar a rajoy que en el momento del accidente del yak l era vicepresidente y que nunca pidi que se investigara la identificaci n de 32 cad veres en 24 horas a n siguen pensando que se pueden identificar v ctimas en 24 horas tampoco dijo nada cuando tras 613 d as de larga espera pudimos exhumar y conseguir que cada familia tuviera su muerto le recordamos que a n hoy once familias no han podido recuperar a su fallecido porque ste hab a sido incinerado por otra familia

7935132 a new age in dementia care turning evidence into practice
7935133 we expect the summit to challenge working professionals to take a new look at what they are doing in dementia care while sharing with them ways to turn research into practice
7935134 the fulfillment of jeffersons new vision of practice the living laboratory will take what carahs researchers have learned and continue to learn and train others both healthcare professionals and lay caregivers as to best practices in the field so this newfound knowledge can do the most good
7935135 our aim is to translate research into real world service
7935136 the ultimate goal is to provide older adults with functional difficulties and those with dementia and their caregivers access to the best care possible

7935142 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
7935143 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
7935144 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
7935145 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
7935146 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
7935147 new book out and making the move to open access
7935148 i think he is trouncing him i want more of a spread of course i want it all
7935149 we will get much more in the house and the senate and we have to have a democratic president nothing less is at stake than our economy our constitution our budget our reputation in the world ending this war the list goes on
7935150 we cannot be diverted to the silliness that the mccain campaign of course they want to talk about paris hilton
7935151 would they want to talk about why they have the worst record of job creation in america
7935152 have attracted millions of more voters first voters voters and many more voters who havent voted in a long time
7935153 many of them are not even reachable by these pollsters
7935154 these are polls of likely voters likely voters are people who have voted in the last two elections and they are likely to vote again they are not the universe of people who will vote on nov 4
7935155 deliver clarity of message about what the choice is and deliver force on the ground
7935156 i wasnt taking any hits at john mccain i was just speaking truth about his record
7935157 when they talk about john mccain having experience he has the experience of being wrong on the on tax cuts you name it
7935158 but let me tell you this this election is about the economy it always is and its a question of who has the leverage and for eight years the wealthiest 1 percent has had the leverage
7935159 think of me as a lioness you threaten my cubs you have a problem
7935160 the president was very isolated he doesnt want to work in a bipartisan way
7935161 will be one of the first bills we would put on the presidents desk
7935162 thats not a full 100 days agenda its more like 100 hours
7935163 just when you had seen it all the beautiful beautiful presentation by
7935164 this is an effort on our part to tie the three events together the world trade center the pentagon and shanksville
7935165 i couldnt have dreamed this would turn out any better all the brotherhood coming down from new york and new jersey and showing up here today to pay their respect to this piece of steel
7935166 i was very happy that everyone was able to get together
7935167 i didnt always comport myself in the way that i wanted to
7935168 what it took for him to get here was something i never thought id see in my life
7935169 ive never been a team i shouldve been a one man band
7935170 he is a highly marketable young driver who knows how to win races and has a long career full of promise ahead of him
7935171 reed is today as good as hes ever going to be if somebody else wants to put him in a car fine with us
7935172 i cant wait to get in their cars i really believe in what they are doing with their program with all their wins and poles this year
7935173 ray evernham and the gilletts are going to give us the equipment we need to go out and be a contender each weekend and eventually race for a championship
7935174 she didnt see herself and john having much in common or having a future together
7935175 youd probably do it in a couple of catchments to see if the model will work
7935176 in most of canterbury the issue is mainly about allocation but not quality so you may not be able to use the whole of the model there might be places where nutrient concerns as well as quantity could be used
7935177 obviously with the number of takes you have got in canterbury you probably are a reasonable place to start and see if this model could work if the government could help provide metering set up the registry
7935178 indications are that for example a national registry might be 30m to put in place thats a one off cost
7935179 for an era when our supply of water was vastly greater than our needs
7935180 i understand its only a matter of protocol a matter of procedure were working on one country which has some difficulty in this protocol but we think that its within reach
7935181 we have a strong balance sheet and the business is in great shape to tackle the challenges of the current operating environment
7935182 we are acutely aware of the need to stimulate demand and will continue to sharpen domestic and short haul prices
7935183 contact doesnt see any significant upside in the 2009 financial year
7935184 so with a lack of growth the shares look fully priced around current levels
7935185 that would be a valuable contribution to the south island in the next month to six weeks as the coldest part of the winter rolls out
7935186 fairfax claims these cuts are about adapting to new technologies and platforms but the way to deal with these changes is to increase the size of newsrooms and compete on the quality of news
7935187 but we are also non compromising on the quality of our editorial content
7935188 im gonna be playing vside til im a shribbled up old lady
7935189 wie gut spiegeln deutschlands aktienb rsen den wert der notierten firmen wieder

7935195 het zag er allemaal heel natuurlijk uit alsof ze eerder samen uit waren geweest
7935196 deze burgemeester en regering hebben veel beloftes gedaan over veiligheid
7935197 ze kunnen slachtoffers dan niet verwijten dat er iets gebeurt
7935198 maar er zijn nooit plannen geweest voor een optreden in de show
7935199 its been a process that we had to go through and the process hit roadblocks late in the piece and at this stage it appear we have found another alternative that is equally as positive
7935200 we know that anz are committed to supporting and we just need to wait for a bit more detail in that
7935201 its just that behind the scenes will look a little different than it would have under saxo
7935202 as of close of business friday everyone was expecting the transaction to proceed
7935203 the feeling i get is that saxo are interested in supporting us to develop that space further
7935204 our overall outlook is that you can expect a performance from pgc which is in line with the year weve just reported on we will know more about that in february
7935205 if theyd mentioned the word growth in the year ahead then we would have seen some more share price upside but i think investors are reluctant to pay out too much on that stock
7935206 maracs result was particularly pleasing against a backdrop of the wider finance sector performance and global and local credit conditions
7935207 lots of people are looking for them ill save you the trouble they are not there
7935208 we are in this because unless someone does something there will be no sheep meat industry left in five years we wish there was another way and we did not have to stump up with 220m but we do not see any other choice
7935209 this is a partnership partners do not rip each other off the day we try to put one over these guys is the day it ends

7935272 as the visual impact of the works would be deemed too significant
7935273 if they are not i would say come and try to do better we have always said the scheme needed to share the effort much more fairly
7935274 along with the one off financial payment this goes a long way to compensating households for their higher prices reducing energy waste and carbon emissions
7935275 to build a platform for future growth in existing and new markets
7935276 you should expect to see air new zealand being aggressive with its transtasman travel
7935277 if there is the proposed capacity increase of 10 to 11 in the next six to nine months that transtasman market will very quickly become a bloodbath
7935278 i never want to pre empt positions that parties may take but he and his party have been very constructively engaged with us for a long period of time around the scheme so we are just carrying on those talks
7935279 it was the right thing to do it was a difficult decision because we do not believe that emissions trading in itself will do enough to reduce emissions

7935282 the circumstances of the last year have led to a shift in relative performance between the companys retail and generation segments reinforcing the value of contacts integrated business model

7935291 it has been seven weeks today since operations ceased and we are really looking forward to getting out on the river again
7935292 our society is trying to turn fathers into male mothers you aint
7935293 we are living in a pc world which is destroying us where you actually cant put the hard word on people when they have digressed and committed bad blunders
7935294 one of the advantages of being a farmer is that i was able to work with my children
7935295 you can take them on the back of your motorbike which youre not supposed to do any more
7935296 they can climb trees which theyre not supposed to do any more
7935297 in the evenings we went to the rugby parties with the kids who slept in the back of the car
7935298 we cant do that any more because we havent got rid of the perpetrators that actually destroy our society
7935299 my friends were my childrens role models and i was my friends childrens role model
7935300 the one thing i believe is important in life is respect they respected authority they respected the teachers i respected the teachers
7935301 we lack a great deal of respect for authority nowadays theres always someone protesting
7935302 respect and role models are very important in life you as a father with the aid of your partner i cant say wife these days pc you are the one who set the ground rules
7935303 and dont ever tell me that the kids dont want to know where the line is
7935304 all i had to say was hey boy i think youre annoying me
7935305 people have to make decisions and people do make mistakes but make sure that you take action that there are consequences and that you actually follow them through
7935306 yes i smacked my children but ive never hit them

7935308 but we are not allowed to do that any more in this pc world
7935309 competition is healthy and brings lower fares which stimulates consumer interest

7935313 i dont want this meeting to be hijacked into a discussion about the stadium
7935314 this is significantly less than what we would expect to earn in an average year and is largely as a result of volatility across all asset classes during the second half of the year
7935315 thats why they get such a huge welcome from people lost in the outdoors
7935316 were all volunteers out there in the mountains searching when we need to and these courses are vital for everyone involved
7935317 to make sure such outbreaks can be minimised and better managed in the future
7935318 i cant for the life of me think what we had to gain by closing the hospital for a week in the first instance we tried to manage it with the least amount of disruption to other people when it became clear the contagion between people coming in and staff and patients was getting too difficult to manage it was the right thing to do to close the hospital
7935319 if mr ryall wants an independent investigation then were happy to participate in that at this stage i think we did everything we should have
7935320 time will tell as we go through debriefs whether we got everything in the right order and right timing
7935321 one of the most difficult couple of weeks for this hospital that didnt have something to do with money
7935322 i say thank you to the people of dunedin who have been terribly inconvenienced whether as a visitor or more importantly have had an appointment cancelled when you cancel that many appointments i would have expected my phone to be screaming and it didnt ring once it was one of those things that could have gone absolutely pear shaped in relation to the public

7935394 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table

7935402 ive said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think the settlement activity is helpful to the process
7935403 that in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties
7935404 settlement activities have been reduced in the most dramatic way especially in parts which are on the other side of the fence
7935405 israeli government policy is not to expand settlements its not to build new settlements its not to confiscate land from palestinians
7935406 there were some small activities that are not going to influence neither the ability nor the future border of the palestinian state
7935407 i guess i did realize that when the plane was going to take off perhaps it was not going so fast
7935408 and i said to myself something is going on here
7935409 i grabbed the seat i noticed a bump my stomach was rising and falling and then i dont remember anything else
7935410 there were children who had seats on top of them what i did was pull them out and set them aside so they were not trapped
7935411 i know a lot is being made of this but i think any human being at any time when people ask for help will give it
7935412 it is a contradictory feeling because i know that bodies are arriving back there and i will arrive intact
7935413 i noticed that the plane did not have power when it started to rise
7935414 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level
7935415 the most overbuilt areas of the country including california nevada arizona and florida contrast greatly with most other states where prices are declining more moderately or even increasing
7935416 both have played huge parts in the last few years
7935417 they deserve it they have been consistent performers in the first team and they set an excellent example
7935418 drug manufacturers would want to make sure new compounds for antipsychotic use block the beta arrestin pathway
7935419 must take heed of the sentiments and the call of malaysians
7935420 the malaysians consider this a critical point in our history whether we get the mandate to chart a new course for malaysia or we should just be happy with the same corrupt establishment
7935421 woe to you teachers of the law and pharisees you hypocrites you are like whitewashed tombs which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead mens bones and everything unclean in the same way on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness woe to you teachers of the law and pharisees you hypocrites you build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous and you say if we had lived in the days of our forefathers we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets so you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets fill up then the measure of the sin of your forefathers
7935422 the measure with which we measure will be measured out to us
7935423 be on your guard against the yeast of the pharisees which is hypocrisy
7935424 cest avec enthousiasme et s r nit que nous pr parons cette deuxi me dition du troph e prevens le succ s de lan pass a galvanis toutes les quipes aujourdhui notre ambition est de faire du troph e prevens un v nement sportif incontournable la fois vitrine et porteur du dynamisme est francilien
7935425 its concerning because the pattern of revisions from the census bureau has been systematically downward instead of random as youd expect
7935426 chances are well see some downward revision when they put out the august numbers
7935427 the uptick is still good news but well see if it holds
7935428 inventory of existing home sales has definitely been affected by foreclosure sales and the new home market has been afflicted by that negatively
7935429 but in recent quarters weve seen sales volume exceeding housing starts for sale so that will run inventory down if that continues
7935430 newly designed gapless microlenses over each pixel to reduce noise
7935431 pues de eso se trata ellos no quieren que haya imagen alguna del movimiento
7935432 esta nos obliga a recurrir a instancias fuera de la legalidad para poder presionar en un proceso de negociaci n colectiva la empresa puede contratar rompehuelgas demorar los procesos y finalizada la huelga puede despedir por razones de la empresa eso instala cualquier negociaci n en la ley del garrote todo est dado para el empleador
7935433 la negociaci n colectiva como fue estructurada por el c digo laboral est superada no da cuenta de la complejidad actual de las relaciones productivas y laborales los trabajadores no tienen posibilidad alguna de negociar en el marco regulatorio pese a que somos un actor principal para el desarrollo econ mico
7935434 hay una asimetr a de poder importante entre los trabajadores y empleadores expresadas en los impedimentos del c digo del trabajo a algunas acciones que empoderar an a los trabajadores adem s de la situaci n de varias razones sociales de una misma empresa cada vez hay m s sindicatos peque os con min sculos poderes de negociaci n
7935435 la precarizaci n aument las formas de trabajo por cuenta propia aumentando los contratos a plazo fijo o por servicios determinados hicieron difusa la relaci n de dependencia laboral todo lo que provoc la inestabilidad actual del empleo
7935436 una conducta permanente es aplicar pol ticas de terror de vulneraci n de los derechos de los trabajadores y amenazar su estabilidad en el empleo a n vemos que los empleadores dicen que cualquier demanda de los trabajadores pone en riesgo la empresa
7935437 ramos un grupo de trabajadores sin experiencia en estos procesos y quiz nos falt madurez quiz no estoy conforme pero nos toc y lo asumimos la experiencia si bien no aument la cantidad de socios en el sindicato signific que hoy tenemos una mejor relaci n con el empleador y logramos algunos beneficios
7935438 nosotros no hubi semos conseguido nada si los sindicatos de ripley y almacenes par s no nos hubiesen apoyado creo que la idea de la confederaci n es potente es algo que va a beneficiar a mayor organizaci n son mayores los logros
7935439 lo que nos result a nosotros fue la uni n es la nica f rmula que la gente sepa lo que est pasando maneje la informaci n la empresa nos vio tan firmes y s lidos que tuvo que ceder
7935440 cambiar la din mica de poder al interior de las tiendas
7935441 no hay claridad respecto a los factores que definen la remuneraci n final suben y bajan cambian sin gran orden y como a n no se prolonga la ley que regula esto pueden poner cualquier sueldo base no hay garant a para los trabajadores que recibir n su sueldo a fin de mes considerando que el salario tiene que dar estabilidad y el trabajador no puede correr con su sueldo los riesgos de la empresa el alza del sueldo base queda cargado a las comisiones
7935442 lo fundamental es juntar la mayor cantidad de gente para enfrentar la negociaci n que se actu de manera informada y transparente con los trabajadores en ripley juntamos a varios sindicatos para que la fuerza sea mayor ahora con otras organizaciones queremos concretar otra negociaci n m s grande el resultado del a o pasado fue satisfactorio porque negociamos juntos todos los sindicatos la idea es negociar todos los sindicatos con la empresa madre
7935443 cambi la mente en la directiva del l der porque ahora no persiguen la formaci n de sindicatos
7935444 tenemos sindicatos por local y una federaci n con 4 5 de casi mil socios y otro interempresa la ltima negociaci n fue de los sindicatos del norte quienes votaron la huelga para conseguir beneficios con la empresa les fue bien
7935445 divergencias en la comisi n de relaciones laborales e institucionalidad hay tantas visiones que es dif cil llegar a acuerdo se dej constancia de todas las visiones y sus fundamentos para los que decidan tambi n en materia de flexibilidad laboral no hubo acuerdo yo soy partidario de cuando sea pactada siempre cuando sean representativos de las respectivas partes el problema es que en chile la flexibilidad ha sido establecida de hecho unilateralmente la experiencia internacional demuestra que es m s aceptada y eficaz cuando es pactada entre las partes
7935446 el consejo de equidad no abord temas laborales aunque es importante decir que el equilibrio del mercado de trabajo chileno es inadecuado poco empleo y contratos precarios los contratos indefinidos han estado cayendo y aumentan los de plazo fijo si uno mira cifras del seguro de cesant a nota que m s de la mitad duran menos de un a o
7935447 inflexibilidad del mercado laboral chileno las empresas no se arriesgan a contratos de largo plazo por lo que la principal cosa a reformar son las indemnizaciones por a o de servicio combin ndolas con un mejor seguro de cesant a o una indemnizaci n a todo evento
7935448 pese a lo manoseado del concepto la flexibilidad puede mejorar las condiciones laborales siempre cuando se negocie con los propios trabajadores como es en el caso de flexibilizar los horarios de trabajo a trav s de una negociaci n pero en chile el concepto ha significado m s bien correr a n m s el borde de la precariedad laboral
7935449 todo esfuerzo que se haga por acentuar el acuerdo entre las partes va a fortalecer una paz laboral que no se funda en la inexistencia entre las partes
7935450 el hecho de que se le quiera transformar en el ingrediente de cosas como el seguro de desempleo le quita contorno a la naturaleza original lo primero que debiera hacerse es respetar la titularidad de la representaci n de los trabajadores que recae en las organizaciones sindicales esta afirmaci n se dispone en los convenios 87 y 98 de la oit
7935451 que el gobierno se est yendo abre espacio a que las medidas que son impopulares sean efectuadas esa es una de las ventajas de un gobierno que no se reelige hay que aprovechar la libertad que se tiene para hacerlo
7935452 ninguna lucha es homologable en cada sector cada proceso tiene realidades distintas lo principal es superar el individualismo hay que organizarse pese a que la situaci n demuestra que no se puede en el marco de la actual institucionalidad la tecnolog a disponible nos ofrece oportunidades para articularnos mejor c mo lo hacemos con sabidur a prudencia inteligencia y mucha conspiraci n
7935453 veo dif cil grandes cambios en la situaci n pese a que tiene que lograrse alg n avance para lograr el desarrollo cualquier actor social debe tener las herramientas para ejercer derechos y hacer ciudadan a en otros contextos o hay sindicatos grandes o donde hay bajos niveles de sindicalizaci n como ocurre en francia cuando se negocia es a partir de pisos m nimos para grandes grupos de trabajadores eso es sin nimo de una econom a desarrollada que es en donde todas las partes est n representadas
7935454 el derecho a huelga sea efectivo que no haya reemplazo de trabajadores y m s personas puedan negociar adem s de los subcontratistas que puedan negociar quienes trabajan a plazo fijo o a honorarios que cambie tambi n el c mo se negocia o sea que los sindicatos cuenten con la informaci n financiera de la empresa
7935455 la multiplicidad de rut de las empresas que atomizan la organizaci n sindical tambi n que no tengan posibilidad de poner remplazos y se respeten las decisiones de los sindicatos lo fundamental es la negociaci n supra empresa
7935456 lo fundamental es que la sindicalizaci n sea autom tica porque hay muchas empresas que persiguen a los dirigentes
7935457 los tr mites judiciales sean m s r pidos lo que exige una mejora radical en el c digo del trabajo
7935458 este a o las negociaciones colectivas en almacenes par s se est n moviendo estamos formando la confederaci n de sindicatos del comercio que integran a l der falabella par s y ripley hay que esperar que se concrete
7935459 se debe fortalecer el poder de los sindicatos para negociar hoy estos est n atomizados al agruparse por locales y por empresas por lo menos que puedan negociar los mismos trabajadores de una empresa
7935460 estrechar a el abismo que existe en la distribuci n del ingreso en el pa s hoy lo principal es dirigir la conversaci n a la supra empresa ya que stas son las principales beneficiadas y las que generan este tipo de relaci n contractual y buscan eludir a trav s de diversas razones sociales la efectiva negociaci n colectiva de parte de los trabajadores hay que ir buscando convergencias que permitan influir esto
7935461 wir haben unser budget noch in keiner weise zusammen um in der h chsten spielklasse vorne mitzuspielen braucht man ein budget mit mindestens 50 000 euro aber es wird immer schwieriger sponsoren f r damenfu ball zu bekommen

7935464 einen fu ballverein am leben zu erhalten geht in der heutigen zeit nur noch mit tatkr ftigen sponsoren denn von den zuschauereinnahmen allein kann keiner mehr existieren
7935465 wir spielten beide harmonika da braucht man nicht so viel
7935466 nat rlich haben wir uns in dieser zeit st ndig weiterentwickelt und f r ein duo bieten wir heute eine ganze menge zu einem preis bei dem gr ere gruppen nicht mitk nnen
7935467 wir sind beruflich sehr eingespannt ich habe auch familie sodass wir uns immer ein wochenende im monat von auftritten frei halten

7935473 meine arbeit innigst mit der landschaft des weinviertels verbunden ist
7935474 f r villgraten und die region hat dieses treffen sehr viel gebracht sowohl in touristischer als auch in wirtschaftlicher hinsicht
7935475 es wurde unter anderem ber touristische projekte diskutiert sowie konkrete vorhaben angesprochen an denen in n chster zeit weitergearbeitet wird
7935476 burnout gef hrdete und stressgeplagte personen sollen bei uns wieder bodenhaftung bekommen

7935479 die neuen reifen aus frankreich waren ein hit im finale bin ich ab runde vier nur mehr z gig gefahren wollte nichts mehr riskieren nur mehr die punkte ins trockene bringen

7935481 es ist eine tolle saison f r mich ein echtes lehrjahr jetzt mach ich alles um den dritten platz in der meisterschaft zu halten
7935482 for me it felt like i broke up with a boyfriend but with a girl instead
7935483 what people will see now is michelles poise the depth of her love and commitment to this country her embracing vision of a first lady who serves the needs of women family and children
7935484 obligation to fight for the world as it should be
7935485 because it feels like hope if finally makin a comeback
7935486 not just because barack has done well but because i think people are hungry for change
7935487 where does your funding come from the cia al qaida
7935488 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
7935489 the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything
7935490 anything that is complex is not useful and anything that is useful is simple this has been my whole lifes motto
7935491 it is unfortunate but it really has come down to this
7935492 its your people that are walking around our neighborhood committing all these crimes
7935493 what you are suggesting is putting people behind walls and thats un christian like its un jewish like its completely inhuman and unacceptable
7935494 its now a matter of letting everyone know were ready to do what we have to do to protect ourselves
7935495 i am strong advocate of the second amendment but you can go from being a victim to someone being prosecuted very easily
7935496 my fear is that someone is going to get into trouble or hurt
7935497 i believe that the constitution confers an individual right to bear arms but just because you have an individual right does not mean that the state or local government cant constrain the exercise of that right
7935498 just because you have an individual right to free speech does not mean that the state or local government cant constrain the exercise of that right
7935499 just because you have an individual right not to be searched unreasonably does not mean that the state or local government cant constrain the exercise of that right
7935500 just because you have an individual right to freely exercise religion does not mean that the state or local government cant constrain the exercise of that right
7935501 just because you have an individual right to an abortion does not mean that the state or local government cant constrain the exercise of that right
7935502 just because you have an individual right to bear arms does not mean that the state or local government cant constrain the exercise of that right
7935503 i believe that the constitution confers an individual right to bear arms but just because you have an individual right does not mean that the state or local government cant constrain the exercise of that right
7935504 it is unfortunate but it really has come down to this
7935505 its your people that are walking around our neighborhood committing all these crimes
7935506 what you are suggesting is putting people behind walls and thats un christian like its un jewish like its completely inhuman and unacceptable
7935507 its now a matter of letting everyone know were ready to do what we have to do to protect ourselves
7935508 i am strong advocate of the second amendment but you can go from being a victim to someone being prosecuted very easily
7935509 my fear is that someone is going to get into trouble or hurt
7935510 i never imagined i would be a grandmother with a gun
7935511 can you help me unravel my latest mistake i dont love him winter just wasnt my season
7935512 puoi aiutarmi a risolvere lultimo errore che ho fatto non lo amo linverno non era la mia stagione
7935513 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late
7935514 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
7935515 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
7935516 a lot of the fall is due to the increase in public coverage
7935517 we are coordinating with pakistani authorities in investigating the incident
7935518 they should take a low profile their movements should be restricted during this period
7935519 for besieging the afghan and foreign forces in kabul we have begun the initial work on the main roads leading to kabul from four directions
7935520 raz dwa trzy ca y wiat niech ca y wiat piewa z nami bogu dzi kuj c za s o ce i nieba aksamit
7935521 i felt a strong blow and then my stomach went up and down
7935522 on the 20th of august i have been born again
7935523 if theyre complying with federal law then there would be fingerprints
7935524 in eight years of doing this i have never been able to find someone identified
7935525 what we worry about is the guy in his basement who has some kind of voice programming who can crank this out from his laptop they sell it for cheap or for free and thats the stuff that needs to be taken out
7935526 more and more people are getting called and more and more candidates up and down the ballot are using them
7935527 and there is no evidence to show they are effective

7935529 his very presence the color of his skin the very strangeness of his name is the best guarantee of his betrayal of the expectations of the constituencies that will vote to elect him barack obama is in short order a far more reassuring prospect for the continued dominance of the financial elite than another four years of neo conservative rule which in an almost historically unique combination of greed ill will incompetence and stupidity have brought the country to the edge of disaster

7935552 north korea is trying to muddle through and delay as much as possible
7935553 at the same time this is a last ditch effort trying to somehow influence u s presidential politics
7935554 i think the timing of the hu jintao visit to south korea was very depressing to the north koreans
7935555 i see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the u s to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible
7935556 the united states and china can think that they are drawing north korea into true nuclear disarmament but north korea has continued to nuclearise throughout the six party process

7935575 it is impossible to return 400 acres of land to the farmers who have been agitating in front of the tata motors nano project site in singur west bengal chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee said here on tuesday
7935576 returning 400 acres means dropping the entire project i cannot afford to roll back the project now it is too important for the state
7935577 im trying to make the opposition parties understand that the automobile company and its ancillary industries should be in a continuous piece of land
7935578 west bengal will be the first state from where tata motors will roll out the rs 100 000 small car we cannot miss this project this car factory and the ancillary factories will attract many other companies in the future and the ancillary units will not only supply products to the nano factory they will also serve other companies
7935579 this singur is an exceptional case this is not the original feature of the state as a whole
7935580 there are 13 000 farmer families involved with this project and it is impossible to reach out to every farmer individually but our officials have attended several meetings over there and talked to the aggrieved farmers

7935592 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7935593 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7935594 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

7935606 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7935607 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7935608 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7935609 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7935610 i intend to be tolerably well understood there was no longer knew the building roofs or road walking very slow glides in the diner seemed to come down into the discussion going on hidden in the french court in english and scottish without irish

7935613 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7935614 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

7935619 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7935620 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7935621 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7935622 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7935623 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7935624 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7935625 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7935626 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7935627 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7935628 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7935629 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7935630 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7935631 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7935632 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7935633 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7935634 estamos muito perto de alcan ar um acordo o ciclo de robinho na espanha chegou ao fim e ele precisa encontrar um novo caminho

7935642 eu prefiro come ar jogando foi assim que fiz o meu melhor jogo no campeonato contra o sport quando marquei dois gols
7935643 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7935644 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7935645 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7935646 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7935647 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7935648 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7935649 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7935650 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7935651 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7935652 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7935653 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7935654 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7935655 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7935656 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7935657 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7935658 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7935659 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7935660 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7935661 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7935662 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7935663 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7935664 who are open to doing something on the production side
7935665 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7935666 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7935667 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7935668 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
7935669 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
7935670 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
7935671 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7935672 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7935673 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7935674 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7935675 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7935676 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7935677 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

7935724 it was pitch dark and he couldnt see anything it was lucky he did not have an accident himself
7935725 it is so bad i have seen a lot of things i am 58 but this is so bad
7935726 some of the cows were going away at 50 to 60km h the river was so wild
7935727 we are so lucky that the guy smit getting the cows in didnt get hurt it could have been much much worse if he had fallen into the river
7935728 somewhat abated and changed course so its no longer such a dire threat
7935729 there is high potential for another major slip to come down onto the road so the risk to public safety is too great for the road to open
7935730 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7935731 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7935732 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
7935733 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
7935734 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
7935735 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7935736 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7935737 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7935738 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7935739 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7935740 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7935741 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7935742 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7935743 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7935744 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7935745 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7935746 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7935747 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7935748 no one works for someone we all just work together
7935749 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
7935750 michael winder the ironworker who took 43 5 percent of the vote against house speaker rod jetton in the 156th district missouri house race in 2006 said hes feeling confident of victory this year
7935751 last time going against the speaker of the house nobody gave me much of a chance
7935752 i opened their eyes up now a whole lot of people expect me to win
7935753 a lot of people say democrats are for taking away guns and abortion
7935754 di paris ecco come si presentata la hilton qualche sera fa alla festa organizzata da
7935755 my projects explore peoples capacity to construct an inhabitable environment by assuming this new three way interaction
7935756 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7935757 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7935758 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7935759 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7935760 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7935761 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7935762 i used to be my own protection but not now coz my path has lost direction somehow
7935763 in a neighborhood overflowing with overhyped overpriced and over the top venues max is an island of under
7935764 go to this bar to meet some low quality women
7935765 as a driver it creates a little bit of confusion for you
7935766 an upgrade is helpful both from a pedestrians point of view and a drivers point of view
7935767 dumpling man is a great cheap east village hot spot
7935768 i frequent this place for lunch every chance i get
7935769 ugh people with first time tattoos that are small are so annoying
7935770 initially you may be put off but talk a little bit put up some wit and theyll laugh along with you
7935771 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7935772 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks
7935773 theyre going all of these routes through threats intimation to try to thwart the first amendment here because they dont have an argument on merit
7935774 as a california lad dreaming of the many benefits of what new york could offered i often dreamt of emporiums of every conceivable item
7935775 it was tricky because the waves were crashing over his head one minute you saw him the next he was under a metre of water his fists were white from clinging on
7935776 if no one had been there he would have given up he was pretty gouged up from the rocks his feet were opened up
7935777 he is a very with a capital v lucky man
7935778 die gc games convention findet auch 2009 in leipzig statt
7935779 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7935780 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7935781 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7935782 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7935783 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7935784 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7935785 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7935786 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7935787 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7935788 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7935789 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7935790 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7935791 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7935792 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7935793 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7935794 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7935795 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7935796 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7935797 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7935798 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7935799 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7935800 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7935801 see how the bacon on my hamburger is all curled up they deep fry it
7935802 omg how can he take me to a place this ghetto
7935803 i wonder how many germs are embedded in these crevices
7935804 no dai ma trp triste 1 ragazza ke dice aio oppure eia
7935805 youre friend gave me a fake pennsylvania id i should have called the cops on her i know shes underage
7935806 you should have called the cops i would have liked to see the look on your face when they tell you it is a valid id and she is in fact 25 years old
7935807 im going to have to ask you to leave if it were up to me you could stay but this is my job
7935808 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7935809 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7935810 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7935811 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7935812 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7935813 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7935814 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7935815 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7935816 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7935817 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7935818 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7935819 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7935820 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7935821 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7935822 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7935823 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7935824 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7935825 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7935826 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7935827 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7935828 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7935829 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7935830 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7935831 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7935832 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7935833 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7935834 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7935835 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7935836 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7935837 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7935838 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7935839 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7935840 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7935841 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7935842 this is a planning took where all things are going
7935843 you hit him and he is a lot older than you
7935844 you were fired up and shouldnt have allowed yourself to punch him but there were no serious injuries and there has been no record of violence for 15 years i believe this was an isolated incident
7935845 the russian occupation of georgia has hit the georgian economy besides humanitarian aid another way to help is to buy georgian products
7935846 borjomi is a symbol of their freedom and of our solidarity with georgia
7935847 jonas brothers song art drawing tutorials illustration sketch learn to draw drawing class how to draw art school animation drawing books tutorials watch draw
7935848 being in the business of rock and roll means having an attitude being sexy being edgy and being unapologetic unless i do something wrong i look up to people like joan jett pat benatar freddie mercury and cyndi lauper i want to have that same type of appeal if people want a role model they can have miley cyrus
7935849 compare that to todays fbi a threat based intelligence driven technologically supported agency of over 30 000 employees who are working in 56 field offices and 61 offices overseas
7935850 in my opinion it is a very serious crime and it certainly is not a victimless crime
7935851 you should meet some of the folks who have been victimized such as the elderly being victimized in telemarketing scams people who paid premiums for insurance and are left high and dry employees who lose their jobs because someone in the corporation embezzled and shareholders who invested in a company and found out it was nothing more than a scam
7935852 some of their stories are heart wrenching these people have lost their life savings and even their homes and businesses to con men the white collar criminal concern us and we try to pursue them
7935853 a text book definition is any theft of monies or assets through deceit or deception without a threat of violence any con game
7935854 its virtually anybody its such a lucrative area that weve even seen drug gangs involved in check fraud weve also seen gangs involved in credit card fraud and weve seen organized crime involved in insurance fraud and securities fraud
7935855 it certainly takes planning and forethought and organization to reach some form of success as a white collar criminal
7935856 fortunately most of our agents are just as talented and just as aggressive in trying to pursue these people
7935857 back when i was a rookie agent in denver colorado i had a subject who was an inmate in a state correctional facility he bilked an investment firm out of 400 000 just by using the prison phone there are actually a few guys who can generate income from behind bars
7935858 our cases are complex and they take a while to develop our average investigation takes over a year in the investigative stage then working through the u s attorneys office the case is charged and it may take another year before the person is actually brought to justice whether its a trial or a plea and then there is the sentencing
7935859 the mayor is very busy and has to attend numerous functions events and business meetings irrespective of the day of week or time of day so i think it is entirely appropriate that he be granted a driver
7935860 i paid this cheque out of my own pocket so i have suffered the consequences of my actions
7935861 the fact is he wasnt fined and the council only issues fines based on direct evidence from our traffic inspectors and not third parties
7935862 when i came into office here i refused the mayoral limousine and my views have not changed a bit
7935863 it sounds like its feasible but i think it would be too impractical
7935864 the poor person would have to sit there for ages while i do what i have to do at the events
7935865 its disappointing ron has rejected facilities that are tried and true
7935866 he should accept the system not make excuses when he does something illegal
7935867 if you think a bloke is a mate and then he does that to you hes obviously not a mate
7935868 i guess my son is disappointed about that to be used as a scapegoat and i can understand that position its crazy really
7935869 from a fathers point of view im extremely disappointed with whats happened
7935870 i guess its a kick in the arse when you get a call from a mate asking you to do a favour that in fact could put you in jail its a bit hard theres not too many who would agree to that unless they have rocks in their head
7935871 it just goes to show you what mateship is realistically im extremely disappointed for my son
7935872 i think its put tremendous pressure on the boy at this stage of his life
7935873 everybody from me to you to the pope has to be given a chance of showing that theyre innocent and thats the position that hes in now
7935874 but unfortunately its not my decision its a decision for the club and for tony zappia but were showing a lot of compassion towards both people who were involved in this
7935875 the important battle thats being won is right across the football culture there is now a recognition that the community will not tolerate violence towards women
7935876 its a bit like drink driving forty years ago it was acceptable today its not but some idiots still do it
7935877 does that mean we give up educating young people about it does that mean we stop having law against it no
7935878 its the same thing with violence against women we need to stay the course and you will always get young men who think its ok to abuse or assault women and we just have to keep at it
7935879 bersyukur saya karena ternyata kawan kawan begitu banyak yang mau mendoakan kepergian almarhum
7935880 im happy to be back at episcopal my alma mater which i have many happy memories of and a few that im sure former teachers school administrators and i would rather forget
7935881 i would respond aggressively and sometimes irresponsibly to anyone whom i perceived to have questioned my sense of honor and self respect those responses often got me in a fair amount of trouble earlier in life
7935882 in all candor as an adult ive been known to forget occasionally the discretion expected of a person of my years and station when i believe ive been accorded a lack of respect i did not deserve
7935883 but i believe if my detractors had known me at episcopal they might marvel at the self restraint and mellowness i developed as an adult or perhaps they wouldnt quite see it that way
7935884 it was worth taking the time to go through the pilot process to really do it right
7935885 theyre perfect additions to our dominant core slate of shows hese are the initial pickups but there are a number of other pilots we feel will also get the go ahead in some form moving forward
7935886 you know what maybe it is paulas time to go
7935887 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
7935888 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
7935889 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
7935890 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
7935891 im a property owner we own a lot of property but we live in one or two
7935892 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
7935893 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
7935894 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
7935895 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
7935896 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
7935897 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
7935898 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them
7935899 well let you know if we can use your services
7935900 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7935901 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7935902 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7935903 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7935904 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7935905 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7935906 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7935907 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7935908 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
7935909 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
7935910 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7935911 when ted kennedy comes here to ask us all to pull together as a party not many people in this hall are not going to take that next step
7935912 it never stopped him he didnt go in a corner and weep he just started something else and now here he is tonight so tenacious
7935913 anyone whos advanced for him knows he likes a stool
7935914 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7935915 i have a headache from the altitude today i cant imagine what its like for someone whos got radiation chemotherapy and has to take a battery of drugs
7935916 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7935917 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7935918 id heard it from a pretty good source last night but everyone was thrilled to hear about it at our breakfast this is the kind of moment that sen kennedy lives for
7935919 id heard something over the weekend but his health is such an issue it wasnt clear if hed be able to come
7935920 im a cancer survivor and i know how draining this kind of thing can be
7935921 it pushes the focus back on the challenge ahead and on obama and the race it gives people something positive to talk about
7935922 this may be ted kennedys final gift to the party
7935923 this says that he feels this is the democrats year and the party is not as unified as hed like it to be his appearance takes the headlines away from the clinton faction
7935924 happens to be somebody who i love to death hes just a good man and obviously hes going through a difficult time but im glad that we can use this convention to remind people of the contributions hes made to this country
7935925 just charges the atmosphere here the emotion is enormous its just what you want to start off the convention
7935926 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
7935927 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
7935928 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
7935929 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
7935930 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
7935931 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
7935932 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
7935933 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
7935934 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
7935935 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
7935936 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
7935937 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
7935938 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
7935939 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
7935940 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
7935941 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
7935942 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
7935943 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
7935944 i was wondering if maybe solar cells could be made with carbon nanotubes
7935945 i mean carbon is cheap and ive seen self assembling molecules so i think it would be easy to make
7935946 we said al gores just a spokesman for these ideas wouldnt you like to meet with the people doing the real work
7935947 todays visit to the lab is only one of seven visits david will be making to companies doing work in this area
7935948 weve had kids who wanted to swim with the dolphins or paint their room in a tom and jerry theme but davids wish is really unique
7935949 a friend and i are trying to build a hydrocraft using ions
7935950 but we havent been able to get the aluminum foil and balsa wood into the air yet
7935951 grow algae and use carbon dioxide to make oxygen and it could feed on the astronauts waste
7935952 another problem well have with sending an astronaut to mars is their exposure to radiation thats something else you might think about
7935953 these are really excellent ideas and we want to do everything we can to encourage his inventiveness after all this is where the wild new things come from
7935954 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
7935955 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
7935956 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
7935957 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
7935958 the same speech hes been giving for months why didnt he give the germans something more
7935959 it was a tent in the desert 100 degree heat off and on for what seemed like forever
7935960 why was i held by the united states like that when i was their ally
7935961 if theyre exaggerating and distorting this much in august what will october be like
7935962 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7935963 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7935964 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7935965 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7935966 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7935967 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7935968 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7935969 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7935970 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7935971 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7935972 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7935973 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7935974 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7935975 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7935976 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7935977 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7935978 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7935979 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7935980 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7935981 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7935982 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
7935983 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
7935984 madonna shows that obama has no chance against mccains gang
7935985 people had wanted to make behind the music type films of me but i wasnt interested i dont have any scandal attached to me i dont have any drug problems my story is personally sad in terms of loss but its not behind the life
7935986 i didnt want a documentary im young i mean im 61 but i still feel vital and alive and im still discovering who i am in terms of being a worker and doing new work i dont wish to be eulogized at this time in my life and i like the film because it doesnt have a lot of people talking about me as if im dead instead of having interviews with flea of the red hot chili peppers or sam shepard its just life with them
7935987 i had also recently lost my brother and in meeting steven it was like i was gifted with another brother
7935988 hes not unlike my brother in that he is a generous spirit and very protective a good one of the reasons i let him film us
7935989 when i left the public eye in 79 i had depleted myself in terms of giving what information i knew as a human being about anything i really needed to learn more about myself about what it means to be a citizen a human as well as an artist and mother
7935990 i learned that there is nothing one cant surmount from the simplest task of doing laundry to burying ones husband
7935991 ive watched it now several times and i find when i watch it that im smiling through it or that certain parts make me cry and a couple of parts are sort of boring
7935992 sometimes i think you know too much we get rid of some of it
7935993 and seeing my parents or flea when im laughing or happy in the film im still happy i access that
7935994 going through our house looking at the pictures of fred we had so much hope and so much joy in having our children and having our little old house
7935995 she looks off to one side her eyes watering up and pauses for a moment to collect herself
7935996 i have to catch my breath looking at the yard and looking at our deck with the rain falling that deck that fred loved to sit on and listen to tigers games just things i know little things
7935997 i wanted it to be a positive film it has a sense of me as allen ginsberg said to me continuing my lifes adventure in one way letting fred go and in another way carrying him within me
7935998 i could walk over there and be in the company of susan sontag samuel beckett baudelaire jean seberg and sartre theyre all buried there its such a beautiful little cemetery
7935999 some of it was an homage to robert some to the poet ren daumal a whole selection of polaroids drawings films
7936000 it just makes me sad sometimes to work on it because i never imagined life without robert i met him when i was 20 and i thought i would always know him
7936001 its just a modest hotel but i can look out the window and see the graveyard a lot of time was spent by myself but ive been happy here i havent been lonely
7936002 paris is a very rewarding city if you like historical architecture and like to visit the graves and caf s of poets
7936003 ive experienced quite a gamut of hotel life in paris and i love em all the little hotels that sometimes have more charm than most and the five star hotels that have italian linen and the finest pillowcases it just depends on what my job is and what i need
7936004 im really a mess i fell asleep in these clothes and woke up and im still in them
7936005 my mother would just hide it but i would find it i wore it every day
7936006 im like that onstage i have my favorite t shirt anne demeulemeester makes me a t shirt and i wear it untillw it wears out and then she makes me another one i dont have 40 t shirts ive got one and then i get another or anne makes me a jacket and when it gets threadbare she gives me another jacket
7936007 these will last a good five six years then ill get another pair
7936008 a delight for the performer or artist personal style is important think of bob dylan record covers or the image of maria callas with her headscarf and pearls im a uniform type of person but i enjoy fashion especially high fashion even though i dont wear it ive always loved looking at the gowns at couture ive always loved balenciaga and seeing what ava gardner was wearing i dont really dress up i dont wear makeup i cant be bothered with that but i find it fascinating to see what other people do
7936009 oh theres a matisse show somewhere or theres a new limoges china a new pattern is out
7936010 hey i like your stuff where can i go buy the record
7936011 well i produced the beat on the b track of this vinyl i got some scratch records if you want and i did a remix for some german guy
7936012 okay well this is just four or five songs stretched out
7936013 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
7936014 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
7936015 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
7936016 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
7936017 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
7936018 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
7936019 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable

7936054 my experiences at princeton have made me far more aware of my blackness than ever before
7936055 i have found that at princeton no matter how liberal and open minded some of my white professors and classmates try to be toward me i sometimes feel like a visitor on campus as if i really dont belong
7936056 as close to infanticide as anything i have come upon

7936063 celtic christians had a name for the holy spirit an geadh glas or the wild goose the name hints at mystery much like a wild goose the spirit of god cannot be tracked or tamed an element of danger an air of unpredictability surround him and while the name may sound a little sacrilegious i cannot think of a better description of what its like to follow the spirit through life i think the celtic christians were on to something most of us will have no idea where we are going most of the time and i know that is unsettling but circumstantial uncertainty also goes by another name adventure
7936064 it could be good for the nation if other corporate companies could emulate what standard bank has done to work with undp on an issue that is of national and global concern
7936065 when i was closing the short sale at the ritz carlton in washington dc i was faced with 3 mortgages past due condo fees and tax liens but because i was able to prove that the short sale would benefit the bank i was able to stop the foreclosure and get the entire deal done from start to finish in 28 days
7936066 having a knowledgeable and savvy realtor is essential to negotiating the short sale process with a bank
7936067 if you want to improve the chances of your bank accepting a short sale you ultimately need to prove that a foreclosure on the property is imminent
7936068 there is a popular misconception that homes sold through a short sale are

7936081 this has been a year of focusing on what we do well and implementing ways to tighten efficiencies especially in automation and computerization our it team is implementing and rolling out a new information system to be used by all
7936082 network rail on operator delays currently cause some 80 of the late arrivals on the wcmls virgin tail services
7936083 we also need evidence that the project will be delivered to schedule as it is previous overruns that have brought us to the current state of affairs this is simply not good enough to keep uk businesses on the move
7936084 businesses understand and support the need to invest in our railways and they know this work is essential firms need guarantees that work will be scheduled to avoid damaging the economy and that delays will be minimised
7936085 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7936086 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7936087 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7936088 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7936089 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7936090 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7936091 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7936092 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7936093 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7936094 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7936095 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7936096 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7936097 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
7936098 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7936099 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7936100 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7936101 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7936102 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7936103 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7936104 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7936105 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7936106 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7936107 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7936108 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7936109 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7936110 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7936111 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7936112 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7936113 would you like to go out for dinner and a show
7936114 would you like to come up and see my etchings
7936115 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7936116 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7936117 to go into botswana to buy mealie meal and haul it back into zim to be distributed
7936118 most of the hauling within zim is done at night because government sponsored thugs set up check points on the roads and would demand the mealie meal be given to them
7936119 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7936120 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7936121 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7936122 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7936123 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7936124 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7936125 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7936126 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7936127 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7936128 we cannot now confirm that u s ships will be travelling to poti
7936129 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7936130 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7936131 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7936132 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7936133 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7936134 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7936135 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7936136 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7936137 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7936138 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7936139 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7936140 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7936141 this is a very solid showing for senator obama in historical terms its a showing that augurs well for him
7936142 the more you like senator clinton the more likely you are to be for senator obama
7936143 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7936144 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7936145 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7936146 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean he enthused
7936147 i mean thats a storybook man not a fairy tale
7936148 look the clintons are dirty how many times do the republicans need to throw that in our faces turn the page they did most of the stuff that the republicans said they did whitewater catte futures filegate travelgate gennifer flowers katherina wilkie monica lewinsky turn the page
7936149 never walk over others in climbing the ladder to success you just might meet them on your way down
7936150 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7936151 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7936152 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7936153 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7936154 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7936155 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7936156 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7936157 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7936158 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7936159 she killed her daughter her story has occupied my mind for days i cant shake it how do you possibly continue after something like that how does she do it
7936160 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7936161 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7936162 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7936163 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7936164 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7936165 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
7936166 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
7936167 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7936168 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7936169 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
7936170 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
7936171 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7936172 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7936173 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7936174 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7936175 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7936176 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7936177 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7936178 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7936179 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7936180 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7936181 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7936182 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7936183 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7936184 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7936185 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7936186 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7936187 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7936188 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7936189 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7936190 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7936191 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7936192 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7936193 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7936194 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7936195 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7936196 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7936197 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7936198 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7936199 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7936200 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7936201 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7936202 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7936203 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7936204 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7936205 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7936206 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7936207 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7936208 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7936209 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7936210 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7936211 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7936212 she runs fast and is out of sight in minutes leaving a trail of pheromones in her wake
7936213 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7936214 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7936215 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7936216 we petitioned dep department of environmental protection about three minutes ago
7936217 we have to wait for the dep approval and that may take several hours
7936218 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7936219 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7936220 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7936221 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7936222 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7936223 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7936224 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7936225 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7936226 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7936227 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7936228 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7936229 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7936230 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7936231 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7936232 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7936233 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7936234 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7936235 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7936236 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7936237 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7936238 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7936239 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7936240 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7936241 i dont know how long it had been there but it had to be dismantled because it was overcrowded without enough sanitation it was also posing a risk to safety and security
7936242 it was not a forced action the same people who were living there are the ones who destroyed the camp
7936243 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7936244 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7936245 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7936246 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7936247 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7936248 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7936249 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7936250 barack obama is going to have to win this thing or lose this thing on his own
7936251 we analysts have had to pretend to know what they are thinking
7936252 and so weve had to get by without really knowing what were talking about
7936253 i think there has been a great deal of healing
7936254 but if content creators cant make any money they wont create content
7936255 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7936256 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7936257 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7936258 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7936259 he in turn laid a charge of assault against police
7936260 advice sought by the portfolio committee indicated that more time was needed to ensure that a wide variety of stakeholders had been consulted and that public participation may have been insufficient to see the bill through
7936261 we started the operation around 9am and ended it around 2pm we arrested anyone we found in those 15 house that connected the electricity illegally
7936262 we received a tip off from the community members about him and then we set a trap for him the dog unit was used to sniff out the dagga
7936263 we believe that the men were distributing the explosives to atm bombers in mpumalanga we will investigate to find out where they are finding these explosives
7936264 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
7936265 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment

7936271 queremos seguir en la copa de la uefa si no pasamos adi s pero no hay cosas positivas en una eliminaci n hay que pensar en seguir adelante si no se puede mala suerte
7936272 es f tbol y cuanto m s ambiente haya mejor estos son partidos para demostrar que uno es futbolista por lo que nos jugamos por el ambiente y por el resultado que cosecharon ellos en riazor sinceramente el ambiente no me preocupa demasiado
7936273 queremos seguir en la copa de la uefa si no pasamos adi s pero no hay cosas positivas en una eliminaci n hay que pensar en seguir adelante si no se puede mala suerte
7936274 no creo que haga el mismo planteamiento que aqu el hajduk es un equipo con jugadores ofensivos aunque en riazor no lo demostraron
7936275 el equipo se siente a gusto con los dos sistemas y eso es una ventaja casi con toda seguridad saldremos con una l nea de cuatro defensas aunque hay aspectos a mejorar tanto para este partido como para el resto de la temporada
7936276 dependemos mucho de lo que pase el jueves si estamos en uefa jugaremos los jueves y los domingos y no habr mucho tiempo de recuperaci n y se va a necesitar mucha m s gente que el a o pasado tenemos que pensar en esa circunstancia
7936277 la liga de campeones y la uefa tienen dos problemas la primera causa mucho cansancio y la uefa tiene el problema de que se juega los jueves y que la recuperaci n para el fin de semana puede no ser adecuada
7936278 casi siempre estoy preocupado por eso tengo arrugas brome pero estoy ilusionado con esta temporada contento con la plantilla pero vamos a esperar

7936282 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7936283 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7936284 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7936285 they will dictate political fortunes and reshape the government of this country at all levels anyone who wants to understand the political landscape must examine the mind and motivations of the womens electorate
7936286 year after year one thing has become clear when women vote women and democrats win
7936287 thats why this study is so important to understanding the messages and issues that will motivate this critical segment of the electorate

7936295 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7936296 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7936297 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7936298 the reality is that this groundswell of external factorsand environmental change exceeds the flexibility of ourbusiness model

7936303 we anticipated that the lme 3 month copper price would fall back to 6 500 t by the end of june 2008 although our timing was wrong our view of the trend was correct
7936304 it appears that this long standing copper bull has finally given up hope that the price is going to strengthen
7936305 given the recent price slump chinese buyers may well hold off until it becomes clear where the price floor is
7936306 it takes about three days to get to the site about two and a half hours to get down there
7936307 there are only five submarines in the world that can get to that depth and do any recovery this piece couldnt be brought up by a submarine it had to be brought up by a lift bag this piece weighs 30 000 pounds its the biggest piece weve ever recovered

7936309 would put more pressure on the treasury to explicitly back the liabilities of the gses

7936332 i think ive taken a lot of confidence out of saturday and not knowing i was going to be there because of mcmenimans illness and yet the team had such a good result
7936333 hes certainly playing like he wants to go away isnt he
7936334 what do you do do you make a bloke honour his contract or do you give in and say see you later
7936335 penrith are in a no win situation arent they i think the contract should be honoured
7936336 i think these days blokes get out of contracts way too easy and i think its good that they make a stand and make him earn his money
7936337 theyve basically built a team around him and he cant just say when he wants that he wants to go even if sonny bill williams did it
7936338 id make him enjoy his time and if he doesnt want to stay well theres not much he can do i suppose
7936339 obviously hes not a happy camper and we keep hearing week in and week out that hes not
7936340 so either come out and dispel the rumours or come out and say my times up im ready to go
7936341 its not fair on the club and not fair on the fans
7936342 to suggest the guy wasnt going to go back on the field because he was feigning injury is taking it just a tad too far

7936354 claims that an anc national audit team has recommended the dissolution of the anc provincial executive committee pec are untrue
7936355 any fraud or corruption that could be attributed to the pec or the provincial secretariat as claimed by the cape times
7936356 newspapers that have allowed themselves to be used in this campaign not only damage their credibility but also do a disservice to their readers and the people of the western cape

7936364 after numerous attempts by the family lawyer for information about the two men from the department of foreign affairs diplomatic access was eventually secured from the ugandan authorities this took a week to process
7936365 unfortunately this has led to a perceived lack of interest as well as negative speculation vis vis the department of foreign affairs
7936366 as a desperate measure the family had to obtain the services of legal counsel in kampala to assist them
7936367 both gentlemen represent a charitable organisation the crescent of hope and have been involved in relief work on the continent and at home for many years
7936368 if not then the department through its high commissioner should assist in securing their immediate release so that they are able to return to their home and their loved ones
7936369 the anger and frustration of the muslim community at this stereotyping and religious profiling is quite understandable
7936370 the muslim community would be deeply grateful to the anc if you could add your voice to their call for the unconditional release of the two men

7936399 has long allowed food processors to irradiate beef eggs poultry oysters and spices but the market for irradiated foods is tiny because the government also requires that these foods be labeled as irradiated labels that scare away most consumers

7936410 the facts are even more interesting with confusion from the plaintiff as to who sold him his ticket and how he boarded the wrong train proving once again that you cant make this stuff up the courts decision has the details
7936411 on the evening of may 19 2005 the plaintiff consumed approximately five large tequila based margarita cocktails note to court dont all margaritas have tequilla at a new haven restaurant before walking to the new haven railroad station

7936424 a todos os f s da banda akashic e interessados informamos que estamos finalizando as atividades
7936425 foram 10 anos de uma conviv ncia fant stica onde aprendemos muito uns com os outros tanto musicalmente quanto pessoalmente
7936426 foram dois cds e um dvd a ser lan ado al m de duas turn s pela europa neste per odo focamos no akashic nossas principais energias criativas temos certeza de que fizemos o nosso melhor artisticamente sempre mantendo a verdade de cada um de n s em cada m sica ou ato que a banda tomou at aqui
7936427 por que isso que gostamos de fazer e o que fazemos de melhor
7936428 watching customers move so effortlessly between acoustics and electrics brought home the fact that these worlds really do converge
7936429 thats obvious to most players but as a manufacturer with a largely singular focus up until now it definitely hit home
7936430 does the world need another electric guitar does taylor really want to risk its stellar rep in the acoustic world by trespassing into the parallel universe of electric solidbodies
7936431 bob and his crew are always tinkering with new ideas
7936432 some of them rise to the surface and some of them dont there wasnt a plan to make a solid body electric we dont want to make something unless its original unless we think weve added value
7936433 but i got convinced that these guitars were really special and that the positive feedback we were getting meant we should do it yes the whole guitar market is very crowded now compared with when we started in 1974 now there are zillions of brands but most of them are me too products with very little innovation in my opinion and we think theres always room for original ideas
7936434 the challenge isnt in making a quiet single coil but to do it without losing the single coils tonal character using our flavor of design we did that and on top of it we were able to maintain what we call a modern output level
7936435 ive owned probably three or four strat style guitars in my life ive built two or three for myself but they werent my main axe
7936436 a lot of it was because i only found that sound usable for my style of playing here and there but when we did these single coils and got them up and running i found something i really liked i like the power and the edge and the fidelity
7936437 i think your standard single coil player will find something extremely appealing that he hasnt heard before and i think the guy who normally plays full shred humbuckers will find fresh inspiration
7936438 im leaving the guitar wide open while im playing but theres no noise
7936439 you can turn the volume control down and the tone will clean up so its a real versatile guitar without any of the traditional hum and buzz and artifacts of a regular single coil
7936440 i did a session the other day where we had to replicate all these old popular songs from the 70s and i took both the humbucker and the single coil classic and used them both a lot theyre really really versatile the single coil sounds great plays great
7936441 the world has become more and more flat with cultural currency and trade barriers becoming less and less with the advent of the european union the adoption of a common currency and the free movement of goods across borders a huge opportunity has been created to do more commerce at a higher level
7936442 fender has proven the concept of an american guitar and amp company successfully exporting their business model to europe and achieving much higher sales and brand awareness as a result
7936443 bill mendello shared his experiences in creating fender europe with me a few years ago and invited me to see their european operations first hand i spent a week visiting their warehouse sales offices and even their d sseldorf custom shop showroom i was blown away by their incredible success in europe and the huge potential of their sales model for taylor
7936444 we are extremely pleased to be working closely with bob taylor and kurt listug two admired industry leaders who have built taylor into a premier guitar brand
7936445 by providing our expertise in sales marketing warehousing and logistics we look forward to enhancing their success throughout the european market
7936446 i had no idea what would become of that precious remaining wood but i couldnt bring myself to throw it away
7936447 we locked it up and moved on to other projects
7936448 its an honor to be able to use the last few pieces of this important tree to make something as totally cool as this guitar
7936449 like everything else in his life artie handled his diagnosis with dignity strength and acceptance and even a little of his irreverent humor
7936450 i am leaving for hawaii with my family and the timing couldnt have been more perfect as i wanted to take a guitar with me on the plane and to the islands
7936451 were excited to see how fans and musicians get behind this competition
7936452 bands receive top of the line gear from taylor and a load of cash while fans get a live show from the winning band in their city everyone wins weve learned that fans love it when an opportunity arises for them to truly show support for their favorite bands the element of fan participation and advocacy will only enhance the opportunity for emerging artists to showcase their talent by way of a game changing music industry tool like eventful demand
7936453 we love helping build stronger connections between fans and artists
7936454 were excited to work with the taylor guitars to give the fans the power to shape their favorite artists tours
7936455 i love everything about this guitar ive been a gibson guy my whole life ive got 32 les pauls and this is my main guitar now
7936456 for years bob taylor fended off the question when are you going to build a solidbody guitar
7936457 then as part of the general process of exploration and experimentation that goes on at the company
7936458 longtime employee david hosler devised a new pickup instead of dropping it in yet another strat or les paul clone hosler and bob taylor agreed the new pickup demanded a new guitar
7936459 what they came up with is the solidbody series with variations dubbed classic custom and standard all are flat front single cutaway guitars with two pickups a standard taylor c shaped neck the same used on their acoustics a 24 7 8
7936460 the basic shape of the taylor solidbodies is captivating and they are also extremely comfortable to hold and play
7936461 the bridge common to all three models is cast aluminum with an art deco appearance designed to remain free of sharp edges
7936462 the neck is attached with taylors proprietary t lock system where an allen bolt goes through the body and pulls the neck into a pocket shaped like a w the t lock neck system is so tight that viewed from any angle but the back the neck appears to be glued on the body
7936463 sonically the five way blade switch in position one on the classic the least expensive of the group offers a warm jazzy tone with just a little more treble edge than a traditional humbucker dialing up a mild overdrive from a tube amp the neck pickup gives off a deep throaty growl with a hint of that magic steel on glass tone of a great stratocaster type pickup in position two the classic solves that age old problem of adjusting for too much low end when you go from lead to rhythm its open airy sound is still distinctly electric but wont muddy up the mix
7936464 the central position adds midrange and lower mids offering a deeper more forceful rhythm sound that is still unobtrusive position five both coils in the bridge pickup dishes out a tone very reminiscent of a telecaster though not quite as bright or with the same edge
7936465 backing up a notch to position four takes the tone of the bridge only spot on the blade and boosts it with lower mids and adds just a hint of cluck in other words a great lead tone
7936466 the purpose of mxtabs is to allow musicians to freely share their knowledge and to participate in a community with other musicians
7936467 the rebirth of mxtabs was done with the direct input of previous users of the site and what weve built is directly based on what musicians have been asking us for
7936468 i love everything about this guitar ive been a gibson guy my whole life ive got 32 les pauls and this is my main guitar now
7936469 you can actually get a lot of different sounds from the gibson sound to the strat anything
7936470 and sounds that dont even sound like either of them
7936471 thats what really makes them special theres so many unique sounds working with your volume and your tone that you get can a very unique sound going and with these pickups here referring to frenchs standard you can get the big big crunch that you like plus for a guitar thats lighter than im used to they have just as much punch youll see in a little bit they want us to rock today so were turning it up
7936472 the first time i plugged mine in and roi elam our other guitarist plugged his in we just started laughing hysterically because of how good it sounded
7936473 the bridge is so perfect for your wrist or palm the neck just feels great the weight is awesome everything just really seems like it was thought out for the guitarists
7936474 you know how a lot of times when you get a new guitar you put it on and it feels foreign as soon as i put this guitar on it felt like id been playing it for like 10 years
7936475 the standard to me just fits what i do i think theyre all great its just a matter of personal taste which is the cool thing about the fact that yall have three different models you can kind of find one that fits your style and flavor
7936476 the body contours are great the bridge is really comfortable theres no risk of stabbing your hand with a screw sticking up
7936477 its a beautiful guitar i have no complaints to me an instrument should just be a tool for you to be creative and you do feel creative when you pick up that guitar
7936478 the coolest thing about that guitar also is the 5 way switch and the way the humbuckers are split
7936479 you get some really unique tones and when youre doing rolling picking things like doyle dykes its just so articulate a lot of note separation its a phenomenal sounding guitar
7936480 when i plugged it in the sound was just humongous
7936481 but if you break my heart or hurt my feelings i will write a song about you
7936482 theyre the only acoustic guitars that actually stay in tune especially when you capo them
7936483 the most rewarding moment for me is when someone comments on how beautiful and functional our namm room is
7936484 invariably they will ask me who designs your room for you

7936491 practicing regular mindful breathing can be calming and energizing and can even help with stress related health problems
7936492 grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change the courage to change the things i can and the wisdom to know the difference
7936493 dont sweat the small stuff and remember that its all small stuff
7936494 this is silly why on earth am i thinking about this
7936495 the 21st century will be known as the age of the entrepreneur it will be a time when americans and others from many of the worlds capitalist economies will return to their roots of individual family owned businesses and with this return will come not just enormous personal wealth for those who get there first but also the resulting moral and family values as well as freedom that come with owning your own business and controlling your own destiny

7936499 a quarter vending machine that offers three different types of candy can be bought for about 200 and the candy to fill it costs around 50 in a good location the machine can easily bring in around 25 per month that means that you can pay off the entire asset in about six months or roll your profit into a second machine after another six months you can buy two more machines this may not seem like big money but it is planting the seed for big money in the future if you dont have the money or credit for real estate this is one way to turn a couple hundred dollars into a couple thousand

7936507 what are the enabling conditions that make human beings flourish
7936508 being completely involved in an activity for its own sake the ego falls away time flies every action movement and thought follows inevitably from the previous one like playing jazz your whole being is involved and youre using your skills to the utmost
7936509 there appear to be nine choices that self identified happy people consistently make that give them a feeling of contentment and well being regardless of how stressful their lives may appear to be
7936510 to be in the flow of life and feel connected and full of love and peace
7936511 may suitable doses of guaranteed sensual pleasure and slow long lasting enjoyment preserve us from the contagion of the multitude who mistake frenzy for efficiency
7936512 when you are walking walk when you are sitting sit dont wobble
7936513 when we do things with only a part of the mind we are just skimming the surface of life nothing sinks in nothing has real impact it leads to an empty feeling inside unfortunately it is this very emptiness that drives us to pack in even more seeking desperately to fill the void in our hearts what we need to do is just the opposite to slow down and live completely in the present then every moment will be full
7936514 in our workaholic culture we have lost the art of leisure we never make time to switch off to rest and reflect to play to do nothing at all but leisure is not an optional extra it is an essential part of a life well lived and a cornerstone of every great civilization
7936515 if a man does not keep pace with his companions perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer let him step to the music which he hears however measured or far away

7936522 you can learn to turn inspiration on like a faucet by practicing your craft on a regular basis that is by carving time out of your schedule for the process of creation the intent of this post is to help you do just that
7936523 better do a little well than a great deal badly
7936524 mindfulness is a certain way of paying attention that is healing that is restorative that is reminding you of who you actually are so that you dont wind up getting entrained into being a human doing rather than a human being
7936525 when we learn to focus our attention completely in the present we make an amazing discovery problems we thought were huge begin to shrink and old compulsions we thought we could never break out of fall away we find we have a breathing space between stimulus and response we no longer blow up when frustrated because we are going slow enough to control the situation we no longer cling to a moment of enjoyment but let things come and go in the natural rhythm of circumstances
7936526 why would you want to die at 65 do you know how to play the piano do you draw do you speak french have you written a book theres so much to do my goal right now is to live to 100 maybe ill say 120 later on

7936528 expecting the world to treat you fairly because you are a good person is a little like expecting the bull not to attack you because you are a vegetarian
7936529 to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment
7936530 there are persons so radiant so genial so kind so pleasure bearing that you instinctively feel in their presence that they do you good whose coming into a room is like the bringing of a lamp there

7936539 you can achieve anything you want in life if you have the courage to dream it the intelligence to make a realistic plan and the will to see that plan through to the end

7936547 to write the bad things that happen to me on sand and to write the good things that happen to me on marble
7936548 to not take things personally to realize that nothing others do is because of me what others say and do is a projection of their own reality
7936549 to always remember that my outer world is a reflection of my inner world and that i am creating my reality with my thoughts beliefs emotions and words
7936550 its hard to stay mad when theres so much beauty in the world
7936551 it is never too late to be what you might have been

7936574 the neck was spectacular the walnut was unbelievable and the sound of those pickups was to die for im just a straight garage church playing rhythm guy not tommy shaw by any stretch of the imagination but im very picky about the sound of the guitar and the overall presentation and feel of playing i congratulate everyone at taylor who put the solidbody together i think its probably the ultimate electric guitar
7936575 im very impressed with this little white stallion ive been using it in my home studio and its just beautiful the simplicity of the five way switch and controls is wonderful and the taylor neck what can you say about that if you cant play barre chords on a taylor guitar quit playing
7936576 in the past two months i have been fortunate enough to purchase a taylor t5 custom and a taylor solidbody classic
7936577 after plugging it in i bought the classic the statement in the review about taylor reinventing the electric guitar was not overstated this guitar does it all
7936578 the campbells had seen the solidbody at the taylor road show we had in october
7936579 theyd been badgering us ever since when are they coming in when are they coming in we were joking with them about the way the final harry potter book was released with bookstores opening up at midnight so that kids could get it as soon as it went on sale
7936580 they left the store that day but they called us a little later asking how serious we were about opening at midnight my dad and i looked at each other and said lets just do it so after thanksgiving dinner and watching football we came back up here about ten minutes to twelve we put some christmas music on turned on our christmas lights and they met us at about five til they bought the standard model my dad waited until 12 01 a m to print the invoice and we snapped some pictures we hope they were the first people to buy a solidbody
7936581 he asked that we save all the original packaging for the 2007 pre launch solidbody guitars
7936582 he wants the original boxes because down the road they will add to their value
7936583 you tore that song up that song is yours now
7936584 i had a ton of compliments on the look and sound of this guitar its simply an excellent guitar the pickups had a classic humbucker sound but it was nice and light with just the right amount of jangle and character as far as the way it played well its a taylor it plays amazing the world needs to know about this guitar
7936585 taylors revolutionary solidbody electric guitars come as close to reinventing the wheel as is conceivable using traditional materials and forms of signal generation

7936610 to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7936611 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to
7936612 see thats just not how he sees the world he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7936613 we know the momentum can shift and its going to shift starting in denver
7936614 now is the time for barack obama to begin the second wave of this campaign
7936615 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7936616 now these next three days i think youre going to see an intensity of attack
7936617 but you know you dont want to get negative choppy every single day and i think what were seeing today here is a democratic party thats positive thats unified that wants to heal that wants to bring bipartisanship and you know ill talk about that too
7936618 if the republicans are good at anything they are experts at fear and smear divide and conquer
7936619 what we have to do though i think is rebut those charges but also to point out the real mccain record
7936620 understands a lot more about how people have to struggle economically than john mccain will ever in his whole lifetime

7936647 were looking forward to getting our next re load because weve only got one solidbody left out of our three
7936648 as soon as taylor released information that there was going to be a solid body electric our phones started ringing
7936649 we think its going to be the guitar of the year 2008
7936650 i have them customers are playing them it was really loud in here this morning i havent even plugged in a custom though since my customs are pre sold i spent two minutes with one showing it to a customer then i put it back in the box because he bought it
7936651 ill probably get around to playing one sometime next year when the excitement has died down a little
7936652 a solid body is chambered typically where the controls are but finding those areas and chambering correctly is tricky
7936653 sustain and bloom are hard to get when everythings locked down but if you chamber too much you go in the opposite direction it blooms too soon and basically starts to resonate
7936654 it comes through in his fluid style speed and technical ability it was like a cutting edge blues fusion jazz rock style and that was what caught my ear the most about him that and the fact that his playing had more fire and passion than i had ever heard to that point regardless of the style that really got me plus how easy he made it look
7936655 when i put this guitar a classic on my rig it was just strong it really popped

7936659 then she proceeded to go into the vendors area get some plastic bags from them help herself to a ton of food and cookies and candy and all that stuff from the snack tray and proceeded to walk out the door again making another big stink about the thing and left
7936660 she never checked in or showed up at any conference functions at all her or her assistant
7936661 what were some of the sessions who were some of the speakers
7936662 i thought it would have been great for her to be there so im disappointed disappointed and angry as a taxpayer
7936663 the executive director says you took a bag filled it with muffins donuts and candy and then stormed out of there
7936664 shahbaz hussain alias shanu has played a very important role in the blasts that claimed 68 lives in jaipur and he has got strong linkage with abu bashar arrested from azamgarh uttar pradesh and sajid mansoori from gujarat in connection with ahmedabad blasts
7936665 the modus operandi of the entire blasts in jaipur is a part of investigation and interrogation but this is for sure that shahbaz is the main link in planning conspiring and execution of the bomb blasts
7936666 most indications are that gustav will be an extremely dangerous hurricane in the northwestern caribbean sea in a few days
7936667 i knew it was coming but i was hoping to be out before it came
7936668 routine base operations will continue through the day as normal assuming conditions warrant this while emergency preparations continue
7936669 the government orders the population to take precautions because this storm will bring a lot of rain
7936670 theres no rain and wind the sky is clear cars are traveling everywhere i dont think theres a hurricane
7936671 they cannot last a day longer if we as zimbabweans speak against them in deafening unison

7936676 the challenge there was to recreate an 80s dance club in this prestigious restaurant
7936677 no fue f cil convencerlo al gordo para que insistamos
7936678 if this convention is about the hillary forces and obama forces each analyzing each others actions endlessly ad infinitum theres no chance the democrats are going to do better than just get along where these two sides are really going to come together is over making the case against john mccain hes the clear and present danger
7936679 michelles speech was a home run emotional heartfelt and very authentic
7936680 michelles speech was good the family exchange at the end was fan friggin tastic that was really awesome more like that
7936681 i suspect the original goal of michelles speech was to help humanize her husband but she ended up going much further telling an amazing american story and one hopes erasing any doubts about her love of country
7936682 im about the least sentimental person i know but i choked up listening to michelle obamas speech even the republican talking heads cant find a bad word to say about her bill schneider is talking about this as the first speech of michelles future political career and the shout out to hillary was inspired all the folks who have been slagging her for the past four months are now looking like a bunch of liars the hostile entitled black nationalist theyve been describing was simply not in evidence
7936683 michelle obama is giving a beautifully delivered and smartly crafted speech shes also coming off as wholesome and frankly familiar she just brought the crowd to its feet with an emotionally delivered and that is why i love this country her inflection is soft and steady the end of every sentence drops in volume robbing it of aggression giving it a empathic almost quavering cadence shes really knocking it out of the park
7936684 the ads that mccain is running throughout the country attempt to paint barack obama is an ulta radical dangerous liberal whos secretly a commie muslim babykiller insertyoursmearhere tonight from michelles rousing speech to the obama children say ing hi to their dad to the countless anecdotes in between they all serve to introduce this family to america theres no better rebuttal to the mccain smears than to have the obamas speak directly to voters showing in their simplest of gestures like a smile to daddy on the big screen to the most stirring of speeches that this is an all american family that loves this country as much as they love each other
7936685 michelles speech was her attempt to trick people into believing shes not a radical elitist liberal with a dislike for her own country and it was good for what it was
7936686 michelle hit the ball out of the park i could not help thinking the speechwriter did a brilliant job given the task at hand which was to make a somewhat unpleasant maybe angry woman seem like a nicer version of the mom next door wherever you live if one did not know all that one knows about her her thoughts about the country her religious choices etc why youd want her to be your bff i would
7936687 michelle obama did not seem aggrieved entitled whiny extreme unpatriotic or even particularly liberal she didnt sound anything like the off the cuff michelle obama we have come to know the speech was well crafted to achieve its goals and she delivered it well
7936688 ms obamas make over was more extreme when it came to her account of her life we saw her growing up on the south side of chicago with her family including princeton basketball legend super craig robinson now the basketball coach at oregon state we saw her fleeing corporate america to serve her community and we saw her and barack with their small children we did not see her at the ivy league institutions where she spent seven years of her life four at princeton and three at harvard law school in tonights account she was merely able to go on to college nor of course do we learn just how well ms obama is doing financially by doing good in her community plainly ms obama wishes to be viewed as an ordinary american to the extent that her real biography is known or emerges over the course of the campaign some voters may conclude she was a bit phony tonight
7936689 michelle obama came out to thunderous applause and proceeded to begin talking about herself her family her mother her father her kids her job her leaving her job her hopes for the future her policy proposals her love for the country her her her sen obama the nominee was almost nowhere present in this speech except for when his wife was making it quite clear that he has a lot to live up to in her dad or when she was dragging him along for the ride on her litany of beliefs there were a lot of is and not nearly enough hes halfway through the speech one wondered just who is running for president michelle or barack
7936690 there was little to object to in last nights speech
7936691 other than pelosis less than convincing john mccain is wrong call and response do we have any plans to attack john mccain during this convention i havent heard any of it so far it would be a massive waste of an opportunity if we dont really open up on him in this election
7936692 if a glove was laid upon mccain and the republicans last night i did not see it
7936693 thought we had some great speeches tonight but i did not hear much about president bush or john mccain maybe this wasnt the night for it maybe this was kennedy and michelle obama but they need to go there i just need to know its coming and that even if mainly in the hands of surrogates it wont stop until election day paul begala its not about responding quickly to the attacks its about making mccain respond to democrats attacks
7936694 somewhat incredibly ive been watching the democratic convention for something like three hours now and i think claire mccaskill who just finished was the first speaker who actually took some time to make an argument against john mccain i understand that the theory of the day is that democrats want to introduce people to barack obama but it seems to me that viable political parties figure out how to walk and chew gum at the same time its hardly impossible to work a few digs at the other guy into a talk thats mostly about the virtues of your candidate
7936695 from my perspective claire mccaskill is knocking this out of the park rather than vague statements about how obama is like totally awesome shes saying mccain would be a bad president doesnt sound like much but no one else is doing it change as a message is meaningless without any argument about you know why we need it mccaskill unlike so many other people out there tonight is making that argument and arguing that mccain represents part of the problem not the solution its not an artful speech or particularly well delivered but it actually makes sense logically and that makes up for a lot
7936696 the notion that tonight should have been about ripping the bark off the president seems to me misplaced no one needs to be persuaded that the country is on the wrong track we have endured one of the worst presidencies in american history a stalling economy and a war that was as deceptively packaged as it was poorly executed the wrong track number is at 80 percent what was necessary tonight was rebutting the only real weapon the republicans have dragging obama into the mud throwing every extremist attack they can at him painting him as a commie alien anti american freak for good measure they had tried to paint michelle as an angry black radical they failed there was nothing more american than the way the obamas spoke of their story it made them more appealing to the white working class and the black working class it defused the smears
7936697 for those of us who were born in the combative blogosphere were pretty much happy with how the first night panned out why perhaps because being close to the ground we understand that the problem the obamas have is not that the country thinks things are peachy 80 percent of americans think the country is headed the wrong direction and bush and congressional republicans are getting the lions share of the blame its true that mccain is trying to use his maverick status to distance himself from his party but piercing that fabrication isnt the obamas biggest problem no the biggest problem they face is the b s about them not being real americans that he is foreign and muslim that she is an angry black radical that they dont look how a first family should look and so obamas team set out to diffuse those fears on the first night there are three more days of convention we dont have to beat up on republicans all four nights the anti gop case has already been made by bush and his enablers over the past eight years there are two tasks left to show american the obamas are well real americans and to tie mccain to the gop the former has now been accomplished i suspect today and tomorrow will handle the latter
7936698 if this is about the hillary forces and obama forces each analyzing each others actions endlessly ad infinitum theres no chance the democrats are going to do better than just get along where these two sides are really going to come together is over making the case against john mccain hes the clear and present danger
7936699 as you may recall several months ago it looked as if one of americas two major political parties was going to have a serious party unity problem their nominating contest produced a winner whod prevailed against divided opposition without ever proving himself to be a clear majority choice anywhere whats more the partys base was divided between a substantial element that strongly approved of the partys unpopular incumbent president and another substantial element that joined the majority of the public in disapproving of his job performance whats more the winner had a long history of personal and professional tensions with key stakeholders in his partys political movement and with leading party politicians
7936700 and yet these tensions were overcome and not overcome primarily by endless hand holding sessions in which the various aggrieved parties recited their complaints from one side of their mouth while talking of their admiration for each other out of the other side and they certainly werent overcome by speaking in more detail about a policy agenda rather though there was of course some hand holding unity was primarily achieved by shifting attention off the internally controversial subject of their nominee and his relationship to other party figures and on to the internally uncontroversial subject of how awful the other political party is whether there may be any lessons in this for any other political parties is something ill leave to readers to judge
7936701 it strikes me that republicans have every reason to feel good about the first night of the democrat convention its hard to tell what if anything was achieved in furtherance of making the case for barack obama who incidentally told the assemblage that he was in st louis when he was really in kansas city imagine if dan quayle or george w had made such a gaffe
7936702 overall this was a poorly organized bomb it gets a d grade and only michelle obama and ted kennedy saved it from being a complete and utter failure you want to know how bad it was even james carville and cnns david gergen were panning it why was it so bad let us count the ways my friends it was poorly organized had a lame group of speakers didnt hit any overriding themes didnt build barack up very much didnt fire up liberals didnt attack the gop it just did very little for the dems in any way shape or form beyond perhaps improving michelle obamas image a tad
7936703 the word on the street is total meltdown the clintons and their advisors arent even staying for the final speech bill clinton is openly whining about his speaking assignment and thats before joe biden stuffs most of his leg in his mouth
7936704 the intensely political city is being wracked by sectarian conflict that appears ready to devolve into out and out civil war with partisans on each side looking to destroy the other as they work to ensure the political supremacy of their respective leaders baghdad no denver i am sure that we will have the show of unity at the end of all of this but the question of whether a disgruntled group of clintonites decides to hold back and ultimately serves to deny barack obama the presidency is not a closed one
7936705 the clinton chatter is dominant the clintons will get two nights in denver hillary tuesday and bill wednesday the coverage on the cables so far this morning has been all about the clintons high profile clinton surrogates complaining about the lack of vp vetting with the rnc mccain capitalizing bill being upset about his speech topic hillary jerking her delegates around effectively telling them nevermind after making a show about the catharsis of the roll call a couple of weeks ago if the clintons really wanted to screw with obamas chances setting up hillary 2012 this would be the week to do it and this is what they seem to be doing
7936706 seriously i dont know how obama should handle the clintons you cant roll over for them but you cant stand up to them either this could get very interesting
7936707 sitting inside the pepsi center watching delegates dancing to the sounds of a funk band and screaming their heads off each time barack obamas name is mentioned its hard to believe that outside the cable news networks are talking obsessively about tensions between the obama and clinton camps its one thing to train your camera on the spectacle of puma protesters wearing clinton tee shirts adorned with mccain stickers many of whom are registered and lifelong republicans its another to imply that these folks somehow represent democratic delegates or are the theme of the convention itself
7936708 here on the ground in denver you would be hard pressed to find someone who is willing to vote for john mccain in the fall sure the place is teeming with people who voted for hillary but the general consenus here is that we need to get a democrat into the white house period that wont stop television reporters from flocking to the rare puma in the streets wearing a hillary or bust t shirt but the force of these individuals here at the convention isnt as compelling as the media make it out to be while pumas may think theyre here to roar for hillary only in the midst of all of this energy for obama and the democratic party puma whining is nothing more than a barely audible meow
7936709 ive been wandering around denver for a couple days now and havent seen any sign of the pumas the diehards who purport to support hillary but are really just a bunch of media hogs and losers from my vantage point here in denver it feels like the hype has been overblown chuck todd thinks so too the folks i know who supported hillary and a lot of them are here want a democrat to win in november
7936710 is there any chance that nbc news or cbs news or abc news or cnn or msnbc or fox news will give one tenth as much airtime to naral president nancy keenan s speech ongoing as i blog on the differences between the candidates on reproductive rights as they gave today to vague meta talk about what obama needs to do to win over hillary clintons supporters no and yet keenans speech if full of actual information noting that the supreme court is at an ideological tipping point and the next president will decide roe s fate i think well informed liberals and conservatives alike would basically agree with that but many voters dont seem to realize this watching keenan would leave viewers better informed than they were previously watching talking heads ponder the puma phenomenon accomplishes well i couldnt quite say what
7936711 pumas act like idiots and that is also a good thing self identified democratic concern trolls who are willing to trash the democratic party are a dime a dozen and the media will pick up on them whoever they are it is much better that our major concern trolls right now are idiotic pumas who have no idea who to influence voters then media savvy corporate funded pundits who could do real damage even the mccain campaign knows this because they arent throwing any money behind their ad featuring a puma these are the sorts of concern trolls that we want its the the new republic s of the world that are actually dangerous to progressives
7936712 theres no indication that mike huckabee is being considered so consider this idle speculation like the hillary chatter prior to obamas pick but wouldnt huckabee make a lot of sense given the things weve learned the last two weeks 1 mccain might have a wealth problem and certainly democrats are going to try to hit his wealth for all its worth in their play for working class voters huckabee doesnt have a problem on this front and has lots of working class cred 2 the pro choice trial balloon hasnt been well received and its clear that a pro choice nominee would create a major disruption huckabee is pro life 3 obama picked biden who is going to a vivid presence for better or worse on the stump and could be formidable in debate huckabee is a great campaigner and might be just the guy to puncture biden in a debate 4 this is a less important point the mccain folks have made a huge deal about differences between obama and biden during the primaries mccain and huckabee didnt have much in the way of differences and went out of their way to praise each other the other upsides are the press likes huckabee for now hes a different kind of republican and his selection would be such a shock it might even be considered bold the downsides are as ive noted many times before he doesnt have much in the way of national security credentials and has a big seriousness gap obviously not trifling matters but if mccain cant do ct sen joe lieberman and isnt thrilled by mn gov tim pawlenty or mitt romney huckabee might be worth a last minute second look

7936743 we found 38 per cent of mature men and 29 per cent of mature women were having sex more than once a week
7936744 thats a significant amount of older men and women having a lot of sex perhaps more than many of us suspected
7936745 these people are not frothy young singles out at the clubs having hot casual sex
7936746 theyre more likely to be at home with their loved one in front of the fire so in that respect its quite impressive
7936747 for a lot of these women their sex drive isnt like what they see on sex and the city or read about in romance novels so they think theres something wrong with them when its totally normal
7936748 so the pickings are particularly slim for women over the age of 40 compared with men

7936754 our pets seem to be eating better than their owners
7936755 i think giving a nice chunk of fish to a pet is important to satisfy the personal hedonistic needs of the owner not the nutritional need of the cat cats will be very happy to eat the offal from a trout
7936756 the liver donors are getting fatter and the problem there is the livers arent so good
7936757 once theres a certain amount of fat in the liver were reluctant to transplant because theres a high risk that its never going to work properly
7936758 we were not aware then that people with severe fatty infiltration of the liver when you took that liver cooled it down and transplanted it the liver just doesnt function
7936759 varias de las detenciones realizadas y grupos desarticulados tienen que ver con el trabajo de los fiscales de las polic as y tambi n de la inteligencia para los efectos de frenar stas organizaciones
7936760 puede mejorarse perfeccionarse pero sostener que no hay trabajo de inteligencia me parece una declaraci n bastante atrevida
7936761 deben ser muy cuidadosas y cr ticas cuando haya certezas que personas o grupos de personas est n por la v a violenta creo que los programas de gobierno tienen que cerrarse para esos grupos o personas
7936762 hay que dar una se al suficientemente clara pues aquel que est con la violencia no puede tener colaboraci n del gobierno a la hora de obtener alg n subsidio

7936769 never had a situation where you walk in and its an empty room
7936770 we stressed the importance of running through every scenario that they could think of and running over that scenario over and over again
7936771 its to savour the olympics that im taking part with pui pui
7936772 to be here and to take part in these outdoor events and to meet so many dogs and people makes pui pui very happy
7936773 we very much rely on his skills and his passion for bison track and field
7936774 its very much in line with the original strategy to fold much of the legacy hp services capability into the eds management framework
7936775 just enough people dont even understand the thing that it could pass

7936779 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience

7936783 i know hes not an evil man theres not evil in his heart
7936784 i know that i love him i know that much
7936785 were just not going to rush anything were gonna walk through the process however slowly it needs to happen in order for the healing and restoration to be complete and then well go from there
7936786 im actually seeking professional counselling myself i need to be able to unravel a lot of emotion thats bombarding me at the moment i owe it to myself to work through that properly and to him
7936787 i had questions after the shock of it all but my initial thoughts after hearing that were a sense of sorrow for the church and that a lot of people were going to be hurt because of it
7936788 i was the first one he told he confessed everything to me
7936789 he just went through it where it had started everything in his life as a young kid the patterns he was crying sobbing actually absolutely sobbing he just said i dont have cancer
7936790 he was terrified i still remember the look on his face it was a very hard moment for him as it was for me hearing it
7936791 i could just see a really broken unwell man at that point i found it really quite hard to get angry
7936792 seeing your husband of seven years absolutely sobbing in front of you risking everything coming forward and telling the truth in that instance it was really hard to be angry or mad
7936793 i never questioned it when you love someone you trust them i had no reason not to trust him
7936794 perhaps i feel a little bit foolish in this hindsights a fabulous thing but im trying not to beat myself up
7936795 in the middle of the night he was in so much pain i would put towels in the microwave to try and give him some relief in his back
7936796 before i stopped working to care for him i was busy hed have doctors appointments when i couldnt be there and he would say its fine you dont need to be there
7936797 or i would just drop him off at the hospital
7936798 were only talking two weeks since admitting his lies theres a lot of stuff to deal with
7936799 that sort of side of things hasnt really hit me yet theres many levels and layers to everything i can almost talk about it like im removed from it thats where the professional help will help me work through that it hasnt hit me yet
7936800 the board considered that while this advertisement does not sexualise children it brings the issue of sex before them
7936801 the board noted that debate within the community about the sexualisation of children has crystallised community concern about the unsolicited exposure of children to advertisements dealing with sexuality
7936802 we need to be direct in our advertising because weve found men dont respond to the message otherwise
7936803 last year the word sex was ok today its not
7936804 im a true believer that if you dont look ahead at new things you miss opportunities
7936805 my previous business was a vertical mail business in china and i came across a lot of neat products and found out through that about this new process of weaving bamboo fibers into clothing
7936806 the first thing i saw was the attention being given to eco friendly products and that got my attention from a business standpoint
7936807 the industry includes organic fibers like cotton soy hemp and bamboo
7936808 when i saw the performance the idea came to us to create a line of clothing to go into high end boutiques like tommy bahama and tori richard but i didnt know the first thing about designing clothing
7936809 i worked in the industry and had my own business for six years designing childrens clothing
7936810 but i wanted to get back into the adult industry and this job said bamboo clothing line designer wanted so i sent my information it blossomed from there
7936811 i had worked with hemp but not bamboo and i do manufacturing in china
7936812 i havent been over there but bryans brother kyle has been over there working with this factory and determined their standards are of the utmost quality and we have insured they are following good labor practices
7936813 its highly sustainable doesnt need pesticides and is a renewable resource
7936814 but it has to be broken down to a pulp boiled into a fiber and the u s will only recognize it as rayon from bamboo they wont let us put only bamboo on the label
7936815 we carry bamboo products in the store socks and other items
7936816 but some people making bamboo clothing and thinking they are using this great resource but are using dye and dye fixing agents they are targeting the green consumer but unless the consumer looks into it they might not really be buying a green product
7936817 the research and development marketing and initial product line of 16 items with color choices and four sizes of each gives us 156 bar codes
7936818 to launch the wholesale line a 10 month project cost between 600 000 and 700 000
7936819 i dont necessarily feel like we need to sweep them but i feel like we need to win the series i really feel like we cant afford to lose any more series this year

7936821 the chip is savory and fatty but still mild flavored and the acidity in the champagne cuts through all that and more it also seems that the salt in the chips is enhancing the flavors in the wine like salt does to a properly salted dish
7936822 after it sat in my glass and opened up i could taste the creaminess of the prosecco my downfull is buttery creamy in white wines with these chips at that sparkling the flavors in the wine and food enhanced each other
7936823 ah good question do sparklings and potato chips go well together well i overheard sparkling wine advocate mike werther talk about champagne and chips so i think i can propagate upon our earlier discussion the acidity in champagne matches really nicely with the saltiness in chips i prefer grand cru blanc de blanc amp plain old basic lays with a rose or darker saignee you can do the black pepper kettle chips in indian food classic curries have been known to be fantastic pairings with your favorite blanc de noir by the way ive also heard that there is a direct correlation between iqs overall happiness and the amount of sparkling wine you consume
7936824 my favorite thing to drink with our sorelle branca prosecco is anchovies with frito miso i probably wouldnt put out chips to go with champagne but chips do go with everything my favorite champagne pairing is smoked salmon with cavair or brillecart brut with oysters
7936825 my favorite sparkling that we sampled with the chips tonight was the raventos blanc cava reserve it had sufficent fruit and umptiousness to not be too acidic with the chips because it had far less acid that other wines present the pairing was quite pleasurable
7936826 the winner of the sparkling wine and chip pairing was the a margaine champagne rose of pinot noir for me nothing else clung together either because the chips were too fatty or something else got in the way of the match

7936829 a year ago i dont think anyone would have predicted minnesota could achieve a trifecta of fuel conservation increased use of mass transit and increased sales of cleaner burning alternative fuels in the middle of what has historically been the peak driving season
7936830 since vehicle exhaust is the single largest source of air pollution in minnesota the positive impact of these three elements coming together cant help but improve air quality this summer
7936831 we will attempt to recreate what we had for 20 years over in soho

7936835 the six year pattern of sexual abuse of the girl began when the child was 8 years old and culminated in frequent sexual intercourse beginning at age 12
7936836 we rely on everyone in our community including employers to detect and report suspected child pornography
7936837 without the vigilance of ecoquest the prompt investigation by the greeneville police department and the forensic assistance provided by the icac task force grice would continue to victimize this child

7936840 the crucial link in the chain for getting the best performance from the patriot viper pc3 16000 2gb memory kit is whether or not your motherboard and processor can handle front side bus increases if your nvidia or intel chipset based motherboard cant give you something upwards of at least 1600 mhz fsb then you wont really be tapping in to the bulk of the memorys potential nvidia 790i users can at least expect great things from the bios memory and cpu bus link option a quick change to a memory setting or two and youre running at 2000 mhz but again youll get much better results if you at least tap in to your processors 1600 mhz fsb potential
7936841 today i will be looking at one of sapphires latest video cards the radeon hd 4850 toxic a 512mb ddr3 factory overclocked version of the hd 4850 this card comes complete with ramsinks the first i have had on a video card that i didnt install myself and a zalman heatpipe cooler will the hd 4850 impress me as much at the hd 3850 did how will it fare against the cards i plan to compare it to read on to see

7936844 its hard to believe that late last week we broke 10 000 news posts here at tweaktown we are actually probably quite a bit higher than that as some of the very old and original news posts were not converted over to a new site design many years ago we hit up our friends at msi gigabyte and kingston and got some goodies for you to celebrate our 10 000th news post hang on shouldnt we be getting the free stuff and not you guys oh well
7936845 it was only going to be a matter of time till asus strapped some mean clocks onto the gtx 280 and put it under its top naming scheme well that day has come and its time to see what happens when the gtx 280 gets for the most part an unnecessary but much loved speed bump the tumbling gtx 280 prices over the past few weeks make the card more and more affordable for people wanting to get a top gaming experience while we all know that for the most part the new amd hd 4870 x2 is the faster single card on the market nvidia still hold the crown of the fastest single cored card
7936846 today for review ive got a very small solution to that problem from our friends at usbfever its called the worlds slimmest usb bluetooth dongle and while im not sure if its the worlds slimmest it is very very small about the size of a quarter so it will fit anywhere and you wont have some ugly big usb dongle sticking out of your computer to enable bt functionality
7936847 back in june we had looked at the super micro c2sbx motherboard which was a workstation motherboard oriented around the intel x48 chipset this was our first time reviewing a super micro product at phoronix but from the success of the c2sbx we decided to look at another one of their motherboards this time around we have our hands on the super micro c2sea which is a desktop motherboard that uses the intel g45 chipset and provides integrated gma x4500 hd graphics

7936849 since the beginning of times intel cpus use an external bus called front side bus or simply fsb that is shared between memory and i o requests the next generation of intel cpus will have an embedded memory controller and thus will provide two external busses a memory bus for connecting the cpu to the memory and an i o bus to connect the cpu to the external world this bus is a new bus called quickpath interconnect qpi and in this tutorial we will be explaining how it works

7936852 a funny thing has happened to cpus their not as hot as they used to be in some cases intel core 2 duo processors are pushing out as little as 65w while some celeron chips output just 35w of heat its quite a change from the long standing belief that newer processors will always output more heat glacialtechs igloo 5058 light e heatsink stands a squat 55mm tall and comes with a fixed speed 80mm fan that rotates at a quiet 2600rpm weighing in at a feather 263grams the igloo 5058 is compatible with intel socket 775 cpus outputting 95w heat or less
7936853 samsung has always been pretty impressive with its lcd panels both in terms of computer monitors and high definition televisions the spec sheets on these samsung lcds are always at the top of the class but sometimes having an impressive spec sheet isnt good enough these days you need to be more than just a good lcd it seems and thats why so lcd monitors now come equipped with all sorts of secondary functions recognizing that you need to have these extra features to compete in the home computer market samsung has created a family of lcd monitors that do more than just show you a pretty pictu re the samsung syncmaster 2263uw is one such unit it has been designed largely as an all in one solution helping you save some of that precious real estate on your shrinking desk
7936854 the three fans equipping it perform well they could have been spinning a bit faster but noise would have increased they are incredibly quiet at their speed and they still beat a faster fan setup like in the thermaltake xaser vi vh9000bws but there is also a small problem having a third fan on the side this one leaves little room for larger heatsinks such as my xigmatek hdt s1283 cpu cooler i have to force a bit to get the panel closed therefore pushing on the motherboard however if you plan on watercooling you wont have any problems the guardian 921 even allows you to pass tubing to an external radiator by two holes at the back especially made for that purpose moreover a great feature which adds to both watercooling and air cooling setups is the temperature reader with three probes you can stay aware of any temperatures simply by looking at the lcd in front of the case

7936856 when western digital launched their first 10 000 rpm consumer desktop drive enthusiasts quickly took note now in its fourth generation the western digital raptor series is still unchallenged and dominates the enthusiast and performance user markets 10 000 and even 15 000 rpm hard drives started long before the raptor series but have been exclusively built for workstation and server environments utilizing scsi and its successor sas connectivity sata and later sata ii bridged the gap between consumer ata and scsi standards and arguably the biggest performance gains came from native command queuing but the raptor series did not utilize this technology not until now

7936858 overall the ocz elixir is a solid keyboard at a very good price 30 retail the minor layout issues we had were just that minor nitpicks were very picky about our keyboards compared with most keyboards 30 is about average though the elixir is anything but average with the plethora of additional functionality provided true it may not have the same level of features as the logitech g15 but its also far cheaper for those that dont feel like paying too much for a keyboard the ocz elixir is a solid buy

7936870 happily slipknot can pull in these directions and still maintain a new standard of bone crunching intensity there are louder metal bands in the world for sure but the iowan nine piece continue to make the most noise
7936871 sure theres some navel gazing the power ballad snuff one of several tracks that continue vol 3s move into more melodic drama tackles a personal trauma that taylor cant bring himself to name but hopes fiercest tunes the bludgeoning math rocky butchers hook and the sludgy atonal gehenna find slipknots usual self loathing and internal hostility becoming even heavier and more powerful when its turned outward
7936872 the groups development makes a lot of sense because the members simply cant target the rebellious high school freshman demographic forever in the end this album is definitely a step in the right direction for the band members but they havent quite grown up yet
7936873 in that sense the slyest thing about this project is the way its sound and vision argue against the albums title from the instrumental arrangements to the layered levels of meaning in the lyrics slipknot vol 4 comes across as smarter deeper and tougher than ever and if thats not a cause for hope we dont know what is

7936949 we should also point out that the word pedophile is spelled wrong the two times that its used in this comic book

7936961 media outlets reported allegations biden plagiarized kinnock but not that he had previously credited him
7936962 quit the 1988 presidential race in the face of accusations that he had plagiarized part of a speech from neil kinnock the british labor party leader at the time
7936963 shortly afterward he was found to have suffered two aneurysms
7936964 biden also will have his 1988 presidential campaign and the charges of plagiarism that drove him from the race resurrected at least in these opening days as he is introduced as obamas running mate but that experience is long in the past and probably does not present a significant problem

7936986 the obama campaign knows it cant argue the facts of the link between obama and ayers so it is instead resorting to a desperate campaign of intimidation and legal threats
7936987 the scary question this raises is if barack obama demonstrates this little regard for free speech from his opponents during the campaign what could the american people expect from him as a president
7936988 the tremendous amount of time money and effort the campaign is expending to run its own ads on the ayers controversy and dispatch its hired guns all over the country during the democratic convention speaks to the fear they must have that this issue is resonating with american voters
7936989 the warfare began aug 7 when georgia launched a barrage targeting south ossetia
7936990 are going to be bored because im going to give some back story that you know better than i do
7936991 a key tool that the soviet union used to keep its empire together
7936992 they tried that in a number of countries they tried it in the baltic states but the fuses were defused nothing much happened they tried it in ukraine it has not happened yet but its getting hotter they tried it in moldova there it worked and now we have transnitria they tried it in armenia and azerbaijan and it went beyond their wildest dreams and we ended up with a massive massive war and they tried it in two territories in georgia which ill talk about in a minute they didnt try it in central asia because basically all the presidents of the newly independent countries were the former heads of the communist parties and they said were still following your line kremlin we havent changed very much
7936993 now the story starts really in 1992 when this fuse was lit in georgia
7936994 now theres two territories theres abkhazia which has clearly defined administrative borders and theres south ossetia that doesnt before the troubles started abkhazia was an extremely ethnically mixed area about 60 percent georgian 20 percent abkhaz and 20 percent assorted others greeks estonians armenians jews what have you in ossetia it was a completely integrated and completely mixed ossetian georgian population the ossetians and the georgians have never been apart in the sense that they were living in their own little villages and doing their own little things there has been inter marriage and a sense of common understanding going back to distant history the georgians will tell you about king tamar thats a woman but they called her a king and she was married to an ossetian so the fuse was lit and two wars start one in abkhazia and one in south ossetia
7936995 it was also lit in tbilisi there was a guy in charge here zviad gamsakhurdia a little bit like serbian nationalist war criminal in bosnia radovan karadzic he was a poet he was an intellectual but he was one of these guys who veered off into ethnic exclusivism he made stupid declarations like georgia is only for the georgians if youre running a multi ethnic country that is really not a clever thing to say the central control of the state was extremely weak the russians were trying to make things worse there was a civil war between georgians and tbilisi but they key thing is that here there were militias georgian militias and some of them pretty nasty
7936996 this guy zviad gamsakhurdia was driven from power from across the street they bombed this place
7936997 theres a horrible picture in my georgia book of this facade
7936998 of course he led the government in exile until he came back in 1993 then died obscurely in the mountains of suicide some people say others say cancer then he was buried in grozny
7936999 things here explode and basically it gets pretty nasty thomas can tell you what happened read his book
7937000 youve got two bits of abkhazia which are not ethnic abkhazia
7937001 the first thing that misha mikheil saakashvili did was try to poke his finger in russian president vladimir putins eyes as many times as possible
7937002 most notably by wanting to join nato the west in my view mishandled this situation america gave the wrong signals so did europe
7937003 but basically the encouragement was given despite stronger and stronger russian signals that a georgian accession to nato would not be tolerated
7937004 just a little bit of back story again in july of 2007 russia withdrew from the conventional forces treaty in europe
7937005 one provocation was to use the russian media to launch shrill accusations that the georgian army was in kodori preparing for an invasion of abkhazia now if you go up there i took a bunch of journalists up there a few times when you get to the actual checkpoint you have a wall of crumbling rock a wooden bridge another wall of crumbling rock a raging torrent and a steep mountainside filled with woods its not possible to invade out or invade in unless youve got air support which is why the abkhaz were never able to kick these georgians out they just kept that bit of territory
7937006 but this time im getting advice from an expert on how im doing
7937007 the next provocation on april 16 putin signs a presidential decree recognizing the documents of abkhazians and south ossetians in russia and vice versa
7937008 starting in mid july the russians launched the biggest military exercise in the north caucasus that theyve held since the chechnya war
7937009 on august 3 the head of the local administration says hes evacuating his civilians
7937010 on top of that for the last four years the russians have been dishing out passports to anyone who asks in those areas
7937011 so back to the 3rd of august kokoity announces women and children should leave as it later turned out he made all the civilians leave who were not fighting or did not have fighting capabilities on the same day irregulars ingush chechen ossetians and cossacks start coming in and spreading out into the countryside but dont do anything they just sit and wait on the 6th of august the shelling intensifies from ossetian positions and for the first time since the war finished in 1992 they are using 120mm guns
7937012 because of the peace agreement they had nobody was allowed to have guns bigger than 80mm okay so thats the formal start of the war it wasnt the attack on tskhinvali now stop me
7937013 all the reports ive read say saakashvili started the war
7937014 saakashvili is accused of starting this war on the 7th
7937015 but that sounds like complete bs to me if what you say is true
7937016 it must be stopped if not today then maybe tomorrow my troops were in our village avnevi on the 6th of august they blew up our troops four wheel drives our pickups they blew them up also in this village it was august 5th or 6th i cant remember they started bombing us with shells two soldiers died that day our peacekeepers the ossetians had a good position on the hill they could see all our positions and our villages and they started bombing they went to the top of the hill bombed us then went down we couldnt see who was shooting at us
7937017 but it started that day from that place when two georgians were killed
7937018 before they started bombing us they took all the civilians out of their villages
7937019 then they started damaging our villages houses a gas pipe roads yards they killed our animals they evacuated their villages then bombed our villages
7937020 but in another village i was fired upon on august 6th on the 5th of august they started shooting they blew up our peacekeeping trucks they put a bomb on the road and when they were driving they were blown up they also mined the roads used by civilians on the 6th of august they started bombing avnevi and at this time they took the civilians out of tskhinvali and sent them to north ossetia inside russia
7937021 they took the civilians kids women and put them on the bus and sent them to north ossetia
7937022 i was running away and the soldiers wounded me they robbed me and shot me in the leg with a kalashnikov i dont know if it was russians or ossetians they took my car took my gold chain and shot me
7937023 they didnt care if it was a house or a military camp
7937024 i saw it it was the russian military airplanes if they knew it was a georgian village they bombed all the houses many civilians were killed from this bombing
7937025 on the 6th while this is going on the integration minister who was until a few months ago an ngo guy and who believes in soft power things tried to go there and meet the separatist leadership
7937026 on the evening of the 7th the ossetians launch an all out barrage focused on georgian villages not on georgian positions
7937027 what they had in the area was peacekeeping stuff not stuff for fighting a war
7937028 the georgians will tell you that they estimate that these two actions together slowed the russian advance by 24 to 48 hours that is what the world considered to be mishas game and you know why the world considers that because here in south ossetia was the head of the peacekeeping troops he hasnt been in iraq hes a peace keeper what have they been told for the last four years they lived in a failed state then there was the rose revolution it wasnt perfect but damn now theres electricity theres jobs roads have been fixed and what the georgians have had drummed into them is that georgia is now a constitutional state a state of law and order and everybody here knows that ossetia is a gangsters smugglers paradise the whole world knows it but here they know it particularly well the peacekeepers had a military objective and the first rule of warfare when youre talking to the media is not to reveal to your enemy what youre going to do so they werent going to blather into a microphone and say well actually im trying to go through tskhinvali in order to stop the russians so what did he say instead im here to restore constitutional order in south ossetia and thats it with that georgia lost the propaganda war and the world believes saakashvili started it and the rest of the story you know
7937029 this is your first time to the lands of the former soviet union
7937030 may sound just like a rhetorical flourish with no echo in the american mindset what it means in the post soviet mindset is what boris yeltsin was doing in chechnya this was the stupidest phrase this guy possibly could have used thats why people want to lynch him
7937031 your presentation was deliciously comprehensive perhaps it was well ask our new friend michael too much information out of the gate to absorb
7937032 there are some details that i would chip in who are the ossetians and where do they live this is the question that has been lost in all of the static from this story this autonomy south ossetia is an autonomous district as opposed to an autonomous republic with about 60 000 people max so where are the rest of the ossetians guess where they live tbilisi here there everywhere there are more ossetians take a look around this lobby you will find ossetians here of those ossetians who are theoretically citizens of the republic of georgia 60 000 live there and around 40 000 live here
7937033 are they on the side of those who live in south ossetia
7937034 one of them is georgias minister of defense georgia is a multi ethnic republic and the whole point of the ossetian ethnic question is this south ossetia is part of georgia
7937035 everyone regardless of nationality even those who love georgia genuinely thought saakashvili started it
7937036 absolutely weve been trying to tell the world about this for months if you go back and look at the archives youll see plenty of calls from the georgian government saying theyre really worried even some russian commentators agree that this is exactly what happened dont forget they sent in a lot of irregulars chechens cossacks ossetians ingush basically thugs not normal chechens or ingush thugs thugs out for a holiday many western camera crews were robbed at gunpoint ten meters from russian tanks while russian commanders just stood there smoking their cigarettes while the irregulars that happened to a turkish tv crew theyre lucky to still be alive some of the georgians were picked up by the irregulars if they happened to be female they got raped if they happened to be male they got shot immediately sometimes tortured injured people we have in hospitals who managed to get out have had arms chopped off eyes gouged out and their tongues ripped out
7937037 you also have to remember the propaganda campaign that came out
7937038 human rights watch is accusing the russian authorities of being indirectly responsible for the massive ethnic cleansing of georgians that happened in south ossetia
7937039 that goes on a lot where i usually work in the middle east

7937058 from the time i can remember the olympics were it staying up until all hours and watching the olympians go for medals was something from a child that was a complete dream for me when i stepped into the position as an athlete to fulfill that dream as a player i thought that was the pinnacle and then here i am as the coach so its truly life long dreams for me
7937059 there was no more pressure on me than the pressure i put on myself
7937060 that was just extremely disappointing to be the leader of that team that came away with bronze and to know that we were better than that and could be better than that drove me every day since 2006
7937061 im not coaching the team any more so i can sleep at night now
7937062 there is so much more i think there is a lot of pressure i put on myself for this and there is just a tremendous amount of satisfaction to know the last three years there have been a lot of challenges so this is a great way to go out

7937108 and because small scale fisheries use less fuel to catch fish
7937109 small scale fisheries use fishing gear that are more selective and far less destructive to deep sea environments
7937110 as a result they discard very little unwanted fish and almost all of their catch is used for human consumption

7937112 market based initiatives while well intentioned unduly discriminate against small scale fishers for their lack of resources to provide data for certification
7937113 its an unfair disadvantage that in any other industry would have had people up in arms
7937114 but small scale fishers are often in developing countries and have very little political influence
7937115 without subsidies most large scale fishing operations will be economically unviable
7937116 small scale fishers will have a better chance of thriving in local markets and global fish stocks will have an opportunity to rebound

7937130 once again educational theorists in the late centuries of the last millennium found themselves thinking that they had to either work or play
7937131 one who has mastered the art of living simply pursues his vision of excellence at whatever he does leaving others to decide whether he is working or playing
7937132 work is thought of as something that you have to do while play is something you choose to do the distinction is more of an idea than a reality since both require physical and mental energy
7937133 the game is not competitive it is cooperative the game is for the players the software development team to help each other complete the software

7937145 id like to give you a piece of my mind
7937146 before you hire a company to build a house you would i expect insist on detailed plans showing what the finished structure was going to look like building a childs mind and character is what public schools do their justification for prematurely breaking family and neighborhood learning where is documentary evidence to prove this assumption that trained and certified professionals do it better than people who know and love them can there isnt any the cost in new york state for building a well schooled child in the year 2000 is 200 000 per body when lost interest is calculated that capital sum invested in the childs name over the past twelve years would have delivered a million dollars to each kid as a nest egg to compensate for having no school the original 200 000 is more than the average home in new york costs you wouldnt build a home without some idea what it would look like when finished but you are compelled to let a corps of perfect strangers tinker with your childs mind and personality without the foggiest idea what they want to do with it

7937151 but what you consider trading a first round draft pick you want somebody who can come in and make an immediate impact for you

7937155 i know there were rumors out there of her going to san antonio
7937156 that was sort of the talk over there in beijing her agent said thats not going to happen
7937157 its been a stretch to get her to come over for a max salary now were talking about a short period of time getting a visa people not having big dollars to throw at her to do it because most people are stretching their cap as it is i think that people looked into it obviously but when its all said and done it would have been real hard to do that
7937158 hopefully what were talking about is something that will not happen
7937159 if it does we wouldnt just say come back next year what we would do is work with them on where they fell short provide them the resources they need the tutoring and when we feel like they need to be evaluated again we would evaluate

7937162 that i was the ceo of a major company whose business had been interrupted in some locations by a true hurricane id want to record a message immediately with that status too to tell customers and employees which locations might be out which still functioning as someone who trains executives in crisis communications i can tell you that theres no way the written word can communicate what an effective spokesperson can communicate visually and aurally

7937167 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
7937168 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
7937169 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions

7937174 the overall goal of the tifrc is to reintegrate detainees with basic education and trade skills such that they can contribute to a peaceful and secure iraq
7937175 to rebuild people means contributing a very critical part of rebuilding the country
7937176 that is exactly what the tifrc is designed and constructed to do it plays an essential role in the reconciliation of useful citizens for a stronger iraq
7937177 permatang pauh has given a clear signal to the leadership of this country we demand change we want freedom we dont want to live with corruption and oppression

7937207 composed of several well matched interacting parts that contribute to the basic function wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning
7937208 it is not the case that the national banks year 2000 project the space shuttle software project an overtime food request project a promotion tracking project and a word processor software project should all run the same way they differ at least by the he number of people involved the criticality of the project and the project priorities
7937209 every person is different every project is different and each project differs internally across subject areas subsystems sub teams and time each situation calls for a different methodology set of group conventions
7937210 at regular intervals the team reflects on how to become more effective then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly
7937211 we started with a no process and added practices along the race when needed

7937523 a good monsoon has increased the moisture content in the air and this is primarily the reason behind growing discomfort among people
7937524 the monsoon is on a weak phase now and generally the humidity level goes up during this period the cloudy sky is also preventing moisture radiation leading to too much sweating
7937525 attention of the government has been invited to a report published in a section of the press regarding a purported notice given by the ministry of labour and employment to a firm namely huawei on the alleged violations of various labour and employment regulations of the country

7937539 the same plight was in store for abkhazia tbilisi had obviously planned a blitzkrieg that would have presented the world with a fait accompli
7937540 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us

7937551 i think a lot of modern game design is actually unethical especially massively multiplayer games like world of warcraft because they are predicated on player exploitation

7937581 if properly treated tuberculosis caused by drug susceptible strains is curable in virtually all cases if untreated the disease may be fatal within 5 years in more than half of cases
7937582 the world health organization who estimates that 1722 million are infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis
7937583 tuberculosis in cattle has been known even before classical times owing to its close resemblance with the disease in humans and the close relationships between the causative agents they were initially termed m tuberculosis typus bovinus and m tuberculosis typus humanus
7937584 before effective drugs were available 50 of patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis died within 2 years and only 25 were cured
7937585 there is no evidence to support the use of ada tests for the diagnosis of pulmonary tb however there is considerable evidence to support their use in pleural fluid samples for diagnosis of pleural tb where sensitivity was very high and to a slightly lesser extent for tb meningitis in both pleural tb and tb meningitis ada tests had higher sensitivity than any other tests
7937586 naat test accuracy to be far superior when applied to respiratory samples as opposed to other specimens although the results were not statistically significant the amtd test appears to perform better than other currently available commercial tests

7937610 its not all gory for me today as my teammate david paton was involved in the first lap crash he is ok and i hope the other guy involved will be ok
7937611 the crash was a get out of jail card for me because i jumped the start and would have incurred a penalty but at the restart i got away well and sat behind kennaugh through the first few corners and took the lead at mansfield when he made a mistake
7937612 i dropped my pace a little bit to try and conserve my tyres and then glen richards came past i just followed him and bided my time as i knew i could pass him at some stage i left it until the last lap and took him at park corner and kept him behind me to the chequered flag
7937613 after the wet german race the cool laguna seca weekend and the resurfaced brno we now move to misano which will hopefully be a more typical race weekend for everybody misano was anything but typical last year with extremely heavy rain that restricted track time on friday so i think we all hope for a fully dry weekend this year we had a good first trip to misano with casey winning the race and the top five riders all on our tyres however success is not automatically transferable from one season to the next and i am sure our rivals will be back in contention this weekend we carried out extensive tyre testing in the post race test at brno which will form the basis of our race preparations for the final six events of the year and which we hope will help keep bridgestone riders at the top of the championship by the end of the season
7937614 the character of the asphalt at misano is quite slippery and we suffered from quite bad graining over longer runs in the race so we have to accommodate for that this year by producing stronger tyres the circuit itself has been extended slightly for this years race with changes to the third corner which increase the overall lap slightly to 4 226km this should not have any real effect on tyre performance there are a lot of slow and tight corners and the main straight is also not too long so the focus will be on finding good braking stability and traction over the lap we will bring updated race specification tyres to misano with compound adjustments made to counter the demands of the track we also have new qualifying tyres for this weekend in a bid to get our riders as high up the grid as possible since overtaking is not particularly easy at misano

7937721 i have been campaigning for many years as councillor and then as mp for reform of the complicated leasehold laws which affect some 25 000 residents of brighton and hove living in flats
7937722 i welcomed the changes made by the labour government in 2002 making it easier for people to take over the management of their blocks ending what was often years of shoddy and costly service by managing agents
7937723 the reforms also enabled leaseholders of some blocks in our area to buy the freehold as well
7937724 but over the last couple of years it has become clear that there are still obstacles to be overcome which are unfair to leaseholders
7937725 i have been contacted by local residents groups and i have consulted the brighton and hove leaseholders association as well as meeting with local solicitors who have represented leaseholders i have also been contacted by the eastbourne based english leasehold reform association
7937726 one big problem is because of the need to calculate what is known as marriage value when deciding the cost to the leaseholder of buying the freehold the decisions in two lands tribunal cases have significantly increased costs for leaseholders trying to buy their freeholds by between 50 and 300
7937727 one of these known as the sportelli judgement was in london the other involved coniston court in hove

7937794 the warfare began aug 7 when georgia launched a barrage targeting south ossetia
7937795 are going to be bored because im going to give some back story that you know better than i do
7937796 a key tool that the soviet union used to keep its empire together
7937797 they tried that in a number of countries they tried it in the baltic states but the fuses were defused nothing much happened they tried it in ukraine it has not happened yet but its getting hotter they tried it in moldova there it worked and now we have transnitria they tried it in armenia and azerbaijan and it went beyond their wildest dreams and we ended up with a massive massive war and they tried it in two territories in georgia which ill talk about in a minute they didnt try it in central asia because basically all the presidents of the newly independent countries were the former heads of the communist parties and they said were still following your line kremlin we havent changed very much
7937798 now the story starts really in 1992 when this fuse was lit in georgia
7937799 now theres two territories theres abkhazia which has clearly defined administrative borders and theres south ossetia that doesnt before the troubles started abkhazia was an extremely ethnically mixed area about 60 percent georgian 20 percent abkhaz and 20 percent assorted others greeks estonians armenians jews what have you in ossetia it was a completely integrated and completely mixed ossetian georgian population the ossetians and the georgians have never been apart in the sense that they were living in their own little villages and doing their own little things there has been inter marriage and a sense of common understanding going back to distant history the georgians will tell you about king tamar thats a woman but they called her a king and she was married to an ossetian so the fuse was lit and two wars start one in abkhazia and one in south ossetia
7937800 it was also lit in tbilisi there was a guy in charge here zviad gamsakhurdia a little bit like serbian nationalist war criminal in bosnia radovan karadzic he was a poet he was an intellectual but he was one of these guys who veered off into ethnic exclusivism he made stupid declarations like georgia is only for the georgians if youre running a multi ethnic country that is really not a clever thing to say the central control of the state was extremely weak the russians were trying to make things worse there was a civil war between georgians and tbilisi but they key thing is that here there were militias georgian militias and some of them pretty nasty
7937801 this guy zviad gamsakhurdia was driven from power from across the street they bombed this place
7937802 theres a horrible picture in my georgia book of this facade
7937803 of course he led the government in exile until he came back in 1993 then died obscurely in the mountains of suicide some people say others say cancer then he was buried in grozny
7937804 youve got two bits of abkhazia which are not ethnic abkhazia
7937805 the first thing that misha mikheil saakashvili did was try to poke his finger in russian president vladimir putins eyes as many times as possible
7937806 most notably by wanting to join nato the west in my view mishandled this situation america gave the wrong signals so did europe
7937807 but basically the encouragement was given despite stronger and stronger russian signals that a georgian accession to nato would not be tolerated
7937808 just a little bit of back story again in july of 2007 russia withdrew from the conventional forces treaty in europe
7937809 one provocation was to use the russian media to launch shrill accusations that the georgian army was in kodori preparing for an invasion of abkhazia now if you go up there i took a bunch of journalists up there a few times when you get to the actual checkpoint you have a wall of crumbling rock a wooden bridge another wall of crumbling rock a raging torrent and a steep mountainside filled with woods its not possible to invade out or invade in unless youve got air support which is why the abkhaz were never able to kick these georgians out they just kept that bit of territory
7937810 but this time im getting advice from an expert on how im doing
7937811 the next provocation on april 16 putin signs a presidential decree recognizing the documents of abkhazians and south ossetians in russia and vice versa
7937812 starting in mid july the russians launched the biggest military exercise in the north caucasus that theyve held since the chechnya war
7937813 on august 3 the head of the local administration says hes evacuating his civilians
7937814 on top of that for the last four years the russians have been dishing out passports to anyone who asks in those areas
7937815 so back to the 3rd of august kokoity announces women and children should leave as it later turned out he made all the civilians leave who were not fighting or did not have fighting capabilities on the same day irregulars ingush chechen ossetians and cossacks start coming in and spreading out into the countryside but dont do anything they just sit and wait on the 6th of august the shelling intensifies from ossetian positions and for the first time since the war finished in 1992 they are using 120mm guns
7937816 because of the peace agreement they had nobody was allowed to have guns bigger than 80mm okay so thats the formal start of the war it wasnt the attack on tskhinvali now stop me
7937817 all the reports ive read say saakashvili started the war
7937818 saakashvili is accused of starting this war on the 7th
7937819 but that sounds like complete bs to me if what you say is true
7937820 it must be stopped if not today then maybe tomorrow my troops were in our village avnevi on the 6th of august they blew up our troops four wheel drives our pickups they blew them up also in this village it was august 5th or 6th i cant remember they started bombing us with shells two soldiers died that day our peacekeepers the ossetians had a good position on the hill they could see all our positions and our villages and they started bombing they went to the top of the hill bombed us then went down we couldnt see who was shooting at us
7937821 but it started that day from that place when two georgians were killed
7937822 before they started bombing us they took all the civilians out of their villages
7937823 then they started damaging our villages houses a gas pipe roads yards they killed our animals they evacuated their villages then bombed our villages
7937824 but in another village i was fired upon on august 6th on the 5th of august they started shooting they blew up our peacekeeping trucks they put a bomb on the road and when they were driving they were blown up they also mined the roads used by civilians on the 6th of august they started bombing avnevi and at this time they took the civilians out of tskhinvali and sent them to north ossetia inside russia
7937825 they took the civilians kids women and put them on the bus and sent them to north ossetia
7937826 i was running away and the soldiers wounded me they robbed me and shot me in the leg with a kalashnikov i dont know if it was russians or ossetians they took my car took my gold chain and shot me
7937827 they didnt care if it was a house or a military camp
7937828 i saw it it was the russian military airplanes if they knew it was a georgian village they bombed all the houses many civilians were killed from this bombing
7937829 on the 6th while this is going on the integration minister who was until a few months ago an ngo guy and who believes in soft power things tried to go there and meet the separatist leadership
7937830 on the evening of the 7th the ossetians launch an all out barrage focused on georgian villages not on georgian positions
7937831 what they had in the area was peacekeeping stuff not stuff for fighting a war
7937832 the georgians will tell you that they estimate that these two actions together slowed the russian advance by 24 to 48 hours that is what the world considered to be mishas game and you know why the world considers that because here in south ossetia was the head of the peacekeeping troops he hasnt been in iraq hes a peace keeper what have they been told for the last four years they lived in a failed state then there was the rose revolution it wasnt perfect but damn now theres electricity theres jobs roads have been fixed and what the georgians have had drummed into them is that georgia is now a constitutional state a state of law and order and everybody here knows that ossetia is a gangsters smugglers paradise the whole world knows it but here they know it particularly well the peacekeepers had a military objective and the first rule of warfare when youre talking to the media is not to reveal to your enemy what youre going to do so they werent going to blather into a microphone and say well actually im trying to go through tskhinvali in order to stop the russians so what did he say instead im here to restore constitutional order in south ossetia and thats it with that georgia lost the propaganda war and the world believes saakashvili started it and the rest of the story you know
7937833 this is your first time to the lands of the former soviet union
7937834 may sound just like a rhetorical flourish with no echo in the american mindset what it means in the post soviet mindset is what boris yeltsin was doing in chechnya this was the stupidest phrase this guy possibly could have used thats why people want to lynch him
7937835 your presentation was deliciously comprehensive perhaps it was well ask our new friend michael too much information out of the gate to absorb
7937836 there are some details that i would chip in who are the ossetians and where do they live this is the question that has been lost in all of the static from this story this autonomy south ossetia is an autonomous district as opposed to an autonomous republic with about 60 000 people max so where are the rest of the ossetians guess where they live tbilisi here there everywhere there are more ossetians take a look around this lobby you will find ossetians here of those ossetians who are theoretically citizens of the republic of georgia 60 000 live there and around 40 000 live here
7937837 are they on the side of those who live in south ossetia
7937838 one of them is georgias minister of defense georgia is a multi ethnic republic and the whole point of the ossetian ethnic question is this south ossetia is part of georgia
7937839 everyone regardless of nationality even those who love georgia genuinely thought saakashvili started it
7937840 absolutely weve been trying to tell the world about this for months if you go back and look at the archives youll see plenty of calls from the georgian government saying theyre really worried even some russian commentators agree that this is exactly what happened dont forget they sent in a lot of irregulars chechens cossacks ossetians ingush basically thugs not normal chechens or ingush thugs thugs out for a holiday many western camera crews were robbed at gunpoint ten meters from russian tanks while russian commanders just stood there smoking their cigarettes while the irregulars that happened to a turkish tv crew theyre lucky to still be alive some of the georgians were picked up by the irregulars if they happened to be female they got raped if they happened to be male they got shot immediately sometimes tortured injured people we have in hospitals who managed to get out have had arms chopped off eyes gouged out and their tongues ripped out
7937841 you also have to remember the propaganda campaign that came out
7937842 human rights watch is accusing the russian authorities of being indirectly responsible for the massive ethnic cleansing of georgians that happened in south ossetia
7937843 that goes on a lot where i usually work in the middle east
7937844 little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism but peace easy taxes and a tolerable administration of justice all the rest being brought about by the natural course of things
7937845 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
7937846 any fool can criticize condemn and complain and most fools do
7937847 the state is that great fiction by which everyone tries to live at the expense of everyone else
7937848 when somebody persuades me that i am wrong i change my mind what do you do
7937849 whatever it is that government does sensible americans would prefer that the government do it to someone else this is the idea behind foreign policy
7937850 nothing astonishes men so much as common sense and plain dealing
7937851 never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity
7937852 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with inherent and inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governme walt whitman

7937890 i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together over this period of time

7937913 we also need to know if the hospital should have been put into lockdown earlier than was actually done
7937914 my understanding is that dunedin hospital are carrying out their own incident review
7937915 until that process is complete it would seem premature to call for a full ministerial inquiry if mr ryall would like to raise issues of wrongdoing or failure by dunedin hospital i suggest he does so
7937916 hes mr cunliffes missed the point completely hes a nitwit
7937917 an internal review is enough for dunedin but its not enough fort he rest of the health system
7937918 the fact that mr cunliffe would not want someone to come in makes me worry hes trying to cover up
7937919 its probably the biggest one weve been challenged with for a few years
7937920 i cant get across to the government the gravity of the situation
7937921 ninety nine percent of the time they get it right to call us out or not
7937922 the money you can get from each hectare can out perform that of other crop
7937923 its about making choices for the land the land may not be suitable for sheep or beef but may be suitable for hemp
7937924 we are totally in control of this stock giving us a great chance to develop the industry
7937925 other hemp growers in new zealand have to go through all the dramas of importing hemp seeds and arent in control
7937926 lit sticks of incense strummed their guitars and read another chapter of siddhartha then stepped off the bus to help push the decrepit vehicle over the hind
7937927 all of those involved in committing this crime should be punished for this crime on a young innocent 16 year old boy
7937928 as soon as i saw them hanging around outside i knew those boys would cause trouble whenever they turn up trouble soon follows
7937929 i asked them to leave then noticed a police car pull up outside so i went over and spoke to the officers i asked them to keep an eye on the boys and they said they would then left
7937930 less than an hour later mohammed who was like a brother to everyone here had been beaten to death
7937931 i called my parents yesterday and they have told me not to go out
7937932 mohammed i believe was trying to make his way away from the incident and during the course of the incident he has fallen and struck his head on the pavement sustaining serious head injuries
7937933 clearly much of the investigation will seek to establish to what extent race played a part in what happened to young mohammed
7937934 mohammed was a young student who was loved by his family friends and teachers
7937935 he was a charming loving boy and there is nothing that can replace our loss

7937945 quando estourou a guerra em 1941 meu irm o mais velho yacha logo no dia 23 de julho foi para a frente de batalha juntamente com sua bateria e seus colegas de turma da academia
7937946 a filhinha de yacha fica por enquanto contigo e vamos ter que esclarecer tudo isso pois sua esposa pelo visto pessoa desonesta
7937947 os alem es propuseram trocar yacha por um dos seus que pensam eles que vou pechinchar com eles na guerra como na guerra
7937948 yacha foi fuzilado pelos alem es recebi carta de um oficial belga um pr ncipe qualquer dando p sames ele foi testemunha os americanos libertaram todos eles
7937949 i really love the heat it helps me a lot and ive got a special ice jacket from the academy of sport to wear on the field so i dont overheat
7937950 i would love to see more young disabled people get into sport or anything really
7937951 i would say school is probably the best chance that youll ever get thats where you get the opportunity to get into sport after school its a lot harder to get into
7937952 by law they have to be at school until theyre 16 years old
7937953 this has caused enormous disruptions to dairy farmers at the start of the new dairy season
7937954 we can take someone off the streets here and teach them to milk cows in five minutes
7937955 if this man had milked 10 cows for the past two years then thats all that would have been required
7937956 inflation will be rampant for the next three to four years
7937957 it only takes the cost of putting it in the ground
7937958 people sometimes think its too hard or they cant grow enough which is not true
7937959 its nice to have the choice of growing your own vegetables because it costs less its much better for you and it tastes better
7937960 its typical of the government where they have gone berserk with this sort of stuff
7937961 its not a feminist takeover its a lesbian takeover in wellington
7937962 theres hardly a government head thats not a lesbian so many lesbians are in top jobs and they dont want to acknowledge any sex its a neutralisation of sex instead of saying foreman or forewoman
7937963 we just hope for a fine day and a generous public
7937964 no tememos una nueva guerra fr a occidente entender nuestras motivaciones

7937968 teniendo en cuenta la libre expresi n de la voluntad de los pueblos oseta y abjaso he firmado los decretos sobre el reconocimiento por la federaci n de rusia de la independencia de osetia del sur y de la independencia de abjasia
7937969 no ha sido una opci n f cil pero es la nica posibilidad de garantizar la vida de la gente
7937970 a n me recuerdo las malas cr ticas de las bibicletas son para el verano
7937971 never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake
7937972 he firmado los decretos de reconocimiento de la independencia de osetia del sur y de abjasia por parte de rusia
7937973 rusia llama a los otros estados a seguir su ejemplo
7937974 tomando en cuenta la voluntad de los pueblos de osetia del sur y de abjasia expresada libremente
7937975 no es una elecci n f cil pero es la nica para preservar la vida de la gente

7937982 income has fallen from 2006 level for lower 60 of households
7937983 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
7937984 good politicians like good scientists draw conclusions from facts bad politicians like bad scientists draw facts from conclusions
7937985 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
7937986 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals
7937987 it is time for archaeologists to start searching for other reasons why neanderthals became extinct while our ancestors survived
7937988 it is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit
7937989 the carriers and aircell have taken a position on this because we dont want people talking on the plane
7937990 it is against americans policy and gogos terms of service to use voip aircell has multiple protocols and practices in place to prevent the use of voip obviously it is extremely difficult to stop every instance of voip but aircell is monitoring and working constantly to enforce americans policy and gogos terms of service
7937991 we are doing our best to make voip services unusable
7937992 i know what its like to be the only kid in the hospital ward and to have lots of operations
7937993 i just thought i could talk to jesse and maybe help him out
7937994 it is a tribute to him that when i first saw him he was in a wheelchair and the last time he walked in
7937995 they have been warm cored systems and the intensity of the rainfall has been due to the majority of air coming down from the north where air is warmer and moister
7937996 but you just cant tie this type of storminess to climate change in that way you cant necessarily say its the beginning of any kind of trend youd need more years
7937997 there is increasing evidence that the earth has not warmed as substantially in the last decade as perhaps was anticipated and also increasing evidence there may be other factors at play in temperature changes across the globe not just carbon dioxide
7937998 if you listen to those scientists that have researched those solar cycles the input of the suns energy the suggestion is we are at the beginning of a period of significantly colder temperatures and that could last for several decades if not this century
7937999 if you accept that view you could say this winter is the first of significantly colder ones this country has to get used to we are so used to looking for trends of increasing warmth that we could be missing increasing coldness
7938000 they arent necessarily different sides of the same coin we could still see warm summers and yet our winters may get colder
7938001 its a really interesting question but you cant really say looking at it in one year is definitely climate change
7938002 but what we have seen in the last couple of months is consistent with the idea of what were saying about climate change that when you have a storm theres more moisture so it rains harder theres more risk of landslides flooding coastal inundation
7938003 the indication is therell be fewer storms in the future but when they come theyll be bigger
7938004 there have been plenty of decades in the last century where there hasnt been warming but the trend is upwards
7938005 by the end of this decade temperatures may be on the rise again
7938006 we have talked about it a bit and said in our collective memory can we recall a collection of events quite like this one doesnt readily come to mind
7938007 the end of july in particular was especially notable august hasnt been perhaps quite so busy
7938008 if a forecaster comes on shift at the beginning of an event it probably does last three or four days on average and they are definitely tired at the end of four days it has tested the office
7938009 i am proud of them they have done a really good job this winter
7938010 our memories are pretty dodgy though some of us have been joking about the weather map for the weekend saying the anticyclones of spring are coming
7938011 we finally know what the big faults between wellington and blenheim are doing
7938012 by combining the sea floor imagery with other data we have been able to get a much more accurate idea of the location size and history of faults in the area
7938013 im terribly sorry but the re issue on that card was never put on the system

7938019 it was tricky because the waves were crashing over his head one minute you saw him the next he was under a metre of water his fists were white from clinging on
7938020 if no one had been there he would have given up he was pretty gouged up from the rocks his feet were opened up
7938021 he is a very with a capital v lucky man
7938022 were not doing the parade for the shopkeepers were doing it for the public
7938023 it was pitch dark and he couldnt see anything it was lucky he did not have an accident himself
7938024 it is so bad i have seen a lot of things i am 58 but this is so bad
7938025 some of the cows were going away at 50 to 60km h the river was so wild
7938026 we are so lucky that the guy smit getting the cows in didnt get hurt it could have been much much worse if he had fallen into the river
7938027 somewhat abated and changed course so its no longer such a dire threat
7938028 there is high potential for another major slip to come down onto the road so the risk to public safety is too great for the road to open
7938029 mit der serie wollen wir tabus in der pal stinensischen gesellschaft ber hren

7938031 als k nnten die pal stinenser sich nicht selbst helfen
7938032 sie haben also dem overbeck gesagt er k nne dann die schl ssel gleich mitnehmen dass sie das entscheiden ist mir neu

7938044 politics didnt bring me to working people working people brought me to politics
7938045 not just about themselves but about the direction of the country as a whole and theyve got good reason to be worried the fact is the economy is not working for ordinary americans
7938046 when you say the fundamentals of the economy are sound and your top economic adviser is saying youve become a nation of whiners then you dont get it
7938047 youre out of touch and youre not hearing the stories of ordinary americans who are working hard every day but feel like theyre just treading water and in some cases sinking
7938048 thats why im in politics politics didnt bring me to working people working people brought me to politics thats why you can count on the fact that when i get in the white house im going to be hearing your voices
7938049 the proposed changes are inconsistent with the letter and spirit of the esa contradicted by federal judicial precedent and would reduce rather than strengthen protections for imperiled fish and wildlife
7938050 apparently ms pelosis new script is still being reworked but its a telling mistake not only is natural gas every bit as much a fossil fuel as oil or coal more to the point these concentrated organic compounds found beneath the earths surface must be extracted by drilling and sometimes even drilling offshore on the outer continental shelf but more drilling is what ms pelosi had refused to allow just a few days ago

7938057 we cant definitively say its not listeriosis but certainly everything looks as though its not
7938058 we know they had some of the recalled meat product at the camp but that doesnt mean thats what caused this
7938059 what we have is this cluster of up to eight camp staff who reported being sick were in the process of following up with them and if there are any tests we can do
7938060 if we find someone who is still sick well get some samples from them if were able to
7938061 we may or may not be able to make that conclusive diagnosis but the important thing is the appropriate steps were taken as soon as the issue occurred
7938062 this is a strong bipartisan initiative to create a balanced energy policy including better conservation incentives for alternative energy and more production here in we need to lift the ban on offshore drilling across the gulf of mexico and the for example we have a great sustainable forestry industry that can support a growing demand for efficient wood burning systems thats good for our economy and it reduces demand for energy imports
7938063 we felt confident when we formed this bipartisan group that wed quickly receive support from our colleagues i am so pleased to have senator sununu as a member of our bipartisan effort he indeed understands that congress needs to take action immediately so that people in and all across this country will have the relief they deserve from high energy costs we look forward to his leadership and input as we move forward with senator sununu as a member of our group the people of can be certain they have a seat at the table as we move forward in addressing the current energy crisis
7938064 this is good news we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by 16 members of the senate because it puts every option on the table
7938065 we have the biggest gap between the rich and everybody else since the great depression
7938066 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late

7938100 the protection of the investment made in collecting verifying or presenting database contents is still not harmonised internationally some laws over protect database contents whilst others under protect them this book examines and compares several methods available for the protection of investment in database creation namely intellectual property unfair competition contract and technological protection measures in order to find an adequate type and level of protection to this effect the author uses criteria based on a combination of the economics of information goods the human rights to intellectual property and to information and the public interest proposing a model that can be adopted at international and national levels the legal protection of databases will be of interest to intellectual property lawyers competition lawyers as well as general commercial lawyers because of the breadth of laws reviewed it will also appeal to practitioners policymakers economists and students
7938101 unlike many ip books published by edward elgar which specialises in multi authored works this one is all written by estelle herself the fruit of this is that each chapter benefits from her ability to combine breadth of perspective with attention to detail although she freely confesses that this is the book of the thesis it is plainly very much more than that the book is a confident assertion of her mastery of both civil and common law thought as well as the subjects technical and commercial dimensions of particular interest is the tenth chapter which deals with remedial steps to deal with both the over protection and under protection of database right proposing a workable model which deserves more serious attention than it will probably receive
7938102 for several decades now david nimmer has maintained a steady flow of insightful witty and deeply informed commentary on copyright in the law journals his well earned reputation as a major authority and theorist on copyright law is unassailable in this new volume a companion to his very well received copyright sacred text technology and the dmca published by kluwer in 2003 nimmer once again tackles some of the thorniest issues that arise in the practice of copyright law including the following and much more the work for hire doctrine repeat infringers fair use determination and substantial similarity of computer programs although the volume collects articles originally published between 1988 and 2006 mostly in the past few years nimmer has scrupulously updated the texts and woven them together into a unified whole what the book offers as a result is a microscopic scrutiny of the u s copyright act of 1976 and all its amendments with an immeasurable abundance of interpretation grounded in the authors unmatched familiarity with the law and its application this is a work that no lawyer handling copyright cases or indeed no student or scholar of any branch of intellectual property law will want to be without
7938103 for those who want to read david nimmers articles without the hassle and expense of subscribing to the periodicals for which he writes and without going to the inconvenience of having to thumb the pages penned by others till he finds them this is the perfect volume incidentally professor nimmer is no mere copyright technician his footnotes reveal a cultured and intellectually curious polymath for whom us copyright legislation is a sort of prism through which philosophy economics literature and many other subjects are refracted he also has a delightful sense of humour which speed readers and literalists may possibly miss this is a great christmas stocking filler for the enthusiastic copyright lawyer
7938104 this volume and the series of which it is the final part is structured around the six themes of the ahrc network on new directions in copyright law which are 1 theoretical framework of copyright law 2 globalisation convergence and divergence 3 developments in rights neighbouring on copyright 4 protection of traditional knowledge and culture 5 copyright and the new technologies and 6 copyright corporate power and human rights accordingly the volume addresses itself to all those with an interest in copyright regardless of discipline

7938121 oh my god the republicans are very theyre narrow they never listen to a pro choice theyre not a big tent party
7938122 when the government runs something is it usually wasteful and poorly run
7938123 should government get involved in helping people establish basic needs
7938124 were a big tent party essentially we embrace all different points of view
7938125 ofcom created a new 03 number which can be included in
7938126 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7938127 this is not an easy choice but it is the only way to save the lives of people
7938128 this is in violation of the principle of territorial integrity which is one of the basic principles of international law and this is therefore absolutely unacceptable
7938129 this is not just about georgia but about relations between russia and the west
7938130 it stands quite clear now a peaceful resolution of the conflict was not part of tbilisis plan
7938131 the georgian leadership was methodically preparing for war while the political and material support provided by their foreign guardians only served to reinforce the perception of their own impunity
7938132 we repeatedly called for returning to the negotiating table and did not deviate from this position of ours even after the unilateral proclamation of kosovos independence
7938133 however our persistent proposals to the georgian side to conclude agreements with abkhazia and south ossetia on the non use of force remained unanswered regrettably they were ignored also by nato and even at the united nations
7938134 puts russia in opposition to the security council resolution to which it is a party
7938135 since the united states is a permanent member of the security council this simply will be dead on arrival in the security council
7938136 in direct violation of numerous u n security council resolutions regarding georgias territorial integrity resolutions that russia itself has endorsed
7938137 russias actions in recent weeks call into question russias commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
7938138 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
7938139 the crisis in georgia has changed the situation in europe unfortunately in a way that runs counter to our values and convictions
7938140 hey that free song i got sounds pretty good lets see the entire album
7938141 a vote for obama is a vote for dead children
7938142 why are there so many lawyers who want to be writers
7938143 ini membuktikan ada pengekangan terhadap petani yang sebenarnya berada dalam kondisi yang sulit dan sangat menderita
7938144 kami minta polda jabar dan polres garut menarik pasukan bko nya dari desa karangsari serta menuntut pembebasan enam warga yang ditahan
7938145 dat de man zijn vrouw moet slaan blijkt een vertaalfout ook zijn we nergens tegengekomen dat hoofddoekjes verplicht zijn maar dat niet alleen de koran geeft de vrouw recht op eigen financi le middelen twee jaar zwangerschapsverlof en alimentatie
7938146 it is all part of being an actress but i was so in awe of sir ben i was more nervous about acting alongside him than i was about the kiss
7938147 i would love to be able to swim in the ocean in malibu but that is asking for a bikini shot thats inviting something that i dont want to happen i dont need to be on a whos skinny whos fat whos looking healthy whos not eating list
7938148 well the creator designer has designed the female body to be such that it can procreate
7938149 the decisions that you make as a young adult will stay with you for life
7938150 kids these days grow up in a very violent world
7938151 you know how back when i was young things were different
7938152 more fond of her husband perhaps than the politeness of the day allows
7938153 it was two against one you know and no one helped him
7938154 i didnt think that it would happen but it was not safe for him to work there
7938155 both have played huge parts in the last few years
7938156 they deserve it they have been consistent performers in the first team and they set an excellent example
7938157 kamu sama seperti kuburan yang dilabur putih yang sebelah luarnya memang bersih tampaknya tetapi yang sebelah dalamnya penuh tulang belulang dan pelbagai jenis kotoran

7938159 were seeing more and more engine manufacturers endorse a b20 blend of biodiesel
7938160 it was very well received a lot of people came up to us afterward and had a lot of questions
7938161 it gives us more stability and everything we do is under the universitys name
7938162 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7938163 the dollar wants to pull oil lower and the storm wants to pull it higher its a bit of a tug of war right now
7938164 from the caribbean to the caspian weve had one bullish headline after another and the market cannot generate a sus tained rally
7938165 it certainly doesnt bode well for anyone who owns commodities
7938166 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by rus sia as a bargaining tool
7938167 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries
7938168 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7938169 we are an ambulance in the sky rather than on wheels
7938170 we can land in a field or on a road and we can travel in a straight line as the crow flies anywhere we go
7938171 we check and double check because once we are in the air we cant just pull over
7938172 its important to be cool under pressure fulfill the purpose of the mission and not be distracted from it
7938173 my job is to fly safely and if i get caught up in the human drama i wont perform as well
7938174 the patients i remember best are the people for whom the ride in the helicopter is the first time theyve flown
7938175 the wonder of it elevates their mind from their personal situation they are sick or injured in a bad spot but for a moment they can forget it and just feel awestruck
7938176 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7938177 important part of what im about what makes me tick
7938178 shes on the phone with the world food programme hes on the phone with saakashvili
7938179 it was a great picture of what theyll be like in the white house
7938180 senator mccain has talked for years about the dangers of russian policies in the way they conduct themselves and undermine the sovereignty of their neighbours
7938181 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7938182 this contradicts the basic principles of territorial integrity and is therefore absolutely unacceptable merkel said in a speech in tallinn today
7938183 will very clearly stand by this principle of territorial integrity
7938184 is something that we dont consider to be part of international law she said
7938185 relatively optimistic that the emergency eu summit called for sept 1 in brussels will find a common voice in addressing the aftermath of the five day conflict in georgia
7938186 we have a lot of options there with one instrument being the eu neighborhood policy under its eastern dimension
7938187 we shall continue to talk to russia though you can only do this on the basis of recognition of international principles the chancellor said
7938188 what is happening in georgia is a turning point that should allow the caucasus nation
7938189 at this moment it is especially appropriate to stress increased activity of the european union in this region estonia considers it important to decide on awarding a membership action plan to georgia and ukraine as soon as possible
7938190 tieni vai dalla nonna e portale vino e focaccia ciao e in bocca al lupo

7938192 of the intolerance shown by the chinese authorities toward tibetan culture and dissident voices
7938193 we issued a release saying that over 40 olympic athletes downloaded the album in an act of solidarity and thats what triggered it then everything got blocked
7938194 we are aware of the log on problems but we have no comment at the moment
7938195 it seems like suspending itunes is punishment for itunes but really it doesnt hurt itunes it hurts us
7938196 some in beijing did download and i think thats what spooked the chinese government
7938197 no i gave the hug first and its up to me when the hug ends
7938198 i cant give up i have to keep on fighting not for me but for my son
7938199 remember that you are a gift and not everyone gets to unwrap that same gift if that were true then there would be no worth and you know you are worthy
7938200 friends are those angels that lift you to your feet when your own wings have forgotten how to fly

7938209 io porto i soldi a casa per cui sono il capitalismo
7938210 of course brunello and tignanello and sassicaia have to be named
7938211 but i also really like passito di pantelleria and i like pino grigio
7938212 you know a lesser known tuscan wine thats very good is vino nobile di montepulciano do you know the area
7938213 that whole zone is wonderful from montepulciano with wineries like avignonesi to pienza with the pecorino cheese to montalcino with brunello
7938214 you dont have to go beyond tuscany weve got so much here the olive oil too
7938215 i do my best but i cant afford the really good stuff
7938216 its the base of everything you must use good olive oil
7938217 i know i agree its fundamental i try to cook tuscan as much as i can at home but its not the same
7938218 in via ricasoli its sicilian and they have the best pistacchio and mandorla and i also love the gelateria in settignano
7938219 and he would talk to me about his gelato like it was as much of a work of art as michelangelos david
7938220 another clue is that the domain registration information points to 152 w 57th street in manhattan which just happens to be iac ceo barry dillers address justin ouellette muxtapes founder worked at iac site vimeo

7938230 americans think that all afghans are terrorists and they send rockets and missiles against us
7938231 i myself buried more than 50 women and children are all of them terrorists
7938232 suddenly the infidels attacked and i lost consciousness when i came to i was in hospital and they told me that all of my family were dead and already buried was my two year old child a terrorist then am i not also a terrorist why did they let me live
7938233 according to our investigation there was not a single armed individual from the opposition in the area
7938234 during the air attack on azizabad 90 people died including women children and old men this is cruel behaviour on the part of the foreign forces and it can greatly complicate the security situation
7938235 every operation is based on confirmed and re confirmed information and data
7938236 the coalition forces coordinated the ground attack in azizabad but there was no coordination on the air strike
7938237 when you study the area that was bombed you can see that there was no need for an air strike
7938238 the international forces along with commando forces from the ana ran into an ambush on the way to the area where mullah siddiqs men were gathering and had to call in an air strike
7938239 the americans act on the basis of incorrect information and bomb residential areas
7938240 if this continues hatred for the americans will increase day by day
7938241 karzai can keep his money i want my child will this money bring him back
7938242 it is interesting that the ministry of defence says it did not know about this attack in advance but that they sacked two officers
7938243 it clearly shows that the afghan government cannot do anything more than that they have no power over the americans they are just trying to calm people down
7938244 it is useless to ask the president he has no power or authority all he can do is condemn these air strikes we should be talking directly and quite seriously to nato demanding that they do not target civilians
7938245 the taleban were better than this puppet government and its masters
7938246 the taleban would at least distinguish between civilians and enemies but these thugs think everybody is their enemy
7938247 the caucasus is the kind of place where when the guns start firing its hard to stop them that is the brutal reality of south ossetia

7938255 i have to knock him out to win that is my plan to be aggressive from the first round
7938256 i was very disappointed with the referee i felt like i was fighting two fighters in the ring and i felt like they wanted to take my belt away
7938257 i felt like every time i went in he was holding me
7938258 the ref would break us up and i couldnt get my punches off
7938259 i would give him more credit if i felt like i was given the same advantages he was during the fight
7938260 boxing is the only sport where you can get robbed without a gun

7938396 contemplation is essentially a listening in silence an expectancy in other words the true contemplative is not the one who prepares his mind for a particular message that he wants or expects to hear but who remains empty because he knows that he can never expect or anticipate the word that will transform his darkness into light he does not even anticipate a special kind of transformation he does not demand light instead of darkness he waits on the word of god in silence and when he is answered it is not so much by a word that bursts into his silence it is by his silence itself suddenly inexplicably revealing itself to him as a word of great power full of the voice of god

7938414 your heavenly father has given you agency the ability to choose and to act for yourself agency is essential in the plan of salvation

7938419 i go to pretty school now and when im big ill ride a school bus and go to kitty garden
7938420 ive given much thought and prayer to this issue let me first say that i prefer the original hebrew and greek however i also realize that the common man cannot read those languages therefore the issue is which of the english translations best renders the meaning of the originals
7938421 although i have preferred other translations in the past my current favorite is the in fact from this day forward i will hold an nlt only position
7938422 my reasoning after much prayer and fasting is that the nlt has come from a thought for thought or idea for idea philosophy of translation this stands in opposition to the word for word translations such as the kjv nkjv nasb esv hcsb etc because the nlt uses a thought for thought approach this translation cannot be as exact as some of the others this allows me to claim to like the bible while still holding to blatantly unbiblical positions such as supporting partial birth abortions and same sex unions
7938423 my faith is very important to me i have faith in god thats why i carry the nlt i also have faith in acceptance tolerance and diversity thats also why i carry the nlt with this loose translation as my guide along with several trans gendered communists i will lead this country to places it has never been

7938529 even though the trnc is not recognised by any government and has no extradition treaty with britain we have identified and arrested criminals who have fled here and sent them back theres no safe haven for criminals here
7938530 we applaud the turkish cypriots determination to ensure that the northern part of cyprus is not a haven for fugitives from justice
7938531 it is very positive if fugitives are returned from north cyprus it seems that the turkish cypriot community wants to improve its international reputation and demonstrate its adherence to european standards
7938532 with a reunification process under way in cyprus the turkish cypriot community is keen to demonstrate that it takes its international responsibilities seriously
7938533 the word has got out among britains criminal underworld that the political situation in cyprus means they can use the loophole in the law to their advantage it is terribly frustrating for british police forces but things are changing
7938534 there is more and more organised and international crime across the globe so police departments all around the world should work together against all types of crimes now police are not politicians
7938535 finished files are the result of years of scientific study combined with

7938537 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
7938538 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
7938539 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
7938540 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
7938541 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
7938542 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
7938543 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
7938544 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
7938545 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
7938546 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
7938547 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
7938548 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
7938549 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
7938550 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
7938551 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
7938552 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
7938553 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
7938554 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
7938555 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
7938556 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
7938557 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since

7938559 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
7938560 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
7938561 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
7938562 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
7938563 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
7938564 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
7938565 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
7938566 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
7938567 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit

7938570 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
7938571 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
7938572 our problems dont stem from only a certain political party or a certain race or a certain religion or nationality did you pick to whom you were born or in which country which social class or tax bracket its time that people stop laying blame and recognize their individual part in the problem hate breeds hate and doesnt fix any problems by spreading it only creates more its easy to complain the world is full of people willing to whine about whats wrong when what is actually needed is for people to take action in resolving the problem no one is perfect and no group should be judged as a whole by the actions of a few
7938573 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied

7938707 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7938708 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7938709 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7938710 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7938711 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7938712 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7938713 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

7938718 because of the changes our government has introduced the dream of a post secondary education will be open to every canadian regardless of their level of income
7938719 what a tremendous opportunity for students and for their potential and what a powerful advantage for canada
7938720 minister solbergs commitment to help improve access for low and middle income students and the governments new initiative to help relieve student debt is reassuring for those who are faced with the burden of such barriers
7938721 opened doors for a portion of students in canada that said there are still groups that remain largely underrepresented in the current pse system such as aboriginal students rural students first generation learners and students with disabilities

7938740 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7938741 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

7938744 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7938745 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7938746 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7938747 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7938748 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7938749 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7938750 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7938751 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7938752 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7938753 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7938754 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7938755 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7938756 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7938757 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7938758 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7938759 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7938760 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7938761 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7938762 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7938763 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7938764 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7938765 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7938766 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7938767 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7938768 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7938769 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7938770 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7938771 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7938772 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7938773 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7938774 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7938775 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7938776 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7938777 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7938778 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves

7938784 no hay dudas de que hubo una cosa en la que los dos partidos se pusieron de acuerdo librarse de musharraf

7938786 el ej rcito quiere que el gobierno lidere y asuma la responsabilidad pol tica de ir tras los extremistas a fin de que la actual falta de popularidad del ej rcito no empeore
7938787 pero el se or sharif no tiene intenciones de convertirse en el instrumento del ej rcito mientras el se or zardari hasta ahora no puede negociar una posici n com n de la coalici n
7938788 no quiere concesiones al ej rcito y no ofrece apoyo a la guerra contra los extremistas del talib n consciente de su banco de votos del ala derechista l tiene poco tiempo para demandas estadounidenses
7938789 tambi n tenemos que ofrecer una asociaci n a largo plazo con pakist n los dirigentes pakistan es sospechan que si tenemos xito con al qaeda nos apartaremos de ellos hemos hecho poco por garantizarles que vemos algo m s all de este esfuerzo muy centrado en el terrorismo
7938790 no se puede escapar del hecho de que pakist n estar en mejor situaci n econ mica con un gobierno civil que con una dictadura militar en general el gobierno ha aceptado esto
7938791 pakist n se convertir completamente en una democracia cuando haya una propiedad civil del aparato de seguridad y de la pol tica exterior

7938804 gambari siempre aprovech la oportunidad de tomarse una foto con suu kyi para dar la impresi n de que el proceso de di logo pol tico que lidera en nombre de la onu est funcionando
7938805 pero esta vez no hubo foto ella envi un fuerte mensaje al pueblo birmano al negarse a reunirse con gambari
7938806 ella quer a que la gente supera que no pueden depender de la onu para tener resultados tienen que pararse en sus propios pies
7938807 a diferencia gambari aun san suu kyi se niega a ser un t tere en el juego de la junta esto confirma que perdi la confianza en gambari ella ha dicho esto a trav s de la nica forma de resistencia pac fica que tiene disponible

7938827 the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us and let me state what i think about their tactics and these ads im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7938828 my job as president would be to try to make sure that we are tightening the screws diplomatically on iran that weve mobilized the world community to go after irans nuclear program in a serious way to get sanctions in place so that iran starts making a difficult calculation and weve got to do that before israel feels like its back is to the wall
7938829 we joined the coalition with full sincerity and commitment to steer pakistan towards full restoration of democracy independent judiciary and constitutional governance unfortunately all promises made with us were not honored
7938830 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests

7938860 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7938861 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7938862 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7938863 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7938864 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7938865 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7938866 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7938867 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7938868 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7938869 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7938870 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7938871 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7938872 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

7938939 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
7938940 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues

7939011 look at the sky we are not alone the whole universe is friendly to us and conspires only to give the best to those who dream and work

7939013 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7939014 the first mainstream african american candidate who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7939015 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
7939016 its a well intentioned notion he has but its a very na ve way of thinking how youre going to conduct foreign policy
7939017 having talking points on foreign policy doesnt get you there
7939018 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7939019 the white house isnt a place to learn how to deal with international crisis the balance of power
7939020 you may end up going against a senate colleague perhaps mccain perhaps frist
7939021 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7939022 they are both going to do what they have to do
7939023 there is a lot obama could have done to unify the party and basically he hasnt lifted a finger
7939024 feels like the obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments
7939025 and he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process sen obama would go a long way towards healing these wounds if he were to specifically praise the accomplishments of the clinton presidency in a line or two during his speech on thursday
7939026 yes theres some scabs but sometimes underneath a scab theres a little bit of pus but we have to put some disinfectant on it so we that can heal the wound and move forward thats what the convention is about
7939027 there is a group of hillary people who are very angry very upset
7939028 some of its directed at the media very disappointed you cant control all those people these are ceos some of them major rich people
7939029 you cant call them and tell them what to do there is no question there is that category of people but i dont think people can blame her for their behavior i think thats probably unfair
7939030 her challenge is to make the most of the emotion without popping the roof off
7939031 she wants to reassert her relevance and introduce a new political identity
7939032 i think she understands that if she runs again she has to run a different style of campaign
7939033 and shes got a huge opening right now for the first time in her career she actually has a base to invigorate at the beginning of the 08 campaign she was the issue she had to explain herself her celebrity now shes got a base the working class and she needs to speak to them
7939034 hillary is very goal oriented and so the goal shifted from ive got to win to baracks got to win
7939035 with bill clinton the transition was harder because he wasnt the candidate its difficult when the candidate and the target of obamas primary campaign is his wife
7939036 thats not the way i was raised unfortunately there are people who didnt have the luxury of having wonderful parents like i did who taught about parental respect
7939037 it is obvious that you meant that my wife of 56 years and i did a poor job raising our son eric

7939047 part of his pitch was that he needed this womans name on paper to indicate that the had talked to her

7939061 certainly some of the comments about matt in that report i didnt think were accurate
7939062 it wasnt coming from us or at least not from people on our staff that i was aware of

7939064 just based off of one play or one half its a comprehensive test were still in that process
7939065 ive talked to the head coach were on the same page
7939066 on one of the other plays i got to eat the ball there was a little miscommunication but it was my fault
7939067 it would be incorrect of me to ignore the fact matt didnt play well i think matt understands that he knows he has to play better than that
7939068 were going to work to get better and go forward
7939069 im not particularly worried about anything except just focusing on getting better ive taken a lot of heat for whatever reasons the microscope has been on my play every day every game

7939142 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish
7939143 and through trial and error i finally settled on the type of spit for the task at hand
7939144 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing he found murray mints worked the best
7939145 when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7939146 it is some form of ball tampering it is not about natural deterioration
7939147 i loved the wrist release of flintoff jones and harmison but always felt something was going on as the ball was reversing by the 40th over especially on a grassy pitches
7939148 youre used to seeing the ball reverse early on the much rougher tracks in the subcontinent where the hard surface makes the ball abrasive easily
7939149 to me it is a total hypocrisy on what is deemed to be ball tampering
7939150 there are huge inconsistencies for one side to complain about the other scratching the ball when they are deliberately sucking sugary sweets to shine the ball
7939151 people use suntan oil lip salve scruff the ball with finger and thumbs until they get caught if you apply suntan oil on you forehead or face or arms and rub the sweat on your body which is mixed with suntan oil and then rub the ball what is the difference
7939152 if a batsman edges the ball and stands his ground and no one says a word that is part of the game and if a bowler adds sugary saliva on the ball the spirit of the game is called into question there should be some leniency about what the bowler can do to the ball you dont want a cricket ball tested at the end of day for sugar for sun cream for lip gel for finger nails and whatever else you want to try and put on it
7939153 i actually wish marcus put a bit more mint on the ball so it deflected further off my glove
7939154 were talking about sugar coating using mints there are a lot more major issues in the game at the moment to worry about
7939155 i had no knowledge of it and i certainly wouldnt recommend anything like that
7939156 i dont know if it would even work i would never cheat in the game bowlers have used sweat and polish over the years to shine the ball there is an old wives tale from past years that sunscreen and brylcreem helps the ball swing but i dont know about that
7939157 may polish the ball provided that no artificial substance is used
7939158 it depends on the evidence and circumstances so if something is brought to our attention it would be dealt with
7939159 over the last century or so bowlers have been fiddling around with balls using all sorts of stuff
7939160 if hes come out and said that hes used it yes its unethical
7939161 yes he got away with it good luck to him you cant change the result of the test series
7939162 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish and through trial and error i finally settled on the best type of spit for the task at hand it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing as with most of the great scientific discoveries this one happened quite by accident while at warwickshire dermot reeve noticed that his bowlers somehow had the ability to keep the ball swinging far longer than any team they faced the problem was no one knew why he realised the player in charge of polishing and keeping the ball clean was his top order batsman asif din and what he did to keep his concentration levels up was chewing extra strong mints it took a while for word to get around the circuit but once it did the sales of sweets near the county grounds of england went through the roof i tried asif s confection of choice but couldn t get on with them too dry so i had a go at murray mints and found they worked a treat trouble was even allowing for trying to keep one going as long as possible i still used to get through about 15 a day and the taste soon palled once phil neale came on board as our operations manager it was one of his jobs to make sure the dressing room was fully stocked at all times we even tried taking them on tour a couple of times until we realised that they didn t work as well on the kookaburra balls used overseas as the dukes we used back home
7939163 i dont want to go to a job every day that im not crazy about i just dont want to live that way
7939164 well just so you know i already canceled the trip for you
7939165 so i went to this physical therapist friend of dawns the physical therapist made my my back feel a bit better
7939166 jesus christ your friends are already introducing you to guys
7939167 no no in fact i think dawn in rich might be fucking and shes married
7939168 so the other day rich who i consider a new friend said
7939169 frankly its a little creepy that someone your age wants to see peoples myspaces
7939170 i never thought id say this but i cant have you in my life

7939177 more moderate growth in display advertising was partially offset by continued weakness in online recruitment advertising
7939178 the decline in print has been so pervasive that its taking the online stuff with it

7939190 we started off with the assumption that we wanted our people to be superior
7939191 franzen has an idea that medicalizing the language in which he describes his characters various moods and motives carries an ironic charge a way of acknowledging and thereby resisting the saturation of our mental language by chemistry the result as so often in simple mimesis is just the re representing of that saturation for his readers in a way that looks a little close to complicity with it

7939194 as lenders pursue higher quality loans for the market the priority should be on identifying poor quality at the earliest possible point in the process and at the lowest possible cost
7939195 in maris view the origination and prefunding processes offer the largest and least expensive opportunities to assure funding of higher quality loans how a lender accepts or rejects a loan application at the front door is often all a criminal needs to see how much further he or she may push through the loan process

7939282 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent

7939286 i dont want anybody do something to me because they have to i want it to be because they want to

7939297 the trailer fell on the right side of the van and crushed it
7939298 im a little disappointed to hear about the cost of living for the employees
7939299 to me the employees are the most valuable asset the county has
7939300 most of the funds are consumed by the rising cost of health care
7939301 i want to go on the record as im opposed to going above this 36 mills
7939302 i just feel we could come in in the 35s to maintain a level mill i think we have to find a way to stay level even though its not much every little bit counts
7939303 this is just a resolution that would allow us to publish the notice of public hearing for sept 8

7939310 its important that a company is locating in center city and will have its headquarters here
7939311 is an important corporate presence as well its not uncomplicated
7939312 we knew that there would be appropriate processes to look at the signage issue that all the voices would be heard
7939313 its very unfortunate that with all good intentions on the part of so many the city the commerce department even unisys the residents of two liberty place that a dilemma of this nature arises
7939314 had the facts been known earlier i dont think we would have gotten to this point
7939315 we do want unisys to move to the city we just dont want their sign up there

7939333 until we have an official decision from the board we have to push forward with our appeal regardless of any promises that are made
7939334 my main concern from the start was not what court goes in there but having some sort of citizen participation and representation in there
7939335 its important for people to have access to their public officials
7939336 i told him what court went there wasnt my main concern but that i wanted citizen representation there
7939337 whatever the majority of the board wants to do in regards to which court goes there is fine with me
7939338 mr morgans comments are certainly a step in the right direction but they do raise some concerns
7939339 the bar associations primary concern is that the judicial functions of the circuit court which have always been at the core of the courthouse issue are satisfied the space in the courthouse should be allocated in a way to make those judicial functions both efficient and safe

7939356 i look forward to working with richard as we continue to implement a prudent credit culture as a strong foundation for our organizations future growth richard will be instrumental to cal oaks success
7939357 i am pleased to join a company as completely committed to maintaining the highest standards for credit quality while serving the community needs of thousand oaks this is an exciting opportunity to utilize my experience in evaluating and managing credit risk in the current challenging marketplace while contributing to the institutions becoming the premier business bank in ventura county as well as a powerful community resource
7939358 while we are extremely pleased with the results obtained from the work undertaken to date on our three marketed and seven pipeline drugs four of which are moving towards commercial release we feel this success is not yet represented in shareholder value
7939359 we have invested heavily in the respective successful development of our products now we need assistance in developing our companys share valuation
7939360 collectively these developments have substantially increased the value of sinobiomed which has seen a dramatic corresponding increase in market capitalization of nearly 200 the company believes however that its valuation remains well below the market capitalization and corresponding share price of above 3 00 per share we further believe that our share price has been impacted by the overall decline in the chinese capital markets
7939361 we have therefore retained cb capital partners as our financial advisor to assist in reviewing our strategic alternatives with the objective of maximizing shareholder value and we look forward to working with them to ensure that all alternatives available to the company are considered and evaluated to achieve that objective
7939362 we believe the merger will result in a leadership position in the less lethal market and greatly improve the efficiencies of distribution and production of less lethal products marketed to law enforcement private security corrections and the military
7939363 several years ago i was asked by the board to take over the management of pepperball to grow and expand its established non lethal product base and name brand the greatest opportunity we saw for the company was a need in the marketplace for new products and that need became the focus of management and the board with the product development financed by that group today the new product development efforts have resulted in two totally new finished products called the flashlauncher and the sa 4 which we are introducing through our existing distribution channels as well as new channels for the consumer market we are ramping up production and have commenced initial sales of these products additionally pepperball is completing market testing and beginning production of a new lightweight hand held product that is designed for personal protection for use in the consumer and institutional market we believe this new product to have a very broad potential market we believe that our new products including those pictured below will rapidly achieve significant sales and we expect that the merging of our companies will result in an excellent growth opportunity in a market we believe has significant worldwide potential
7939364 we are very pleased and excited with the progress that has been made to date and the relationship that has been developed between swat and pti in advancing to this point and looking to close the merger following the upcoming shareholder meetings the joining of swat and pepperball will create a supplier with a full line of less lethal launchers and projectiles led by a very experienced and dedicated management team and at the same time eliminate the litigation existing between the two organizations that has been expensive and distracting for both companies

7939367 i think the obama campaign when they asked me to speak knew what kind of message id want to convey
7939368 im sure there may be other speakers that will contrast and point out sen mccains continuation of the bush policies ill make that point as well but it wont be the major focus
7939369 i just know that ive got a record in virginia and ive got a view on how government ought to be part of fixing problems
7939370 ive got a view on the fact that neither political partys got a monopoly on truth or patriotism or all the answers and the obama campaign knew thats what im about and what i wanted to say
7939371 i really enjoy the us open its a race i look forward to every year

7939373 when i moved to america it was a race i really looked forward to competing in
7939374 it receives great publicity so after winning the race in 03 and 04 it helped boost my profile in this sport
7939375 the u s open is a fun weekend for the riders and fans
7939376 the track is really tight which reminds me of the supercross races i competed in while growing up in australia its fast and intense and all of the riders are eager to get their hands on the 100 000 check

7939391 shipp writes well constructed puzzles where each word each sentence contributes to the final picture with economic precision and sharp bursts of humor this is a memorable collection wandering deftly through the gnomic shadowlands of dark fantasy horror and bizarro
7939392 jeremy c shipp writes about horrible things in marvelous ways sheep and wolves is a compulsively readable collection i read the sucker in three sittings filled with resplendent moments of satire gruesome contrivances and some of the sharpest funniest dialogue around these stories had me cringing and laughing out loud simultaneously of course trying to box sheep and wolves in as merely a gore and giggles affair would be doing the collection a serious disservice each of the stories contained within offer up odd instances of insight that elevate the work and paint a compelling view of our sometimes beautiful sometimes insidious humanity a weird funny brutal transcendent read highly recommended

7939413 unlike the last time we went to the moon everybody is going to the moon now there are at least a dozen proposals i know of from various countries to go to the moon
7939414 this is going to open a new era of scientific understanding of not just the moon and the formation of the earth moon system but how we can live on another world
7939415 of the moon on the moon and from the moon
7939416 i think the way to sell it is that were going to the moon as a step beyond
7939417 the other is that the moon is an interesting enough place to stay as well people talk about exit strategies on the moon to touch base leave and go to mars i think thats dumb
7939418 if we can work in antarctica for 50 years and still want to go back and do more the moon also is at least as interesting as antarctica
7939419 theres still a lot of science to be done on the moon its a natural world with natural complexity
7939420 were never going to have a long term 50 year plus research base on mars if we cant figure out how to do that on the moon so lets figure out how to do it on the moon
7939421 the moon is hot or cool depending on what your generation is
7939422 but i dont think we have to go sell the moon i think it sold itself
7939423 but im here to tell you its not your fathers oldsmobile

7939459 theyre saying if we can find some way to manage and support these we will
7939460 its all just less about what end users clients are running
7939461 certainly some businesses and also some u s government agencies will explore diversifying their portfolios
7939462 weve talked to some who have explicit goals to have macs account for 10 of their client base for example but i think apple will continue a slow but steady increase not accelerate

7939483 ive visited north korea in 1999 2004 2005 and then the last time in october 2007 so i can see the dynamic of this change
7939484 in 1999 even in pyongyang people were exhausted malnourished feeble in 2004 the situation was very different the whole city looked like one big market
7939485 there was activity everywhere on streets under the bridges from the windows of apartments
7939486 there have been a lot of changes but they are very patchy its still not a transitional economy
7939487 certain segments or layers are allowed to adopt some market driven mechanisms but the majority of the economy is being artificially preserved
7939488 its the level of specificity in the ideology thats the problem for reform
7939489 if your guiding principles were vague and adaptable it would be easier but in north korea they have official guidelines on how to do proper ostrich farming how can you now say in fact thats not the right way to do ostrich farming
7939490 north koreans were taught their whole lives that the state would provide now they have to take care of themselves
7939491 a mistake of just one word can lead a north korean to be publicly executed in this society

7939723 sentimos que el gobierno estadounidense no ha reconocido el avance sustancial que hemos hecho en materia de dpi
7939724 la pol tica del gobierno es hacer lo m nimo posible
7939725 chile est violando el tlc y no cumple adecuadamente su acuerdo comercial con la ue ni el adpic
7939726 chile no est burlando de ninguna manera los acuerdos y no tiene necesidad de hacerlo
7939727 podemos tener desacuerdos sobre los instrumentos usados para proteger los dpi pero no sobre los principios
7939728 cuando suscribi el tlc estados unidos entend a que chile era un estado y que las patentes entregadas por el departamento de propiedad industrial ser an respetadas por el isp
7939729 el origen de la actual discrepancia podr a radicar en la relativa ambig edad de esta parte del texto del tlc
7939730 creemos que en lo que respecta a las patentes farmac uticas estamos cumpliendo el tlc
7939731 lo que tenemos es una diferencia de opini n estados unidos cree que el linkage es la nica respuesta mientras que nosotros pensamos que tenemos un sistema que es igualmente efectivo
7939732 y sostener que la ca da de la inversi n se debe a los dpi no resiste an lisis
7939733 basta mirar a d nde se dirigen las inversiones pa ses con un registro mucho peor en materia de dpi

7939748 contrary to the principles of georgias independence sovereignty and territorial integrity
7939749 i reject the decision of the russian government to extend recognition to the south ossetia and abkhazia regions of georgia
7939750 this is in direct violation of numerous un security council resolutions regarding georgias territorial integrity resolutions that russia itself has endorsed
7939751 all responsible people should support russia so as to put an end to the unilateral influence in the world of the us and the eu
7939752 ukraine should respect the will of the peoples of abkhazia and south ossetia

7939777 before long the group made an important discovery not only would a huge number of employees become eligible for retirement in the next five to 10 years the company had done little to retain the wealth of institutional knowledge they would be taking with them from the intricacies of key client relationships to mainframe computer languages no longer being taught in school many experienced workers possessed critical know how that if lost would be costly if not impossible for the company to replace
7939778 these parameters helped shape the american express phased retirement program an initiative launched in pilot mode during the first quarter of 2008 rather than retiring and leaving the company at once participants gradually give up their day to day responsibilities while replacing some of their free time with activities like mentoring and teaching master classes to their successors in addition they get more time out of the office doing whatever they want be it planning for life in retirement or doing charity work the phased retiree continues to receive a portion of his previous salary benefits as usual and the company in turn gets to hold on to some of its most valuable employees a year or more past traditional retirement age

7939862 additional strengthening is possible before the center moves over land today some weakening is likely when gustav moves over haiti however restrengthening is forecast as the center approaches eastern cuba on wednesday
7939863 gustav continues to represent a potential threat to oil and gas installations in the gulf region and will be watched with vigilance
7939864 given the current track for gustav and the expectation that it might enter the gulf of mexico this weekend we are making logistical arrangements to evacuate staff who are not essential to production or drilling operations
7939865 evacuations could begin as early as wednesday there is no impact on production at this time

7939869 for people at risk for high blood pressure if youre a habituated coffee drinker reducing your caffeine intake would be an effective way of potentially reducing your blood pressure
7939870 the cane toads cannot survive in much of southern australia because they would be too cold to move about and forage or spawn
7939871 we found that cane toads can barely hop once they get below about 15 degrees celsius
7939872 their range would also be constrained by the limited availability of water for their tadpoles in some parts of australia
7939873 these are perfect conditions for growing wine but you are unlikely to meet a toad at a winery
7939874 our study is particularly helpful in predicting where cane toads could live under climate change because we have identified a cause and effect way that climate limits the toads
7939875 in one way it is obvious why dry conditions are bad for frogs they lose too much water
7939876 but having wet skin also provides frogs with a thermal challenge because the evaporating water takes heat away from their bodies and often makes them colder than the air
7939877 as scientists were excited about this discovery because its a fundamentally new approach to regulating what enzymes do in cells
