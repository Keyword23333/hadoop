6240009 the rudd governments overhaul of bulk wheat export marketing is a major economic reform that will provide many new opportunities for growers
6240010 we want growers confident in their skills so that they can capitalise on these opportunities and improve their understanding of the dynamics of grain marketing
6240011 the information sessions will explain how the new system works expert presenters will also discuss a range of marketing and business management strategies such as the timing of wheat sales and how to choose and build a relationship with the right buyer

6240013 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined

6240040 theres no doubt in my mind he was fixing to strike again
6240041 the only thing we could figure was that maybe something happened with his sugar we dont know
6240042 please convey to the other family that we have no words to describe how sorry we are that this all happened to everybody
6240043 i sometimes wonder why many american christians appear to be quite ignorant of much of the rest of the worlds people cultures and religions
6240044 the third piece of a three sim set of ancient ruins sims
6240045 wolf hills quaddryl and crucible all contains ruins from three ancient cultures
6240046 it is still under construction and will incorporate an underground flooded ruins on its west side the darkness and storm are intended to segue the entire estate to the final sim templum templum ex obscurum is a masterpiece sim built by baron grayson this sim was entrusted into my keeping and crucible is a companion sim to extend the ethereal quality of templum beyond its current border
6240047 that may be true i enjoy building very much but i only started a few months ago
6240048 i was amazed at the sims that people built and then shared freely
6240049 i want to contribute a part of my vision back to second life
6240050 a problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer
6240051 if the petermann glacier breaks up back to the upstream rift the loss would be as much as 60 square miles 160 square kilometers
6240052 this type of harassment has been used against peaceful protestors in the past and never have these tyrannical methods been acceptable
6240053 american life league is committed to making sure these people get the attention they deserve
6240054 this kind of blatant disregard for pro lifers rights on the part of governor martin omalleys state police wont be tolerated if these pro lifers were pro abortion activists or peta protesters this would have been on the front page of every newspaper on the east coast
6240055 i am pro choice i believe in roe v wade and come to that conclusion not because im pro abortion but because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually i think they wrestle with these things in profound ways in consultation with their pastors or their spouses or their doctors and their family members and so for me the goal right now should be and this is where i think we can find common ground and by the way i have now inserted this in the democratic party platform is how do we reduce the number of abortions
6240056 bank robbery is fine as long as the decision to rob the bank was done as a result of deep introspection
6240057 personally im opposed to abortion but if a woman wants to have one thats her decision
6240058 i think abortion should be rare but i cant stop a woman from having one its her choice
6240059 why do you personally oppose abortion or why do you think it should be rare
6240060 so youre against abortion because it takes a life but its perfectly fine for someone else to take a life
6240061 youre against the killing of a human but also for the killing of a human
6240062 if i were designing a system from scratch i would probably go ahead with a single payer system
6240063 two simple examples producers would refer to as creative license

6240065 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6240066 and methodically tore into mccains health care tax and offshore oil drilling policies
6240067 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6240068 sen obama got a little testy on this issue he said i was questioning his patriotism let me be clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6240069 the bottom line is that sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much
6240070 theres a lot of mystery about the process and so the more information we can get out to people the better chances are that people will you know will want to adopt and will find that theres a need
6240071 what were hearing from trainers and physicians is were getting some back injuries when the ball carrier is immediately snapped to the ground by being jerked quickly
6240072 if the ball carrier is grabbed by the shoulder or jersey and just ridden to the ground over a couple of yards thats not going to be a foul
6240073 well err on the side of safety well defend the official who may be a little more strict because thats a major point of emphasis
6240074 this is a short dvd that focuses on proper injury prevention tackling techniques
6240075 its been distributed to every college in the nation and we encourage every football program to show this to the student athletes
6240076 in new york we dont think of alternative power as something that we just import from other parts of the nation

6240085 if you go into a forest during the dry season the whole population of chameleons there will be represented by eggs
6240086 there are about a dozen lizard species known to be short lived in which a good proportion of individuals die off by a year
6240087 but there are always some that make it to the next year so the species maximal longevity is greater than one year
6240088 one of the most robust things to come out of life history theory is that trade offs exist
6240089 if you increase the number of young the cost is often accelerated aging if you get something that lives longer you get costs early in life with lower fertility and even sterility
6240090 that they practically grow in front of your very eyes
6240091 chameleons can be very antisocial and if you crowd them theyll happily fight to the death
6240092 i do not fear death in view of the fact that i had been dead for billions and billions of years before i was born and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it
6240093 the so called christian nations are the most enlightened and progressive but in spite of their religion not because of it the church has opposed every innovation and discovery from the day of galileo down to our own time when the use of anesthetic in childbirth was regarded as a sin because it avoided the biblical curse pronounced against eve and every step in astronomy and geology ever taken has been opposed by bigotry and superstition the greeks surpassed us in artistic culture and in architecture five hundred years before christian religion was born

6240099 the novel traces the life of aisha from her engagement to mohammed when she was six until the prophets death
6240100 i have deliberately and consciously written respectfully about islam and mohammed i envisioned that my book would be a bridge builder
6240101 cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
6240102 the numbers of s amp e bachelors and masters degrees awarded reached new peaks of 466 000 and 120 000 respectively in 2005

6240104 i can scarcely get my mind around the fact that he is so openly unapologetically endorsing a policy in which pious opinion would trump secular law
6240105 i would not consider frosted flakes the food of an olympian
6240106 the food network will enable real time communication between consumers farmers and other participants in the regional food system and allow online food related transactions

6240127 parents must impart to their children a sense of personal responsibility for their health nutrition and exercise
6240128 we should again teach nutrition and physical education to our children and better inform adults what our foods contain and the importance of exercise
6240129 supports providing marketing tools for the fruit and vegetable industry focused on promoting healthier american diets
6240130 expand access for u s agricultural producers to foreign markets providing a great and lasting benefit to american farmers
6240131 implement a 250 000 payment limitation so that we help family farmers not large corporate agribusiness
6240132 close the loopholes that allow mega farms to get around the limits by subdividing their operations into multiple paper corporations
6240133 strengthen producer protections to ensure independent farmers have fair access to markets control over their production decisions and transparency in prices
6240134 support immediate implementation of the country of origin labeling law so that american producers can distinguish their products from imported ones
6240135 help organic farmers afford to certify their crops and reform crop insurance to not penalize organic farmers he also will promote regional food systems
6240136 establish a new program to identify and train the next generation of farmers he will also provide tax incentives to make it easier for new farmers to afford their first farm
6240137 will roll back corn based ethanol mandates which are contributing to the rising cost of food
6240138 the second generation of alcohol based fuels like cellulosic ethanol which wont compete with food crops are showing great potential
6240139 my top priority is making sure that people are able to get enough to eat and if it turns out that weve got to make changes in our ethanol policy to help people get something to eat then thats got to be the step we take
6240140 carry out a robust emergency food assistance program at a time when high food prices are hurting the neediest among us and indexing food stamps to reflect the current cost of living
6240141 help improve the mental and physical health of the family
6240142 direct the usda to carry out a comprehensive research approach to help develop more drought resistant higher yield crops and increase production per acre this will not only be critical to addressing our worldwide food needs but also necessary to combat global warming

6240144 i think its pretty interesting that their government can and does things like this
6240145 the underlying assumption is we know each other so well
6240146 thats baloney we are endlessly complex and always changing once romance wears off we tend to block the complicated places within ourselves those places where we are most scared in that way boredom is sort of dynamic self protection
6240147 there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past
6240148 the details of who did what to precipitate russias war against georgia are not very important
6240149 my fahdah often spoke of his dreams before tucking straw around us in our beds he would tell us that someday he envisioned himself having 6 wives 12 goats and a large herd of chickens i was inspired to dream of that myself
6240150 i believe that bin laden has been able to get into the good graces of omar who is very poorly educated and unsure of foreign affairs and to influence him in his way of thinking
6240151 the potential ramifications of a mullah omar who is drifting toward pan islamism are grim first and foremost it could mean that the taliban would under no condition expel bin laden because they see his cause as theirs
6240152 time for a diplomatic solution may be running out taliban brush off of our indictment and other evidence may indicate movement from tolerance
6240153 today the days of being cut off from the rest of the world while in the air become history
6240154 research has shown that good relationships and good sex education can raise the age that young people first try out sexual activity
6240155 most young people want to hear the facts from their parents or carers and be able to talk with them about body changes feelings and boyfriends or girlfriends
6240156 yet many parents and carers feel embarrassed or are not sure what to say
6240157 the speakeasy course was specially developed for those parents and carers to help them improve their communication skills with children and young people and to give them more confidence
6240158 while the core to improving lunchtime choices for scotlands teenagers is about supporting them with the information about good food and healthy eating the scottish government and local councils have to play their part as well
6240159 these young people are consumers who are making their own decisions
6240160 the problem was that after the plane crashed the area around it was engulfed in flames the firefighters could not get to the plane
6240161 that is why the helicopters came with their water tanks they were putting out the fire
6240162 from my seat i could see smoke coming up from the end of the runway there was a small mushroom cloud as you might expect after an explosion
6240163 when we came in to land the emergency services were alongside our plane as we slowed they overtook us and went straight to the crash scene
6240164 they were at the scene within two minutes there must have been about 80 or 90 ambulances on the scene by the time we got to the terminal i have never seen so many it was a constant stream which did not stop for about 20 to 25 minutes i could see flames coming from the tail end of the plane it looked like the left wing was broke and the aircraft was lying on its side
6240165 the scene is devastating the fuselage is destroyed the plane burnt i have seen a kilometre of charred land and few whole pieces of the fuselage
6240166 the plane was set to take off it was late on the second take off attempt that produced the fire on the motor of the plane which crashed very shortly after take off
6240167 they are pulling out burnt corpses the plane has been completely destroyed
6240168 the planes tail has broken off from the rest of the fuselage its difficult to describe the scene because its just a mess of metal
6240169 i was going home when i saw an airplane in front of me it seemed to be landing
6240170 i looked at it from the side and what caught my attention was the fact that it was trailing an immense cloud of sand in its wake but then i realised that it had taken off from the runway and i was scared i slowed down and when the plane suddenly veered to the right its right wing crashed to the ground at that point there was a big explosion
6240171 like other major models such as the boeing 737 jet the md 80 series has a long pedigree which dates back to the 1970s it has a safety record very similar to other big aisle planes of its kind spanair the company involved has a good safety record it was involved in one incident in 2001 in liverpool when its undercarriage was damaged on landing but on that occasion no one was hurt
6240172 identification could take until today which only compounds the suffering of families
6240173 the families are in shock people react in different ways some delay accepting whats happened we have to help them come to terms with reality the longer it takes the deeper is their suffering
6240174 often its a question of accompanying people in shock and helping them through the next stage of their trauma and managing practical details
6240175 first it could be that something further had gone wrong with the plane after the engine exploded another system may have gone down or there could have been a total loss of power
6240176 second it could be that pilots noticed something wrong and had been panicked into taking a course of action that was very unusual that would be a pilot mistake
6240177 she said mom im ok im home but i think somebody might have been in my house
6240178 she called again a few hours later with panic in her voice

6240188 theres no way we can offer blanket compensation in fact no telco will do that all telcos have clauses in their customer contracts that say we cant be held liable for consequential damages if communications networks go down
6240189 but we have asked our customers to contact us and work with their account managers if they have problems
6240190 the irony is that very few customers have got in contact with us about compensation most customers who contacted us were serious and obviously significant corporates
6240191 the industry is not in a sustainable position to invest in infrastructure until we get clarity on the national broadband network
6240192 until then we will not be able to finalise what we need to do in terms of investment nor will anyone else this is not exclusive to optus
6240193 social obligation in making sure everybody could participate in the next generation of broadband services because increasingly thats what people want
6240194 the great thing about bingo halls which have come from cinemas is they tend to retain many of the original features
6240195 the montrose gala bingo hall is no exception at the top of the first floor theres a balcony with tiered seating in it and lovely old cinema seats
6240196 its pretty disgraceful that in this day and age theres no cinema for the huge population between dundee and aberdeen
6240197 i recommend this seller he went beyond what was required of him to help

6240206 our darwin office closed six months ago and now we are losing all the rest it is difficult to see how we can possibly service remote areas such as queensland and the northern territory with the remaining staff
6240207 there used to be 10 technical staff in brisbane to look after southeast queensland now we have four and we have to cover all the areas handled by the closed offices
6240208 on top of that acma receives more than 8 million from the government to do digital television field strength measurements all over australia prior to the analogue switch off in 2013
6240209 this is to establish just what the problems are going to be and believe me there are some real problems
6240210 so far we have done about 1200 but they may have to be done again because there has been a rethink and there may have been a blunder in getting us to do the measurement at 2 5m antenna height instead of a more realistic height as found at most homes
6240211 unless this work is completed in time for translators and fill in transmitters to be installed there is a real risk that many thousands of people will be watching blank screens when analogue switches off
6240212 we have another team using new equipment replicating the tests done at 2 5m and the results they have been getting from their tests at a height of 10m show substantially the same results as the earlier readings
6240213 these cuts highlight the damage short sighted arbitrary efficiency dividend cuts can have
6240214 there are always unintended consequences and it appears in this instance that they may be very costly we are urging acma and the government to revisit this issue
6240215 social networking needs to get out from the houses and into the bars
6240216 because you have your phone with you when youre out it allows you to meet up with your online friends thats the real value
6240217 if you know you like absolut vodka and theres an absolut vodka party on youll go if your friends go
6240218 social networking is a reason to come back to a mobile site again and again
6240219 weve been massively surprised by the amount of usage and the number of times people come back
6240220 we offer myspace and video sharing site youtube on a capped package because theyre both quite data hungry

6240227 the wireless keypad comes with some cool features including a mode that turns the main key area into a touch pad similar to a touch pad on a laptop computer once in this mode you can slide your finger on this area to move the cursor on the screen and tap to enter
6240228 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6240229 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6240230 i didnt recognise you because you look younger than you did when i saw you before and havent you lost weight

6240233 es absurdo que las empresas que fabrican cemento en el pa s sean las responsables de la escasez de este producto al orientar un porcentaje de sus ventas al mercado exterior en detrimento de la demanda interna
6240234 seguir tomando medidas al respecto para que la falta de materiales e insumos del sector construcci n no afecte en modo alguno el crecimiento que viene experimentando este sector y que se priorice en la entrega de estos materiales a las obras p blicas vinculadas a los sectores salud educaci n e infraestructura

6240249 the uniqueness of our program is that we not only embrace eastern and western philosophies but we try to integrate the traditions of new mexico
6240250 keeping the body in balance staying healthy exercising eating healthy and doing good things in your life
6240251 to achieve one goal of health and wellness in our patients
6240252 thats different from a place where you can sense healing right from the beginning
6240253 its here because our consumers are wanting it our consumers are asking these questions so we have to go out and find the answers for them
6240254 a culture of dangerous clandestine binge drinking often conducted off campus has developed
6240255 pushes drinking into hiding heightening its risks including risks from drunken driving and it prevents us from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
6240256 as you would expect we have been in communication with the companies for months to receive updates and weve been communicating with their regulator and the federal reserve
6240257 we continue to be concerned about what dilution would be required to stabilize fannie and freddie and what that would leave over for existing shareholders
6240258 it could be something like a convertible preferred deal that might end up diluting shareholders but at the same time the rest of the capital structure winds up doing ok
6240259 the market sees that takeover as further illustrating the guarantee of the government
6240260 what mudd didnt say is that the company is too leveraged to a depreciating asset housing and losses are off the charts and there are no signs of stability
6240261 that delay will only be possible if the gses continue to be able to sell discount notes and term debt at relatively stable spreads
6240262 i would rather pay the bills off myself than have you be a part of my life
6240263 is to help them return to full productive lives through work
6240264 i was so proud of myself because now everyone has had the opportunity to say goodbye properly
6240265 i feel like i have said everything too and if i died tomorrow it would be sad but there would be no regrets
6240266 every parent thinks their son or daughter is special and we are no different adrian touched all who knew him were very proud of all his achievements in tragically such a short time
6240267 determined to get over this disease and reclaim my normal life as quickly as possible
6240268 i have a confession to make with a few exceptions i generally loathe blogs whos really interested in a pet cat someone buying new shoes or top tips on how to plant potatoes
6240269 i just hope my blogs dont fall into the unacceptable category of really bloody boring
6240270 ive been preparing for this eventuality now for the best part of 18 months ive led a decent life seen a lot of the world and been in a job ive enjoyed as for dying how can anyone be scared of something that is going to happen to every single one of us
6240271 i had this overwhelming sense of panic and deep breathing it was so strange
6240272 she wasnt doing anything threatening me with a wedgie or a chinese burn
6240273 i firmly believe that if our young adults are given all the facts about these important issues many more will go on to become donors themselves
6240274 true hero whose selflessness and courage made him an inspiration to all who knew him and to many who didnt
6240275 we conservatives believe that you dismissed our serious quest for responsible limited government
6240276 as a senator i understand that you have had to adopt a compromising stance with the democrats to get legislation passed
6240277 but in your quest for the presidency we want to know if it is in you to become a passionate and forceful leader with a conservative agenda to fight the lure of socialistic programs promoted by senator barack obama
6240278 i am supporting john mccain because hes ready to lead america
6240279 john mccain should be ashamed of himself not just for voting against protecting an american company like harley davidson but then for going in front of a group of motorcyclists in sturgis and pretending to be one of them
6240280 combine that with the steadfastness of the t the traditionally conservative region encompassing central northeast and northwest pennsylvania and he will be the next president of the united states
6240281 if mccain is himself then he will earn peoples respect which leads to their support and their vote
6240282 i was hoping and praying to god that hillary would not only win the pennsylvania primary but also the nomination
6240283 mccain is honest and he seems like a good christian man he has good character and courage to do whats right
6240284 i dont like obamas arrogant attitude obama doesnt have the experience in government and qualifications that we need
6240285 historically the campaigns will try and control the message as best they possibly can
6240286 the campaigns hope there wont be any surprises reporters of course hope there will be
6240287 cnn announced on tuesday that it would assign journalists to 10 cities across the united states a move that would double the number of domestic cities where the cable news network has outposts
6240288 we can see that the magnetic fields are crucial for these complex filaments both for their survival and for their integrity
6240289 we have to strengthen control measures in ivory trade to abide by provisions of the convention in in endangered species cites which requires specific legislation
6240290 and until that is in place dealing in ivory products will be prohibited
6240291 you wake up and have some inflammation thats basically what it is
6240292 if hes not ready we wont pitch him well back him up another couple days
6240293 thats the way it goes i dont think that is going to happen but if it did we would back him up and i told him that
6240294 well pitch him when hes ready to pitch and not because his day comes up
6240295 the point is that beckett is really wanting to throw and thats always a good sign
6240296 but the one thing we dont want to do is rush him back
6240297 playing soccer at depauw were some of the best years of my life
6240298 i feel lucky to have had the chance to continue my soccer career after high school at a place where i was surrounded by such incredible people
6240299 we had a good deal of success especially during my senior year and i feel honored to have been a part of the depauw soccer family as well as the depauw community
6240300 i feel like i received an opportunity from brad hauter that allowed me to grow and progress as a coach a lot faster had i not had the chance to work with the men my time as an assistant coach here was incredible
6240301 i admire and respect so much as a person and a coach he taught me so much about this game that i love and i owe it all to him i think one of the reasons we have been as successful as we have since i have been here is because brad and i were able to work so well together he allowed us to collaborate and we felt like a team of our own in a way
6240302 the insurance company said they had paid on it three times

6240304 that church has been built with fried chicken and fish plates

6240306 our engineering department is geared up to respond to situations quickly
6240307 it is important to us to keep the trains rolling so when something happens anywhere on the system we have teams ready to go
6240308 they will be using the old sections of track that go over it
6240309 last inspection prior to sundays event was about two weeks ago the bridge was scheduled to be replaced about two weeks from now before this happened
6240310 are inspected at least once annually the last formal inspection was march 2007 and at that time the corrosion was observed on the pilings and the bridge has been checked frequently since that date to check on changing conditions
6240311 no record of being contacted by outside parties regarding the condition of the bridge
6240312 is not investigating this bridge incident because it was not a train accident
6240313 norfolk southern is contracted by the north carolina railroad to maintain and inspect the bridges and we constantly monitor norfolk southerns bridge management practices we are satisfied with what they do but did not inspect this individual bridge
6240314 federal employees review the bridge management programs of the railroads and when we do audits we audit the actual inspection
6240315 we learned about it when norfolk southern advised us of the bridge failure they did call us right away and had already engaged a contractor to repair the bridge before the incident
6240316 hurricane katrina swept about five miles into the water and we had that back on line within two to three weeks
6240317 c e foys vision has been realized through the active participation and engagement of all 100 counties which have directed strengthened and enhanced the association
6240318 in many cases schools put barriers in the way of students trying to do two things at once
6240319 we have not organised schools on the assumption that kids might be in and out we need to reconstruct education and schooling to acknowledge that there are blurred boundaries
6240320 the agencies have a requirement for the provision of capabilities for the mobile biometric identification of persons in real or near real time at scene through biometric and associated information held by or accessed by the agencies
6240321 the highways agency is committed to ensuring that when incidents do occur on our network they are cleared as quickly and safely as possible through the use of this technology we hope to ensure the right resources are dispatched to the scene of an incident at the right time to enable the highways agency to keep traffic moving on the m25

6240326 you know what that relationship with that new friend neighbor co worker client whomever is not healthy it is not reciprocal it is not honoring it does not serve me positively it does not serve the other person positively i will not feed it any energy it is not what i want
6240327 when i saw that he won i jumped up and hugged and kissed my son
6240328 its kind of like revenge of the nerds but were not really nerds
6240329 we just dont really care that much my character is pregnant so i really dont feel like doing anything
6240330 theres still a lot of proving to do on my part
6240331 i just came from an audition with a big director
6240332 surprisingly katharine could throw down and was excellent at throwing in improv stuff
6240333 she was riffing for a good five minutes with the squeegee in hand
6240334 i had to be reminded that shes a big star in her world
6240335 o display de parede era gigantesco e o maior da loja por sinal

6240338 i dont know these people who got run over and i dont know these people that died but i am a mother and i feel for them and i am just glad that they put lights and we made history
6240339 those are all tragedies but what i do think is important is this is a resolution and that we never forget those who were lost those were all tragedies
6240340 we need more charter schools of high quality we dont just need more charter schools so idaho has a real focus on student achievement and high quality charter schools and sharing best practices
6240341 theres no way we can offer blanket compensation in fact no telco will do that all telcos have clauses in their customer contracts that say we cant be held liable for consequential damages if communications networks go down
6240342 but we have asked our customers to contact us and work with their account managers if they have problems
6240343 the irony is that very few customers have got in contact with us about compensation most customers who contacted us were serious and obviously significant corporates
6240344 the industry is not in a sustainable position to invest in infrastructure until we get clarity on the national broadband network
6240345 until then we will not be able to finalise what we need to do in terms of investment nor will anyone else this is not exclusive to optus
6240346 social networking needs to get out from the houses and into the bars
6240347 because you have your phone with you when youre out it allows you to meet up with your online friends thats the real value
6240348 if you know you like absolut vodka and theres an absolut vodka party on youll go if your friends go
6240349 social networking is a reason to come back to a mobile site again and again
6240350 weve been massively surprised by the amount of usage and the number of times people come back
6240351 we offer myspace and video sharing site youtube on a capped package because theyre both quite data hungry
6240352 two of the most popular services are uploading photos directly from your phone into your myspace account and streaming music
6240353 in australia youre probably looking at about 200 000 people using mobile social networking services
6240354 what weve offered the market for the launch of the product is a share of voice packages offering exclusivity in automotive fast moving consumer goods entertainment and financial services
6240355 essas pessoas falsificavam um suposto contrato de compra e venda falsificavam tamb m um carimbo de registro de im veis e com isso realizavam a venda de maneira irregular
6240356 the issues are similar to the defence force just because you dont have a war doesnt mean you disband the army navy and air force
6240357 our darwin office closed six months ago and now we are losing all the rest it is difficult to see how we can possibly service remote areas such as queensland and the northern territory with the remaining staff
6240358 there used to be 10 technical staff in brisbane to look after southeast queensland now we have four and we have to cover all the areas handled by the closed offices
6240359 on top of that acma receives more than 8 million from the government to do digital television field strength measurements all over australia prior to the analogue switch off in 2013
6240360 this is to establish just what the problems are going to be and believe me there are some real problems
6240361 so far we have done about 1200 but they may have to be done again because there has been a rethink and there may have been a blunder in getting us to do the measurement at 2 5m antenna height instead of a more realistic height as found at most homes
6240362 unless this work is completed in time for translators and fill in transmitters to be installed there is a real risk that many thousands of people will be watching blank screens when analogue switches off
6240363 we have another team using new equipment replicating the tests done at 2 5m and the results they have been getting from their tests at a height of 10m show substantially the same results as the earlier readings
6240364 these cuts highlight the damage short sighted arbitrary efficiency dividend cuts can have
6240365 there are always unintended consequences and it appears in this instance that they may be very costly we are urging acma and the government to revisit this issue
6240366 eu e mais um grupo de pessoas nos reunimos com um advogado para saber como resolver esta situa o n s acreditamos na faculdade e agora estamos sendo prejudicados no trabalho
6240367 a v tima e o pai dela representaram criminalmente contra os supostos autores e em face dos depoimentos que foram muito harmoniosos e coerentes eu representei pela pris o dos dois acusados n o descarto tamb m a participa o do menor de 16 anos neste epis dio

6240444 hasta el 2001 yo pagaba cerca de 200 000 pesetas 1 200 euros de contribuci n porque mi casa mide 600 metros cuadrados

6240446 mantener esta fachada cuesta una fortuna que no tenemos ahora nos van a cobrar el ibi casi que sale m s rentable dejar que las casas se caigan de viejas y vender el solar porque nosotros no ganamos para tanto
6240447 yo fui a pagar la contribuci n y el funcionario del ayuntamiento mir en una lista y me dijo que mi casa estaba exenta por eso me fui sin pagar y hasta la fecha

6240681 this study demonstrates the potential for personalized medicine combining selection of patients with a specific type of genetic mutation and a drug treatment that has been specifically designed to overcome that mutation
6240682 the publication of these ground breaking results in the lancet offers new hope to those patients with cf due to a nonsense mutation in the cftr gene and establishes a path forward for evaluating the efficacy and long term safety of ptc124
6240683 we are very pleased by this positive outcome from our ongoing collaboration with ptc
6240684 the development of ptc124 fits well with our strategic goal of supporting approaches that have the potential to modify the course of cf we are continuing to work together with ptc and the broader cf medical community to support the next steps in the evaluation of ptc124 for the clinical benefit for the treatment of nonsense mutation cf
6240685 in china human rabies was largely under control during the years 1990 1996 via nation wide rabies vaccination programmes since the end of the century however cases of human rabies have jumped high enough to trigger a warning sign for control and prevention
6240686 the use of human and equine rabies immunoglobulins hrig erig has saved the lives of countless patients who would have died if treated with vaccine alone however both products are often in short supply worldwide and are virtually unaffordable in developing countries
6240687 the four rabies endemic provinces lacked strictly enforced measures to eliminate dog rabies or an ample supply of modern cell culture rabies vaccines for humans

6240695 these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6240696 a developing fetus requires some exposure to maternal stress hormones as it normalizes their stress functioning
6240697 but women experiencing anxiety or excessive stress would do well to address it before a planned pregnancy and to have good social support systems

6240752 farmers organisations have been saying to us since we came into government how can we help stop fruit rotting on the vine
6240753 this is their practical proposal we have responded in a modest way with a pilot program over three years that is a practical piece of action farmers want it we have done it
6240754 kay hulls therefore i presume the national party the national farmers federation appear to be supporting the governments position yet we have mr nelson and mr robb rowing in exactly the reverse direction

6240773 i understand for a moment the dread which many feel in the presence of primeval desert the unconscious fear which compels them to tame alter or destroy what they cannot understand to reduce the wild and prehuman to human dimensions anything rather than confront directly the ante human that other world which frightens not through danger or hostility but in something far worse its implacable indifference

6240785 wmc supports as far as i can tell only very conservative republican candidates for office exclusively
6240786 the single biggest driver of our toxic political environment and thus the single biggest obstacle to the recovery of wisconsins economy
6240787 the very candidates i know they supported are the ones that have been harshest on the university and have diddled around with topics that that have nothing to do with economic development or the welfare of the state
6240788 most of the reasons that i came here to go to school and wanted to return are not true anymore

6240808 i still havent had final advice on whether its physically possible theyre getting back to me on that but i have confirmed that there are bladders around its theoretically possible but whether its practically possible im just not sure im still waiting for that additional advice
6240809 certainly defence stands ready to assist in any way we can
6240810 weve pretty much exhausted all the kind of practical options that you could possibly use here
6240811 we do need to be realistic that we are i guess getting towards the end of the process where were trying to balance the whales welfare with any hopes of rescue operations

6240865 the school did not merely find the confederate flag offensive to some students but rather found that in a context of high racial tensions race related altercations and threats of violence the flag would disrupt the schools educational process
6240866 we have all along felt it was in the best interest of our school environment to not allow any symbols that might be racially divisive in any way
6240867 its very clear this panel doesnt like the confederate flag
6240868 that was their starting point in coming to the decision they did the subject matter of the ban is not supposed to be relevant at all in a first amendment analysis
6240869 i am healing from surgery and will not be 100 for a few more weeks
6240870 im fighting in december at latest maybe november if i heal fast enough im not even sure why dana announced it i just talked to joe silva ufc matchmaker a week ago and it was assumed that it was december probably just a mix up

6240877 as well the proportion who reported becoming sexually active at a very early age decreased
6240878 however among those who were sexually active there was no significant change in the likelihood of having multiple partners or for males using condoms so while some adolescents have adopted measures to reduce their risks of sexually transmitted infection and unwanted pregnancy others report high risk behaviour
6240879 our study shows enduring benefits from lessons delivered by many different teachers

6240883 in my wildest dreams i didnt expect how enthusiastically the toronto community would receive my israel branding initiative
6240884 the media has lots of power but it is at best an agenda setter
6240885 in israels case people are already talking about it its on the agenda our job is to change the focus
6240886 this trio has come together in a significant way to help israel create a 1 million campaign based solely on new brand thinking
6240887 never has there been this scale of combination of business and philanthropy for israel
6240888 we want everyone to have a personal stake in this process
6240889 the idea behind brand initiative has been coalition building and with the conference we want to continue recruiting people within and outside the jewish community
6240890 the way to fix negative images of israel is to present israel in a positive light elsewhere
6240891 asia is important to israel its a major market both politically and culturally
6240892 but the direct relation to brand israel in canada is that these cultures hold their own weight in north america im very interested in inter community dialogue
6240893 this will be our modest contribution to the israeli muslim dialogue in toronto
6240894 an exceptional number of israeli cultural acts and scientific achievements
6240895 with local partners im confident everything we plan to do will happen regardless of the situation in israel
6240896 i had to dive for cover when one guy who we didnt want to put through when he auditioned brought his entire family in
6240897 id had the deciding vote and had turned him down so he didnt like me much
6240898 guess how many roads pay for themselves in taxes zero not a one most of them are less than 50 percent
6240899 imagine if youre a grocery a store owner and you decide im gonna sell sirloin at a buck a pound and im gonna sell milk at a dime a gallon thats basically whats happening with transportation were letting people use our roads for three cents a mile when it costs us 20 to 30 cents a mile
6240900 if the road gets really congested you just raise the price until some people decide to use alternatives and that road is free flow
6240901 when you can tell people and you can tell businesses that they have a in traveling from a to b at all times i think thats really valuable for your economy and i think its also good for your quality of life
6240902 our engineers have put together an incredible processing family here that will include a tremendous amount of new processor features all centred on delivering faster computer performance and terrific energy efficiency
6240903 it is an honor and a privilege for you to cover the new york jets
6240904 but you have an obligation to hold up your end of the bargain by being objective and fair in what you report yet you didnt do that
6240905 the result largely due to mike nugents missed 23 yard fg attempt to tie the game as time expired it hit the left upright along with a 43 yard miss earlier was the only disappointment for the jets
6240906 but it hardly mattered this was all about favres debut and he didnt disappoint

6240936 death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us
6240937 it is the curse of the thinking classes to imagine they can reason even the bloodiest mass murderer into peace
6240938 show me just what mohammed brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached
6240939 only through force and victory over the enemies is there security and repose
6240940 the apes are jews the people of the sabbath while the swine are christians the infidels of the communion of jesus
6240941 fighting infidels until they either convert to islam or submit to muslims as dhimmis is still considered by islamists to be a religious duty
6240942 the militants believe that controlling one country will rally the muslim masses enabling them to overthrow all moderate governments in the region and establish a radical islamic empire that spans from spain to indonesia
6240943 iraq would serve as the base of a new islamic caliphate to extend throughout the middle east and which would threaten
6240944 we are saluting to the spirit of our hero shahid
6240945 we tell them in as much as you love life the muslim loves death and martyrdom palestinians hit a new low setting up a boy unknowingly to become a suicide bomber palestinian children die as human shields for adult terrorist leaders israel tears for palestine child may 21 2006 it was always the case arab muslim leaders have been using abusing their kids as human bombs human shields or as general pawns in their propaganda war to smear israeli defenders
6240946 death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us
6240947 there will be continuing enmity until everyone believes in allah we will not meet the enemy halfway and there will be no room for dialogue with them
6240948 islam does not coincide or make a truce with unbelief but rather confronts it the confrontation that islam calls for with these godless and apostate regimes does not know socratic debates platonic ideals nor aristotelian diplomacy but it knows the dialogue of bullets the ideals of assassination bombing and destruction and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine gun
6240949 asphalta asphalta look around theres a parking spot that cant be found
6240950 there are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke but you and i weve been through that and this is not our fate so let us not talk falsely now the hour is getting late
6240951 we have the potential to drastically reduce the incidence of cancer with the introduction of the hpv vaccine
6240952 two vaccines against cervical cancer are being widely used without sufficient evidence about whether they are worth their high cost or even whether they will effectively stop women from getting the disease
6240953 one drawback with investing in a blu ray player is that the consumer needs to purchase their existing titles again on blu ray in order to take advantage of the higher picture quality offered by blu ray

6240955 the greatest challenge to u s security and world stability today
6240956 saw the glamour of it i think he really got smitten with the celebrity of power
6240957 what were seeing now is a clear regrouping and also again some kind of deception campaign saying look were moving out
6240958 they are going around now and trying to grab new strategic areas in georgia
6240959 we still believe this is not all that this is just a beginning
6240960 dreaming to turn my country into chechnya into some kind of insurgency warfare field where they go around and operate with brutal force
6240961 the last thing im worried about is about my political future right now
6240962 mistakenly looked at this group of students as her peer group
6240963 its all designed just to keep everyone guessing and speculating generating more coverage
6240964 of course we comply like charlie brown trying to kick lucys football
6240965 i believe my previous community experience coupled with the public policy roles i had at the state level will allow me to continue to provide the proven leadership that has characterized our city commission

6240967 la vinculaci n que el padre antonio g mez ha tenido siempre con la fiesta de la vendimia nos ha animado a cerrar el programa de actos con la inauguraci n oficial de esta zona verde que la ciudad de montilla quiso dedicarle en su d a
6240968 una de las personas m s queridas y respetadas de nuestra localidad
6240969 durante el transcurso de una fiesta que tendr lugar el s bado 13 de septiembre en el propio parque se proceder al descubrimiento del busto que realiz en 2005 el joven escultor montillano rafael jurado
6240970 si hubiera que identificar las casas nuevas con una persona casi sin lugar a dudas ser a el habitante de la casa parroquial una imagen habitual en cualquier calle y en cualquier acontecimiento donde considere necesaria su presencia con su sotana su palabra reposada y su imagen de serenidad querido y respetado por todos al margen de creencias religiosas
6240971 by accelerating our enterprise growth and executing well across the portfolio hp delivered a strong third quarter performance our global position broad product and services offerings and incremental cost saving opportunities make us confident that we will continue to meaningfully expand earnings
6240972 the collaboration between microsoft and novell has been built on our desire to meet our customers real life it requirements as well as give our partners greater breadth in their solution offerings
6240973 some customers have told us they want to be able to run windows server and linux together seamlessly but in many cases they need help with the transition to suse linux enterprise server from other linux environments
6240974 they said it couldnt be done this is a new model and a true evolution of our relationship
6240975 resolving our patent issues enables a combined focus on virtualization and web services management to create new opportunities for our companies and our customers
6240976 cross platform interoperability is something that we all want and need to achieve but its difficult to accomplish this
6240977 the pragmatic approach microsoft and novell are taking to address this complex challenge including ip assurance through engineering as well as offering tangible support and training programs will make it easier for us to develop a path forward
6240978 her public position and the symbol of this chair are in direct conflict
6240979 this chair is a powerful visible symbol of roman catholic theology and in roman catholic theology abortion is disallowed
6240980 it appears to me that some right wing group has put pressure on the university
6240981 shes done seminal work on christian feminism social justice and the relationship between religion and ecology
6240982 this is a woman who is in favor of abortion in favor of contraception homosexuality and women priests
6240983 i mean how much more anti catholic can you get
6240984 rosemary ruether is like the godmother of the feminist theologian movement
6240985 its just criminal to disinvite her from the university of san diego
6240986 any appeal to the principle of academic freedom in order to justify positions that contradict the faith and the teaching of the church would obstruct or even betray the universitys identity and mission
6240987 im openly gay and im teaching at a jesuit institution
6240988 as a catholic institution for higher education our understanding of ourselves is that we are to uphold the churchs teachings on abortion and other subjects as the holy father calls for
6240989 chair holders are to be distinguished theologians who think from within the roman catholic tradition while exploring and expressing the tradition in contemporary contexts
6240990 first of all what people are doing in their personal life has nothing to do with what youre going to teach
6240991 nbn is going to be a good thing for all equipment vendors we watch with intent as the debate plays out
6240992 the nbn architecture will likely be built very differently from the way dsl networks have been architected in the past
6240993 telstra has a much larger equipment and installed base so you could argue they dont need to invest as much whereas others will have to build out more
6240994 we expect customers to transition to junos over time as they see the benefits of running a single operating system across their network infrastructure
6240995 the news that twelve southern african nations have set up of a free trade area is a clear indication that africa has started looking inwards for market the bid to strengthen regional exchange of goods and economic integration for a market of 247 million people and an economy worth more than 430 billion will be an extra mile covered as far as the quest for african economic integration is concerned the accord that was made during the 28th sadc southern african development community summit of the 15 nation in johannesburg will indeed make sadc an attractive trading area the bloc includes angola botswana zambia malawi lesotho madagascar mauritius mozambique namibia seychelles swaziland tanzania south africa zimbabwe and the democratic republic of congo angola seychelles and congo have yet to sign the agreement other african regional trade blocs such as economic community of west african states ecowas common market for eastern and southern africa comesa and east africa community eac ought to emulate this move in order to avail an estimated 1 billion people market to african entrepreneurs the need for economic integration is not only about the removal of tariff barriers but should focus on building both productive and trade capacity there is a need to expand agriculture and industrial base as well to promote intra regional trade for this to be practical enough hard work dedication and unswerving commitment is necessary from the member states to mobilise resources available so as to meet the objective of strengthening trade in africa to accelerate economic growth and reduce poverty in the continent various member countries need to develop structures and strengthen supply the regions should also diversify their productive capacity to expand the range of products that can be traded in striving to increase the value addition of the products this will accelerate development in africa
6240996 es una media cancha con experiencia la de cruz azul
6240997 ser fundamental que no nos equivoquemos que hagamos un partido perfecto un partido inteligente
6240998 y tratar de ser m s claros en la parte ofensiva que no nos desesperamos y las pocas o muchas opciones de gol que se puedan producir seamos certeros para sacar el resultado que necesitamos
6240999 es una media cancha con experiencia la de cruz azul gente que est en la selecci n pero nosotros tenemos gente de igual experiencia y nos recargamos en todo eso
6241000 nos rezagamos con el partido pasado obviamente pasan las jornadas y de repente te apuras es inicio de torneo y no debemos dejar puntos y m s que vamos con un rival de peso
6241001 el equipo est preparado para eso y m s tenemos gente que va a suplir las ausencias y les tenemos confianza y trataremos de ayudarles en todos los aspectos
6241002 en estos ltimos a os jugu de doble contenci n me gusta m s ah pero estoy para lo que el profe ricardo la volpe decida si me pone por afuera de carrilero en la contenci n de diez como le llama l ayudando a lucho y si es por la derecha trato de poner mi mejor esfuerzo
6241003 ojal que sea as como digo y que los chicos puedan ganar la medalla de oro y que tambi n puedan hacer lo mismo los de baloncesto y que las leonas hockey puedan quedarse con la de bronce porque se lo merecen
6241004 ojo nigeria es un buen equipo hay que respetarlos pero yo conf o mucho en este equipo en el checho el seleccionador sergio batista en su ayudante el tata jos luis brown y por eso estoy confiado
6241005 se merecen el oro por todo el esfuerzo y las ganas que est n poniendo
6241006 siempre vengo a visitar a los muchachos porque me siento muy c modo con ellos y porque veo una selecci n que juega muy bien que el otro d a tuvo un rendimiento superlativo ante brasil 3 0 y me pone muy contento
6241007 esperemos que estos chicos puedan contagiar a los mayores tambi n
6241008 gracias a dios la victoria lleg en buen momento y ahora tenemos un partido muy dif cil sabemos que chivas en su casa va a ser complicado se est trabajando bien y ojal que se empiecen a dar los resultados como el del domingo
6241009 sabemos que estamos recuperando jugadores importantes a lo largo de estos dos a os han jugado y lo han hecho bien por ah se sinti un poquito la ausencia de algunos jugadores pero como el otro d a que lleg christian ben tez y anot un gol de vuelta est n juan pablo rodr guez iv n estrada y daniel ludue a que ya est pr cticamente a las par nuestra y siempre los queremos tener en la cancha
6241010 no es el objetivo primordial sabemos que tenemos que ganar y bienvenidos sean los goles esos siempre los quiero hacer quiero participar en jugadas ofensivas pero la verdad es que vino bien en lo personal porque hab a tenido dos situaciones que hab a fallado pero lo mejor es que le vino bien al equipo
6241011 chivas es un equipo que tiene mucha din mica y arriesga bastante entonces creo que tenemos que hacer un partido inteligente tratar de estar bien parados y poder sacarles la pelota porque cuando la tenemos somos muy complicados debemos estar un poquito m s finos porque hemos perdido algunas pelotas inteligentes pero esperemos que se nos de un buen partido el s bado
6241012 siempre va a ver pol mica cuando convocan a un naturalizado
6241013 hay gente capacitada para estar ah pero siempre va a haber pol mica cuando convocan a un naturalizado a la selecci n eso es m s que claro y ahora son tres l gicamente que se levanta el polvo otra vez pero lo nico que uno puede hacer es desearle lo mejor a la selecci n
6241014 que se hable pero que se hable con congruencia que hablen cosas positivas cosas que puedan mejorar y que puedan aportar dentro del futbol mexicano cada vez que hablan de eso es para destruir y para se alar a alguien entonces para m es un tema que est enterrado
6241015 ya dije que no me importa el tema ese ya se ha hablado de m s para m ya es algo que prefiero pasar a segundo t rmino porque no merece ni siquiera estar platicando porque son tonter as lo que dicen
6241016 me sent bien sin ning n problema l gicamente que es poco a poco todav a no puedo jugar un partido completo para no arriesgar pero me siento bien contento confiado en que muy pronto estar al cien por ciento
6241017 es l gico que no es de lo mejor la victoria frente a puebla fue bastante buena nos reencontramos con la victoria y la necesit bamos pero bueno estamos conscientes de que tenemos que mejorar ya lo platicamos ya sabemos que tenemos que mejorar much simo en cuanto a varios puntos y lo bueno que la conciencia est en que debemos mejorar
6241018 el t cnico ya se dio cuenta que llegar a un equipo como ste que es el m s grande de m xico no ser f cil ya que todos los equipos le van a jugar como hasta ahora nos lo han demostrado al salir a darlo todo contra nosotros lo cual lo hace mayormente complicado sin embargo a pesar de nuestros resultados todo va por buen camino y seguramente durante estos d as el entrenador nos va a decir algo para revertir esta situaci n y sacar adelante al equipo
6241019 obviamente hay fallitas por corregir en todas las l neas pero afortunadamente son m nimas creo que las m s importantes por trabajar son aquellas jugadas en las que nos hemos descuidado y han aprovechado los rivales para hacernos da o
6241020 uno est para ganar siempre y estar en los primeros lugares creo que una victoria este fin de semana nos ayudar a bastante a recuperar confianza y a sacar buenos resultados en las jornadas restantes del torneo y de esa manera conseguirlo
6241021 adem s debemos aprovechar al m ximo que estaremos de locales en un estadio como lo es el azteca que impone a los rivales
6241022 no me incomoda para nada ser de color lo que pasa es que ltimamente con tanto problemita que he tenido
6241023 ser a bueno cambiar de color por un ratico para ver la gente como me ve si me ven diferente si paso desapercibido si ya no me buscan tanto si puedo hacer cosas que hace la gente com n y corriente normal y que nadie dice nada ser a por eso
6241024 no me incomoda para nada ser de color lo que pasa es que ltimamente con tanto problemita que he tenido el ltimo haber disparado con un fusil en abril pasado pens que puede ser por racismo porque como siempre me han perseguido por el hecho de ser famoso entonces nunca le hab a prestado atenci n a lo del racismo y esta vez acept el reto de intentar cambiar de color a ver si los problemas que se presentan son por el color o soy yo
6241025 es que a medida que pasa el tiempo he tenido tantos problemas que quisiera ver como la gente me ver a de otro color para ver si le prestamos m s atenci n a tanto racismo que hay en colombia y en el mundo porque tambi n lo viv en italia muchas veces sobretodo en los estadios
6241026 cuando uno tiene un problema siempre me sacan a relucir cosas del pasado y siempre quieren mostrar que yo soy el malo y yo creo que una parte es uno y otra parte creo que es el color que uno carga encima porque sin lugar a dudas me hubieran juzgado diferente si hubiera tenido otro color
6241027 en este momento tengo unos 25 caballos desde ni o siempre me gustaron las pel culas del oeste las ve a por los caballos me gustaba el caballo del llanero solitario ve a a john wayne ve a bonanza porque me gustaban los de los indios
6241028 men have to respect women but women have no reason to respect men
6241029 man is not a balloon going up into the sky nor a mole burrowing merely in the earth but rather a thing like a tree whose roots are fed from the earth while its highest branches seem to rise almost to the stars
6241030 tipico giorno estivo scrive dub ek nella sua autobiografia caldo con un sole velato praga era piena di turisti intere famiglie passeggiavano o sedevano nei parchi la citt anzi lintero paese era tranquillo era impossibile pensare che nel giro di poche ore i carri armati sovietici ci avrebbero assalito
6241031 i would like to commend the rcmp the combined forces special enforcement unit cfseu and international law enforcement partners for the hard work and coordinated efforts in project colisee which led to this apprehension and the seizure of illicit drugs the seizure of 300 kilograms of cocaine sends a strong message to anyone involved in the illicit drug trade this arrest is consistent with ongoing efforts of canadian law enforcement to tackle serious drug related crime through inter jurisdictional and cross border cooperation the government of canada continues to recognize that illicit drugs undermine healthy families and safe communities fuel organized crime and foster petty crime as part of our governments national anti drug strategy we have invested 8 9 million in the rcmp and 3 3 million in the canada border services agency cbsa to enhance their abilities to target illegal drug producers and traffickers
6241032 siempre tuve el sue o de formar parte de un equipo como ste
6241033 el apoyo de mis compa eros me da mucha confianza
6241034 el se or tena me dio una gran oportunidad en la en segunda divisi n despu s en poco tiempo fui a brasil con cecilio de los santos quien me fue dando continuidad para posteriormente formar parte del grupo de la primera a en la que fue un gran par metro para llegar hasta aqu pues en este inicio de torneo contra santos de primera a hice un buen trabajo que permiti que el se or ram n d az me diera esta gran oportunidad de subir al primer equipo
6241035 soy medio de contenci n pero si se requiere jugar de otra forma lo har a porque la final de cuentas el t cnico es quien decide c mo se juegue pero sobre todo porque quiero aprovechar esta oportunidad al m ximo y mantenerme con este grupo ya que siempre tuve el sue o de jugar en primera y sobre todo tener la satisfacci n de formar parte de uno de los mejores equipos del pa s
6241036 hasta el momento me he sentido muy bien a pesar de que es poco el tiempo que he estado con este grupo el recibimiento que tuve por parte de mis compa eros sebasti n dom nguez federico ins a salvador caba as y guillermo ochoa fue formidable lo cual me da mucha confianza para hacer bien las cosas cuando se me presente jugar
6241037 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
6241038 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
6241039 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
6241040 probably fannie mae and freddie mac despite what u s treasury secretary hank paulson said these giant mortgage guarantee agencies are not going to exist in their present form in a few years
6241041 there was this view early on in the crisis that sovereign wealth funds could save everybody investment banks did something stupid they lost money in the sub prime theyre great buys sovereign wealth funds come in and make a lot of money by buying them
6241042 that view neglects the point that the financial system has become very bloated in size and needed to shrink
6241043 cutting interest rates is going to lead to a lot of inflation in the next few years in the united states
6241044 men have to respect women but women have no reason to respect men
6241045 you need a break well you need to be able to keep your head together
6241046 you have to scrap that because youve got to have time
6241047 and that is exactly what politics is all about the judgment you bring to make decisions
6241048 and the truth is that weve got a bunch of smart people i think who know ten times more than we do about the specifics of the topics
6241049 next week is strictly devoted to the rally people all of the out of town bikers and people that come in if they get stranded were here to help them
6241050 some of them are rupturing causing a loss of fuel pressure in the instance the bike will start and run itll idle but you wont have any acceleration the bike will sputter and spit and you wont be able to drive it
6241051 were shutting down layton avenue from 60th street to about where 63rd would be just past our west drive ways and its going to be vendors and food and entertainment we have a lot of really special things going on
6241052 it is not the men who wear shoes that hurt their feet
6241053 essa nova rela o da agricultura com o meio ambiente se resume em mais prote o e mais produ o ou seja a gente n o quer quebrar a produ o nem reduzir a prote o

6241231 we have realized that if there are any limiting factors at all such as insufficient snowmaking temperatures or early season snow it is impossible for us to construct and open a super pipe that meets our standards at a reasonable point in the season

6241233 we have the ability to make a small amount of man made snow compared to other resorts
6241234 of course weve never needed much snowmaking because we have such great natural coverage and relatively uncrowded slopes but building the super pipe each year required a large majority of the snowmaking ability we do have

6241236 it was a best case scenario season and it took us until early january to open the pipe

6241244 that being said it really is the right decision its a more responsible use of the resources we have and it will allow us to do an even better job of making the fishbowl a world class terrain park experience im looking forward to the future

6241266 so weve made a conscious decision that were not going to plan on offering something knowing ahead of time that it may not live up to our standards and public expectations
6241267 we have the ability to make a small amount of man made snow compared to other resorts
6241268 of course weve never needed much snowmaking because we have such great natural coverage and relatively uncrowded slopes but building the super pipe each year required a large majority of the snowmaking ability we do have
6241269 last winter the resort got 426 inches of natural snow
6241270 it was a best case scenario season and it took us until early january to open the pipe
6241271 of course there are many people including almost everyone who works here who enjoyed skiing and riding the pipe
6241272 but when you consider the electricity the millions of gallons of water and hundreds of gallons of diesel that go into building a super pipe it really matters how many of our guests are using it in our case the demand didnt stack up against the time water and fuel being used it was a hard decision to make but in the end it seemed like an irresponsible thing to continue doing
6241273 the pipe was difficult to deliver and demand was light but the fishbowl overall was by far the largest busiest and most polished its ever been
6241274 theyll be for everyday fun our competition boarder cross courses are closed to the public when we build them so itll be exciting to offer something similar to everyone
6241275 the quarter pipe will give riders an opportunity to do the same kinds of tricks you see done in a half pipe
6241276 but well be able to build and maintain it much more consistently
6241277 its sad to lose something weve all worked so hard on the last few years
6241278 that being said it really is the right decision its a more responsible use of the resources we have and it will allow us to do an even better job of making the fishbowl a world class terrain park experience im looking forward to the future
6241279 i dont think so but i do think that like us russia is quite paranoid or as woody allen once quipped
6241280 he behaved like god and tried to control everything in my life

6241292 the disproportion of the military force used by russia against georgia belongs then to the deep history that remains common to both peoples the other certainty no less historical is the bankruptcy of the hegemonic role of the united states driven by a resentment as irrational as it is mean spirited the american republic has continued to practice the delusional encirclement of post soviet russia without a doubt the twisted minds at the inept cias langley headquarters or the brains at the pentagon have dreamed of having their own cuba reference to the cuban missile crisis they thought they had found it in georgia with their agent of influence the current president saakachvili
6241293 and just like that retard fidel castro who in 1962 wanted to launch atom bombs against washington before the terrified eyes of his reckless allies in moscow here we have
6241294 in the first place put a permanent end to the logic of force to which russia has tendency to give in to then definitely inhibit the use of force by giving russia the decent and necessary place that it must occupy in the construction of europe in addition we must not push ukraine toward confrontation with russia but also for russia do everything possible to ensure its historic reconciliation with our polish and turkish allies this is a very tough but indispensable road
6241295 we saw a lot of good work and a lot of good effort all the way through the five two a days
6241296 we have tried to reorganize the practice itinerary from day to day the order we do the drills and the length of practice and there is no doubt the players have appreciated a change in the routine over the last 21 practices
6241297 mentally they had to be a little bit sharper because they didnt know exactly what was coming next in practice
6241298 today was a little bit of a relief getting through the last of two a days
6241299 we can see the light at the end of the tunnel we have been able to get through it because we have high expectations for ourselves and we havent lost sight of our goals also the coaches have done a good job of making sure our bodies and our minds stay healthy
6241300 this has been different than the last couple of years
6241301 we have so many guys now that know what they need to do to be successful i think we have the right attitude this year because we have so many veteran leaders
6241302 arkansas has an excellent new coaching staff so we dont know exactly what were going to get on offense defense or in the kicking game
6241303 were preparing well for arkansas but were also preparing for the entire season even if it ends up varying from what arkansas gives us it will be things that we will see down the road
6241304 were getting the best looks possible from our scout team
6241305 more than anything were working on running our own schemes as effectively as possible so we can respond to whatever they throw at us

6241330 coming together of voice facsimile data video and image applications systems and networks both wireline and wireless
6241331 most of these offerings are bundles of voice and broadband internet combinations we have also seen some telecoms and pay tv bundles
6241332 the service is fully converged both from a technology or delivery platform perspective and also from a service perspective since the voice and internet components of the service are indivisible
6241333 hdtv is the most bandwidth hungry the most powerful application of television that you can have today
6241334 but the broadcast itself will be hdtv capable and that has implications for the broadcasting infrastructure

6241336 casual use of enormous amounts of bandwidth which unfortunately you guys cant contemplate yet is part of what you want to change in south africa
6241337 imagine you pay an internet access bill once its a flat rate and you do whatever you damn well please

6241344 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6241345 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6241346 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist

6241360 i think the folks at nike do want to come out of the games with a big win they have the luxury of multiple opportunities for that
6241361 not that they arent winning medals all over the place

6241363 its really been fun to watch and to watch this u s basketball team perform

6241373 the report found that in the 13 southern states where corporal punishment is most prevalent african american students are punished at 1 4 times the rate that would be expected given their numbers in the student population and african american girls are 2 1 times more likely to be paddled than might be expected there is no evidence that these students commit disciplinary infractions at disproportionate rates
6241374 the report documents several cases in which children were beaten to the point of serious injury since educators who beat children have immunity under law from assault proceedings parents who try to pursue justice for injured children encounter resistance from police district attorneys and courts parents also face enormous sometimes insurmountable obstacles in trying to prevent physical punishment of their children while some school districts permit parents to sign forms opting out of corporal punishment for their children the forms are often ignored

6241381 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6241382 it is an agreement which will help us to respond to the threats of the 21st century

6241404 a bortion foes are now accusing sen barack obama of being an abortion rights extremist
6241405 a bortion foes are now accusing sen barack obama of being an abortion rights extremist
6241406 at issue is a measure in both illinois and congress called the born alive infants protection act which defines as a protected human any life expelled from a mother abortion foes championed the cause when an illinois nurse and antiabortion activist said some pre viable fetuses were being aborted by inducing labor and then being allowed to die
6241407 obama then a state senator opposed the measure in 2001 saying it crossed the line of constitutionality and essentially says that a doctor is required to provide treatment to a pre viable child or fetus
6241408 but weisman did not note that in addition to saying that the bill was constitutionally problematic obama has also said it wasnt necessary he has
6241409 existing illinois law already requires doctors to provide medical care in the very rare case that babies are born alive during abortions
6241410 some pre viable fetuses were being aborted by inducing labor and then being allowed to die
6241411 w hat they were alleging were violations of existing law we took the allegations very seriously
6241412 shafer told me that the 1999 investigation reviewed logs personnel files and medical records
6241413 because what they were alleging were violations of existing law
6241414 the allegation that infants were allowed to expire in a utility room could not be substantiated and all staff interviewed denied that any infant was ever left alone
6241415 essentially says that a doctor is required to provide treatment to a pre viable child or fetus
6241416 believes it is proper to kill a baby that has survived an abortion
6241417 then im going to be waiting for the weekend because im going to crash during that time
6241418 i dont care if they have adhd or not they have to have those parameters in order to be successful
6241419 its kind of surprising to have it at the library
6241420 because they usually dont have that kind of stuff here its usually books and computers
6241421 were always looking for ways to attract teens into our libraries
6241422 we thought the games might be one of the ways to do it
6241423 as soon as the kids found them theyve made that part of their library experience
6241424 that would be pretty cool because then you can try out new games before you buy them
6241425 you might buy a game thats 50 and theyll play it for a week and be done with it
6241426 theyll probably like it that were going to the library more
6241427 tell them were going to get books but were really getting video games
6241428 i bet every truly dedicated oprah watcher knows what my feet cannot live without
6241429 if downstream brokerages deliberately stuck their heads in the sand but continued to actively market these products to unknowing investors that will certainly be relevant to our calculus of the firms culpability
6241430 these firms are licensed broker dealers and were obviously well paid by their clients for their specialized knowledge and diligence regarding the appropriateness of various products as investments
6241431 i honor his service i dont honor his policies i dont honor his politics
6241432 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6241433 i have never suggested that picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6241434 the bottom line is that sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much

6241436 ea sports tennis will be available late 2009 for the wii and next generation consoles
6241437 as we look to expand the ea sports brand and captivate sports fans from around the world with rich new interactive experiences it was obvious that the renaissance were seeing in the sport of tennis provides us with a big opportunity
6241438 our new tennis franchise coming first to the wii will put fans right into the action and provide the excitement tension and drama that true champions feel in legendary matches like the classic from wimbledon just last month
6241439 we are a small rural district in the bible belt with strong christian beliefs and feel like homosexuality is wrong
6241440 i dont think we are that different from a lot of districts at least in the panhandle that have beliefs that maybe are different from societal changes
6241441 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6241442 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
6241443 i just felt like i had to stand up for the kids heather wanted to do this and i had to back her
6241444 gsm global system for mobile communications was designed from the first day to allow consumers to use any handset they want in the u s the mobile operators mobility in particular have made it clear you can do so im sure there will be subsidized handsets for a long time but more and more people are learning they can have exactly the cell phone they want regardless of whether the operator has decided to sell it
6241445 it has a much more sleek modern feel to it the treo in its day was a pretty cutting edge device in terms of form factor this puts palm back in the game competitively from a design standpoint its using the latest version of windows mobile 6 1 which is a rock solid os for mobile functionality it will appeal to people using it for business as well as consumers who may just be interested in it for personal use
6241446 it looks like a very very solid offering from palm it doesnt come a moment too soon it comes at time when they need to refresh the treo brand as the premium brand relative to the centro
6241447 its not clear if its enough to attract customers relative to competing offerings at some level its a battle between usability and sex appeal the pros improvements are well conceived and reflect a strong voice of the customer design orientation which should at least be enough to keep current aficionados loyal
6241448 this would be a much stronger launch if a carrier was already lined up but more and more companies are entering into this space and offering it as a choice for their customers
6241449 that is a concern for palm since they are the only gms carrier that has a full scale initiative to serve business users
6241450 the at amp t mobility group that focuses on the enterprise is heavily promoting the iphone however there are many obstacles with the iphone in enterprise it would be unfortunate if at amp t had rejected palm in favor of focusing on the iphone and blackberry
6241451 i didnt mean to do this a lot of innocent people died i dont deserve to live i apologize for everything please pray for me please
6241452 food prices tend to go up pretty quickly and they tend to stick on the way down

6241472 we wanted to do something really different with the house of the dead overkill
6241473 with sega weve been able to create a fresh look for the franchise i think youll agree its like nothing youve seen before on wii
6241474 the refreshing new visual style bold art direction and visceral gameplay of the house of dead overkill truly makes it standout on the wii
6241475 sega is committed to delivering unique gameplay experiences and the house of the dead overkill certainly qualifies as one of our most innovative sega games coming to the wii
6241476 this is by far the most exciting cast we have in over 13 years of shooting live action movies for command amp conquer
6241477 the caliber of the performances we received both individually and collectively have really raised the storytelling bar for the franchise we are really excited that we will be delivering such a high quality production that is on par with movies and television shows
6241478 i wasnt sure what to expect when i came in to work on a video game
6241479 what i realized is red alert 3 is not just a video game its absolutely an interactive movie this is where the people at home get to move the story forward and where seeing the plot thicken is a reward for a job well done and thats really cool
6241480 i think video games are one of the new frontiers for actors and using live action is just another way to connect more easily to the gamer rather than cg or animation techniques
6241481 to be in a groundbreaking game like red alert 3 where we are using full on shooting of live actors and to be with jonathan pryce tim curry and peter stormare it was a great opportunity for a character actor like me to have some fun
6241482 isnt the perfect relationship about filling in those holes in each other so that two people become one yeah thats what i thought sadly but i dont know really i used to have all these opinions about love because im fierce a helpless romantic what happened is my expectations about romance were there motions to one side of the table then the other but what was really happening was here the elastic stretched so much it cracked and now im more realistic about things i love so many people your mate doesnt have to replace everything i dont know and im not going to pretend i do its back to basics being self sufficient now im back to how i was as a kid when i used to spend most of my time alone so im spending time by myself and enjoying it very much it sounds sad but when i was a kid i didnt really have friends the most magical moments i had in my life i had alone like climbing mountains or swimming or singing or listening to music
6241483 hooray i am done with high school and about to start at the university in a few weeks

6241537 this is security theatre a photo op for the bank holiday traveller all the trials have been run on facial recognition almost everywhere have been dismal failures to suggest that this is any security benefit is a joke for anyone following the technology
6241538 our members are being told not to volunteer for the technology until the concerns have been addressed about reliability and whether it can do what the government wants it to do there is an issue of national security here
6241539 over reliance on technology was putting the security of the public at risk
6241540 the uk is undergoing the biggest shake up in its borders for nearly 40 years britains border security is now among the toughest in the world the new facial recognition gates undertake checks against security watch lists in the same way as the current manual control the trial will tell us whether these gates can maintain the high level of entry security we have introduced to the uk

6241546 i think it did so well at test screenings and at the box office because its theme was universal weve all experienced a sense of loss in our lives
6241547 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
6241548 do you think its right that a legally drunk person who deliberately gets behind the wheel and kills an innocent child be let off with a slap on the wrist
6241549 the gypsies were not a numerous people and so the statistics concerning their extermination is unimpressive if you are impressed chiefly by numbers there were just a few less than half a million who died thus but when one human creature dies a whole world of hope and memory and feeling dies with him to be robbed of a natural death is a terrible deprivation

6241564 the trend now is that foreign investment should be better controlled
6241565 we are still waiting for the details though in principle we agree with the decision however we dont think it is necessary for local investors to have the majority stake maybe the state should fix a minimum algerian participation like 10 per cent
6241566 the clans dont really want fdi and now that we have massive hydrocarbons revenues we can defend our mamlouk interests and posture as tiers mondistes populists the gullible left will eat th is up
6241567 if a foreign investor will not have a controlling stake how is he going to bring his best people to algeria to manage his project
6241568 obviously they feel comfortable about this because they are so cash rich
6241569 they want to be able to control who gets to invest in algeria
6241570 but our problem is not the identity or nationality of investors but the fact that investments are not creating jobs
6241571 thats a lot of wood to be hanging out over a structure like the library
6241572 if there is a message out of this whole thing to the public its do not top your trees

6241581 in china human rabies was largely under control during the years 1990 1996 via nation wide rabies vaccination programmes since the end of the century however cases of human rabies have jumped high enough to trigger a warning sign for control and prevention
6241582 the use of human and equine rabies immunoglobulins hrig erig has saved the lives of countless patients who would have died if treated with vaccine alone however both products are often in short supply worldwide and are virtually unaffordable in developing countries
6241583 the four rabies endemic provinces lacked strictly enforced measures to eliminate dog rabies or an ample supply of modern cell culture rabies vaccines for humans
6241584 in the worst affected province guandong 62 5 of patients did not receive proper treatment on their wounds 92 5 did not receive adequate post exposure vaccination and 91 25 did not receive any anti rabies immunoglobulin

6241587 a fifteenth century painting is the deposit of a social relationship on one side there was a painter who made the picture or at least supervised its making on the other side there was somebody else who asked him to make it reckoned on using it in some way or other both parties worked within institutions and conventions commercial religious perceptual in the widest sense social that were different from ours and influenced the forms of what they together made
6241588 there are many different definitions of work of art but most refer to a class of physical objects and the mental states associated with them there are various definitions of society too but most come down to describing it as the complex of institutions through which an individual finds a relation to a collective these are not so much different things as systematically different registers about things partly the same things the relation of a work of art to a society is not the relation of part to whole like the relation of apple to apple tree it is not the relation of two analogous systems like the relation of flower to tree it is much more like the relation of say a chemical entity like carbon to the tree clearly carbon is deeply involved in a tree as part of the input part of the fabric and so on similarly a tree acts with and on carbon but each term takes its meaning from belonging to a different set of categorizations of systems one being chemical the other being biological and botanical carbon takes its meaning out of a difference from and relation to other chemical concepts hydrogen and oxygen and so on tree is one of a set of classes of a biological system now obviously if one discusses art and society or tree and carbon in general terms one can cope better with this kind of conceptual awkwardness without falling into type or category confusions what i am saying is that when we are dealing with the relation of complex particulars a picture and a society the underlying conceptual awkwardness is liable to lead one into the kinds of problems i listed five of just now in short art and society are unhomologous systematic constructions put upon interpenetrating subject matters so what do we do we follow what i shall call the bouguer principle pierre bouguer after whom i call it was the eighteenth century scientist who first developed a reasonable means of measuring light and he seems to me a paladin of the art of relating to each other things difficult to relate his problem was that before the development of photoelectric or other physical means of measuring light everything had to be done by eye and mind like art history and given two unequal lights say two differently sized candles the mind could not come to a precise conclusion about the quantitative relation of one to the other it could not say candle a is 27 percent stronger than candle b bouguers elegantly simple solution was to observe that while the mind could not do that it could decide very precisely just when two lights match each other so he took one candle moved it closer or further away until it matched the other measured the differences between the distances from the eye of the two now matching candles and from this difference worked out with the law of inverse squares though that is no part of the analogy the relative strengths so very generally speaking the bouguer principle is in the event of difficulty in establishing a relation between two terms modify one of the terms till it matches the other but keeping note of what modification has been necessary since this is a necessary part of ones information this is what we do i think but and that is why i am putting the point in this form we are not always aware that we are manipulating a term moving a candle to get a match and moreover we may move now one candle now the other so that we have a kind of double vision
6241589 all that lives must die whence cracked on the skull by mine fist

6241592 a voice from a place where kids throw rocks at tanks where people pull down walls with their bare hands it could be the sound of a carnival or a riot
6241593 this music nor mia have anything to do with grimey garage or that whole scene

6241623 the city of grande prairie has begun recruiting for its vacant community services director position
6241624 the director of community services has a broad mandate and is responsible for a large number of employees in the organization that means we are looking for a dynamic flexible individual who has a versatile background to guide the service areas that comprise community services
6241625 community services is a rapidly changing fast paced area and as a result the leader needs to be a visionary while having a sense of humour
6241626 in fact this position has been referred to as the director of fun
6241627 grande prairie is a growing vibrant community and the director of community service will have an important role in responding to the needs of this city in the coming years
6241628 it will be an exciting time with new facilities such as hearthstone manor the montrose cultural centre and the aquatics and wellness multiplex all coming on stream over the next two years
6241629 lets just say he hasnt disappointed us at this point
6241630 guys that have played a lot of ball have a lot of habits
6241631 he hasnt played a lot of ball so he doesnt have a lot of bad habits sometimes its easier for him to learn plus hes instinctive
6241632 were not pressed so much for time i would think we would probably do it monday if there was a storm
6241633 were rightly proud of our education system but its distinctive nature inevitably means the challenges faced by scottish teachers sometimes differ from the rest of the uk
6241634 im sure the new services will make an invaluable contribution to the wellbeing of scottish teachers and thereby the education of scottish children
6241635 our biggest concern is rain and flooding and weve heard anywhere from four inches to 12 inches to 20 inches even though weve been in a drought we just want to make sure that we dont have any flooding issues
6241636 local state of emergency is just a precautionary measure it gives us opportunity one to have that in place for any monies we recoup it also allows us to open our emergency operations center if we need to and we dont see a need at this time to do that it also provides us the opportunity to order evacuations if we need to because of flooding
6241637 we have a lot of dirt roads in jackson county and if we have to repair those roads and we do not have a local state of emergency in effect we will not be able to recoup any money from the federal government on those roads
6241638 if we have a local state of emergency in we already have an executive order in from the governor that allows us under presidential declaration to recoup most of that funding back and that does not put a burden on the taxpayer
6241639 this is a particularly important exhibition at this moment in time when we are seeing the largest divisions and disparities in social classes in our society since the great depression
6241640 were concerned because she left two children behind there plus the fact that she was there to be protected from an abusive relationship that she was in
6241641 theres no indication that he was here theres always a concern though when someone is in a relationship like that and it was enough that she transferred here from san antonio to be away from the abuser so obviously our number one concern is that there is foul play
6241642 this is usually not what a mother is going to do
6241643 she obviously was protective enough of the children to remove them from the abusive relationship then it would be odd for them to leave them behind
6241644 he thinks hes second fiddle by me he doesnt even play in the orchestra
6241645 let me tell you first what i wont do i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president and not know necessarily what hes doing my vice president will be a member of the executive branch
6241646 he wont be one of these fourth branches of government where he thinks hes above the law
6241647 and im just constantly catching stuff and its totally unique and its self perpetuating
6241648 no one else would get the stuff i get sent to me
6241649 something that is so extremely clich but just brought to a new level
6241650 theres a lot to be said for not being socially acceptable
6241651 it wasnt a possibility we had to do a few things to put pressure on the city and the state but our goal was to remain here in pittsburgh all the way those trips to kansas city and vegas and other cities was just to go and have a nice dinner and come back
6241652 given the mess the team was in when lemieux took over maybe its not such a bad thing hell finally be rewarded
6241653 if it was a negotiating tactic it was a good one
6241654 oh sure now he tells us that leaving wasnt a possibility
6241655 hundreds of volunteers lend a hand for united ways day of caring
6241656 theres always been control systems for different facial movements but say in the past you had a dial for controlling whether an eye was open or closed and in one frame you set the eye at 3 4 open the next 1 2 open etc this is like achieving that degree of control with much finer movements
6241657 for instance you could be controlling the movement in the top 3 4mm of the right side of the smile
6241658 terrorism is the best political weapon for nothing drives people harder than a fear of sudden death
6241659 your enemy is not surrounding your country your enemy is ruling your country
6241660 mossad provoked americas air strike on libya in 1986 by making it appear that terrorist orders were being transmitted from the libyan government to its embassies

6241684 of at least 40 a night for special branch officers to risk their lives to stop him being taken out by followers of the fatwa we were paying or rather the taxpayer was paying rushdie to protect him
6241685 sherry joness book is a work of fiction ron evanss book is not and it contains a very large number of provable lies and complete absurdities which were defamatory not just about me but my sons mother elizabeth west the metropolitan police and people including john major and norman tebbit
6241686 rushies own writing led to the biggest battle over free speech in modern literary history
6241687 this is censorship by fear and it sets a very bad precedent indeed

6241694 her initial impression of hopeless disparity among the attendees was giving way to a realisation that the conference was as much a celebration of a subculture as an assault on relativity
6241695 poetry lies dead on the page until some voice brings it to life just as music on the stave is no more than instructions to the player
6241696 the dead dont go till you do loved ones the dead are still here holding our hands
6241697 to be able to copy the look and style of both authors signatures
6241698 can i ask you a question why are all your women characters so crap

6241700 there were no red flags to cause any of the office staff to become suspicious
6241701 the school has no control over what students do while school is not in session
6241702 at no time was mr montes questioned as to who he was where he was taking the plaintiff and why
6241703 when you turn off front end controls word gets out if there is money to be made people are going to find out
6241704 it appears to me that some of these decisions almost rise to the level of being criminal
6241705 and looking at this report is almost like looking at crime scene photos
6241706 this township its people visitors and surrounding communities will soon benefit from the services that will be delivered from this new fire station
6241707 to assist nfa with this objective it is prudent to provide the best facilities for our fire fighters in october 2007 fiji witnessed the opening of sigatokas new fire station and earlier this year in may the groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of nadis new fire station
6241708 it will require all stakeholders to partner with nfa to educate and train your community on fire safety measures so that each one is well prepared for any fire before the fire fighters arrive at the fire scene this is very essential given the wide geographic layout of savusavu
6241709 i would expect that the prime minister would be applying maximum diplomatic pressure to commodore voreqe bainimarama to see that elections return to fiji as soon as is possible
6241710 devil may care is a period book which is set in the 1960s and it really wouldnt fit as one of the films that eon has been making recently
6241711 i would have thought that if you could move casino royale from the 1950s you could move devil may care from the sixties but eon know what they are doing
6241712 the 90 minute drama will interweave the stories of three very different women and shed light on the impact and influence the books had on womens lives over the last century
6241713 i think its partly because the books are cheap they are considered disposable literature and theyre also almost exclusively read and written by women and so have never been taken seriously
6241714 this cooperation between afghanistan and pakistan is absolutely essential for the future
6241715 we know weve got to be prepared were fighting a very difficult campaign for anything that may happen
6241716 ive been pressing for an increase in the burden sharing by other countries
6241717 esta clase de situaciones estimulan y solucionan problemas de seguridad como este por ejemplo en el caso de la desmovilizaci n de este guerrillero el presidente lvaro uribe y yo tuvimos di logo constante y mi gobierno dispuso para que se efectuara la reinserci n
6241718 vivo como si fuera un recluso nadie sabe qui n soy
6241719 fue muy breve hablamos tan s lo unos minutos era como una reuni n con un desconocido
6241720 gordon smith cant defend his record so hes resorted to attack ads that distort the facts
6241721 gordon smith has run the most negative campaign in the country but millions of dollars in attack ads wont prevent oregonians from rejecting his election year makeover
6241722 now merkleys party bosses are criticizing gordon smith for voting with ron wyden and barack obama to support our troops and encourage energy independence
6241723 matt brings an impressive amount of public policy experience to the house of representatives he will provide excellent service to the people of house district 26
6241724 originally the term sentimental was used to describe poets who engage with feelings as well as the mind and if that is the way it is being used then yes burns was sentimental but in the modern sense it means treacly or sugary and that is not the real burns at all i think paxman is trying to trade off his image as a grumpy middle aged man it is very strange he is saying this its the equivalent of poking a stick in jocks ribs which is fine if he really wants to do that
6241725 who cares what he thinks of burns paxman is a short man with a long face
6241726 i am very sure that he knows he is being controversial
6241727 we knew he would say something interesting and it will certainly get people talking
6241728 its not exactly a word one hears every day but as a term to describe dog tiredness it has a pleasing euphony
6241729 although im afraid i find the scottish national poet no more than a king of sentimental doggerel one might as well have used his ramfeezled to describe our state
6241730 im controversial in a thoroughly establishment kind of tradition sorry i cant help it im the establishments anti establishment
6241731 only democrat taking on tom feeney that has consistently opposed the war in iraq
6241732 i dont think were friends he feeney is not the worst guy in the world but he wants to hold on to his seat and is willing to try a few dirty tricks to do it
6241733 est por firmar el acuerdo gubernativo que proh be todo cobro en las escuelas
6241734 en este momento hay muchos cobros en las escuelas lo cual impide que muchos padres de familia que no cuentan con recursos puedan inscribir a sus hijos
6241735 youll love the way we do business tell a friend
6241736 a nice soft wife on a sofa with good fire
6241737 it is obvious that i am on the side of love letters
6241738 anyone can write a love letter and almost everyone has
6241739 you can carry them around squirreled away on your person and bring them out occasionally and sigh or gloat with one love affair of mine that ended i demanded back all my letters they were too good to leave behind he resisted i insisted and got them
6241740 benefited from being taken aside and gently told its not all about you
6241741 the problem with great men is that they do everything including making love and writing love letters looking over their shoulder at posterity
6241742 perhaps the term love letters puts men off its not terribly masculine
6241743 some day when im feeling old and the world is cold i will get a glow just thinking of you and the way you look tonight
6241744 dear sal i love you very much but next time please buy me a train
6241745 originally the term sentimental was used to describe poets who engage with feelings as well as the mind and if that is the way it is being used then yes burns was sentimental but in the modern sense it means treacly or sugary and that is not the real burns at all i think paxman is trying to trade off his image as a grumpy middle aged man it is very strange he is saying this its the equivalent of poking a stick in jocks ribs which is fine if he really wants to do that

6241749 its not exactly a word one hears every day but as a term to describe dog tiredness it has a pleasing euphony
6241750 although im afraid i find the scottish national poet no more than a king of sentimental doggerel one might as well have used his ramfeezled to describe our state
6241751 im controversial in a thoroughly establishment kind of tradition sorry i cant help it im the establishments anti establishment
6241752 im a 25 year old yugoslavian born immigrant who grew up in australia i write little songs about childhood relationships fashion and things that happen everyday only in the last six months have itried to make music on my own whilst travelling in europe i was based in london and the us im currently living in brooklyn ny im heading back home to australia in about 2 months hopefully to prepqre for some live shows before the year is out making music is a lot of fun i hope you enjoy what i have a lot of fun doing
6241753 its frustrating to know im ready to pitch and i dont have a role
6241754 well im sure i will in december when it starts
6241755 hell have an opportunity to pitch in a pennant race here in september
6241756 i feel comfortable that the guys we have here will get the job done
6241757 but at the same time if you have to go outside and bring a guy in weve done that
6241758 youre dealing in areas with guys who are not proven
6241759 this guy is proven but that doesnt mean that hes going to be better than the guys we have here
6241760 you wake up and have some inflammation thats basically what it is
6241761 if hes not ready we wont pitch him well back him up another couple days
6241762 thats the way it goes i dont think that is going to happen but if it did we would back him up and i told him that
6241763 well pitch him when hes ready to pitch and not because his day comes up
6241764 the point is that beckett is really wanting to throw and thats always a good sign
6241765 we need a win and he is a guy who can help i hope we get the real carl pavano
6241766 well see how he pitches of course he had 25 saves last year
6241767 with our situation with the bullpen as far as the back end of the bullpen and uncertainty over whos going to be the guy he wanted to come over here and compete
6241768 the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy and already under rickys full time care
6241769 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children
6241770 wed joke about how were not sure if a lot of our fans have jobs because theyre always here
6241771 its 8 in the morning on weekdays and theyre here 5 in the afternoon theyre still here its pretty cool its been nice to have that kind of support
6241772 the fans have come out and supported us for years and now it obviously wont be as easy unless they want to hike over there but the good thing is were not that far away
6241773 i think its big because the jets roots are from long island
6241774 theyve been here since the days of joe namath the fan base really is long island its going to be a little weird a little strange
6241775 being from new jersey itll be about half the commute but ill miss it out here
6241776 its going to be better for the team though with a state of the art facility florham park will be a setting like this though quiet and clean
6241777 over the time ive been here whether it was this time or the last time i was here its always great to have the energy from the fans
6241778 it gets a little bit long during training camp at times and there are some days where the coffee is just not getting it done having them there and having the kids here having the passion here its always great
6241779 when i first got here in 2000 i really didnt know what to expect but there was always a good crowd out there
6241780 we wont be in their backyard anymore but these fans are true fans theyll follow us wherever we go
6241781 it is sad and i cant not feel sad about it but the team is getting a new facility and a new stadium and its going to be a good thing
6241782 when i first started coming here there was no fencing around the fields so you could put a blanket out and sit there and watch but its become so popular over the years
6241783 it used to be a few hundred people here and there theyll be missed out here
6241784 we developed some good rookies last season larry patey dave hrechkosy rick hampton ron huston and we expect them to improve
6241785 consistent with conditions in the broader economy advertising markets have slowed in the new financial year the company said
6241786 we have limited visibility on how well advertising markets will perform this half
6241787 overall these are a very satisfactory set of results in the face of declining earnings for our sydney and melbourne metropolitan newspapers in australia and tough trading conditions particularly in new zealand fairfax chief executive david kirk said
6241788 these results highlight the successful implementation of our strategy of diversification of revenue investment in digital earnings growth and constant focus on operational improvement to drive earnings per share growth he said
6241789 we expect the current property market volatility to remain for the foreseeable future with the timing of recovery in property markets in the us and uk dependent on the recovery of liquidity in the financial markets mr clarke said
6241790 the us and uk residential markets continue to suffer from lack of liquidity and inventory overhang
6241791 in comparison the australian market is stronger and while slowing should not see the same level of impact
6241792 our strong positive cashflow combined with capital recycling has provided cash on hand of 842 8 million allowing us to continue to fund our investment pipeline while exploring growth opportunities he said
6241793 mr clarke had given the company a commitment of between five to seven years when he was appointed in december 2002 chairman david crawford said
6241794 greg has driven a tremendous turnaround in the fortunes of lend lease since he joined
6241795 lindsay and sam sat down with friends and ordered dinner when someone who looked like the chef or owner came up to them and asked if they would go to the kitchen
6241796 they were so nice they went back and put on aprons and chefs hats and everything but when the owner asked them to pose for photos they became furious
6241797 o ur time our energy should be spent in educating agitating organizing our fellow citizens in the workplace in the neighborhood in the schools our objective should be to build painstakingly patiently but energetically a movement that when it reaches a certain critical mass would shake whoever is in the white house in congress into changing national policy on matters of war and social justice
6241798 true religion will not let us fall asleep in the comfort of our freedom love thy neighbor is not a piece of advice its a command god my friends is with the poor and god is with us if we are with them this is not a burden this is an adventure

6241804 the evidence will show at one point mr shaballa was eyeball to eyeball with the defendant pleading with him to pull the dogs off that the pig was a pet and he had no permission to be there
6241805 joseph calarruda did not even own any dogs to go pig hunting
6241806 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined
6241807 whether you were a presidential candidate a colleague debating on the floor or a friend passing time you wanted her on your team for her quick legal mind tenacious debating skills her infectious humor and that thousand watt smile my heart is heavy
6241808 90 percent of all the businesses in the u s are fewer than 100 employees
6241809 its the same system used by the fortune 500 users we have hosted in a multi tenant saas environment
6241810 we have export buttons built into the systems modules that allows you to convert data into a csv file at any time
6241811 id love for there to be a new term as additional capabilities and concerns become understood and widely embraced
6241812 i can imagine a new group of users who may never articulate to themselves that what theyre working on is a crm project
6241813 not quite patented matthew trisler maybe five but probably more like six years to graduation
6241814 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
6241815 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
6241816 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
6241817 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
6241818 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
6241819 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
6241820 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
6241821 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
6241822 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
6241823 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
6241824 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
6241825 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
6241826 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
6241827 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6241828 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
6241829 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
6241830 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
6241831 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6241832 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6241833 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
6241834 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
6241835 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
6241836 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
6241837 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
6241838 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
6241839 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6241840 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
6241841 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
6241842 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
6241843 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
6241844 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
6241845 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
6241846 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
6241847 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
6241848 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
6241849 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
6241850 remember that the next time you hear of an otherwise boring congressperson caught doing something fiendish you either swing back and forth in reasonable degrees or you pull so strongly to one side that
6241851 everyone is great and she is a healthy beautiful baby girl
6241852 its a lucky thing for local broadcasters that the olympics are only 16 days
6241853 she didnt ask for this and i am very very sorry that it came out how it did
6241854 i would not consider frosted flakes the food of an olympian i would rather see him promoting fiber one i would rather see him promoting oatmeal i would even rather see him promoting cheerios
6241855 im going to the republican convention not to attack the democratic candidate but to explain to the american people why i support john mccain sen mccain asked me to do it and i strongly support him
6241856 sei que n o l um n mero decente se comparar a muitos sites que tem por
6241857 the sun and moon are eternal travelers even the years wander on a lifetime adrift in a boat or in old age leading a tired horse into the years every day is a journey and the journey itself is home
6241858 oh man its a dream job i write as well and ive written characters similar to chuck but for a guy like me its a perfect job im more like chuck than i am not so instead of working i can just be my nerdy self its a lot of fun the gunfights and the car chases explosions comedy and drama i mean its got everything its an actors dream
6241859 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
6241860 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
6241861 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious

6241867 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
6241868 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
6241869 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
6241870 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
6241871 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
6241872 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6241873 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
6241874 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
6241875 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
6241876 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6241877 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6241878 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
6241879 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
6241880 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
6241881 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
6241882 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
6241883 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
6241884 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6241885 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
6241886 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
6241887 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
6241888 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
6241889 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
6241890 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
6241891 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
6241892 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
6241893 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
6241894 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
6241895 dolores had no hobbies made no contribution to society and rarely shared a kind word or deed in her life i speak for the majority of her family when i say her presence will not be missed by many very few tears will be shed and there will be no lamenting over her passing
6241896 it gives you a better look at what the skills of that individual are so if you can have that information its better to know
6241897 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
6241898 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
6241899 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
6241900 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
6241901 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
6241902 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
6241903 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
6241904 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
6241905 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
6241906 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it

6241934 estou melhor fisicamente acho que n o consegui render o esperado porque foi uma correria a minha chegada ao rio at a estr ia o fuso hor rio tamb m teve influ ncia porque estava jogando na alemanha
6241935 espero que eles compare am pois podem ser um fator importante para conquistarmos os tr s pontos nesse jogo t o dif cil
6241936 tive uma passagem curta pelo gr mio de seis meses e conquistei dois t tulos mas isso n o significa que deixarei de comemorar um gol
6241937 it has been absolute mayhem overnight we have had numerous reports of flooding and dozens of homes affected a few elderly people have been rescued from their homes and required hospital treatment
6241938 wang xiuying is almost blind and disabled what sort of re education through labour can she serve
6241939 we have no records of these two names in our system
6241940 this is part of the arsenal of repressive tactics that the government has used to silence dissent
6241941 we have provisionally found that there are significant competition problems arising from baas common ownership of seven uk airports heathrow gatwick stansted and southampton in england and edinburgh glasgow and aberdeen in scotland
6241942 this is evident from a large number of factors including its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity this has resulted in investment that is not tailored to the requirements of airport users and lower levels and quality of service for both airlines and passengers
6241943 it has until recently been noticeably slow to develop new routes at glasgow and edinburgh whilst at aberdeen its investment plans are regarded as unambitious despite relatively high levels of profitability
6241944 we need to be realistic and face the possibility that our arguments will not be heard
6241945 failing to fully comprehend that glasgow and edinburgh serve separate markets
6241946 it seems unlikely the competition commission will capitulate on such a significant issue
6241947 it is in interest for there to be further disruption least of all the people in our communities who most rely on the services provided by councils and their employees the only way to resolve this is by negotiation and i would urge the unions to meet us and to jointly reach a solution to the difficult situation that we all find ourselves in we have always been willing to talk that willingness remains the same
6241948 it is for the unions and local authorities to resolve this dispute and avoid further disruption to public services
6241949 that can only be done through negotiation and we are encouraging both sides to get round the table to reach agreement
6241950 there has been a tension building up inside the funding council since the merger the fe and he merger is something that had never been done before
6241951 traditionally the chief executive would have been a university principal but because of the tension between further and higher education they had to appoint someone who couldnt be seen as from one side or the other
6241952 mark batho is seen as a career civil servant who will be more inclined to resolve this tension between the chairman who seeks a more interventionist approach and the officers who want to concentrate on funding formulas
6241953 i am quite famous and hard of hearing please can you arrange for an escort for me at the other end there may be some press there
6241954 we cannot comment on whether an individual will be allowed access to the country
6241955 its up to the chinese authorities to decide whether they allow him to enter
6241956 what i am concerned about is whoever the individual sex offender is that we have in place the necessary provisions to monitor them
6241957 stalkers sell off all the bits and the game dealer takes the carcase
6241958 the meetings with the chinese have been one of the most interesting negotiations i have ever had
6241959 every processor has the responsibility to attempt to sell as much of the carcase as possible
6241960 the pizzles are creating an extra income for the estate just like the meat
6241961 there is no reason to dismiss it its been used in our country for thousands of years
6241962 this is another example of how sought after scottish game is and how every part of the beast is useful and nothing goes to waste
6241963 i have never tried it but if there are any scots athletes who want to give it a go im sure we could arrange it however im sure our gold medals have been won by sheer dedication and hard work
6241964 you were a valued and trusted employee of charlie miller and youve been convicted of theft and fraud to the value of 62 000 this was a breach of trust
6241965 we need leadership to bring schools policymakers and retailers together to develop a strategy that goes beyond the school gates
6241966 instead of simply trying to offer the opposite of whats available in the school canteen surely this is an opportunity for local retailers to offer healthy on the go options at affordable prices for young people who choose to eat away from school
6241967 the main reason for children going outside the playground is simply to get away from school
6241968 it is a break from the environment and to hang out with their friends
6241969 if local stores offered more healthy meal deals than a jumbo sausage roll fudge donut and fizzy drink which can add up to over 1 000 calories children may well choose them
6241970 these young people are consumers who are making their own decisions they will only stay in school if whats on offer there in terms of both the food and the lunchtime environment is better than whats on offer outside
6241971 decades of the troubles gave us behan and ocasey a few years of peace cough up this makes you revisit the role of trauma in great art
6241972 we are all in the gutter but some of us are looking at the stars
6241973 it is in interest for there to be further disruption least of all the people in our communities who most rely on the services provided by councils and their employees the only way to resolve this is by negotiation and i would urge the unions to meet us and to jointly reach a solution to the difficult situation that we all find ourselves in we have always been willing to talk that willingness remains the same
6241974 it is for the unions and local authorities to resolve this dispute and avoid further disruption to public services
6241975 that can only be done through negotiation and we are encouraging both sides to get round the table to reach agreement
6241976 jack brooks monster slayer looks to be attempting to follow in the evil deads shoes and hey more power to em we need more goofy fun horror and fewer torture porn saw knockoffs
6241977 there is a risk that failing to recognise when a patient could benefit from palliative care may result in a patient not getting appropriate care in the community or not being referred to specialist care when this is needed
6241978 patients not on the register may still be getting some care but by being on the register you have your full palliative needs assessed and a co ordinated plan put in place
6241979 the difficulty is often recognising when palliative care is required
6241980 there is significant variation across scotland in the availability of specialist palliative care services and how easily patients with complex needs can access these
6241981 we want people to enjoy and understand and be more aware of the wildlife and that will feed into more interest in conservation
6241982 black grouse are spectacular to see but it has to be done sensitively so as not to disturb the birds
6241983 its management that sustains the range of habitats and species that we have come to expect
6241984 there has been a tension building up inside the funding council since the merger the fe and he merger is something that had never been done before
6241985 traditionally the chief executive would have been a university principal but because of the tension between further and higher education they had to appoint someone who couldnt be seen as from one side or the other
6241986 mark batho is seen as a career civil servant who will be more inclined to resolve this tension between the chairman who seeks a more interventionist approach and the officers who want to concentrate on funding formulas
6241987 this blacklist will keep dubious airlines out of europe it will also make sure that all airlines operating in europes sky meet the highest safety standards
6241988 when you consider the amount of aircraft built and operated it is one of the most remarkably safe aircraft
6241989 the black boxes could solve the mystery if they are recoverable but the intensity of the fire could have severely damaged them a lot ground around the aircraft was on fire which indicates a substantial fuel spillage
6241990 its very difficult to speculate in the early stages but quite evidently a key focus for air accident investigators will be an engine catching fire but also reports that the pilots may well have delayed departure for some technical issue
6241991 if that report proves true then the air accident investigators will be poring over maintenance records with even more attention than they would do to see if any problems are indicated
6241992 as the team and i began examining this area i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
6241993 a lack of understanding of the citys economic environment that beggars belief
6241994 if mr matsuura had his way all development in edinburgh would be suspended for a year
6241995 is he seriously suggesting that developments that have been subjected to the full rigour of our planning process over a period of some years should be stopped in their tracks complying with his request would be catastrophic for edinburgh
6241996 strathclyde is at the forefront of physical activity for health research in scotland
6241997 our mission is to train the future workforce which includes coaches physical educators and sport and physical activity professionals to encourage increased levels of physical activity across the lifespan and to engage in research aimed at improving public health
6241998 glasgows outstanding conference credentials and proud sporting heritage make it the ideal location for this pre olympic conference
6241999 theres little political content no credit crunch its personal stories
6242000 people have not gone for wider things the world situation to provide a lot of material
6242001 i live in these times so that is my day to day
6242002 how people seem so unhappy in their relationship the difficulty of settling on anything and the problem of hype in modern times
6242003 im dazed and confused i feel a little bit like im drunk and everyone is walking round me very fast
6242004 there are a lot of other very very good young women out there now and i think thats a great step forward
6242005 elite sport cannot stand alone without local facilities giving kids the chance to get into the sport in the first place i really hope edinburgh is going to continue to produce world champion cyclists in the future but we cannot do this without a local facility
6242006 we have to remember scotland will be getting a brand new indoor cycling velodrome in glasgow in time for the commonwealth games which as a country we dont have at the moment and there are currently only two other such facilities in britain
6242007 however the whole question of training facilities does seem to be an area worthy of further exploration although the new facility will be capable of hosting international competitions we need to look at the case for a series of other facilities around scotland
6242008 we do want to build a new training facility but its likely to cost 2 3 million and wed obviously need external assistance to pay for it
6242009 we found a different profile of chemicals above tumour sites relative to healthy skin
6242010 the same chemicals are present but at skin cancer sites some chemicals are increased while others are decreased compared to healthy individuals
6242011 researchers have speculated that tumours give off different odours but were the first to identify and quantify the compounds involved in skin cancer odours
6242012 this research opens the doors to potential new approaches to skin cancer diagnosis based on the profile of skin odours hopefully leading to more rapid and non invasive detection and diagnosis
6242013 the idea that we could one day detect skin cancer by measuring the scented chemicals released from our skin is extremely interesting but its far from clear whether this could work in practice our skin releases many different chemicals and their levels depend on many factors including the area of the body and the age of the person factors that would make developing a national skin cancer screen based on detecting them extremely difficult
6242014 while this research is interesting it is still quite theoretical at present
6242015 these cancers do not normally pose much of a problem for diagnosis when seen by a specialist they have a distinctive appearance and if there is any doubt then biopsy is a simple confirmatory investigation
6242016 the protection of children from sexual abuse is of vital importance to society
6242017 in this case i am satisfied that only a term of custody is appropriate
6242018 at the commission of these offences he was a child
6242019 in my opinion i would be failing in my duty if i did not mark the serious nature of these offences by the ultimate penalty which can be imposed these are so serious that custody is the only way i can mark these offences not just to you but to the public at large

6242025 for the creation was subjected to futility not willingly but because of him who subjected it in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of god for we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now and not only the creation but we ourselves who have the firstfruits of the spirit groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for the adoption as sons the redemption of our bodies
6242026 brad is a big strong player that has shown improvement in his three seasons in our organization we asked him to change from defense to forward and he has accepted the challenge and is making the most of it
6242027 weve added four people and every one of them has won a stanley cup
6242028 they have such a great interest i have never seen an nhl organization like this so involved i think it is beneficial for the nhl bound players and for everyone in the locker room
6242029 stockton should attract players because of their skill and the organization and the fan support that we have is the reason we should be one of the top notch teams every season
6242030 i scored the championship goal but we did it as a team
6242031 from the angle i was at casey pushed hernandez in the back you cant do that in this sport jason feels the hands on his back and bends over and it ends up a free header
6242032 i got thrown out with canada once i dont get angry very often but i struggled with that one
6242033 christian is an extremely competitive person and weve liked his development as a player
6242034 he got injured late in the regular season and showed a great deal of heart by playing through the playoffs we expect him to continue to get better and be a big contributor for this organization
6242035 while wearing 22 was called for 22 minor penalties leading the team in penalty minutes without being called for a major
6242036 i had four weeks back home lounging on the couch and enjoying home cooking
6242037 he has tremendous upside we see him as a potential islander hes a big winger 6 foot 3 215 pounds he was our no 1 targeted free agent on the forward end
6242038 it has been pretty tough for awhile i have been in tampa awhile and it is my home i didnt see this coming whatsoever it was a shock for awhile but once i processed the whole thing i got a lot of information from a lot of different places when it came time to decide on waiving my no trade clause we took a quick peek at a few times san jose obviously being the top team i wanted to go to i have played with players on that team i have played with thornton i have played with marleau i have played with nabokov i know blake from the olympics the team along with the management i heard nothing but great things after what happened to me that is very important to me once i kind of got over the shock it was a very easy decision to make
6242039 i am the type of player i have had to prove myself my whole career i am going to do that until the day i retire this is just another chapter in my book i am actually pumped to prove what i can do i want to win and this team is a couple of pieces away from winning
6242040 it is no secret what my style of game is i play on offensive type of game coming in from the blueline i think campbell did a good job at the end of the year helping the team out i watch every team i have the hockey package at home the sharks play an offensive type game which is right up my alley that doesnt neccessarily say you give up on your side of the blueline but i am looking forward to playing with some of the players up there it has been a tough couple of years in tampa unfortunately i have won a cup i have seen what it is like to be at the top of the mountain i have seen what it is like to be the worst in the league last year is one i completely want to forget i heard people talking about me and my year last year it was a horrible year last year and i completely want to forget about it now that i have gotten over the shock of it i am so excited to look forward i am not the youngest guy but i have so much left to give that i am very excited
6242041 i honestly dont have the nicest things to say about what happened in tampa bay i dont want to dwell on this and for this to be what is talked about in san jose but i was misled it was really not the right way to do a lot of things i actually dont have anything good to say about how this all went down once i got over the shock all of a sudden i am on the trading block and finding out a lot of things now i am past that i am ready to move on i have to be honest with you i am a straight shooter i am very excited to be on a team that will not just contend next year but hopefully for the next hopefully 6 years for me and beyond maybe who knows that is what excites me about next season i want to win i have done it before once you get there there is nothing like it
6242042 blake is one of those guys who was probably underappreciated in his career i love guys like that i think he is a great defenseman but he probably does not get as much credit as he deserves thornton everybody talks about how good he is but he hasnt won he is going to win he is a great player and one of the smartest in the game patrick marleau i have played with him and he is one of the best players in the game evgeni nabokov i began my career with him in lexington kentucky in the minors obviously he has come a long way and he is one of the best goalies in the game today not to single out any of the other guys i still have to get to know some of these younger guys they have some of the best prospects in the game 2 3 year guys who are doing an amazing job that makes my job easier and makes me look better too
6242043 i have played with all kinds of defenseman i have played with rookies i have played with veterans it really does not affect me one way or another i am going to play my game bringing in brad lukowich who was my partner the year we one a cup and for 2 3 years in a row i like to think that within a few minutes we will get some kind of chemistry going
6242044 i have not had a chance to speak with coach todd mclellan yet i have talked with doug wilson and he gave me a brief schpiel on him he is from my hometown of ottawa he is one of the most respected coaches in the game and he comes from a winning tradition i have played for all kinds of coaches and i am going to play hard no matter who is behind the bench i am going to give you everything i have and at the end of the day that is what you get
6242045 in tampa i have had the opportunity to play in different situations i got an opportunity to find out what kind of player i could be i love to hit and block shots i am not a fancy player but i like to get out there and play an old school kind of game i think the west is a little more rough and tough so i think that is good for me
6242046 i have been on a lot of stanley cup runs right to the very end and been successful i have seen teams that have not even made it to the playoffs like us last year i think being in different situations being on different teams gives you more awareness with what it takes to win fortunately for me it has been very easy for me to see what it takes to win if i can bring some of those things into the dressing room with the sharks a team that will do anything for each other and sacrifice for each other bring leadership and a little bit of knowledge if can bring a little of that to san jose and help them get over that bubble help them wit what they were looking for that would be a great start for me on the ice i like to be one of the more physical guys on the ice i like to block shots defense first and if i can do anything on offense it will be a bonus for me last year was a very difficult season for everybody and i want to look past it i am very unhappy with the way everything went last year with myself and i am looking to redeem myself and to get to san jose
6242047 i was asked that question about four or five years ago about what fans can expect from dan boyle i said he was one of the most underrated players in the league and that he played for team canada and was definitely going to be an allstar he has proven me right in every respect he is a nice guy he is one of my closest friends he is a game changer in every which way he is not afraid to mix it up either for a little guy he does everything else he is a guy you look for to play those big minutes he can play 30 minutes a night he is a very competitive guy to be honest with you the deciding factor for me going back to tampa was the fact that dan was there i would get a chance to play with him back in tampa and i am very fortunate to get that chance now
6242048 i like to get in on pucks like i said i am not a very flashy guy i like to hit it is part of the game that i have embraced over the years i like to get the puck any chance i can i like penalty killing if i can basically make life easier for my goaltender and my teammates that is me i am not the flashiest guy but i really know the game i am not the biggest guy but i like to make the big hits and give my best every night
6242049 a lot of things are connected under this system obviously it is rare when a player like dan boyle becomes available an elite player in the league he has won a stanley cup and brad lukowich is the same way so when you start building your team and you go back and look at the pieces we have added i think they are pretty consistent we have addressed that when you move people and take on the type of dollars we took on you have to do some other things one you have to move some talent and two you have to replenish some picks we will never alter our draft and develop philosophy when you get the opportunity to add these types of players you have to step up and do it
6242050 i did have one conversation with dan boyle you would have to talk to him about that we had the ability to share some thoughts on our organization he knows our organization very well he has played with a lot of our players we think it is a great compliment that he had an option of choices where he wanted to go and i think he fancies where we are at and what we are trying to accomplish two big right shot players like this boyle and rob blake with rob blake and then with brad coming in it changed our defense evolved it and made it better that was our goal
6242051 absolutely i feel better about this team now we have people who have been there and won it that is really important to have the opportunity to get this type of player we had to do what we did
6242052 dan boyle is a player we have always identified as a great player especially under these rules we think he is the type of guy that we need dont underestimate the impact of a player like brad lukowich also
6242053 with the right hand shots and rob blake is that type of player the minutes and the types of player we added we added three defenseman we had three go out that were on our roster the level that dan is at that rob is at and brad it all makes sense when you look at it from a team building concept we certainly included todd mclellan in these conversations with how we are going to play the puck possession and pushing the puck a little quicker in the big picture this clarifies it for you
6242054 you look at your group and you learn from all of your experiences we made a very aggressive move to add a player at the deadline and he played very well for us we did not quite show enough in the playoffs as i have said we played 5 good games out of 13 you have to maintain the push we had 108 points i cant question many of the things we did but we are going to have to push to get where we want to get to these guys have all been there starting with our coach and these players i think it is an important element one that was needed at this point and we were willing to do it certainly in dans case he will be our power play quarterback for a long time and you cant find those guys that fit into that role we expect him to do it for a long time as he comes into his prime now
6242055 as recently as three or four days ago i was told he was going to be a centrepiece for the organization i was in contact with them through the course of the summer and there was never any indications i wasnt going to be part of this
6242056 under the cap system difficult decisions have to be made and this is one of them craig is a true professional and we would like to thank him for everything that he has done here
6242057 dan is one of the elite offensive minded defensemen in the league today being able to acquire an elite player in his prime that has won a stanley cup will help this organization get to where we want to go
6242058 brad is a tough competitor that isnt afraid to give up his body for the sake of the team
6242059 rob is a tremendous competitor that has been one of the top defensemen in this league for many years while he has enjoyed mentoring the young guys great players need the ability to win in order to thrive and his sole purpose here is to focus on winning
6242060 robs skill set and intangibles speak for themselves i coached nicklas lidstrom for the last three years and rob is the same age as him rob like nicklas has proven to be a leader on a championship winning team and any coach would be lucky to have a player of his caliber
6242061 as i stand here right now i want to be in tampa
6242062 weve been in communication everybody understands everybodys position dan is going to think about things tonight we will have further discussions friday to find what is the best option for dan
6242063 thats one thing weve lacked our power play has been really subpar the last three or four years and we needed to upgrade that campbell can log a lot of minutes and is similar to duncan keith with his feet probably a little more offensive minded than dunc but those two guys can play a lot of minutes
6242064 saying that chicago is back thats not the issue the issue is that we wanted to send a message that we are committed to doing whatever it takes to get better and become a championship team
6242065 san jose is first class in what they did i think it was a case for me that i wanted to be a little closer to my home area chicago just kept creeping back into the picture the whole time
6242066 obviously san jose is first class and they have really good people that work for that organization so a part of me feels bad and a little guilty i consider myself a pretty honest person and to leave people like that is very tough though i was only there for a short time its unfortunate that it didnt work out there but i dont think i would have considered them if i hadnt gone there im happy i did go there but yeah todays a huge celebration for me and for everybody involved with me
6242067 i had my doubts about how much these players actually add to the production process beyond a familiar face for the cover that was until i sat in a room with the 2k games eggheads and nash who got a grilling that makes a postgame media scrum seem like a hugfest by comparison
6242068 they wanted to know what he thought of the series what he wanted to get across and what it was that he thought should change
6242069 well they did have nashs phoenix goal playing on the wall in a continuous loop but i havent heard anything official on that
6242070 from the first day that jody arrived here he brought toughness and character he is one of the most respected players in our room because of his team first attitude and his willingness to do whatever it takes to get the job done
6242071 if i see another negative letter in any paper this will come out i promise from anyone

6242075 the lord has put a delicate balance in the church he has put just enough headstrong ornery church members to keep you the pastor humble and he has put just enough sweet godly saints to keep you from quitting
6242076 now if a pastor focuses on the negative group the critics the naysayers he will become discouraged and want to quit
6242077 and if he focuses only on the positive supportive group the ones who adore him and think he can do no wrong he will become too enamored with himself and become puffed up
6242078 the key is to keep your focus on the lord jesus christ and him alone
6242079 for me to live is christ and to die is gain
6242080 father we thank you for everyone who has had a part in bringing this young servant of yours to this point for his parents and that youth minister who reached him when he was far away from you for friends and ministers along the way and for the special young lady you brought into his life as his partner in ministry

6242089 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because that what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6242090 this is irresponsible journalism and sadly indicative of the level of objectivity we have witnessed at nbc news this election cycle instead of examining the obama campaigns spin for truth before reporting it to more than 3 million nbc news viewers andrea mitchell simply passed along obama campaign conspiracy theories the fact is that during senator obamas segment at saddleback last night senator mccain was in a motorcade to the event and then held in a green room with no broadcast feed
6242091 society has changed fundamentally and the measure of it is that the official fatwa religious edict of old no longer has the hold it had

6242095 there is a lack of infrastructure and basic urban aesthetic beauty is also missing we have about 60 per cent of our population under 30 and these people need places to live so we are going to create the educational opportunities for them to come study and work
6242096 they are white elephants and not economically sustainable without huge subsidies
6242097 its hard to find serious economists who arent in the pay of the saudis who think it is sustainable
6242098 the king goes to parliament to talk about the need for women to participate but its all nonsense
6242099 the king has good intentions but when it goes down to lower levels there is resistance
6242100 we are putting our faith in king abdullah because obviously hes a reformist
6242101 he represents optimism and tolerance and a progressive way of thinking
6242102 if iran involves itself more in iraq and the americans tried to back the shiites well resort once more to the religious establishment

6242106 i have seen a kilometre of charred land and few whole pieces of the fuselage it is all destruction
6242107 one can only imagine the abject horror on the plane
6242108 people here are calm but we dont know whats happening outside the flights are delayed and we have to wait
6242109 when i came to the airport i saw smoke and where it was the incident happened when the plane was taking off and one of the engines stopped working and the pilot managed just to turn the plane into terminal four
6242110 we are just looking at the screens because the flights are going to be delayed
6242111 this is the first and hopefully the last incident like this here that i know of
6242112 the whole back end of the plane was just burnt to a crisp
6242113 the names of the passengers and crew on board the aircraft will not be released until all next of kin have been notified and a special helpline number has been established for relatives and friends seeking information about those who may have been on board

6242118 you dont hear much about these sorts of wines today

6242125 can i think of any other film festival that has invited as many indian films year after year

6242134 the program was well received and went over well he said
6242135 i think it is safe to say we are looking towards that program again but it may be premature to say we are committed to it
6242136 we know we have an audience out there that is under a lot of hardship and pressure he said
6242137 we are looking at creative options to reach out into the community particularly for low income families and low income seniors that is something that is a huge priority

6242155 i have seen two of my friends killed i have scars from defending myself with my fists i am good with my fists
6242156 right now its a time for our party to be united its not a time to be kicking people out and be divided
6242157 right now we all need to stand together especially in the loss in the election we didnt do so great we should have done a lot better than we did and its not the time to be getting rid of people we should be pulling people in

6242172 when it comes to producing clean power were determined to make new york the no 1 city in the nation
6242173 because it is such a feature rich device people are using more of the functions than they would on a smartphone type device
6242174 traditional mobile phones have been designed to cope just with voice and sms the iphone came along with lots of data intensive applications and features and they naturally consume more battery power
6242175 it is going to be trial and error at this stage
6242176 they have accelerometers in there so they can detect if the phone has moved at all if it hasnt moved there is no need to get an update from the gps
6242177 apples value is all about the software they dont need cutting edge technology to do it
6242178 you can see by the number of architectural licences that we have that we dont go out of our way to sell them
6242179 if they found a way of really reducing the power dissipation such that other companies had to go to a new generation of silicon to get the same power reduction that would allow apple to stay on a lower cost technology for longer
6242180 the car companies have done the same thing if you are cruising down the highway they shut down four out of the eight cylinders to save fuel
6242181 for this sort of chip it could take anywhere from one year to two years to get to having the first test chips its closer to three years before i would expect to see an iphone that had any kind of apple designed chip in there
6242182 there are a lot of smart people focusing on low power at a lot of companies
6242183 most of the pollution associated with cars actually relates to their construction
6242184 adding about 3 of hydrogen to the intake air results in a lean burn which has never been made possible with gasoline alone
6242185 we have improved fuel efficiency by 30 and reduced co2 emissions by 30 in recent tests
6242186 retail network distribution is always a problem with new alternative fuels a uk company called itm recently announced they had developed a home refuelling unit for hydrogen cars so a solution is forming
6242187 the key problem with hydrogen technology so far has been retail distribution of hydrogen and economic and environmental viability of the technology so far hydrogen has been held back because the easiest way to produce hydrogen was to burn fossil fuels which meant the well to wheel co2 emissions were actually higher than if you just put the fossil fuels directly into the car as a result it was a bit of an expensive non starter
6242188 organic hydrides are a high efficiency high density storage media for hydrogen
6242189 the end product can be transported alongside petrol in fuel delivery lorries and deposited at petrol stations just like todays conventional fuels
6242190 conspiracy theories aside the automakers have some very smart engineers and if they see something that will easily give them a 30 boost in fuel economy then they are going to take a hard look at it
6242191 modifying an existing technology unless it is mandated by some government agency will not likely go anywhere
6242192 they said look behind you the house is fixing to start back to fire so i grabbed my phone and called 911 again
6242193 ive been saying that theres a wiring problem through the house it just shows as a proven fact that it started up again
6242194 its a possibility thats what happened when my sister and them were in there sleep if it wasnt for the rain keeping it cool it would have been up in flames again
6242195 i just cant explain it its still hurting and for this to happen like that again it just brings up old memories that are still fresh
6242196 i think we have to do a better job screening people
6242197 should this have happened a lot of things should have happened
6242198 the council is concerned about it we remain concerned weve got to find out exactly what happened
6242199 i think we have to do a better job screenin

6242206 we need an advocate in the white house now more than ever before
6242207 from the flights to denver the lights in our hotel rooms and transportation to the pepsi center the site of the convention well be burning a lot of fossil fuel this is a great opportunity for our delegation to neutralize the effects of those carbon emissions

6242212 chi meglio di me in formula 1 solo alonso e raikkonen
6242213 what do you mean i told you what happened the rest is implied
6242214 perhaps but you must pretend that youre speaking to a complete stranger who wants to know every little detail in addition putting your memories into words is good for your mind things dont seem as complicated then remember youre the one who needs help not me
6242215 alright then when i realized that what i was doing wasnt working i dumped the new girl feeling guilty afterwards for leading her on by the time i realized what i 3 minutes ago

6242221 they are both hard workers and bring great attitudes to the court every day mckenzie is a raw talent but has shown us some nice things in practice so far while jackie should play an important role in 2009 with her versatility along the front row
6242222 we suffer from hopeless romanticism well be taking donations and hey why dont we set up one of those walks for a cure
6242223 they are natural hockey players with strong hockey sense they do a lot of things well and the upside is their bodies are going to get stronger and theyre built well physically
6242224 they have some synergy playing with one another and its their puck skills and ability to make plays in tight spaces that stand out most their lack of strength isnt an issue because they have the height and its easier to put on weight than it is to add inches they are tall and skinny but will bulk up when they go to sioux city and northeastern and get into the weight room their development path of going to the ushl and then playing for northeastern is absolutely a great development path for them
6242225 they compliment each other really well and both are very creative players with great hockey sense they are both excited about being drafted by the sharks and so are their parents they both realize how unique this all is the twins are fun to be around and they like to push each other and challenge each other on everything they are very competitive if they could someday theyll probably live in the same house or at least buy the house next door
6242226 they need to compete at a higher level of play and they will next year in the ushl that league will challenge them more especially lines one through four where as in prep school they where only challenged by the top two lines they both need to get quicker and that will come with technical work on their skating and through the pace of the ushl they need to learn how to properly give checks roll off checks and improve their agility but they are both smart enough that they will figure it out quickly they will only be taking a few community college classes and this will be their first year of focusing soley on total hockey their weight is coming and part of them going to the ushl for a year is so they can add that physical stature to play in the ncaa they both have the tremendous work ethics and brilliant hockey minds to get it done
6242227 hes a good skater and a very tough kid hes an excellent playmaker and goal scorer with a tremendous shot
6242228 he has the combination of hands speed and offensive ability he has a long stride and the ability to take the puck in the defensive zone and quickly turn up ice with it he cycles the puck very well and showed good hands in tight and ability to play through traffic when he has the puck he really can control the play and the pace
6242229 his puck skills are exeptional he has the great stick and great hockey sense to create plays in traffic what separates him from his brother drew is the assertiveness he displays on the ice
6242230 hes more cerebral he likes to go east to west stall and delay to make plays justin has the vision skill and i think the courage to make it in the nhl what separates him from his brother is his creativity
6242231 a solid all around player who is more of a playmaker he has a quick shot and showed good poise with the puck hes a solid player who is a few notches below his brother in terms of offensive talent but he does own a quick shot he needs to get stronger on his skates and is only average playing in traffic
6242232 we had everyone in seeing the twins at different times of the year it wasnt so much trying to get both of them together but the other one was still there and we figured it was good value so we took them both we think that theyve been growing the last few years and getting a lot stronger and theyre skilled players
6242233 not a whole lot separates drew from justin especially not four rounds of separation worth they are very similar packages but its that assertiveness that drew lacks compared to justin a lot of that probably has do to with the positions they play justin is a center and is naturally more involved with the game while drew could let the game come to him more on the wing
6242234 hes more physical and thats probably why is on the wing drew gets very underestimated and is a great hockey player in his own right drew has some special attributes himself and is not far off of justin
6242235 hes a real physical and tough kid with a good blend to his game he needs some work to refine what kind of player hes going to be hes got some offense and some physicality but we need to get him focused on a type of role
6242236 a swift skater with massive size making him a very interesting project
6242237 ive only seen him three times this year but he does nothing for me he has good size at 6 foot 2 215 pounds but he still needs to fill out and get stronger not very involved enough for me in his own end not an offensive player or real puck mover when i scouted him three years ago for the ohl draft since he is a late 89 i thought he was a very raw player who had some tools but i think he has less upside now than i did then i just dont see him translating because he really doesnt have any pro calibre strengths
6242238 we had him at training camp last year and he played really well but we would have had to commit to a three year deal at the time he went back to juniors and we had people watch him and it was a consensus that this was a player we had to try and draft we got to a point in the draft where we didnt want to risk it and we new a lot about him from training camp
6242239 i liked him as a late pick and at the least he will be running the worcester sharks power play in the near future hes an exceptional passer and while hes not overly big he improved his defensive play this year
6242240 it was kind of a surprise because he was rated really high and we really liked him at the world junior tourney we saw him during the year also and we didnt think he was going to be there so we had to do some things to get another pick
6242241 hes a smallish butterfly goaltender that relies on his quickness and athleticism to make up for his lack of size
6242242 hes a very good shutdown defensemen and is conscientious at his game we feal his offense is starting to come around he has an edge to him when he plays and hes not a crazy player but he makes you pay
6242243 hes skinny and skates funny but he has some smarts and i know of at least one other nhl team that was hot for him at the draft
6242244 he really came on in the ncaa tourney we looked at him last year in the ushl but were worried about his offense he got into college in his first year and answered the offense question and hes a competitor we got him in the right spot
6242245 astute two way player and a strong shot blocker that can take it the other way for a breakaway forechecks hard will finish his checks but can also use his long reach to clog the outlet lanes will back check and overall works hard without the puck has a nose for the net but lacks a good shot his shot lacks both accuracy and velocity but he can be effective thanks to his instincts around the net scores his goals by battling right on the goalmouth has the awareness to stay there for rebounds instead of skating by the net as so many young players do average passer can make a nice give and go work but other than that he lacks in the way of creativity vision
6242246 thats the thing about hockey its really a four year process of development
6242247 its really good for the fans to understand that you have to be patient with these kids
6242248 samuel was often used on both the power play and penalty kill units showing good puck movement from the point and good body position in front of the net to prevent the opposition from gathering rebounds
6242249 the kid worked his whole life to be drafted in the nhl and i didnt see a reason he shouldnt be
6242250 we have some outstanding young goalies in the pipeline and they need to play we are at the point with brian that we worked very hard to get the right guy we were complimented that he wanted to come back and be a part of this team we have the best goalie tandem in the league the leadership he showed in the room how he played bottom line he got it done on the ice i am very impressed that brian wanted to come back and continue this
6242251 joe pavelski did have a strong year last year hes won national championship and came from a program where he did all things when he was there he played on both ends of the rink he is a big time player we think he is right on track i am not going to limit my expectations of him i think he can be a heck of a player he wants the puck on his stick he wants to be on the ice when the game is on the line he certainly gained respect in that dressing room as the year went on for him to step up and get this deal done for us at this time that tells you a lot about joe he is also getting married so he had some other stuff to handle i am glad he stepped up right now
6242252 our discussions with brian campbell are ongoing i wanted to share that with everybody and that is how we will proceed
6242253 jeremy and i have talked about his coming back a year ago lets see how this works out and i cant give him enough credit what he did last year it is one thing for a guy to say i want to play and it is another thing to put the work in and get to the fitness level he got to but he went and did it you could see he was excited about playing the game at that level and he was committed to wanting to win we talked shortly after the year was over after the trainers and the medical guys sat him down and we said it is going to have to be the same guidelines you are going to have to play hard you are going to have to do the things you did this year not only what he did on the ice but he took some younger guys under his wing and had a huge impact on them
6242254 joe pavelskis contract is a deal that works for everybody i think that is where the deal fell he knows under this cba you can not be overly creative with options and bonuses he knows he has another level to his game and so do we we think it is a fair deal at this point for both parties we got it done pretty quickly
6242255 the two of them had a great relationship nabokov and boucher i think they have great respect for each other and obviously he went 3 1 1 with us i think his save percentage is over 930 so he got it done on the ice that is how you really command respect from your teammates he and nabber worked really well together i dont think you will see nabber playing the same number of games as he did last year when you have to guys like this it enables the goal of being healhty and rested come playoff time when you have two guys like this knock on wood that should take place
6242256 we are looking at everything free agents obviously we can not comment on other teams because they are other teams property until july 1st we are looking to take care of our own business but yeah we have mapped out all sorts of options with players that could be available we are prepared we also look at potential trades there are many ways to acquire players draft trade free agency we have explored all routes in the past and we will do so moving forward a lot of those discussions take place when you have all the gms together in the same building at the draft it escalates some of those conversations
6242257 i dont think we have to free up any money by trading patrick marleau i dont know where that perception is coming from we have always positioned ourselves to have the pieces we want players we have we are trying to keep and add to that yes there are a lot of teams calling and asking about a lot of our players and we take it as a great compliment you should be worried when they dont call and they dont like our players we leave it at that i take every phone call that comes from every gm you learn from what they ask about having said that we think we have a pretty good hockey team with the players we have with the experience they have over the last few years with the new coach with that some of these players will have to re earn their equity we may adjust how we play a little bit patrick marleau i am not sure why he gets asked about more than any of our other guys because i get calls from other gms about 10 12 of our players
6242258 we have sent out qualifying offers for the rfas you talked about clowe ehrhoff goc do we have ongoing negotiations yes are we making progress yes we are i am getting very close in talks with two of the three free agents curtis brown patrick rissmiller and jody shelley i am getting very close with jody shelley jody obviously brings a certain element when you are playing in this division and in this conference he played well and certainly fufilled his physical role you have a tough team but he also showed that he was capable of playing in situations that impressed a lot of people we are close on shelley and i will talk to the other two in the next few days i got back really yesterday i am scheduled to have more conversations and we will have more decisions before july 1st
6242259 last week todd mclellan contacted me we had a great conversation he told me what to expect a litte bit more offensively defense still has to be there he talked more about the team and how bad we are going to want to win what are we going to do to win are we going to be ready and compete every day he has those expectations he didnt really say we are going to be playing here with that you dont really expect a coach to come out and say that because it is a game of hockey and there are so many reads over the course of a season anything can happen so we are going to train hard over summer come into camp in good shape ready to go and pretty much the whole team is going to have that attitude coming back in
6242260 i think last year was interesting i think it goes all the way back to the previous year i got off to a pretty good start and then kind of hit a wall had a little injury didnt finish the way i wanted to finish i think any hockey player wants to finish with his best at the end of the year going into last summer that was a big thing for me to get stronger and be able to last the whole season that is important i came in started off kind of slow it was around 8 10 minutes of ice time a night for awhile towards the end of the season the last 20 25 games i started playing on a bit of a roll and was able to produce more point wise play a little more but i think the whole team kind of stepped it up at the end of the year too guys are feeding off each other i am satisfied how i kind of came around at the end of the year and i think it is a good stepping stone for next year
6242261 it is important this summer to continue to grow with my skating ability protecting the puck and a lot of that comes from just getting stronger as you get older you learn a lot more how you can pick your spots on the ice strength is a big one for me that will kind of lead into every aspect of my game
6242262 i took a lot from jeremy roenick last year he was really good with me and he was really good with a lot of young guys he showed us the way and told us how it used to be back in his days and how it has got to be in todays game he showed us those things i think guys felt comfortable around him he challenged us but he was honest too we took that in stride and we got better as the year went on having him around because he was retired a year ago he came to the sharks organization knowing he would have a chance to win a stanley cup the expectations are right there we have a few changes but the same core group of guys will be back he sees that and it is exciting to be around he brought the energy and i think he will expect that from us and we will expect that from him and more
6242263 i really have not talked about expectations of playing time with anybody obviously coming back i hope to play a little more than the combined backups did last year that is a lot of games for nabby to play i think is a matter of what the coaching staff wants to do
6242264 i think before july 1st i am not able to speak to any other team my only other place i was looking was potentially europe mainly russia that was the only other area i was looking at at the end of the day i think san jose was probably the best place for me family wise that is why i ended up here and there was a great experience last year that is one of the reasons i want to go back there there were a lot of great people and i wanted to be a part of that again with the team we have i think we have a great chance to win every goaltender wants to be on a winning team and hopefully we can do that next year
6242265 for me personally going down to philadelphia ahl last year i played 42 games up until the trade deadline i think it was good for me to be able to get my game back i had not been able to play a lot the last couple of years and i think maybe as an athlete it is not other people second guess you it was second guessing myself you want to rely on past experiences but you need to play by playing last year in the minors i was able to get my confidence back i think i was well prepared coming to san jose to do a good job things went pretty well in my starts the team we had too it is not really hard to play behind those guys it was really enjoyable playing behind them getting my game back in order and stepping into a good situation it made for a good fit hopefully we can continue that next season
6242266 any goaltender would love to play more i think nabby would like to play all 82 who knows the fact of the matter was that i was very fortunate to be back in the national hockey league and have an opportunity with a great team beggars cant be chosers you earn your playing time i dont expect anyone to hand anything to me if i have to work to get more games than hopefully thats what i can do i would like to play more than once every 20 games we will see how it plays out with the new coaches and new people to impress hopefully i can do a job for them and give nabby the amount of rest needed to keep him sharp all day long
6242267 in sports the fans are the ones who drive the values but you dont see them in the media we want to enable talented knowledgeable fans to report on their teams as professional media
6242268 american idol demonstrated there are some talented people in this country youtube let us distribute videos and myspace gave us a place to connect with others but mainly around music there is nothing like this for sports fan media network does this for sports
6242269 the movement of citizen journalism is intriguing and i am curious as a judge and as a member of the media to see what kind of talent is out there for sports fans who think they can report on their favorite teams
6242270 fan media network is taking a professional and organized approach to helping fans produce video reports at ktvu we get a lot of feedback from our viewers on their perspective as fans and this gives them a chance at sports reporting
6242271 you map out where you want to be at certain stages of your career i feel right now i am ready to make the jump i am as full of assistant coaching experience as you can get in this league but timing is perfect with a class organization like this
6242272 i like the fact that there is a strong foundation here there are some other positions that are open right now in the league that maybe dont have a joe thornton or a patrick marleau down the middle or a nabokov in goal i think that is a real strong foundation i do believe players are extremely hungry here right now i think it is my job to give them some guidance and leadership to get them over the hump i beleive we will have a very captive audience i look forward to being a part of that i expect them to respond to that and have some responsibility in that success as well
6242273 naturally that puck possession theme or theory is going to come out but i think that is kind of a fallacy i would like to see a strong puck pursuit game i would like to see us have a strong puck recovery game if you look at what the detroit red wings did they have that label but they gave up the puack as much as any other team in the league but they were prepared to go get it again and to compete for it we are going to be fast i would like to encorporate the defense more into the offense a little bit more get them active obviously 216 goals last year was not good enough so the offense has to come up a little bit more but that isnt done without being responsible on the other side of the ice everybody will be held accountable for their actions players will learn what they receive
6242274 you obviously like to have the puck there is no doubt about it whenever you have the puck you are on offense i am a big believer in that but there are times and situations in a game where you just cant continue you have to give it up but if you give it up with a plan if you give it up to a certain spot where you know you can go and get it again where work is efficient as opposed to giving it up period now you waste a lot of time effort and energy defending i guess that is the best way i can explain a puck pursuit strategy
6242275 i have had a chance to talk with nabby this morning prior to the press conference just to wish him luck at the awards tonight it was a very good conversation nabby and i have one thing in common and that would be our experience in cleveland and our connection to jock callender a very good man there we spent a little time talking about him so its ironic how small the hockey world is and how many connections different people from different worlds have i wished him well and i think he is a person i am very anxious to meet
6242276 that is what excites and challenges me the opportunity to take the team beyond where it is right now it wont be easy there is going to be many ups and downs throughout the year there is going to be frustrations on my behalf frustrations on the players behalf but if we are prepared to be in it for the long haul i really believe you win the stanley cup day one in training camp you dont neccessarily win it when you begin the playoffs you have to build that foundation from day 1 we talking about being a championship team from day one and we will work on it throughout the whole journey
6242277 i dont know if i am mr power play in detroit listrom datsyuk zetterberg they are mr power play in detroit my job is to give them the foundation something that they can work around we did not get in the way of their creativity in detroit we had some principals that we put in place that they are a must i believe on the power play we will implement them here joe thornton patrick marleau pavelski campbell those are tremendous players with a lot of skill sometimes as a coach you can get in their way and hamper what they do out there principles will be very important they will be expected to outwork the penalty kill night in and night out we will see where that takes us
6242278 this will be a busy week for us initially my goal will be to take care of my family make sure my children are taken care of well so i can take care of what needs to be done with the draft coming up with free agency coming up doug and i have not really had an opportunity to get into that at all obviously the remaining staff members have to be put in place the next couple of weeks we will get all of that done and we will be a real unified group when the season starts
6242279 this is a special opportunity there are only 30 of these positions available in the world i feel very fortunate to be involved with one of if not the top organizations in the national hockey league i am very excited about it there are some very good things that have happened here in the san jose sharks organization you dont win close to 50 games a year by accident there is an incredible amount of skill on this hockey team if you combine the skill with the will good things can happen we look forward to doing that
6242280 it is my job as the coach to push this team push them hard push them outside their comfort zone and get them doing things that they may not be comforable doing but while i am doing that make sure they enjoy the process that is the only way championship teams evolve i look forward to that opportunity and can not wait for it to start
6242281 its a very good feeling from the first moment doug wilson called to the moment he offered the job i felt comfortable i think the sharks have done a tremendous job you dont get that close to 50 wins for a number of years in a row without a lot of talent its a matter of getting over the hump there are some real parallels between the wings and the sharks
6242282 its my job as a coach to push this team to push them hard to push them outside their comfort zone and get them to do some things that theyre not comfortable doing butwhile im doing that i will make sure they enjoy the process and thats the only way championship teams evolve
6242283 i had a chance to talk to nabby this morning i called him prior to the press conference to wish him luck at the awards tonight it was a very good conversation nabby and i have one thing in common and that would be our experience in cleveland and our connection to jock callander i wished him well and thats one person im very anxiously awaiting to meet
6242284 i like the fact that there is a strong foundation here there are some other positions that are open in the league that dont have a patrick marleau or joe thornton down the middle or nabokov in goal i do believe that the players here are extremely hungry right now and i think its my job to give them some guidance and leadership to get them over the hump
6242285 there is an incredible amount of skill on this hockey team and if you combine the skill with the will a lot of good things can happen
6242286 todd mclellan has an excellent track record and has had success at every level of coaching in his career
6242287 he comes from one of the top organizations in all of sports and has been exposed to some of the brightest hockey minds in the game including jim devallano ken holland scotty bowman steve yzerman and mike babcock along with jacques lemaire to name just a few we feel that todd is an excellent fit for our hockey team
6242288 this is an unbelievable day for me the last couple of weeks have been very exciting obviously when you lose your job in this league you often wonder if you will get another opportunity the furthest thing from my mind at any point in my hockey career ever was to have the opportunity to coach the toronto maple leafs with their incredible history
6242289 i have coached three teams in the national hockey league and kind of start underneath the radar and work our way up i feel i have accomplished those things i belief a team in transition will need a lot of work it is going to require a lot of energy and attention to detail but i am the happiest person in the national hockey league today i am fulfilling a dream kind of completing the circle when i was growing up in fort erie i dreamed about playing for the toronto maple leafs as long as i can remember dave keon was my hero johnny bower another i lived and died with the maple leafs through the 60s eventually i got an opportunity to actually play with the leafs and wear 14 my heros jersey today to come back and be a part of the maple leafs is basically a dream that i never thought i would get to experience we are going to have a lot of work ahead of us this is an interesting project
6242290 i know one of your questions may be why did it take so long well when you have gone throught the roller coaster that i have been through over the last month you want to make sure to take the emotions out of the decision making process and make your decision with your head i think i have been able to do that slow things down and see a clearer picture i have had some interesting meetings obviously with cliff with mr tannenbaum and mr peddie as well i think in talking with my friends around the league they thought i would be a good fit with toronto i decided to make the decision that i would accept their offer once again we are going to have a good time we are going to get to know each other there will be good days more good days than bad days i hope but you guys know i wear my heart on my sleeve occasionally we are going to have some duels but that is the fun part of it
6242291 i think in todays nhl you have to be very patient you see the top teams in the league and i would like to think i come from one of them in san jose every year we were incorporating 3 or 4 rookies into our lineup the job of the head coach in the national hockey league today there is a good part of development involved you dont have the luxury in the salary cap era of putting guys in the minor leagues for 2 or 3 years for seasoning you have to do that along with your staff at the nhl level i am really looking forward to it i understand the cubbard might be a little bare from a younger players stand point right now but that is going to improve in the years to come i look forward to helping and that is the bottom line in this business with winning and the stanley cup i really get pleasure out of helping young players fulfill their potential so i am looking forward to meeting the players that are here now and meeting the players who will be here in the future as well
6242292 to me coming to a team with an interim gm is irrelevant it is putting the pieces of a puzzle together anyone here who has played and who has done puzzles knows there is no exact way to do it you dont have to have x piece first i think this job is to assemble the best possible team in any order at the end of the day the best possible team on and off the ice as well i think that is what management intends to do
6242293 no i am not worried about a new gm wanting a different coach at all i have worked with 4 general managers up to this point i think when cliff did his homework he talked to the 4 guys i worked with and i dont believe i have had a problem with any one of them whoever comes in here as a general manager i am pretty confident i will be able to get along with and i am pretty confident he will be able to see and understand what i can do to help this team as a coach
6242294 no i have no involvement in who the next general manager will be i can go upstairs and bring my contract down and show you no there is nothing at all like that i work for cliff right now and i enjoy that whether it is for 2 weeks or 5 years i get to pick a brilliant hockey mind i plan on doing that i look forward to this challenge
6242295 i cant really say what my expectations are right now i dont really know the team very well my expectations are to put in a defensive system the one guy i know better than anyone else is obviously vesa toskala i really liked him as a goalie we had a situation in san jose where you can only play 1 goalie you cant have 2 great ones so we ended up trading vesa to the leafs it starts in goal and you have a great goaltender i think from watching the leafs you need a little more structure defensively and you need to do a better job killing penalties i guess cliff would look at my track record and see i do have the numbers to back that up defensively special teams i think i can make a difference here
6242296 in todays nhl a turnaround can happen in a hurry the philadelphia flyers finished dead last last season and had a remarkable turnaround i am not saying we are going to be the philadelphia flyers but it does not take as long in the new nhl to turn things around
6242297 i have talked if you know my background one of my mentors is pat quinn before pat got the job here in toronto we had him on board as kind of a mentor in washington for george and i as we went to the finals i have talked with pat about what it is like to coach here i have become friends over the years with paul maurice i have tried to lend paul some support this season when things were going tough in those conversations you have a general feel for what the market is like i have talked to other coaches who know me and they think i can handle the team and the whole atmosphere as well as anybody i might be as qualified as anyone to handle a situation like this i dont really have problems sitting down and talking with people i just expect and open and honest back and forth conversation hopefully we can have that
6242298 maybe i can make a difference on the perceived negative media environment in toronto
6242299 keeping san jose sharks assistant head coach tim hunter is a possibility there is a process san jose is going through an interview process i know tim hunter is viewed favorably by doug wilson and he should be tim has worked with me for 10 years those are things that we will sort out in the next couple of weeks we dont have any games for awhile so my assistants dont really need to be in place hopefully i can get that all cleared away because the program i want to put in place involves a lot of development in the summertime but i do have i am not going to share it with you a plan a and a plan b and probably a little bit of plan c depending on who may be available
6242300 we may have to take a step back in order to go ahead i am just part of the whole process it is hard for me to answer the questions about who is on the farm team who is going to be drafted free agents to be signed that is stuff that is going to transpire over the next couple of weeks i dont care who the players are going to be i wanted and i told doug this when i left san jose is the people i am going to be working with and for right now that is cliff fletcher i could not be working for anyone with a better reputation in this game cliff will do the right thing moving forward and have the right team in place and i am talking about a management team which would include general managers assitant general mangers and include coaches he will have the right team in place
6242301 i am sure cliff will want to hear my ideas on the current roster i can aprise him of my general knowledge of the team as it was last year i dont have much information on the marlies or know any of those players but the players on the leafs i would like to think i am fairly well schooled on who plays well and what the strengths and weaknesses are for a lot of the players one of the things when you are a west coast team and i have been there the last 5 seasons a lot of games are on you watch a lot of hockey we play at 7 30 on the west coast 10 30 your time so i get to watch a lot of hockey games i am not just saying this but i loved listening and watching the leafs a lot because i loved listening to joe bowen calling the game and hockey night in canada with bob cole as a hockey fan they made watching the game exciting maybe to a point where you get fooled thinking as an outsider that the leafs are a lot better i enjoyed watching that and i want to be a part of it i want to make this team better i am not going to say in a few years it will be 1967 all over again but you do forget with pat quinn here the maple leafs came very close to going all the way a bounce here or a bounce there as a coach i have learned you have to put yourself in a position to knock on the door if we can be knocking on the door in two years it would be a tremendous accomplishment then we just have to knock the door down
6242302 i told you i love vesa toskala he has been of my favorite goalies i have ever had i am lucky enough that i have had along the way some pretty great goaltenders olie kolzig won a vezina trophy playing for me in washington i truely believe that evgeni nabokov will win the vezina trophy this year i used to flip a coin as to who would be playing vesa toskala or evgeni nabokov that is the truth they can vouch for that i think when you look at kaberle in particular he is a very coveted defenseman and pavel kubina kubina almost became a san jose shark and if he had i might not be the coach of the toronto maple leafs that might have been one of the missing pieces to the puzzle in san jose a little more veteran presence and leadership on our defense
6242303 do i think mark bell can help that is hard to say mark has gone through a ton in the last couple of years obviously he ran into problems before we ever really got to know him in san jose it made that year difficult that is hard to say that is something we have to sit down with mark bell and see where he is i have coached a lot of guys and mark has paid the price and shown remorse paying his debt to society if you will he has been a true professional at some point i may be able to finish moving from out in san jose be able to sit down with mark and have a long talk with him to see where he is at in his life and his career he has to worry about his life first not mark bell the hockey player
6242304 i can tell you right now i believe the western conference is better the top four teams in the national hockey league are in the west a lot of that has to do with goaltending and defenseman the bigger robust guys on defense are in detroit dallas anaheim and to a lesser extent san jose that is why the power is right now in the western conference the eastern conference for me means better travel more quality practices if you are going to go young you need quality practices if you can get those the eastern conference is so much easier although the schedule will be different moving forward i am still not sure what it is going to be we have to play everybody at least once travel for some eastern teams will go up but it is so much easier to coach in the eastern conference it is ridiculous
6242305 ive had maybe the youngest defense in the league the last three years both in terms of games played and age 18 year old defenseman can play in this league if you surround them with the right veterans who can be mentors its a little easier to develop young people in san jose when you have 1 beat writer and 1 television camera 1 day a month it is more difficult with the media environment you have here
6242306 actually you would be shocked about my relationship with patrick marleau the message patty left me on my phone when i was released has expired on my phone but he thanked me for everything i did for him than helping him grow more as a person than a hockey player and that he would play for me anytime anyplace yes we had a difficult spring last year patrick struggled in the playoffs i might have overreacted i certainly did but we patched that up in a hurry pattys struggles this year had as much to do i think patty worried all year about a carryover i kept reassuring him that nothing was going to happen and doug wilson did the same thing his name was in every internet column i dont know so much that patty read those things but his wife certainly did and it affected his play once the trade deadline went passed patty probably played the best i have ever seen him as a shark in the playoffs a lot of people have told me they have never seen patty compete like that in leaving and i have said this i would love to coach patrick marleau again we have had our differences i have had differences at some point with every player you coach along the way at the end of the day when you close the door you hope everything is ok patty is a great player and he going to continue to improve and become a great leader in san jose
6242307 our cycle down low in san jose was a result of the players you have i think that is what you have to do as a coach i dont have the ron wilson style of play you have to look at your talent and build a system up the ice on your strengths in san jose we had a big physical team up front and a smaller defense that we tried to protect how do you protect a smaller defense you forecheck like madmen and dont let them in your end towards the end when we picked up brian campbell this past year you saw our game completely evolve in 20 games from a dump it in forecheck to more of a puck possession more of a detroit type game you try to do that in a short period of time detroit has been perfecting their game for 15 years we were trying to do it in 2 months and it might have cost us
6242308 this was a country club a retirement home it was a place players came to retire they just forgot to tell us they were doing it john came in and changed the culture changed the way we do business and the attitude and in so doing he raised expectations

6242439 i read some blogs on it where the director writer and producer came to tucson surreptitiously to work on the script
6242440 no matter where you go in life after this it will always be better than tucson
6242441 at sundance last january i talked to the producer and co producer of hamlet 2 im also friends with basically the whole art department who worked on it
6242442 i guess they thought about filming in tucson but it all came down to money as it always does
6242443 with all the incentives new mexico offers compared to arizona it was a no brainer
6242444 hamlet 2 is a low budget film that came in under the radar
6242445 i didnt hear anything about the project until it got to sundance
6242446 arizona does have a tax incentive program too but it is more awkward to use not as film friendly as the one in new mexico
6242447 we are trying to get the state legislature to make arizonas incentives more film friendly weve been working on it for three years were preparing now to make another push in january
6242448 i was recently in the production office for st john of las vegas in albuquerque and there were several cars in the parking lot with arizona plates

6242451 a lot of our arizona work force is over there right now working
6242452 to make hamlet 2 they spent 8 million on the movie
6242453 then the state of new mexico wrote the filmmakers a check for 1 4 million as a rebate so the movie cost them 6 6 million and at sundance they sold it for 10 million
6242454 those are the reasons i always hear when filmmakers bypass arizona to shoot in new mexico
6242455 it is because of the tax rebates low interest loans and work force credits the state gives for hiring locals those are always the reasons

6242495 as imaging and printing continues to improve its cost structure we think it has an opportunity to be appropriately aggressive in the markets where it makes the most sense
6242496 the credit crisis has destroyed the idea that unregulated financial markets always efficiently channel savings to the most promising investment projects

6242500 much of american flamenco practice and performance are shallow in artistry driven purely by the clich and touristic image of flamenco
6242501 but there is a new generation of american flamenco artists who want to preserve the true essence of flamenco that which makes it a provocative art form
6242502 i hope i can be a flamenco conduit to the tucson community i want to infuse the heart of flamenco into my hometown
6242503 i know my community can benefit from this complex and gorgeous art form that reflects part of our cultural heritage

6242517 it is a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for a long time
6242518 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6242519 there is overwhelming experimental evidence that stress to pregnant mammals alters neurodevelopment in the offspring and affects their subsequent behavior both in childhood and as adults
6242520 the knowledge that maternal stress affects the fetus has important implications for mental health in a world threatened by acute violence and war
6242521 these are smart educated people but when it comes to making good choices in the legal industry they feel lost and powerless
6242522 its just replicating the process of someone calling me and asking if id recommend a lawyer
6242523 should people be choosing their lawyer on the basis of who has the biggest ad
6242524 the lawyers who have some empathy and offer some solutions on the spot are most successful
6242525 youll be able to check on their reputation and therell actually even be auctions among people who compete with one another that is a fundamentally new way of selecting lawyers
6242526 there are people looking to buy airports but theyre not going to be willing to pay the price that ferrovial paid
6242527 its not a good time for highly geared companies in the infrastructure sector
6242528 obviously ferrovial would have preferred to have kept all of baas airports but no one expected this crisis to take the shape its taken

6242553 we expect several very important measures to be included in the recommendations from the charter commission the decisions we make in these areas will impact our city for years to come
6242554 we want to make sure that our coalition works to avoid what recently took place with the shelby county referendum that appeared on the august 7 ballot
6242555 because there wasnt an education campaign associated with those amendments and there were several issues grouped together we believe voters werent given an opportunity to cast an educated vote
6242556 this is a very exciting election year throughout the country and while national politics are tied up in the race to see who is going to change this country we cannot forget that change is also needed on the local level here in memphis
6242557 i thought you were going to say she was the vice presidential nominee
6242558 she didnt take any grief from anybody she had been a prosecutor so shes stood her ground
6242559 she was one of a kind shes still with me shes one of a kind she was inclusive energetic just a humongous personality
6242560 by going to invesco field at mile high we doubled the number of boxes and that has helped dramatically that and having the candidate have been a big difference
6242561 i guess the government will need to take another step on fannie and freddie
6242562 the problem is that the bigger the commitment you make the more people sometimes want to test that commitment its going to be an interesting time to see what the government does do
6242563 are finally recognizing the strong fundamentals that those stocks have despite what the price of oil is on a weekly basis
6242564 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined
6242565 dont take your organs to heaven when they are so needed down here
6242566 i sometimes tell stories that i have heard or experienced but mostly we have tried to avoid the subject
6242567 i hear things all the time that i chalk up to spending time in old buildings my imagination or whatever every now and then though i find myself walking out to the main entrance calling hello is someone there when there isnt anyone there
6242568 they found primarily evps electronic voice phenomena recordings that are not heard by investigators but recorded on electronic media like tape recorders or digital recorders and audio recordings that were actually experienced by investigators the really spooky thing is that some of them supported the stories we have been told by psychics who have been invited to visit

6242570 in relation to foreigners holding demonstrations in beijing in support of tibet independence competent authorities have the right to handle these things according to law
6242571 id also like to emphasize that in china activities that support tibet independence will be strongly condemned by the chinese people and will not be welcomed
6242572 im afraid my wife isnt safe we think the olympics should be held but i am just not in the mood to watch it
6242573 in china as in other countries applications for demonstrations must go through legal procedures
6242574 they wanted to see us stuck in jail so the olympics would look better

6242577 it looks as though the natural contentiousness of people has died
6242578 and suddenly i thought of that valley of the turkeys and wondered how i could have the gall to think turkeys stupid
6242579 do they find their emotional fair so bland that it must be laidened with sex and sadism through the medium of paperback
6242580 it seemed to me partly cautious and partly lack of interest but strong opinions were just not stated
6242581 oh sure hardly a day goes by that somebody doesnt take a belt at the russians
6242582 nobody can find fault with you if you take out after the russians
6242583 you think then we might be using russians as an outlet for something else other things
6242584 why i remember when people took everything out on mr roosevelt
6242585 it seemed to me that the frantic bustle of america was not in montana
6242586 it was only as i approached seattle that the unbelievable change became apparent
6242587 the vainest most slap happy and irreverent of men in the presence of redwoods goes under a spell of wonder and respect
6242588 if i thought he did it out of spite or to make a joke i said to myself id kill him out of hand
6242589 i printed once more on my eyes south west and north and then we hurried away from the permanent and changeless past where my mother is always shooting a wildcat and my father is always burning his name with his love
6242590 although people around the country are individuals certain customs and characteristics are similar
6242591 there are many customs that assimilate then into like minded people
6242592 the south is a place of hatred violence and bigotry
6242593 its the goddamn new york jews cause all the trouble
6242594 i think its just a prolonged reaction to the divorce
6242595 its whats indicated in the report and that does happen but hes taking it to the extreme
6242596 we have to look at exactly what happened each scenario with the sexual assault we were planning on adding that also
6242597 that interception we got last year happened to get us to where we wanted to be the super bowl whether he came back or didnt it didnt make much difference
6242598 we are going to go out there the same way and do what we do on defense keep them from scoring and eliminate the big plays
6242599 i know he has a big gun and tries to make big plays and we are going to try to put pressure on the quarterback and try to eliminate big plays
6242600 i just happened to read the route downfield and was able to undercut it and make them turn the ball over
6242601 i didnt know what he was doing at that time
6242602 im trying to watch the receiver i was able to get my head back around and played the ball in the air secured it and went down and helped us get to the super bowl
6242603 i never changed last year from the beginning of the season
6242604 i am still working hard doing the things that i normally do i go out and try to get better
6242605 hopefully i get to play a long time and make a lot more interceptions
6242606 hopefully i can forget about that one and make some bigger ones thats my goal
6242607 if its the usual masturbation with a living partner i try not to have it at all
6242608 maybe we are all just masturbating with a living partner
6242609 actually theyre shit at this age babies come back to me in about four months when it can do something other than crap itself
6242610 now that ive got used to the baltimore accents im loving it
6242611 we are going to go out there the same way and do what we do on defense keep them from scoring and eliminate the big plays
6242612 i know he has a big gun and tries to make big plays and we are going to try to put pressure on the quarterback and try to eliminate big plays
6242613 i just happened to read the route downfield and was able to undercut it and make them turn the ball over
6242614 i didnt know what he was doing at that time
6242615 im trying to watch the receiver i was able to get my head back around and played the ball in the air secured it and went down and helped us get to the super bowl
6242616 i never changed last year from the beginning of the season
6242617 i am still working hard doing the things that i normally do i go out and try to get better
6242618 hopefully i get to play a long time and make a lot more interceptions
6242619 hopefully i can forget about that one and make some bigger ones thats my goal
6242620 a woman who has a real curiosity about the world who loves life and can find passion in lifes smallest moments
6242621 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6242622 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6242623 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6242624 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6242625 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6242626 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6242627 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6242628 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6242629 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6242630 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6242631 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6242632 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6242633 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6242634 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6242635 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6242636 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6242637 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6242638 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6242639 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6242640 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6242641 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6242642 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6242643 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6242644 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6242645 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6242646 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6242647 tambi n hemos hecho eso lo de la compatibilidad as que os puedo asegurar y de manera oficial que todos los instrumentos de rockband 2 guitar hero world tour y rock revolution ser n compatibles entre los diferentes t tulos
6242648 only the tail was recognizable there was wreckage scattered all over the place and dead bodies across a wide area a lot of them were children
6242649 i saw how the plane broke in two and a huge explosion
6242650 also you feel powerless because the airline doesnt provide any information at all
6242651 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6242652 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6242653 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6242654 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6242655 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6242656 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6242657 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6242658 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6242659 subfunk 7 i punched that into google and found this old page
6242660 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6242661 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6242662 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6242663 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6242664 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6242665 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6242666 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6242667 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6242668 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6242669 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6242670 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6242671 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6242672 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6242673 who are open to doing something on the production side
6242674 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6242675 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6242676 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6242677 super rapido una leche este es de esos q de peque o solo leia libros no comics lo q te crees es que yo soy super jilipollas estas descalificado
6242678 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6242679 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6242680 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6242681 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6242682 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6242683 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6242684 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6242685 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6242686 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6242687 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6242688 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6242689 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6242690 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6242691 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6242692 its the last one so i think people are feeling a sense of relief
6242693 but with the last one also comes the reality that this is exactly whats happened and we have to deal with it now
6242694 we were all trying to sing and cry at the same time it was rough
6242695 the mechanical examination of the vehicle is complicated by the fact that the vehicle was submerged and this will delay the work of the collision reconstructionist
6242696 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6242697 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6242698 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6242699 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6242700 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6242701 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6242702 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6242703 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6242704 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6242705 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6242706 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6242707 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6242708 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6242709 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6242710 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6242711 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6242712 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6242713 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6242714 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6242715 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

6242744 the key idea in power management is quite simple to shut things off when not in use
6242745 were at the dawn of a new era delivering rich internet applications with the power of
6242746 we realize that there have been many attempts to bring internet to the tv with limited success remember web tv but what the difference is now is bringing the full richness of the internet to televisions
6242747 we think in order to address the mass market of television we need a purposeful foundation viiv was not a purposeful foundation
6242748 essentially were merging the content of the cinematic internet with the tv in a way thats never been done before
6242749 its a real category not a novelty and it can transform the business
6242750 a more full featured area in which applications can run in all their glory
6242751 today we still spend five times as much money on television as we do on the internet
6242752 fundamentally however everyone sees the same ad which is not the best kind of targeting initiative and there is a limited ability to delve into content this changes the whole accountability
6242753 it puts the tv on an equal footing with the internet
6242754 there never has been any 3d graphics in this space before and we think it opens up some dramatic new opportunities
6242755 the new york police department violated core constitutional rights when it arrested a group of peaceful demonstrators who were lawfully protesting against the commencement of the iraq war and those who stood to profit from it
6242756 we are gratified by the citys decision to compensate these individuals whose targeted arrests were without probable cause and intended to quell future protest in new york city this lawsuit and this settlement vindicates our clients rights to assemble and speak their mind free from the fear that they will be punished for their views
6242757 my question is why did the nypd send over 100 police in riot gear along with vehicles to block the street and disrupt the flow of morning rush hour traffic all to stop a legal peaceful protest when there are far more important matters they could be pursuing and why did they fight us in court so doggedly when they knew the evidence proved that we were arrested without any police orders to leave
6242758 we hope our victory helps convince the city to stop violating peoples rights as a matter of policy and stop wasting taxpayers money doing so
6242759 it should also serve as a reminder that washingtons illegal war in afghanistan and iraq is also being fought at home against its own citizens and in the name of war profiteers like carlyle and halliburton we intend to continue our resistance until this stops

6242780 its people on low incomes who are being hit hardest by increases in the price of food and fuel there will need for example to be above inflation increases in welfare payments in the next budget
6242781 its vital too that people on such low incomes are not hit with increases in indirect taxes
6242782 a higher proportion of such people would feel the effect of vat increases to a much greater extent that the rest of the population
6242783 policies developed centrally without local input are less likely to succeed because they fail to foster support among administrators who are closest to the citizen and most involved in delivering services
6242784 without strong two way communications between national and local administrators local officials feel distanced from what is happening at national level and it is difficult to get shared commitment
6242785 central to ending poverty will be a consistent and coherent drive across all state institutions ranging from national policies to their implementation at a local level to deliver policies and achieve interim targets
6242786 tackling poverty and social exclusion needs to be at the heart of policies on employment education and training health and housing
6242787 current pressure points such as health inequalities as well as food and fuel inflation need to be addressed before they become very problematic
6242788 we are maintaining our buy recommendation and target price of 27 pesos for cemexs shares

6242790 for every ton of cement we make we are sequestering half a ton of co2
6242791 we probably have the best carbon capture and storage technique there is by a long shot
6242792 we are turning co2 into carbonic acid and then making carbonate
6242793 a gas fired power plant is basically like attaching a jet engine to the ground
6242794 we use the waste heat of the flue gas theyre just shooting it up into the atmosphere anyway
6242795 we think since were making the cement out of co2 the more you use the better
6242796 make that wall five feet thick sequester co2 and be cooler in summer warmer in winter and more seismically stable or make a road twice as thick
6242797 it took pca about 25 years to get the standards changed to allow 5 percent limestone in the portland cement mix so things move kind of slowly
6242798 could you take this calcium carbonate and add it to portland cement you sure can
6242799 could you add it to the ready mix to replace some of the portland cement you probably can do that too
6242800 we are using emissions from gas fired generation as our co2 source at the pilot plant where we are making up to 10 tons a day

6242845 researchers have speculated that tumours give off different odours but were the first to identify and quantify the compounds involved
6242846 this research opens doors to potential new approaches to skin cancer diagnosis based on the profile of skin odours hopefully leading to more rapid and non invasive detection and diagnosis
6242847 our skin releases many different chemicals and their levels depend on many factors including the area of the body and the age of the person factors that would make developing a national skin cancer screen based on detecting them extremely difficult

6242850 its an important signal but there is also important substance to it
6242851 in practical terms nato is offering close cooperation with the georgian government and the georgian military
6242852 i think the formal process kicked off with the establishment of a nato georgia commission

6242863 but the sheer number of new finds exposed by the fire is the most exciting development in archaeology in my experience
6242864 one of the very rare features exposed by the removal of the entire plant and soil covering is a set of defined borders to the areas cultivated in the bronze age
6242865 but it gave us access to a landscape which we could never have reached otherwise on such a scale no archaeologist has the means to dig out an area like this what we have found as a result has altered perceptions of the period it also raises questions about the scale of what else lies hidden over the rest of the north york moors
6242866 weve brought things almost up to date by making detailed surveys of slit trenches and foxholes used for training on fylingdales in the second world war and since forgotten

6242880 we begin friday practice the way we would at any other circuit but in this instance we need to pay particular attention both to driver feedback and the data generated from the car
6242881 the important thing is not to react too hastily its vital that you dont end up going down the wrong path because you only have a limited amount of time to tune the set up before qualifying
6242882 in terms of car set up we need to remember that like monaco the track will be both green and dusty on the opening day of practice
6242883 that sometimes tempts you into playing with set up more than you would like so you need to resist that temptation and let the track come to the car
6242884 everybodys results have been more varied and every driver who has won a race has also failed to score on at least two other occasions

6242886 we are fed up with people who feel they can park wherever they want and block pedestrians
6242887 one car can make life difficult for hundreds of people
6242888 weve had some harsh reactions from drivers but the most serious protests were from citizens for insulting animals

6242904 we are a small rural district in the bible belt with strong christian beliefs and feel like homosexuality is wrong
6242905 i dont think we are that different from a lot of districts at least in the panhandle that have beliefs that maybe are different from societal changes
6242906 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6242907 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
6242908 i just felt like i had to stand up for the kids heather wanted to do this and i had to back her
6242909 i think a shirt that says i support gays is very different from a shirt that says gays are going to hell
6242910 one can be very disruptive for a childs self esteem the other supports other people and their ideas
6242911 what happens when these kids get out in the real world after they leave ponce de leon and they have a black homosexual supervisor at their job
6242912 i emphasize that daviss personal and religious views about homosexuality are not issues in this case indeed daviss opinions and views are consistent with the beliefs of many in holmes county in florida and in the country
6242913 where davis went wrong was when he endeavored to silence the opinions of his dissenters
6242914 david davis is a fine man and good principal and we are a gentle peaceful christian family oriented community

6242923 for a guy like michael phelps who isnt worried about obesity because hes burning thousands of calories as an athlete eating corn flakes and frosted flakes every so often is not an issue
6242924 i think that the relationship between people that are great is they have a common thread of knowing how to beat their competitors and they know how to constantly be in shape and in top form
6242925 if thats the case id know everything about how to beat michael
6242926 hed also know everything to beat me wed have to tie

6242935 the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness for he is truly his brothers keeper and the finder of lost children and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers and you will know i am the lord when i lay my vengeance upon you

6243012 we monitor some open recursive servers online and we noticed that some have entries that are not the correct entries for banking sites
6243013 i know our government defence and banking clients are extremely worried about this and rightly so
6243014 this is one of those attacks that could have a significant effect on british industry and intellectual property
6243015 you should not only have your isps bring their dns versions up to date but you should patch your own dns servers too even if it does cause a performance issue
6243016 email has the highest sensitive information to total lack of encryption ratio of all the technologies that we use
6243017 ssl is occasionally used and maybe its used right but more and more often its not

6243019 architecturally we need to stop assuming that the network is as friendly as it is
6243020 we were hoping to have the beamline in operation by now
6243021 this is likely to be a problem when you are building equipment that is the first of its kind in the world and pushing the frontiers of technology some of the companies and groups we have been working with have been wonderful and helped us find innovative solutions

6243025 most of the pollution associated with cars actually relates to their construction
6243026 adding about 3 of hydrogen to the intake air results in a lean burn which has never been made possible with gasoline alone
6243027 we have improved fuel efficiency by 30 and reduced co2 emissions by 30 in recent tests
6243028 retail network distribution is always a problem with new alternative fuels a uk company called itm recently announced they had developed a home refuelling unit for hydrogen cars so a solution is forming
6243029 the key problem with hydrogen technology so far has been retail distribution of hydrogen and economic and environmental viability of the technology so far hydrogen has been held back because the easiest way to produce hydrogen was to burn fossil fuels which meant the well to wheel co2 emissions were actually higher than if you just put the fossil fuels directly into the car as a result it was a bit of an expensive non starter
6243030 organic hydrides are a high efficiency high density storage media for hydrogen
6243031 the end product can be transported alongside petrol in fuel delivery lorries and deposited at petrol stations just like todays conventional fuels
6243032 conspiracy theories aside the automakers have some very smart engineers and if they see something that will easily give them a 30 boost in fuel economy then they are going to take a hard look at it
6243033 modifying an existing technology unless it is mandated by some government agency will not likely go anywhere
6243034 it would probably sounds like me singing it and that wouldnt be very good
6243035 guys are a little beat up a little leg weary a little sore
6243036 tomorrow is our last two a day and then well start backing off a little bit so hopefully well start getting some guys back out there and a little fresher too
6243037 thats football the question is do you feel sorry for yourself or do you push yourself through it yesterday we felt sorry for ourselves and today it looked like we pushed ourselves through it tomorrow itll be a different story because we go twice again and im not sure they understand they need to do that once in awhile
6243038 i like will better because its more patient and you can wait to fill the gaps but ill play wherever they want me at
6243039 i like danny he has a lot of speed a lot of us linebackers dont have
6243040 hes the fastest linebacker we have and him being able to go out there and make plays as explosive as he is you have to put him on the field somehow whether its special teams or snaps on defense
6243041 right now hes still learning but hell come around a lot faster than some of the other guys hes one of those guys thats really instinctive too he knows how to get to the ball and is always around it on every snap danny is one of those players that can really help us

6243049 the kind of stress in question are those that would be experienced in a such as an earthquake or hurricane a terrorist attack or a sudden bereavement
6243050 showed a significantly higher rate of schizophrenia as they entered adulthood
6243051 it is a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for a long time
6243052 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6243053 there is overwhelming experimental evidence that stress to pregnant mammals alters neurodevelopment in the offspring and affects their subsequent behavior both in childhood and as adults
6243054 the knowledge that maternal stress affects the fetus has important implications for mental health in a world threatened by acute violence and war
6243055 researchers have speculated that tumours give off different odours but were the first to identify and quantify the compounds involved
6243056 this research opens doors to potential new approaches to skin cancer diagnosis based on the profile of skin odours hopefully leading to more rapid and non invasive detection and diagnosis
6243057 our skin releases many different chemicals and their levels depend on many factors including the area of the body and the age of the person factors that would make developing a national skin cancer screen based on detecting them extremely difficult
6243058 they have a distinctive appearance and if there is any doubt then biopsy is a simple confirmatory investigation
6243059 no congolese has no responsibility into whats going on in congo

6243064 id say the most important issue is how might the county participate
6243065 i think theres a 10 million shortfall somewhere in their negotiations and theyre looking for a way to do that
6243066 its got to be something that the increased value thats generated by the stadium would be used to offset the cost
6243067 does it make sense financially should we participate at all
6243068 provisionally found that there are competition problems at each of baas seven uk airports with adverse consequences for passengers and airlines
6243069 there are also competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
6243070 there were potential investors and we were hopeful as was he that they could trade out of this that was what we took away from that meeting however it appears talks broke down on tuesday night at about 10pm
6243071 nearby were pools of blood watches tattered clothes and a mobile telephone still ringing
6243072 the blast pulverised the bombers body into pieces with bits of his limbs strewn meters away
6243073 the hardcore of hardliners in the group in favour of suicide bombings are in charge of the operations on the ground
6243074 there is no easy solution to stop a suicide bomber the only way is to continue to besiege the terrorist strongholds and fight them there it is a race against time
6243075 we have worked on testing various proposed options over the past four years we are pretty close to be in a position to roll out those by end of this year
6243076 the trialing has gone on over the last six months and they have been very successful
6243077 so now we are into building the product it requires significant changes to internal layouts of trucks and computer technologies on board
6243078 all the cash that moves internally within our vehicles is held within internal safes they are all computer controlled within the vehicles and the opening of those requires remote opening control from our control centre in dublin
6243079 when a vehicle arrives at a location the control centre opens the relevant safe within the vehicle when it is opened weve changed the operating procedure within the vehicle to ensure the cash gets into dye staining devices before anyone has to exit the vehicle and transfer valuables across the payment
6243080 as a result we believe the sector will continue to trade towards the lower end of its historical price earnings range 9 4 times to 12 4 times earnings
6243081 we believe the market is factoring in an even more bearish scenario for crh implying trough earnings of close to 150c
6243082 is our preferred stock in the building materials sector as the share price is factoring in a more bearish scenario than our below consensus forecasts suggest
6243083 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6243084 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6243085 it is an agreement which will help us to respond to the threats of the 21st century
6243086 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6243087 the plane was split in two and was full of charred bodies its a miracle anybody survived
6243088 i have never seen anything like this in my life
6243089 we see the greenback appreciating to around 1 35 to the euro and 1 75 versus sterling by the middle of next year
6243090 the government has to move beyond worrying about the eus rules on borrowing and take action to boost the banking sector and restore some consumer confidence
6243091 if you have to break the rules break them we have to look after ourselves first
6243092 but looking out over the next two to three years we think a crude oil price of 200 a barrel is quite possible as global demand recovers
6243093 although real estate price deflation remains a big threat to banks falling oil prices lower bond yields and proactive economic policy should help the american economy find traction
6243094 our argument would be that people on lower incomes or social welfare they have to be protected in this economic downturn and if there is pain to be spread it should be those on higher incomes that would take the pain
6243095 if you take the forecast of 4 5 5 inflation for next year food inflation levels for milk bread and meat is running at much higher levels than that
6243096 the inflation rate is going to hit low income families a lot harder than those on higher incomes that has to be addressed
6243097 if you think of people living in poverty or at risk of poverty the key issues at the moment are how are they going to pay for food how are they going to heat their houses running into the winter and for families with young children how are they going to afford to send them back to school
6243098 we are very anxious that there would be no increase in indirect taxation like vat they hit low incomes families a lot harder than other people
6243099 at this stage we need to focus on lone parents and children and ensure these are lifted out of poverty we see where government targets resources and actions to a particular group like older people the results
6243100 the reason for the session today was to allow the board and the community to be able to meet with the candidates so that we the committee in charge of finding a new director can get their feedback and see what they thought of each before we make our final decision
6243101 we have not had the opportunity to go through a process quite like this before and we started out with a big group but now we feel that we have the best two

6243104 the best vacation i ever had was a boat trip on the congo river
6243105 an american once told me that was three years ago in mozambique in a five star beach resort i was on the un payroll i had escaped the peacekeeping mission on rnr while he was on a reconnaissance trip for his multi millionaire clients
6243106 our six planned boat trips on the congo river are fully booked for 2007
6243107 says the belgium of his wealthy eco tourists congos paths have definitely become unbeaten
6243108 i believe this notion of understanding user intent being able to analyze search queries and come up with search patterns and use them to shape the search experience is one of the most important areas for us

6243110 the air conditioner guys are getting their jobs back they sweat so we stay cool
6243111 everyone is great and she is a healthy beautiful baby girl
6243112 keep doing what you are doing calm down two minutes and youre there
6243113 you know your sister was asking for it i wouldve got away easy every1s had a piece of her now look what youve done nancy boy i would say i hope you drop the soap in prison but youd enjoy it too much wouldnt ya
6243114 youre free but your shadow is chaos and it will always be there by your side
6243115 reflected my flat mate when we discussed the movie anarchy and freedom still cohabitate in congo definitely
6243116 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
6243117 since singing and gardening both have a large part of my heart
6243118 there is nothing official about shevchenko he is still a chelsea player we are used to facing challenges when recovering players sometimes it has gone well other times less so
6243119 it all depends on the motivation the player brings here because at milan there has never been any problem looking after the players
6243120 i got injured without even realising it in fact i kept on training as if nothing had happened then the pain suddenly hit me
6243121 this kind of thing is part and parcel of the life of a professional footballer i have dislocated my elbow and now i have to wear a cast
6243122 buffon is immense hes the best but its time i got my own back
6243123 im disappointed at how the olympic adventure ended but now i hold only my adventure with juventus close to heart ill try to prove myself here
6243124 i know ive got a long difficult season ahead of me but im setting off charged up to try and cut out some space for me in this team made up of great champions
6243125 its not new that the competition is tough at juventus its normal for a big club but ill do all i can to find space
6243126 i managed to catch the impressive win of my team mates over artmedia from china now ill launch myself with great enthusiasm and desire to do well with juve
6243127 we know that after many difficult months for him we have to pay close attention i think that laggerbak is thinking along the same lines as me
6243128 here at inter we have a lot of important games to play and the same is true for sweden who face portugal and denmark i think we both want a special player for inter and sweden
6243129 so i think this is the best solution for the player right now not to play two matches in one week
6243130 we are leaving for the island of kauai to work and apprentice at an organic farm there
6243131 our plan is eventually to return to oregon and set up our own organic farm but weve deliberately not given ourselves a timeline so we can take it as it comes
6243132 it is a blow because alan stubbs is not just a great player and organiser he is also a fantastic leader and a great human being
6243133 the way he has handled himself over this injury and being forced to call it a day is testament to the kind of person he is
6243134 it was not so great to go 2 0 down and im not really much used to that but we improved in the second half and put the scoreline straight
6243135 we had several good chances to win it and were unlucky not to but we did have some luck with our goals
6243136 we looked to win this game to the end and it is not easy against a physical team like this
6243137 maybe they arent a team with huge quality but they are physical and athletic and they showed it
6243138 for me to play with the world champions was an honour
6243139 we all had the desire to do well for this first international game of the season and the return of lippi gave us a bit extra incentive and it was a good game
6243140 i hope we can get alessandro gamberini fit again for next month as he and giorgio chiellini are the future of our defence
6243141 there is no doubt we will go up there this weekend with the result on the final day of last season still fresh in the memory
6243142 we need to get a bit of revenge for that as it was a painful night for all of us and we will be desperate to come back down the road with three points this time around
6243143 when we lost up there in may i dont think the circumstances helped us we looked jaded and you cant forget the run of games we had in the lead up to that one
6243144 there is never any excuse at rangers for losing games but that was an incredible run of very important matches we had and that night at pittodrie was still painful even though our defeat was irrelevant with celtic winning
6243145 it will be a difficult game for us this weekend it always is up there
6243146 aberdeen are a very good side that are always very well organised under jimmy calderwood
6243147 its a match we are looking forward to and we will have a bit of confidence on our side after the start we have made
6243148 we know that this is probably the hardest start to an spl season in a long time with three away games out of four to very good teams
6243149 it doesnt come much tougher than that but we have done well so far to beat falkirk and hearts and must keep that form going
6243150 a few new players have joined us now and that gives everyone a lift and also means there is even more competition for places
6243151 i know it will be difficult this season to keep my place in the team as there is so much competition for places
6243152 but i will just keep my head down and if the gaffer picks me he knows that i will give every bit of energy i have for the team wherever he wants me to play
6243153 it has been a very painful day for the fatal accident and i want to send my condolences to all the families of the victims
6243154 we were the better team in the second half but denmark were better in the first
6243155 we started slowly you need to be consistent in the first half we could have been trailing
6243156 were hoping to have one or two more players back from injury this weekend so we will wait and see
6243157 but like most people we are trying to sign new ones too
6243158 i dont know where the carr story has come from i can categorically say no to that one
6243159 i keep hearing the brown rumour but theres nothing in it in fact i dont see us doing anything before the transfer window shuts
6243160 michael probably wont be fit and mark viduka certainly wont be
6243161 i probably could rush michael back and then knock him back five or six weeks
6243162 we are probably strong enough to do without the two of them but when they come back it will give us a massive boost
6243163 i am delighted carlos has come in we needed to bolster the squad particularly with our european aspirations as well as our domestic hopes this season
6243164 we want to do well in all competitions if we went into the campaign with only five recognised defenders in myself zat knight martin laursen nicky shorey and luke young then it would have looked a bit light
6243165 if one got injured theres not much cover carlos has come in and that makes the whole set up look more secure it also provides competition for places which is what any footballer wants it keeps you on your toes
6243166 i know he is scottish player of the year and did well for rangers when they got to the final of the uefa cup you know if the manager pays that sort of money for someone that he will be a good player
6243167 i need to concentrate on my game step up my performances and hope he doesnt take my place in the team
6243168 theres more to come from curtis davies in essence i am still finding my feet a bit
6243169 i am just trying to defend properly at the moment doing the bread and butter things getting my head onto things and if the ball needs kicking it goes

6243180 mobileme is suppose to be microsoft exchange for the rest of us but microsoft exchange does things in a secure manner
6243181 as it is if you run a business using your mac then you cannot use mobileme because it transmits data insecurely
6243182 i wouldnt say that its a critical issue or something thats a reason not to use the service but its definitely something that should be addressed
6243183 its a different field if you will but its no less important
6243184 its a privilege to represent this state particularly we have a great tradition here ted kennedy and going back to john quincy adams
6243185 twelve billion dollars a month a month are being spent in place where there was no al qaida and there were no weapons of mass destruction and the place where there is al qaida and there are weapons of mass destruction pakistan and afghanistan they have ignored sufficiently that its now at great risk
6243186 the fact is john mccain still doesnt think it was a mistake to go to iraq barack obama knows that it was thats judgment
6243187 im smart enough to know that in this new way that congress works you very rarely get the slot where you can bring a bill that has your own name on it to the floor
6243188 usually youre trying to attach something to something else to get it passed

6243197 ive been working in the television industry since 1982 and am beyond encouraged by what i see
6243198 more often than not latinos have been cast as prostitutes household help illegal immigrants drug runners or at best bad cops
6243199 latinos are partygoers despite their hard lives we need more comedies

6243221 our data strongly indicates that human intoxication does not transform an alligator into a docile creature that enjoys wrestling
6243222 despite its slow witted demeanor and tendency to bask motionlessly in the hot sun its a mistake to believe that an alligator will passively tolerate a half nelson no matter how much southern comfort is fueling it
6243223 in 10 out of 10 documented cases of violent alligator drunkard encounters the reptile was not influenced by the fact that the victim was just kidding or just having some fun

6243232 lenzs access to youtubes services was interrupted by universals conduct
6243233 first she was deprived of youtubes video hosting services for the holden video for six weeks while youtube provides storage for video files and the bandwidth needed to transfer such files at no cost to users comparable replacement services can add up to 39 00 per month
6243234 chilled her first amendment based right to fair use of lets go crazy and
6243235 universal couldnt actually know what fair use is in this case
6243236 that wasnt really a take down notice it was just a polite little letter pursuant to youtubes terms of use
6243237 even if universal is correct that fair use only excuses infringement the fact remains that fair use is a lawful use of copyright
6243238 notorious for his efforts to control all uses of his material on and off the internet
6243239 the court has considerable doubt that lenz will be able to prove that universal acted with the subjective bad faith required by rossi and following discovery her claims well may be appropriate for summary judgment

6243241 i am a canadian but my husband is in the british military and we were posted in germany i had a midwife until i gave birth and then under german law they had to send me to the hospital to deliver
6243242 there has been a recent push to encourage women with breech babies to deliver vaginally
6243243 is a 25 per cent c section rate a bad thing i dont think theres the data out there to qualify that its bad what we want is healthy mothers and babies thats the outcome we want
6243244 refusing vaginal breech birth is a human rights violation in that it forces women to consent to surgery in order to obtain medical care the right to informed consent is meaningless where there is no access to informed refusal
6243245 football is my job and i love it but music is something completely different

6243255 i had midwives for both my kids and have nothing but good things to say about them my first birth ended in a c section at which point my midwife turned into my advocate and advisor a very valuable resource when you are scared about your babys safety i think that midwifery should be the standard for birth with obs being available for when they are needed in high risk pregnancies i definitely think that obs can be great as well i just think that their expertise can be better spent working soley with women that need them i was at the doctor the other day with derek we arrived at 11 50 for our 12 oclock appointment when we arrived there was one baby that was a week old one baby that was 5 weeks old one that was 2 months old 2 that were 4 months old one that was 6 months old and 2 children including derek that were there because they were sick i cannot figure out why a pediatician needs to weigh all these babies most of them would have been there for simple check ups routine stuff that their expertise is being wasted on my sister in law lives in england and there everyone has a midwife unless they are high risk another thing they have there is something called a health visitor according to her this is a nurse that visits your home after you have a baby and will weigh your baby and make sure that they are reaching the necessary milestones they continue this way for about a year i think i think this is a wonderful system though i am sure that there are flaws in it like there are with everything it would save the doctors time so that when a sick baby like poor derek comes in he doesnt have to wait for an hour to see the doctor and more importantly all those healthy newborn babies arnt being exposed to germs from sick kids

6243262 the department of health and social services has definitely been very willing to work with us towards looking at midwifery services being integrated into the health care system and they do seem quite optimistic about it happening but we are going through this process where there will be a decision around whether it should be regulated and that may affect the length of time that it takes for midwifery services to be come fully integrated
6243263 i think as canadians were just not used to paying for health care
6243264 this process where there will be decision around whether it should be regulated or not may affect the length of time that it takes for midwifery services to become fully integrated
6243265 its hard to say i mean its worth a shot i think it just demonstrates that we need the midwifery services now

6243312 in the body of the temple as you enter there stands on the left hand side a throne for the sun god but there is no image upon it for the effigies of the sun and moon are not exhibited i have learnt however the reasons of this practice they say that religion does not forbid making effigies of the other deities for the outward form of these deities is known to all but the sun and moon are plain for all to see and all men behold them what boots it therefore to make effigies of those deities who offer themselves for all to gaze on 35 behind this throne stands an effigy of apollo of an unusual character all other sculptors think of apollo as a youth and represent him in the flower of his age these artificers alone exhibit the apollo of their statuary as bearded they justify their action and criticize the greeks and others who set up apollo as a boy and appease him in that guise their reason is that it is a mark of ignorance to assign imperfect forms to the gods and they look on youth as imperfection they have also introduced another strange novelty in sculpture they and they alone represent apollo as robed 36 i have much to say about his works and i will tell what is most worthy of admiration first i will speak of the oracle there are many oracles among the greeks and many too among the egyptians and again in libya and in asia there are many too but these speak not save by the mouth of priests and prophets this one is moved by its own impulse and carries out the divining process to the very end the manner of his divination is the following when he is desirous of uttering an oracle he first stirs in his seat and the priests straightway raise him up should they fail to raise him up he sweats and moves more violently than ever when they approach him and bear him up he drives them round in a circle and leaps on one after another at last the high priest confronts him and questions him on every subject the god if he disapproves of any action proposed retreats into the background if however he happens to approve it he drives his bearers forward as if they were horses it is thus that they gather the oracles and they undertake nothing public or private without this preliminary this god too speaks about the symbol and points out when it is the due season for the expedition of which i spoke in connexion therewith 37 i will speak of another wonder too which he performed in my presence the priests were raising him aloft but he left them on the ground and was born aloft himself alone

6243327 the mantra om mani padme hum is easy to say yet quite powerful because it contains the essence of the entire teaching when you say the first syllable om it is blessed to help you achieve perfection in the practice of generosity ma helps perfect the practice of pure ethics and ni helps achieve perfection in the practice of tolerance and patience pad the fourth syllable helps to achieve perfection of perseverance me helps achieve perfection in the practice of concentration and the final sixth syllable hum helps achieve perfection in the practice of wisdom so in this way recitation of the mantra helps achieve perfection in the six practices from generosity to wisdom the path of these six perfections is the path walked by all the buddhas of the three times what could then be more meaningful than to say the mantra and accomplish the six perfections
6243328 thats not my decision to judge where im at right now i just know that im giving it my all and im working hard to compete and earn a roster spot its a good competition at the receiver spot and everybody is pushing each other making us all better
6243329 personally i think ive done a little bit of everything im just trying to get better like i said theres so much room for improvement and i cant be satisfied where im at im still urging to get better
6243330 definitely wherever they want me to play thats where im going to be its not my decision to be where i want to be and im just here to contribute and help the team
6243331 ive talked to all of them not personally im pretty sure they talk to all of the players every coach wants a relationship with their players but at the same time i dont take anything for granted im coming out every day giving it my all and trying to earn a spot on the team
6243332 i think its more of an excitement than a nervous thing when the lights are on you have to perform thats what weve been doing pretty much our whole careers im looking forward to it and i cant wait to actually get under the lights and be able to perform again
6243333 i dont have an exact answer for that but at the same time me and my quarterback at the university of hawaii colt brennan weve known each other for three years we clicked instantly we were actually good friends off the field i think your relationship off the field just as well as your relationship on the field is just as important the more and more reps we get with chad pennington the more and more opportunities we get to spend with him off the field going to the movies like we did last night just anyway in general is definitely going to help your chemistry
6243334 no i wouldnt say buddy up but you definitely want to be on the same page at all times with your quarterback it carries over to the field definitely
6243335 it took me about a whole year at hawaii obviously the offense was i wouldnt say complicated but it definitely wasnt easy the more and more reps i got of it the more and more comfortable i got with the offense the same thing here i dont see myself getting comfortable at anytime being in this level especially with the expectations i want from myself i want to be great i want to be the best i can be for the team and make as many plays possible i know in the nfl you cant get comfortable you always got to be hungry
6243336 no not necessarily if anything i go up and congratulate them because they do the same thing in return like i said as long as we do that its helping the group and everybody is clicking together
6243337 yeah i talk to him every other week or so were all pretty busy so when we have a little free time off i go out and call him and we have a little conversation or a good text message
6243338 theres no place id rather be than here with you guys right now

6243346 i was angling for fried but ok pie it is and you can have it
6243347 and called me complaining that she needed more friends chad she was making a new friend didnt ask you for anything and apparently has managed to survive twenty years or so without you holding her hand through them i think youre still deceiving yourself
6243348 but thats just the point it was so nice to be able to drive away knowing i didnt have to worry about her walking along that highway in the dark i need more of that and less of her in my life
6243349 has she decided that she needs you or did you decide that
6243350 willow has managed to walk back and forth to town without your help or permission
6243351 and with the help of her mother who happens to be dead at the moment
6243352 i assume she plans to stay dead chad so what does that have to do with anything
6243353 but willow had help all those twenty two years actually she probably didnt help much herself until about five or ten years ago
6243354 you seriously underestimate the abilities of children aggies kids have stripped wallpaper cleared the entire property of weeds and scrub brush painted trim sanded woodwork scraped tile and i cant remember what else willow has been a significant help for at least fifteen to eighteen years
6243355 and before willow did any of it her mother did it all alone
6243356 my question to you then is why do you think you have a right to decide what you want

6243537 the bear is back thanks to eugene for inviting me to join this blog let me start with a prediction when historians write about the post cold war era which began in 1989 the date of its termination will not be 9 11 2001 as has been frequently claimed but 8 7 2008 when georgian forces attacked separatists in south ossetia and russia responded with an invasion august 7 marks the end of american sole superpowerdom or hyperpowerness or hegemony or whatever you want to call it an interval somewhat longer than but still very similar to the periods of global preeminence the united states enjoyed for a few years after world war i and world war ii there are other notable similarities in all three of these periods americans and others believed that an era of the rule of international law had begun and in all of these periods the united states was initially lauded for its leadership and then criticized for putting its interests first there are some differences however in the great powers era that ended with the world wars national governments derived their authority from unembarrassed chauvinism their peoples instinctive belief in their own ethnic racial or national superiority with the cold war the conflict was not between competing nationalisms but between competing ideologies democracy versus socialism capitalism versus communism today the conflict is shaping up as one between an ideology on the one hand and a bunch of different nationalisms on the other on one side we have american european commitment to democracy and rights on the other side we have russian and chinese nationalism and who knows what other countries with similar agendas will emerge over the next few decades these differences play out in many ways americans believe that every country should have our system or at least a constitutional democracy europeans similarly believe that every country should respect human rights the chinese and russians by contrast are preoccupied with restoring or promoting national greatness something that few europeans and even americans would say about their own countries the americans and the europeans well the west i guess are willing at cost to themselves to pressure states like sudan that violate western values russias main concern is protecting russians those who live in neighboring countries china seeks to do deals with other countries not to convert them to the chinese system of course americas ideological goals serve its interests they are just the goals that american governments believe that americans ultimately support it will be hard for future historians to see the post cold war period as anything other than a series of steps that the united states took to expand its sphere of influence in africa in the middle east in eastern europe and in central asia into the vacuum left by the collapse of the soviet union but each step was accompanied by a consistent ideological agenda we are doing this for your own good chinas rise has slowed down this agenda in africa and russias recovery will almost certainly defeat it in central asia the united states won the battle of ideologies in 1989 but its global power was only a temporary thing as is becoming clearer every day the implication for international law is troubling the busy international legal activity that occurred during the post cold war era the establishment of international courts the involvement of the security council the advance of international trade law will slow down and perhaps even reenter the deep freeze into which it was shunted during the cold war the irony is that liberal internationalism could advance only as long as the united states was the sole superpower and in the mood to advance it

6243572 we expect to reach 500 million opensocial users by the end of the quarter its also very international as social networking is a global phenomenon
6243573 when we launched opensocial javascript was the center but the community wants more choice we agreed upon a restful api that gives access to the social bits and is already implemented in
6243574 hi5 launched with opensocial very early january 1 2008 and we ended up building the system which had a lot of undefined pieces
6243575 we had a lot of custom work with the rest endpoint so that applications could contact our server directly as time went by all participants came up with one offs but now we are bringing it all together in the community with common types of solutions for these problems standardizing on a single specification will allow application developers to write code once and it will work on all different containers we are already seeing others build on rest specification plaxo for example has enabled privacy enabled exchange of contact info
6243576 templates and markup are now in discussion on public mailing lists but we believe we are pretty close

6243658 july 2008 excerpts people ask my view regarding the lakeland phenomenon im afraid my view is not so positive i have been prepared all along to accept that god uses the yuk factor in his choice of instruments but not all that makes us say yuk is of god and i doubt that the lakeland phenomenon is to trivialize baptism the trinity and preaching salvation through the blood of the cross smacks of the flesh and grieves me no end i firmly believe in last day ministries and believe it isnt far away if im candid but this isnt it in my opinion to achieve the balance between the word and the spirit is no easy task to maintain preaching of the word means that you take it very very seriously indeed i have wondered if the major question nowadays is do we really need the bible and yet there are places where though they would certainly want to affirm the holy spirit would be terrified if the holy spirit would show up in power these are difficult days and it can also be lonely god bless you all r t kendall romans 8 28 john 5 44
6243659 our premiss is this it seems to us that there has been a silent divorce in the church speaking generally between the word and the spirit when there is a divorce some children stay with the mother some stay with the father in this divorce there are those on the word side and those on the spirit side what is the difference take those of us who represent the word our message is this we must earnestly contend for the faith once delivered unto the saints jude 3 we need get back to expository preaching sound doctrine such as justification by faith the sovereignty of god and the internal testimony of the spirit as taught by men like martin luther john calvin and jonathan edwards what is wrong with this emphasis nothing it is exactly right
6243660 i can think of nothing worse than for god to be powerfully at work and i miss it all because i was biased and devoid of discernment
6243661 if the happenings of lakeland are of god then what i have preached for the last 50 years is nonsense

6243674 within the next hour of thaw a break appeared up near the feet area
6243675 as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
6243676 the russians restored order there is no more looting in the area
6243677 i think for the moment its necessary to have the russian troops in gori until theyre replaced by the georgian police
6243678 because if there are neither police nor troops in gori there is no doubt that the city will be looted
6243679 the russian soldiers walked behind the ossetians who looted the city and did nothing to stop them
6243680 we ran out of all our food supplies and what is the use of humanitarian aid if its impossible to get it
6243681 why cant they organize a more civilized way to distribute it
6243682 we didnt go out to use the toilet or for food we were too scared we fear any loud sounds even a clap seems like a gun shot
6243683 how would you feel if a guest came to your house and then forced you out
6243684 it is the same with south ossetia it is ours our ancestors lived there centuries ago
6243685 we were promised by the russians that we would be taken back but so many years have passed since then and still nothing is happening we are not taking away any part of russia why are they doing this to us
6243686 we are all brothers we are all christians we have lived as neighbors for centuries
6243687 i have never had any problems either with the ossetians or the russians this is our governments war not the peoples this war could have been avoided
6243688 the overall number of the displaced was decreasing because of the people who return to join to volunteer militias of south ossetia
6243689 russia is keeping the peace it is the georgians who committed atrocities against ossetians
6243690 my husbands sister lives near a military airport not far from tbilisi she said the russians did bomb georgia but they specifically and exclusively targeted military objects and did not touch a single house
6243691 the way that the west tries to present russia in the conflict in southern ossetia has one major goal the talk is about changing the charter of the united nations where russia is one of five countries who have the veto right
6243692 theres no legal mechanism to deprive us of this right therefore everything is being done to discredit russia and to change the charter today the world is balanced by that charter
6243693 as for georgian actions in south ossetia theyre illegal especially when taking into account the carpet bombing of civilians which is prohibited
6243694 what russia is doing now in south ossetia is legally forcing georgia to peace
6243695 i think georgia is to blame for everything that has happened in south ossetia and i want this conflict to be over as soon as possible
6243696 it really is genocide carried out against a small nation by georgia russia was right to take its troops there as it was time to defend its own interests
6243697 any european country would behave the same way in such a situation
6243698 however russia has a special status certain parts of the world have for a long time hated us and are afraid of us therefore we had this reaction in the west to russias role in the
6243699 however the russian authorities simply didnt have any other choice in that situation inaction in this case would have meant revealing russias failure in peacekeeping if russia hadnt taken action in this situation it would have lost the respect of everyone russians ossetians abkhazians and georgians too
6243700 the irreversible secession of south ossetia and abkhazia from georgia
6243701 therefore i think this conflict is in the interest of the worlds major powers who are not interested in having russia as a strong economic and political rival
6243702 freely moves its troops across the globe as it pleases
6243703 two democracies at the very least states that are moving toward democracy that are clashing

6243768 the russian forces are acting strictly in accordance with international agreements and continue the withdrawal of troops to places of previous deployment
6243769 we consider such peacemaking on the part of nato when the aggressor which was earlier abundantly armed is being restored a clear factor provoking a new blitzkrieg

6243793 create a site called fakecasey com and ill sugar coat everything so that every comments are sweet and positive although im sure after a few posts of that nobody will come and visit a site filled with bullshit
6243794 have you done any market research on your e book or are you just pulling numbers out of you head are there any numbers what is a person willing to spend how many copies will you sell what is the competition like can you point to a similar title that has sold many copies you may be good at marketing but i would not buy your e book on foreclosure i am certain that most people here would not either and i dont really care for your videos i realize that you may need more practice but it is not too hard to find interesting people now on u tube you dont seem to even prepare a script or talking points
6243795 i dont know what he wants from us he hates the constructive advice that is ultimately ignored yet he pretends to listen he thinks you can come up with an idea and slap it onto the internet for instant success he should try pitching product ideas to companies and investors its not that simple
6243796 following me with a camera youd pick up probably my favorite sports team the kinda music listen to and subculture i follow and what it is that drew me to my line of work i just see an eggshell

6243798 bunch of dream killerz you hatterz are im so friggin tired of it right now im gonna take a break and walk away this negativeity is getting to me
6243799 standing up a date at the last moment is another one of the plethora of feminine character traits you display
6243800 weak nation dont even begin to tell me how to live we kicked you a about 200 years ago for the same reason and if you want some more well comeon
6243801 now im ready to rock n roll going to the gym instead of jog to see how i do this early in the morning havent gone lifting in over a week
6243802 i got angry at certain haterz and all the negativity gets to me after a while and i went for a drive stopped by in n out for a veggie berger and fries thoroughly enjoyed it came home and staid up some more
6243803 128 sharky what youre saying there is pretty retarded its not the real chjts i guess and if it is then you need to put that beer down its too early in the morning for that
6243804 i filed for an extension and have until sep 15th to finish the corp taxes and oct 15th for personal
6243805 tavster obama sucks because he is as left as they come look at his voting record if you vote for him say hello to tax increases and further in increase in the size of the already big government and all sorts of handouts say hello to a continuing path towards socialism did you know obamas mentor was a pretty strong communist look it up
6243806 sorry i was going to the gym but then stopped by the computer one last time to grab the latest wallstreet journal bloomberg alex jones health ranger and other good podcasts to put on my mp3 player and take with me so i was waiting for the files to copy and was reading over some more comments and had to jump in

6243811 i could only bear to watch the first 44 seconds of the video and that is because i know the background story of cs if it was new to me i would have left in the first ten seconds
6243812 akubidoo ron paul is also against the iraq war which makes him a vile anti semite in my book while i detest george bush he is right regarding his policies in the middle east to provide security for our most important ally israel
6243813 israel needs to be cut loose in fact all the money sent to third world toilets should be cut off since the usa is becoming one of them
6243814 anyone who doesnt believe that israel is the 51st state is an anti semite according the bankers
6243815 as far as im concerned israel should be getting 10 times more money from the us
6243816 the optimal ingredient for life change is a small group
6243817 small groups are the most efficient delivery system for life change
6243818 my parents went to switzerland and all i got was this stuffed dog
6243819 leaders create and implement a process for managing disruptive and inappropriate behaviors
6243820 i would love to change because it hurts everybody around me
6243821 but when it comes time to do it i forget it all
6243822 but anger management teaches practical skills i think if they come for a long period of time theyll benefit

6243825 the russian federation cannot support this putting it to a vote would be a waste of time
6243826 taking separate parts of the moscow plan and reinterpreting them for political propaganda this is not a constructive route
6243827 in order for this plan to be implemented there is an essential prerequisite which is the withdrawal of russian forces
6243828 the sovereignty independence and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognised borders

6243850 i want to know how i stack up against all these other guys from all these other types of racing from all over the world
6243851 who doesnt and what better place is there to do that than at the olympics dude it would be so huge
6243852 racing is sure as hell more popular than some of the stuff they give out medals for
6243853 somebody said theyre having trampoline jumping this year is that for real it is then those people definitely need some racing
6243854 it is easily one of the coolest experiences of my life
6243855 jeff gordon and i went over to the canary islands in 2002 and won the event with colin edwards from superbikes as long as they want me back im in
6243856 if they introduced this to the olympics people would lose their mind
6243857 and if they can set it up inside wembley stadium they can sure do it inside the birds nest
6243858 people say we arent athletes because we depend on our cars well everybody depends on something ever see a golfer without his clubs
6243859 when i ran iroc it was just a big nascar race
6243860 we would fly into a place like daytona and race in front of a nascar crowd against nascar drivers in cars that were prepared by nascar mechanics and tested by nascar drivers it was fun but the playing field wasnt exactly level you know
6243861 motorized sports are what they want and why not everybody likes to drive right just maybe not like i do
6243862 soccer football and racing it only makes sense that we figure out a way to have them represented in the worlds biggest sporting event
6243863 all of those olympic athletes they talk about the experience first before they ever talk about winning medals
6243864 just once id like to walk through that tunnel in the stadium during the opening ceremonies that would be so cool but i guess every american would probably say the same thing huh
6243865 its always reliably chic it can take you from classic to dangerously sexy this season
6243866 if you still have not invested in a clutch this is the season to do so there are so many styles to choose from from romantic to punk
6243867 the perfect feminine piece to complement the fall wardrobe perfect to frame the face and add some femininity to your tailored looks

6243874 ask yourselves what is the purpose of this initiative by their own admission it isnt about funding education its about does the lvcva have excess revenues yes or no lets have that debate
6243875 contrary to the defendants claims we did not want to cripple the lvcva we wanted them to be able to continue their advertising campaigns and activities at approximately the current level
6243876 after october 1 2008 the seller paid down payment program goes away so you will have to come up with 3 5 percent to buy a home where as today the seller provides 3 percent
6243877 in the last three or four years it been a lot easier to get financing but now theyre going to need a down payment they are going to have to educate themselves on the loan programs that are out there its definitely going to slow the sales up just a little bit but in the end i think it will be positive
6243878 we have been fortunate that there have been no incidents and we want to keep that going
6243879 if the dam is not safe people down river will not be safe
6243880 we do have federal police officers on site they do have tactical capabilities
6243881 we will look at it with open eyes we are not going in there and not taking a defensive position thats not the idea on these things we try to keep that mind frame

6243885 itu memang sudah biasa dilakukan suap di dpr sudah mengakar bukan rahasia umum lagi hal ini dilakukan agar dpr beri dukungan kepada pihak berkepentingan
6243886 pertama dpr meminta tapi tanda kutip yang kedua memang inisiatif dari pihak yang ada keperluan
6243887 bisa berupa kwitansi diberikan tidak dalam bentuk tunai tapi dibayar dengan alasan tunjangan hari raya
6243888 several proposals have been received but few are being considered seriously
6243889 this will more than double the graffiti reduction fund of one million dollars per year
6243890 so in addition to the grant program for cctv were also putting extra money into the cleanup so we can actually have that graffiti removed
6243891 i think it is incumbent on governments to say well look we have to be very careful about what we do locate in those areas because down the track they may be subject to inundation and then the question is who will be liable for that
6243892 in future priorities should be given to what we call coastal dependent uses uses that need to be by the sea and those uses that dont need to be by the sea should seriously be thinking about having them set back
6243893 weve indicated were not proposing to do something thats compulsory but we are looking at ways to ensure that we can revive services on campuses non academic services that in many parts of australia have been seriously eroded by the changes the howard government has made
6243894 the report suggests that we are both going to do something that is compulsory but also have an opt out clause but it cant be both so im not quite sure of the logic of the position thats being put
6243895 weve indicated that were not proposing to do something compulsory but we havent concluded those consultations and investigations of what the options are
6243896 the way the former bill was drafted it was not so much an abolition just of student union fees it was an abolition of the capacity of the university to pay for other infrastructure that surrounded the universities and makes up intrinsically what a university is
6243897 if somebody puts forward a bill that really does start taking money for political purposes or issues such as that which are really of a personal view then i wouldnt agree to that
6243898 several proposals have been received but few are being considered seriously
6243899 and i thought boy well thats weird that im not hearing the doggies and i walked in and they werent at the door to greet me
6243900 it was open like this and the screen was bent and laying on the deck
6243901 our bedroom was just trashed the dresser drawers had been dumped my jewelry box everything was dumped on my bed things just strewn around and i thought man weve been robbed where are the dogs
6243902 shes just sweet as can be but she kind of doesnt have that much of a brain
6243903 its just a huge worry if theyre ok if theyre together if theyre inside you know if somebodys taking care of them

6243907 why do you always do you always think about things so much just choose
6243908 id say the most important issue is how might the county participate
6243909 i think theres a 10 million shortfall somewhere in their negotiations and theyre looking for a way to do that
6243910 its got to be something that the increased value thats generated by the stadium would be used to offset the cost
6243911 does it make sense financially should we participate at all

6243914 online records listing chinese gymnasts and their ages that were posted on official web sites in china along with ages given in the official chinese news media however seem to contradict the passport information indicating that he kexin and jiang yuyuan may be as young as 14 two years below the olympic limit
6243915 i guess its moving on again from the last album 2006s
6243916 researchers have speculated that tumours give off different odours but were the first to identify and quantify the compounds involved
6243917 this research opens doors to potential new approaches to skin cancer diagnosis based on the profile of skin odours hopefully leading to more rapid and non invasive detection and diagnosis
6243918 our skin releases many different chemicals and their levels depend on many factors including the area of the body and the age of the person factors that would make developing a national skin cancer screen based on detecting them extremely difficult
6243919 they have a distinctive appearance and if there is any doubt then biopsy is a simple confirmatory investigation
6243920 this is where we have found success and we are the clear leader
6243921 we came here to win and we are leaving winners
6243922 much more needs to be done to create the access necessary for the oil industry to do what it does best and develop this countrys resources to secure our energy security
6243923 i would guess that these leases are pretty well picked over
6243924 you have a richer opportunity in a place that has not been previously developed
6243925 companies are recognizing a movement afoot but im not sure this sale says much about that

6243931 asshole she is dead you fuck maybe they knew before the signal got to your parents basement
6243932 now im hearing that putin is going to show up at the dnc con and bitch slap obama on national tv that way the whole world will know who obama clinton is in lockstep with
6243933 obviously it is frustrating when guns injure or kill people but when a young person is hurt it is a deeper blow
6243934 we are making strides but at times your success is punctuated by incidents like this that show how much more work there is to be done
6243935 its obviously senseless but the fact of the matter is that virtually all these cases are senseless
6243936 in this case its sort of embarrassing that it happened to fema themselves fema being a child of dhs with calls going to the middle east
6243937 people are saying wait before embarking on a big change
6243938 to get sovereignty on the agenda as soon as possible
6243939 it is when you do not speak of things that cynicism sets in
6243940 theres a part of all of us that wants to be boardwalk
6243941 but if you want to win monopoly you buy the affordable places and you build hotels thats what going to happen with toronto
6243942 congratulations to montreal but when we play were still going to win
6243943 i learned a lot and i took the necessary steps to use my youth to be more successful in the business sector
6243944 i love the new board i love the fact canadas on there three times
6243945 we decided to wait till shes born and then were going to get a look at her and well probably keep debating it
6243946 when you start working with a publisher on a consistent basis over and over again people sort of have the assumption built in that theres some sort of long term relationship or that theres some guarantee that the next deal is always going to be done with them and that was really never ever the case
6243947 for us its not as big news as i think it is to people outside the company because they probably just had a different understanding of the way that we worked and what was really in line with reality
6243948 as far as the rationale and the decision you know theres a lot of parts to it the way we work on this stuff is we get proposals from multiple publishers and we sit down and look at them side by side and discuss them amongst the decision makers at id and figure out what is going to be the best one going forward its not an easy process one doesnt pop up and be like absolutely without a doubt the clearest choice so far so good were happy with the decision and that doesnt mean we hate activision or anything like that were still working with them we have a good working relationship with both companies that may be difficult for people to imagine how to balance that but its really two separate games and two separate projects
6243949 the technology actually started before the game and the ip rage did in fact we were working with the technology for another game that we ended up changing direction in and going with the rage experience because we felt like we could do something more interesting and compelling from a game design standpoint that it actually worked better to leverage the power of what john was doing with the technology it was a big decision not to do a doom or a quake or some other existing brand that we had within id i think we wanted on something that was new and that gave us the opportunity to create a whole new fiction one of the cool things about working on a new property for us which we havent done that since 1996 with quake is that its very liberating not to have to worry about the expectations of a core group of fans about what a game is going to be based upon what the game before that was or what features it had or what they liked about it so when we go into rage we can set the table for what everybody is going to expect to see in the game like if you have a doom game and it doesnt have demons its not doom
6243950 you play a man from that enters the rage world and your first objective is you need to survive and learn about what has happened to society after the impact we had a comet or an asteroid destroy most life on earth but people survived society survived but its changed within the society you have these different competing factions you have the bandit clans you have the mutants and then you have one type of larger organization that comes into play much later on the game is more story driven than what you would have in previous id titles
6243951 you have miles to go between areas and youll receive missions and the missions are very story focused
6243952 its not just a bunch of random things that you can do a sandbox game its very focused so you use your different vehicles to get places you need to accomplish goals and tasks through the racing part of it with the vehicles we want to make them extensions of your first person avatar when you have a vehicle you have it for the whole game you can do upgrades to it you can customize it we wanted to go for more of the arcadey fun feel of the vehicle combat and vehicle driving its not a vehicle simulator its focused on fun and action
6243953 the fact is that the private system exists and like it or not it is here to stay
6243954 we need to accommodate it in order for the public system to prosper
6243955 we have one of the most costly and least efficient health systems of any industrialized country
6243956 its not for everyone its not all doctors who will go to the private side thats for sure and its not feasible everywhere
6243957 does it make sense in the face of a shortage of operating rooms to ban surgeons who provide 90 per cent of their services in a hospital from performing five to 10 per cent of their surgeries in a private clinic
6243958 i totally agree with dr ouellet that we need to do better but most of my patients cant afford to go to dr ouellets clinics
6243959 were going to have to find solutions that benefit everyone and not just people who can afford to pay
6243960 theres just no market outside of major cities for this kind of thing
6243961 they knew what brian day was doing they knew what im doing and they voted for us
6243962 weve always been highly in favour of a publicly funded system but i think we as an organization certainly have reached the stage where we realize there have to be alternatives because the system is not working
6243963 the wait times are totally unacceptable and there are shortages across the country especially in newfoundland the cracks are starting to show
6243964 the cma remains concerned that federal politicians are not addressing some of the key issues affecting health and health care
6243965 we have been trained and are dedicated to providing excellent care to our patients
6243966 horror stories you have experienced using your yukon drivers licence
6243967 im hearing lots of horror stories about yukons drivers licences not being accepted as valid identification
6243968 the doorman said the ids had to be fake because theres no such place as the yukon
6243969 i think this has to do with the cheap looking id
6243970 an alberta cop once stopped me and asked what is this
6243971 were waiting on a pilot project between b c and washington state on extended drivers licences and the work is being done
6243972 were not going to redesign our drivers licence today if it wont satisfy cross border travel regulations
6243973 this is a company that has a culture of food safety
6243974 were taking appropriate broad comprehensive and definitive action as it relates to this facility this involves people we want people to understand theres a recall we want people to have that information
6243975 i strongly advise the public especially those at high risk for listeriosis to make sure they avoid consuming these products
6243976 i have also asked all public health units to advise emergency rooms in their jurisdictions to be on alert for cases all suspect and confirmed cases of listeriosis must be reported immediately to local public health units and in turn to the ministry within one business day of notification of report
6243977 they would simply not use the meat they would move into other foods its as simple as that
6243978 people arent going to take a chance the products theyre talking about arent ones that are a heavy part of menus in most of the homes i havent heard from anybody who has an issue over this
6243979 the death is in fact related to the outbreak weve just had that confirmed
6243980 i dont have any personal specs about the death at all
6243981 to predict when youre going to complete an investigation is practically impossible
6243982 with the tomato issue in the united states it went on for three or four months
6243983 we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause but food safety and quality at mcdonalds will not be compromised
6243984 we are closely monitoring the situation and are taking guidance from the canadian food inspection agency
6243985 i think he would do for senator obama what lyndon johnson did for john kennedy hes got serious foreign policy experience a long and distinguished senate resume and he is one of the most effective surrogates that senator obama has right now who can go toe to toe with any republican on any issue at any time
6243986 not something that lends itself to on the job training
6243987 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
6243988 i made it clear to him and everybody else i never worked for anybody in my life
6243989 i got here when i was 29 i never had a boss i dont know how id handle it
6243990 if i was the neighbor right next to that id want as much barrier as i could have
6243991 the land was purchased with the idea of future development
6243992 we believe a female was involved in this but weve not made an arrest
6243993 i am a christian therefore i am encouraging to others
6243994 its better to be quiet and thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt
6243995 one of the firemen initially began cardiopulmonary resuscitation but attempts to revive him were unsuccessful
6243996 and you saw how well that goes over with the rick warren people
6243997 this ban on a legitimate medical procedure is clearly unconstitutional
6243998 because historically because historically we have not defined marriage in our constitution
6243999 neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the united states or any place subject to their jurisdiction
6244000 im pro infanticide i love sunsets and i dont get the 13th amendment
6244001 well actually my experience in foreign policy is probably more diverse than most others in the field im somebody who has actually lived overseas somebody who has studied overseas i majored in international relations
6244002 i bring my kids here and the service its been good i come here when theyre open because its close to my home
6244003 ms johnson has medicaid and could go anywhere but shed rather come to us because of the service we provide
6244004 i enjoy working here and with my background providing care to those without insurance is very rewarding to me
6244005 when you compare the difference between the hours in the private sector what we are paid in the clinic might come out even
6244006 this is part of a family that had farmed land here for years
6244007 all of a sudden were instructing someone they have to sell that land and that seems a bit ridiculous to me at this point
6244008 i know they have to have laws in regard to restrictions and i respect that but just in this case this farm is no threat to anyone
6244009 i wanted to keep the family farm for sentimental value my grandfather was an original homesteader in 1909 so the farm has been in the family for 99 years before my mom passed away she wanted the farm to go to my sister and myself and then to the grandchildren
6244010 my grandfather he was not a quitter he showed the saskatchewan spirit to go forward and thats what i sort of want to hang onto
6244011 i think the first thing im going to tell them to start when you make a decision use common sense they have exemptions they can make and in this case should have been i feel personally as a farmer from the past should have been used
6244012 i think common sense tells you this isnt something that threatens our way of life on the family farm
6244013 we dont want to open it up to the point where all of a sudden theres corporations from all over the world owning big blocks of land here as a farmer i think that would hinder my business
6244014 our growing portfolio of application services together with our platform as a service resulted in the expansion of our customer base
6244015 google and cisco probably will capture the low end of the market from salesforce com
6244016 salesforce doesnt seem to have a strategy to deal with that which is a bit disconcerting
6244017 i continue to be very positive about the momentum they have

6244022 in recent days i have set before the american people an energy plan the lexington project named for the town where americans asserted their independence once before and let it begin today with this commitment in a world of hostile and unstable suppliers of oil this nation will achieve strategic independence by 2025
6244023 i have asked to be walled off from the velzaquez sic matter thanks for the info but i really should not be involved
6244024 well put the best guys out there that i think give us the best chance to win
6244025 i still dont think we cant go out there and win right away
6244026 were facing great teams but were still going to go out there and compete
6244027 we should treat all the trivial things of life seriously and all the serious things with sincere and studied triviality
6244028 lindsay is either lesbian bisexual or just another straight girl engaged in an elaborate albeit genuis publicity stunt but really what difference does it make

6244035 es cierto cuando me enter pensaba a ver c mo se lo digo a mis allegados luego pens por qu me preocupa
6244036 me hubiera gustado mantenerlo en secreto por un tiempo pero debido a las convenciones que se avecinan mis editores tienen que estar informados y no me parece justo guard rmelo
6244037 todo lo dem s sigue igual y espero poder seguir cumpliendo mis compromisos por mucho tiempo
6244038 me gustar a destacar para todos los que se han le do lo de arriba que todo esto deber a ser interpretado como un no estoy muerto aunque lo estar en alg n momento como es obvio pero puede quedar m s de lo creo es muy pronto para decirlo
6244039 me lo voy a tomar con filosof a y con un optimismo recatado francamente prefiero mantener un buen ambiente porque creo que todav a me quedan un par de libros por delante
6244040 nation no es un libro de mundodisco as que fue un poco m s dificil de escribir

6244042 como puedes ver soy un colgado balbuceante que no puedo mantener una simple conversaci n
6244043 no si no lo hubiera contado nadie se hubiera enterado sab a que algo no iba bien y me dijeron que era alzheimer
6244044 no lo s a ciencia cierta tengo casi 60 a os y nunca antes los hab a tenido as que no s si lo que me est pasando es alzheimer o es que me estoy haciendo viejo si digo se me han vuelto a perder las llaves alguien saltar con un es alzheimer pero yo lo considero algo normal cuando has tenido un d a muy duro respondiendo llamadas y correos electr nicos y con muchas reuniones al final del d a acabas muy cansado pero es algo normal no algo que tenga que ver con el alzheimer
6244045 cuando fui a hacerme las pruebas le preguntaron a mi esposa si hab a encontrado algo raro en mi conducta y les repondi lo normal en un escritor que est con un libro no habla no presta atenci n a nada es un antisocial vamos que soy un escritor muy t pico quiz siempre hemos tenido alzheimer pero no lo sab amos
6244046 fuera lo m s aburrida posible y que lo nico que pasara fuera escribir libros
6244047 mi vida sigue siendo aburrida y sigo pasando mucho tiempo delante de la pantalla de un ordenador pero desde que me la diagnosticaron camino mucho m s el ejercicio me hace sentir muy bien
6244048 tengo fans en muchas partes del mundo que a pesar de haber le do mis libros han llegado incluso a ser m dicos y me han dicho que al masticar el cido de la boca puede reaccionar negativamente con el mercurio de los empastes no hay ninguna prueba m dica de que esto pueda ser la causa del alzheimer pero ya que tengo dinero no est de m s asegurarse as que me he quitado todos mis empastes de metal y me han puesto de esos blancos tan monos tambien estoy tomando aricept una droga para paliar los efectos de la enfermedad aunque tengo que pagarla ya que me han dicho que soy muy joven para que me la den gratis
6244049 uno se sorprende cuando se entera que para investigar el alzheimer se destina s lo un 3 de lo que se destina para el c ncer personalmente dar a lo que fuera por tener la m s m nima oportunidad de presentar batalla yo como muchos otros estamos intentando aguantar todo lo posible mientras esperamos que surja una cura se dice pronto pero el n mero de personas con alzheimer es muy parecido al de gente con c ncer y parece que el n mero es muy propenso a crecer en nuevas generaciones

6244070 the post cold war world the new world order ended with authority on aug 8 2008 when russia and georgia went to war
6244071 a hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace while a thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor and today that new world is struggling to be born a world quite different from the one weve known a world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle a world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice a world where the strong respect the rights of the weak

6244086 food prices tend to go up pretty quickly and they tend to stick on the way down
6244087 basically theres only a few cents worth of corn in a box of corn flakes so food prices are much slower to react to the downside than energy prices
6244088 we have been deeply troubled by the lack of responsiveness by some federal and state appraiser regulators in carrying out the law
6244089 we hope this article proves to be a catalyst for modernizing the existing appraisal regulatory structure and making it more effective
6244090 while some state appraisal boards do a good job of enforcement for whatever reason whether it be lack of funding or lack of mandatory licensing requirements more than a few do a poor job
6244091 if people think they lehman are heading toward bankruptcy nobody will want to do business with them or make them new loans thats fulds biggest problem
6244092 they are clearly not as keen on investing in the financial sector until the credit crisis plays out
6244093 selling off assets would be at fire sale prices and investors will bark if you try and sell some of the crown jewels of the company
6244094 we anticipate that lehman will reduce its overall mortgage exposure by 20 percent suggesting about a 15 billion reduction
6244095 buy them some time and allow them to emerge from the crisis and rebuild
6244096 there is simply too much lending capacity in the global economy
6244097 to cover their needs they will have to go to many different origins to secure the amount of wheat they are looking for
6244098 iran came to the u s with im sure a little bit of reluctance
6244099 if they could i think they wouldnt buy a single ounce of u s wheat
6244100 but a lot of the wheat coming out of the black sea is feed quality and their ports can only handle so much business there are some concerns about the quality of wheat in europe
6244101 they are negotiating to take 500 000 tonnes of new crop australian wheat to top it off for this season
6244102 from the u s perspective that type of measure works against us rather than for us
6244103 the posture is that food wouldnt be used as a weapon

6244121 this book is not intended to be a full or detailed history of animal morphology a complete account is given neither of morphological discoveries nor of morphological theories my aim has been rather to call attention to the existence of diverse typical attitudes to the problems of form and to trace the interplay of the theories that have arisen out of them the main currents of morphological thought are to my mind three the functional or synthetic the formal or transcendental and the materialistic or disintegrative

6244126 imagine the neptunes remixing joe le taxi as performed by peter bjorn amp john and youre about a tenth of the way to what lykke li comes up with

6244128 a rush of everything you ever liked about indie songwriters substantial songwriting crystalline vocals sumptuously simple pop you have to love an artist who reminds you of everyone but defies comparison
6244129 ten years on from its original publication drag city re releases this bewitching collection of sumatran music calling upon disciplines that extend far beyond the indonesian origins of its performers the band responsible for this cross cultural blend were formed in the mid nineties by irwansyah harahap and rithaony hutajulu and the result of their toils is a body of work that you really couldnt compare to anything else its the kind of so called world music release that defies any sense of a single ethnicity
6244130 on when skies wash ashore lead singer alexis brown makes an immediate impression by alternating two voices a normal if impassioned singing voice and the kind of ungodly howl typical of heavy metal groups the music backs the vocal battle royal with a style that similarly alternates between pummeling metal and melodic hard rock

6244148 so i got charged 7 50 for this fee that used to be 3 why did you raise the fee from 3
6244149 7 50 for us automating this transfer is less than 20 for an overdraft

6244155 i cant believe i havent written a review yet for this place
6244156 me too wonder how long we could sit here before someone comes over
6244157 stand up and start shouting go grab a waiter by the lapels cause waiting isnt working and waving isnt working

6244177 there is anecdotal evidence that kids get inspired when they see their olympic heroes do well
6244178 often many gold medalists will say they were inspired by seeing former sporting heroes do well i guess that is the impact the government would hope to get out of this
6244179 all the inspiration doesnt make up for a lack of facilities
6244180 there is a complete dearth of facilities here compared with somewhere like australia
6244181 i think the lack of facilities here just leads to kids hanging about on the streets with nowhere to go
6244182 in terms of olympic medals the thing that probably gets you furthest is spending and focusing resources on athletes who have come forward who are doing well

6244201 egs could be the killer app of the energy world it has the potential to deliver vast quantities of power 24 7 and be captured nearly anywhere on the planet and it would be a perfect complement to intermittent sources like solar and wind
6244202 innovation is the path to massive quantities of cleaner cheaper energy the people were funding today have a real shot at lowering the cost of egs and bringing us closer to our goal of renewable energy cheaper than coal
6244203 the potential of the geothermal industry in australia is truly staggering geoscience australia estimates that if just one percent of australias geothermal energy was extracted it would equate to 26 000 times australias total annual energy consumption
6244204 geothermal energy provides clean base load power and is potentially a very important contributor to australias energy mix in a carbon constrained world
6244205 we could now see australias first commercially viable geothermal power plants in place within four to five years
6244206 new york audiences arent open to new productions and new ideas
6244207 i do find it limiting and i get asked about this thing a lot or just compared to the same people over and over
6244208 if i allow myself to get caught up in that stuff it really upsets me of course i care what people think and i want them to enjoy the music so if its written about in a way thats careless or using one of three known examples it just makes me feel like people really didnt listen

6244211 its usually much more natural a lot of times ill figure out what im writing about as im writing it i think in my subconscious i might be figuring it out and then i sort of shape them as they go but sometimes i think the best ones write themselves i dont always understand it
6244212 weve got a lot of time to get this right
6244213 at least thats how i hope its going to be
6244214 i think youre pretty ugly for turning into one of them
6244215 its not like i plan to tell the world all these things

6244231 i want to say that human rights matters to us every year not just in the olympic year
6244232 support for the games and engagement with china is not at the expense of human rights it is integral to their promotion china has made enormous social and economic progress over the last three decades but much more remains to be done
6244233 i firmly believe that allowing chinas citizens to enjoy freedom of expression and association to worship how and where they wish and to live in confidence that the rule of law will be applied consistently and impartially is not only the right thing to do but will also benefit chinas future stability and prosperity which is in all our interests

6244254 for the first three or four months following the new focus the productivity was basically zero we werent selling anything we were not delivering anything and the overhead clock kept on ticking
6244255 that was the only difficult part our best move was the fact that we didnt go after six or seven parallel implementations at the same time we carried out one and boot strapped that operation and then we matured from having two implementations in parallel to the position we are in now where we can handle maybe four to five all in parallel
6244256 we have got at least three or four industry folks who know the product inside out and the domain itself i dont want to disparage the competition and certainly exc is a very reputable product but i do feel and this is coming from the customers that it is somewhat rigid because that product was designed more than 20 years ago perhaps it is a more mature product but this was back in the dos days and it is cryptic
6244257 what we can accomplish in just a single screen will take many of our competitors multiple screens and many tabs
6244258 more players is one challenge but that also means that there are more people educating the market
6244259 what we observed was that a lot of people that we engaged with had a rudimentary management system when we engaged and showed them what we can do they slowly came round to see it as the market grows more people are going to see the need for real systems

6244300 researchers have speculated that tumours give off different odours but were the first to identify and quantify the compounds involved
6244301 this research opens doors to potential new approaches to skin cancer diagnosis based on the profile of skin odours hopefully leading to more rapid and non invasive detection and diagnosis
6244302 our skin releases many different chemicals and their levels depend on many factors including the area of the body and the age of the person factors that would make developing a national skin cancer screen based on detecting them extremely difficult

6244357 the weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths
6244358 in essence the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch
6244359 ranging from changes characteristic of the primary viral pneumonia and evidence of tissue repair to evidence of severe acute secondary bacterial pneumonia

6244383 he was the first person who became infected in this outbreak and hes been very very seriously ill in hospital
6244384 i just spare a thought for them for the last five weeks i guess it is theyve virtually had to maintain a vigil with him against overwhelming odds of any chance of success it is terrible
6244385 hes been like part of the family for a long long time
6244386 i think weve got some good news there i think shes doing quite well
6244387 across all the business units there are extensive programs in place to help ensure the momentum of the past 18 months continues into the current year
6244388 there is evidence however that global economies are slowing and this could impact the growth in sales
6244389 inflationary pressures are increasing with the impact of higher oil prices flowing through to input costs and higher cost inflation in most countries
6244390 the profit after tax of 369 million was a solid result given the negative impact on earnings of the strong australian dollar
6244391 earnings are anticipated to improve in the current year however growth will be substantially lower than the 29 3 per cent achieved in 2007 08 and is dependent on the impact a slowing us economy may have on volume growth
6244392 is still a few quarters away as we anticipate additional asset sales and write downs in coming quarters throughout the financial services sector
6244393 once again the majority of our negative estimate revisions are being driven by higher than estimated write downs on mortgage assets
6244394 the government formed the view that urine testing is adequate to disclose if drugs might be present in an officers system at the time of a shooting
6244395 there is no evidence that officers with five years or less experience are involved in any more or less firearm related incidents than more experienced officers
6244396 its a sad thing and a beautiful thing we came together and there was strength other than what you see on this corner from where
6244397 we all know where but we dont always speak of it
6244398 i know that you are paralyzed but i will stay with you so that i can help you into the pool the next time an angel of the lord stirs the waters

6244404 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers he said
6244405 while i am pleased to make todays undertaking our medium and long term funding and our retail deposit base represent the greatest proportion of our funding costs and the average cost of these sources of funding continue to increase
6244406 the recent fall in short term funding costs provides an opportunity to undertake to move rates in line with the rba decision but future interest rate decisions will need to reflect an assessment of all the cost of funding factors
6244407 all australian banks are reliant on offshore funding and increases in the average cost of long term funding are likely to be with us for some time
6244408 therefore any consideration that the federal government can give to enhance the attractiveness of retail bank deposits will help reduce overall funding costs and assist in lowering mortgages rates
6244409 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time she told an investor briefing behind the zimmerman tag

6244419 they are the ones that should be looking at what they are doing particularly on budget measures

6244441 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure

6244446 missile defense of course is aimed at no one it is in our defense that we do this
6244447 i propose that the russian federation recognize the republic of abkhazia as a sovereign and independent state and establish diplomatic relations between abkhazia and russia
6244448 the russian military has effective control of the gori region making it responsible for the security and well being of all people living there
6244449 russia should prevent any further militia attacks and allow humanitarian aid to reach the hundreds of vulnerable civilians still in the area including many elderly
6244450 therefore we do not lose heart though outwardly we are wasting away yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day
6244451 we put money and a whole lot of sweat into that house all for someone else we could have done that years ago and enjoyed it for ourselves well never do that again

6244485 we found not just one mastermind behind this action but many
6244486 this person told wamang to purchase the weapons for the attack in jakarta
6244487 but if the findings are linked to the recent american congress declaration we can regard this as a series of interventions on indonesians internal affairs
6244488 i dont want to be in a serious relationship with you
6244489 why dont you go ahead and hit me i can tell you want to im not scarred of you
6244490 wait until they look at your record and realize youre insane

6244492 people never change they just learn to hide themselves better
6244493 paul was literally one of the shining stars in beauty a talented makeup artist who loved the artifice and hassle of achieving looks that at times only otherwise existed in a fertile imagination
6244494 in many cases schools put barriers in the way of students trying to do two things at once
6244495 we have not organised schools on the assumption that kids might be in and out we need to reconstruct education and schooling to acknowledge that there are blurred boundaries
6244496 everyone is great and she is a healthy beautiful baby girl
6244497 i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what hes up against
6244498 senator obama got a little testy on this issue he said i was questioning his patriotism let me be clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgement
6244499 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
6244500 when you feel loved nurtured cared for supported and intimate you are much more likely to be happier and healthier you have a much lower risk of getting sick and if you do a much greater chance of surviving
6244501 when we get stressed out or mad or worried the bottom line is that the hearts rhythmic beating pattern becomes very incoherent and that has the effect of inhibiting the brains cortex
6244502 when we feel emotions like love and appreciation the heart switches into a very rhythmic coherent beating pattern that facilitates cortical function
6244503 when we are in a non loving state when we
6244504 when we are in a loving state our hearts go into coherent heart rhythms
6244505 this is because the two halves of the nervous system are in sync and operating much more efficiently together that allows the body to go through its natural regenerative process
6244506 if we feel love and compassion that boosts our immune system
6244507 the measurement of those two hormones is considered by many including myself to be a very good measure of stress and aging
6244508 if they are out of balance such as high cortisol low dhea that basically is rapid aging learning to love or to love more consciously more of the time brings those hormones into balance this is a very direct pathway to see how love affects health
6244509 natural endogenous morphine like substances that we produce in our brain sex organs gut immune system and heart
6244510 somebody could be flooded with love for their pet or their god and get just as much of a boost as someone who just started going out with someone new
6244511 you call up one of your many images think of that special moment center yourself in your heart and access this physiology then these changes in physiology totally change how you are interacting with your environment they change your internal physiology they change the balance in your autonomic nervous system literally
6244512 we could speculate that in the beginning stages of love there is more of an excitement factor which would produce some of the classical neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and dopamine which are involved with excitement
6244513 maybe as love becomes richer and deeper and different then additional chemicals come into play
6244514 les affaires cest pas grave ya rien de toute fa on mais par contre garde bien mon chateau de sable
6244515 halala clarisse ya que toi qui peut nous sortir une connerie pareil
6244516 es cierto que hubieron propuestas de jugar con otras selecciones pero se consult con el comando t cnico y dijeron que lo m s conveniente era solo desarrollar los trabajos de forma interna por la falta de jugadores

6244518 just so you know my blog is now a pagerank 4
6244519 yay i got the pagerank i wanted but i still am not doing so well in the google serps in fact i used to get like 15 25 hits from google for a myriad of keywords but now i barely only get one per day i have talked to seo people in the blogosphere and theyve really tried to help me out but nothing they said has yet to be successful if i dont start getting visitors from google my pagerank is useless
6244520 offensively i think were getting very sharp in our passing game
6244521 were making improvement on our protection especially our first team im concerned with our running game i dont think were where we need to be and we need to find a way to get better
6244522 defensively i think were ahead on our pressure game im a little concerned with where we are in our pursuit angles were giving up too many big plays right now and we need to get that corrected
6244523 the kicking game i think were starting to get better there
6244524 obi egekeze has been more consistent the last two scrimmages we have three guys to catch punts and all are doing very well
6244525 im not disappointed with where were at i think our attitude is very good
6244526 im anxious to get their legs all the way back i thought yesterday i saw a little more burst in running backs davin meggett and thats a good sign
6244527 im happy hes going to remain a part of our program
6244528 i think a lot of chris and hope hell continue to be a vital part of the team
6244529 since this decision turners had his best practices which kind of shows me something about the kid
6244530 if he was going to go into the tank he wouldve but he hasnt not that jordan steffy hasnt practiced well but turners pass percentage has been in the 70s and jordan has been in the high 60s during practice this week its a pretty good situation for us right now
6244531 id like to scrimmage tomorrow but i dont see anyway possible we can to that with the injuries
6244532 i understand how you feel and thank you for being honest with me
6244533 computers used to take up entire buildings now they just take up our entire lives
6244534 so how do you know what is the right path to choose to get the result that you desire and the honest answer is this you wont and accepting that greatly eases the anxiety of your life experience

6244537 are shifting the majority of our costs for most categories to the back end final value fees which you only pay if youre successful in selling an item
6244538 compared to other sellers in your category your shipping cost is rather high
6244539 starting this fall were moving to an electronic checkout process thats faster and more reliable for sellers and buyers as part of this move checks and money orders will no longer be accepted on ebay although buyers can still use these payment methods for item pick up at the sellers discretion
6244540 finally were instituting a new minimum detailed seller rating dsr requirement as a way to further improve the customer experience for everyone on ebay as of november 1 2008 sellers will need at least a 4 3 across all four dsr categories over the prior 30 day or 12 month period depending on volume in order to list on the site
6244541 id somehow missed the fact that the millionaires proposal was a harlequin romance and as i unpacked the book i found myself groaning inwardly yes i was prejudiced and wasnt expecting much imagine then my surprise when i found myself totally blown away by the book not only enjoying it but actually giggling and sighing as i read harlequin romances have come a long way since i was first introduced to them 15 years ago
6244542 trish wylie takes the reader on a glorious worldwide trip to exotic and classic locations from new york city to fiji to paris while at the same time giving the reader a glance into the most intimate places of the heart an ability to feel wonder a vulnerability an innocence together with a powerful attraction the dramatic conclusion makes this a romance whose insight into love will resonate with anyone who has loved or hopes to love deeply
6244543 kerry and ronan are perfect for each other and i fell in love with these two characters right from the beginning of the story
6244544 a chance meeting on an airplane with travel writer ronan okeefe radically changes hotelier kerry doyles plans for her three month dream vacation but definitely for the better seeing familiar locales through kerrys eyes is a wonderful experience for ronan too and hell get another book out of it eventually but even though their flirtation soon becomes something much more powerful ronan refuses to have a holiday fling with kerry because he thinks she deserves a happy ending that he cant give her trish wylies the millionaires proposal 4 5 is fresh amusing and charming and it has a solid core of emotional truth too a keeper
6244545 this is a significant defeat for burner who made it clear that she needed to outpoll reichert in the primary to keep her national fundraising base engaged and spent over half a million dollars in the loss
6244546 in fact despite his turnout advantages the incumbent has been held under 50 percent of the primary vote and the combined democratic vote is greater than the republican vote
6244547 overall the results basically tell us what we already knew that this race is going to be extremely close on election day
6244548 the four percent primary margin for reichert is a decent argument that he is holding his own and maintaining his usual narrow lead as the incumbent in a tough district
6244549 as long as the results are close i dont think it says a lot while it is true that burner finished ahead in the 2006 primary the presence of the presidential race atop the ballot here should help her considerably this year
6244550 it was an absolutely fabulous night for our statewide candidates
6244551 they all outperformed what our expectations could have been dino first and foremost

6244557 the school did not merely find the confederate flag offensive to some students but rather found that in a context of high racial tensions race related altercations and threats of violence the flag would disrupt the schools educational process
6244558 we have all along felt it was in the best interest of our school environment to not allow any symbols that might be racially divisive in any way
6244559 its very clear this panel doesnt like the confederate flag
6244560 that was their starting point in coming to the decision they did the subject matter of the ban is not supposed to be relevant at all in a first amendment analysis
6244561 ordered that judge murphy shall not sit again as a judge in massachusetts

6244582 but if you go out now you can get more fish

6244587 a news and media blog in the libertarian tenor with limited government overtones facilitating the flow of ideas information e commerce and inspiration within the internet freedom of net neutrality
6244588 my reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government
6244589 commerce with all nations alliance with none should be our motto
6244590 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
6244591 the happy union of these states is a wonder their constitution a miracle their example the hope of liberty throughout the world
6244592 the constitution is the guide which i never will abandon
6244593 a bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government and what no just government should refuse or rest on inference
6244594 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6244595 will help both the alliance and poland and the united states respond to the coming threats
6244596 he got an incredible start i just went wow it was a much more amazing start than he got in the 100m and his turn was just absolutely fabulous
6244597 he has incredible speed and an incredibly long stride that affords him the ability to cover more ground with every stride the way no one else can
6244598 my house has been taken over by more than 100 people from inside and outside the community
6244599 they are waving flags beating drums and just making a lot of noise but this is a special moment and to know that a jamaican has done this and i am the father of that jamaican makes me feel special i never expected him to break the world record but i am proud of my son
6244600 obviously from the race he can go faster than the 9 69 he was having fun in the last 20m celebrating and breaking the world record thats awesome you can read into it he can probably go under 9 60 but i am not good at predictions i just love to see things unfold
6244601 its an important signal but there is also important substance to it
6244602 in practical terms nato is offering close cooperation with the georgian government and the georgian military

6244785 the other guy threw two balls at guys heads i was shocked
6244786 i dont know if he really tried to hit me

6244815 obama is the choice for change and renewal he gives hope to millions of americans and europeans for a fairer world progressive europeans are united in hope that barack obama will be the new president following the u s elections

6244819 it was the american colonels even more than the generals who were asking for more troops
6244820 we believe in why we are fighting here and we want to finish this fight we know we can win it
6244821 perhaps companies will want to put wind turbines atop bridges and skyscrapers or use the enormous potential of powerful offshore winds miles out off the atlantic coasts
6244822 i think it would be a thing of beauty if when lady liberty looks out on the horizon she not only welcomes new immigrants but lights their way with a torch powered by an ocean wind farm
6244823 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
6244824 we expect to be able to start treating cancer patients in november
6244825 we will have imaging a blood draw station and we have a pharmacy right next door
6244826 its for our patients convenience when you have a sick relative its tough getting them and out of a car in four different places
6244827 we will be able to provide the latest technology to the community under one roof
6244828 when a patient gets radiation they need to go every day
6244829 if you have a lung nodule you dont want to wait two weeks for a report this way you dont have to
6244830 we think this makes better business sense and ultimately it will help us to serve the public better
6244831 what was meant to be a temporary fix turned into something a lot more
6244832 whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
6244833 so will web sites and bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
6244834 this election if it goes one way we could see a re imposition of the fairness doctrine

6244838 this administration came to town saying that amtrak was a goner
6244839 but look whats happened people are sitting on these trains using them begging for opportunities
6244840 mark my words the biggest travel day of the year thanksgiving is going to be an awakening for people across america when they find out they cant get a plane reservation because of the reduction in schedules and theyre going to find amtrak full
6244841 theyre going to ask members of congress and the senate why didnt you see this coming
6244842 as with previous multi year drm development efforts this one disintegrated like wet kleenex on contact with the general public now that vista hdcp blu ray and hd dvd are all broken it seems like the millions of dollars and thousands of work hours sunk into these systems was mis spent the only benefit that these anti copying systems confer to the companies that developed them is the right to sue competitors and that benefit could have been had by shellacking a one atom thick layer of token drm onto their systems just enough to be able to invoke the dmca everything else was just gold plating wasted money
6244843 they know how long it took them to get to that point and when we show up within fifteen minutes and it took them an hour and a half to get there theyre very happy to see us

6244898 i was stunned by the news today of the passing of congresswoman stephanie tubbs jones there is a great gap where she stood on behalf of affordable health care womens issues access to quality education and fairness in voting
6244899 whether you were a presidential candidate a colleague debating on the floor or a friend passing time you wanted her on your team for her quick legal mind tenacious debating skills her infectious humor and that thousand watt smile my heart is heavy she was larger than life and we will all greatly miss the gentlewoman from cleveland my prayers are with her family friends and staff

6244903 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information
6244904 so the next president cant do a damn thing about unraveling this disaster which is appropriately enough an embryonic police state
6244905 efforts to harmonize the rules governing criminal and national security matters also raise potential civil liberties concerns

6244956 badri should have been selected in the indian team 2 years back itself he is a prime example of selectors ignoring genuine talent and performance in domestic and a tours lesser batsmen got preference repeatedly over him perhaps the south zone selector in the selection panel has got something personal against him even for this series if he hadnt shouted after finally being fed up openly against selectors he wouldnt have got selected
6244957 hes been performing consistently over the years back home and on india a tours

6244991 im really not sure about mccain i really dont want to see him pick joe lieberman
6244992 hes seen as having foreign policy experience and background that obama doesnt
6244993 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined
6244994 stephanie tubbs jones was a gifted trailblazer with a spirit as big as the city she loved
6244995 punched a clock day in and day out one as a skycap the other as a factory worker
6244996 its really great because as a kid i was a huge superman fan and i watched all the movies with my parents
6244997 im a big pop culture mythology guy so stories like the superman mythology and the star wars mythology theyre significant and theyre important because i think theyre great tools for teaching basic moralities especially to kids so thats why i am so into them thats why i feel very lucky to be a part of it
6244998 you know who doesnt want to take a swing at that guy
6244999 i just hope the fans like what we do with it because its our own interpretation its with the blessing of dc comics and we are not invalidating any back story doomsdays had previously but we are interpreting and adding to that back story and hopefully the fans dig on it
6245000 i was told that early on i think battlestar galactica co star katee sackhoff suggested that to me because she went though hell with that stuff about playing starbuck i try to stay away from it and just kind of do what i think i should do and hope they like it and eventually it will trickle back whether people like it or not id rather have that happen in sort of a more natural process then going to seek it out
6245001 i dont stay up late at night googling myself too often
6245002 i will say that i do like to hear fans reactions because i dont take things very personally and i know that a lot of the time i am just more impressed and excited that people care so much even if its negative
6245003 i really want to know who clark is and whats going on with him
6245004 i am very inquisitive about clark because he was close to lex and lex is missing thats pretty much the only thing i want to find out right now is where he is and i think that clark can help me do that so im trying to find out ways that i can convince clark to help me out
6245005 the stories about him are incredible everybody loves him and watching him hes so talented id absolutely love to work with michael rosenbaum
6245006 what i can tell you is that we know each other
6245007 and im still finding out how we know each other but we do
6245008 the pilot i shot with justin was so much fun
6245009 we got to play paramedics so there was a lot of needles involved and there was a lot of tubing it was really cool then to have the opportunity to work with him again because its a familiar face coming into a group of people you dont know its nice to have one person that you do know
6245010 whats cool is that there are members of the crew that were on battlestar galactica
6245011 so getting there were some friendly faces that was really awesome
6245012 and i cant say anything about that but its a very cool thing where that relationship is going its a new type of thing for the show ill say this i dont think clark has had the opportunity to have a friend like davis and likewise i cant get any more vague then that can i theyre going to have a very unique buddy buddy friendship and that sounds weird too doesnt it i just cant talk about it i really cant its an awesome idea though its a really awesome idea
6245013 he grew up in the foster system he was bounced from home to home and had a very tough childhood he is brought into the story as he forms this fast friendship with chloe and eventually he starts sort of blacking out missing time and he becomes curious as to why that is happening what he learns is really horrible stuff he finds out that he is innately the opposite of what he wanted to be hopefully the telling of that story will be very sad and psychologically messed up and it will probably very easily be the darkest stuff smallville has ever done
6245014 then eventually he is doomsday and he will eventually resemble the character dc comics fans are expecting
6245015 playing those roles its really tiring but its a great challenge
6245016 i like doing things that intimidate me you know when i read the script for the mist
6245017 oh hi my name is its nice to meet you so how are you doin
6245018 i was invited by srp activists living in the us then i took a few days of vacation before returning back to cambodia

6245030 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined
6245031 ok if anything changes between now and when you leave work just send me an email i has an iphone now so i can always get emails
6245032 they would paint a picture of what a university is like
6245033 so i was like cool its not impossible you can get into college so now im inspired i dont want to settle for an associate degree now i want to go higher
6245034 the vast majority of these types of outreach opportunities are focused on the kids who are the straight a students the top of their class
6245035 and being a ged guy myself i know there are people out there who arent at the top of their class and still have some capacity to do this work they just dont have any exposure to the college dream its really not a matter of ability as much as it is opportunity
6245036 to get students interested in science and to see that science can do something really interesting help solve the energy problem
6245037 solving the energy problem i heard someone say is like building a cathedral
6245038 we will never see the end of it they might but i wont see the cathedral built but its important to get people interested in science and involved in helping to solve what i think is the worlds biggest challenge
6245039 the important council of nicaea which for us really is the foundation of our faith in fact we confess the faith formulated at nicaea did not lead to the situation of reconciliation and unity as constantine who organized this great council had hoped it was followed instead by a truly chaotic situation of in fighting
6245040 in his book on the holy spirit st basil compares the situation of the church subsequent to the council of nicea to a naval battle at night in which no one recognizes the other but everyone fights everyone else it really was a situation of total chaos thus st basil painted in strong colors the drama of the postconciliar period the aftermath of nicaea
6245041 fifty years later for the first council of constantinople the emperor invited st gregory of nazianzus to take part in the council st gregory answered no i will not come because i know these things i know that all councils produce nothing but confusion and fighting so i shall not be coming and he did not go
6245042 some were of the opinion that this cultural revolution was what the second vatican council desired this faction said this is the council literally the texts are still somewhat antiquated but this is the spirit behind the written words this is the will of the council this is what we have to do on the other hand however was a reaction that said this is the way to destroy the church
6245043 christians at first were few in number and held the same opinions but when they grew to be a great multitude they were divided and separated each wishing to have his own individual party for this was their object from the beginning being thus separated through their numbers they confute one another still having so to speak one name in common if indeed they still retain it and this is the only thing which they are yet ashamed to abandon while other matters are determined in different ways by the various sects
6245044 the impostor callistus bishop of rome having ventured on such opinions established a school of theology in antagonism to the church adopting the foregoing system of instruction and he first invented the device of conniving with men in regard of their indulgence in sensual pleasures saying that all had their sins forgiven by himself for he who is in the habit of attending the congregation of any one else and is called a christian should he commit any transgression the sin they say is not reckoned unto him provided only he hurries off and attaches himself to the school of callistus and many persons were gratified with his regulation as being stricken in conscience and at the same time having been rejected by numerous sects while also some of them in accordance with our condemnatory sentence had been by us forcibly ejected from the church and withal after such audacious acts they lost to all shame attempt to call themselves a catholic church
6245045 i know moreover that not only this thing saddens you but also the fact that while others have obtained the churches by violence you are meanwhile cast out from your places for they hold the places but you the apostolic faith they are it is true in the places but outside of the true faith while you are outside the places indeed but the faith within you let us consider whether is the greater the place or the faith clearly the true faith who then has lost more or who possesses more he who holds the place or he who holds the faith good indeed is the place when the apostolic faith is preached there holy is it if the holy one dwell there but ye are blessed who by faith are in the church dwell upon the foundations of the faith and have full satisfaction even the highest degree of faith which remains among you unshaken for it has come down to you from apostolic tradition and frequently has accursed envy wished to unsettle it but has not been able on the contrary they have rather been cut off by their attempts to do so for this is it that is written thou art the son of the living god peter confessing it by revelation of the father and being told blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood did not reveal it to thee but my father who is in heaven and the rest no one therefore will ever prevail against your faith most beloved brethren for if ever god shall give back the churches for we think he will yet without such restoration of the churches the faith is sufficient for us and lest speaking without the scriptures i should seem to speak too strongly it is well to bring you to the testimony of scriptures for recollect that the temple indeed was at jerusalem the temple was not deserted aliens had invaded it whence also the temple being at jerusalem those exiles went down to babylon by the judgment of god who was proving or rather correcting them while manifesting to them in their ignorance punishment by means of blood thirsty enemies and aliens indeed had held the place but knew not the lord of the place while in that he neither gave answer nor spoke they were deserted by the truth what profit then is the place to them for behold they that hold the place are charged by them that love god with making it a den of thieves and with madly making the holy place a house of merchandise and a house of judicial business for themselves to whom it was unlawful to enter there for this and worse than this is what we have heard most beloved from those who are come from thence however really then they seem to hold the church so much the more truly are they cast out and they think themselves to be within the truth but are exiled and in captivity and gain no advantage by the church alone for the truth of things is judged
6245046 for the emperor and all good men had one and the same aim that the east and west should be knit together by the bond of fellowship but wickedness does not long lie hid and the sore that is healed superficially before the bad humour has been worked off breaks out again valens and ursacius and others associated with them in their wickedness eminent christian bishops of course began to wave their palms and to say they had not denied that he was a creature but that he was like other creatures at that moment the term usia was abolished the nicene faith stood condemned by acclamation the whole world groaned and was astonished to find itself arian
6245047 but in addition to its doctrinal work the council of constantinople issued a series of disciplinary canons which went straight to the heart of roman claims to primacy over the whole church the council decreed that appeals in the cases of bishops should be heard within the bishops own province a direct rebuttal of romes claim to be the final court of appeal in all such cases it went on to stipulate that the bishop of constantinople shall have the pre eminence in honour after the bishop of rome for constantinople is new rome this last canon was totally unacceptable to rome for two reasons in the first place it capitulated to the imperial claim to control of the church since constantinople had nothing but the secular status of the city to justify giving it this religious precedence worse however the wording implied that the primacy of rome itself was derived not from its apostolic pedigree as the church of peter and paul but from the fact that it had once been the capital of empire damasus bishop of rome and his successors refused to accept the canons
6245048 what is one to say to the disorders in the other churches for the evil did not stop even here constantinople but made its way to the east for as when some evil humor is discharged from the head all the other parts are corrupted so now also these evils having originated in this great city as from a fountain confusion has spread in every direction and clergy have everywhere made insurrection against bishops there has been schism between bishop and bishop people and people and will be yet more every place is suffering from the throes of calamity and the subversion of the whole civilized world
6245049 meeting all these new intelligent people it makes me say im not as smart as i think i am
6245050 basically i just want to help them build a really good r sum for their college application
6245051 out of the mindset of the dysfunction of their community
6245052 i think it helps them to feel that college is the next step not this ambiguous untenable thing
6245053 youre more likely to be asked to consume a lot of peoples arguments and then regurgitate it in college its a lot of your own thought put into things
6245054 even though we come from a lot of different backgrounds i feel like we really connect that we have a lot in common
6245055 for them this is a huge opportunity whereas someone from an affluent family might take that for granted the bronx letters kids really set the tone for community camaraderie and friendship
6245056 whine about taking the bus or bart im like whats the big deal
6245057 i thought it was going to be all hippies but theres a lot of homeless people and they come up and talk to you i dont like that
6245058 details how local educators are earnestly responding to the unrelenting pressure of top down accountability policies often with little support from above
6245059 even when principals place heavy emphasis on activities such as identifying struggling students or emphasizing test preparation teachers often adopt inconsistent practices displaying considerable autonomy
6245060 when district leaders emphasized that boosting learning is the paramount priority and principals motivated their teachers we found smaller achievement gaps between ethnic groups
6245061 accountability pressures can move teachers to focus on lifting low achieving students especially when they draw on individual pupil data and devise inventive pedagogical practices

6245082 due to the decrease in the number of worshippers attending services and the steadily increasing expense of operating and maintaining the building the congregation and the dioceses of colorado have agreed that the episcopal presence in colorado must come to an end
6245083 no one is shutting us down its just the circumstances as they are make it necessary to end over 120 years of the episcopal presence in trinidad
6245084 id always been an episcopalian and when we moved to trinidad from nebraska in 1973 i started attending the church
6245085 we were introduced to the concept of the canonical requirements allowing for the ordaining of lay members by a supply priest we got approval from the dioceses and the bishop
6245086 remote communities utilized the concept or sacramental services wouldnt be available for long periods of time

6245100 everyone is great and she is a healthy beautiful baby girl
6245101 when i read that i could hardly believe it was actually being thought about it just makes no sense in my mind that you would even want to bring that up
6245102 lets just deal with the problem of binge drinking if its there no matter what age itll be there then lets deal with that as a national concern more than an age limit
6245103 weve got plenty of 18 year olds going to high school and i would not want to have that extra responsibility on schools at the high school level to have to deal with that on top of everything else
6245104 weve seen these isolated reports about people having connectivity issues with 3g and edge and frankly i have those issues on a variety of phones cellphone coverage is tricky
6245105 my belief is that because at amp ts network is not built out to every cell site people are getting frustrated because theyre finding places where the 3g signal isnt available or is weak
6245106 i believe in gov huckabees message and consider it an honor to have his endorsement for my campaign
6245107 as state representative i will continue to stand for conservative values responsible government spending and lower taxes to stimulate our local economy

6245110 and the united states will work with our allies to ensure georgias independence and territorial integrity
6245111 continue to provide needed humanitarian aid to the georgian people
6245112 it is not significant and it needs to increase both the size and pace of the withdrawal needs to increase and needs to increase sooner rather than later
6245113 it means a lot to me and i know it means a lot to the country also because i talked to the prime minister and he told me every inch in jamaica is blocked off pretty much everybody is in the streets it means a lot to me i have written history so i am happy with myself i am really proud
6245114 we all practice together so we know who will perform well but it is at the time when you are supposed to do it hopefully some people will hold it together and do it because they are all good
6245115 i was selected for rowing but when i arrived to the rowing venue and i saw the ice and i saw the rowers who were rowing in the ice and well i did not like it and then my coach offered me to throw hammer and i agreed because i like to throw hammer
6245116 i blew my mind and i blew the worlds mind
6245117 i spoke to the prime minister on the phone and he told me everybody is in the streets he told me i have written history pretty much and i am really proud of that the 200 has been my love since i was 15 it means so much more to me than the 100
6245118 hes a 6 6 guy who runs like hes 5 foot 9
6245119 how fast can one man go before you cant go faster we never thought that 200 mark would go down and its gone i never thought anyone would run 9 6 in the 100 and thats gone too hes definitely running much faster than the rest of us and we all have to try to catch him now his every stride is two and a half of mine when youre way in the back inhaling all the dust youre not happy
6245120 i blew my mind and i blew the worlds mind
6245121 i spoke to the prime minister on the phone and he told me everybody is in the streets he told me i have written history pretty much and i am really proud of that the 200 has been my love since i was 15 it means so much more to me than the 100
6245122 hes a 6 6 guy who runs like hes 5 foot 9
6245123 how fast can one man go before you cant go faster we never thought that 200 mark would go down and its gone i never thought anyone would run 9 6 in the 100 and thats gone too hes definitely running much faster than the rest of us and we all have to try to catch him now his every stride is two and a half of mine when youre way in the back inhaling all the dust youre not happy
6245124 anybody who wants to cast aspersions at our program about drugs i can say just one thing they can go to hell
6245125 let me tell you something i am the person who tests in jamaica i tested him15 times from november or december since hes come here hes been tested six times for blood and urine we are ready at any time at any hour to be tested
6245126 ive watched sammy throughout the years tying him its ok i guess
6245127 i never thought i was going to see him hit a home run as a manager
6245128 everybody else does im more concerned about getting hits and getting on base you get hits and home runs happen but it is good to get the first one at home
6245129 its a pleasure and a privilege to have somebody like that playing with you and to get to watch that accomplishment is great ive watched it really by playing against him all those years he was with seattle and its just very special
6245130 i was in free fall and nothing was catching me
6245131 during an obvious time of grief when one loses ones spouse rosemarie was forced to appeal the decision of the va and contacted us for help
6245132 and im glad in this case we were able to prevent it
6245133 its almost like a brand it implies causation and it seems to be something that any of us developed if we were put in that situation
6245134 he had a lot of trouble sleeping drank more than he had before he had some you know not fights because he wasnt in a condition to fight but you know he had some incidents
6245135 there was one incident where he stuck up for somebody and you know he got punched in the eye and couldnt do anything about it because he called me late at night and he was getting taken to the hospital for stitches we tried to encourage him to get help
6245136 the more people are in those environments the more likely they are to have some kind of effect most military lawyers when they get a case and they find out their client has been downrange they ask about it
6245137 i feel withdrawn a lot of the time and its constant problems between my wife and i i just feel alone even when shes there
6245138 when i get put in stressful situations sometimes i just well the two things i pled guilty to
6245139 thats not how somebody should react to a situation like that
6245140 plaintiffs and defendants like it because it implies causation and it seems to be something that any of us developed if we were put in that situation
6245141 my hunch is that military juries will be sympathetic to it in a way that civilian juries wont theyll be more familiar with what deployment is like
6245142 the courts have really tightened up the rules on diminished capacity in recent years
6245143 if there is an environment that adds to the stress level theyre going to recognize that it can turn into reasonable doubt
6245144 the judge took this fact into consideration when deciding the sentence
6245145 so i think its a half and half chance if you can present strong and reliable evidence of your mental illness it helps
6245146 our focus is on making sure that any soldier charged with misconduct and there is associated issues stemming from the war zone be it ptsd or tbi traumatic brain injury or other disorders we bring these issues to light for the fact finder
6245147 there is a push from the army for leaders to be aware of ptsd and tbi commanders recognize these issues are relevant and these types of injuries are occurring
6245148 can criminal activity manifest itself as a symptom of ptsd
6245149 yes due to the angry outbursts the aggression the startle response the anxiety the fear involved
6245150 to tell the voters where i want to take our country first i need to tell them where i came from
6245151 i started working for 1 50 an hour at the age of 17 to support my family when my father became ill and he had no health insurance from that beginning i created a company that employs over 250 people i know what it is like to go without health care and no one should have to experience that thats why i give my employees health care free college tuition and good wages these things ive done as a businessman are the same things i want to do for middle class families in new mexico

6245167 but we are looking at ways to ensure that we can revive services on campuses non academic services that in many parts of australia have been seriously eroded by the changes the howard government has made

6245177 kay hulls therefore i presume the national party the national farmers federation appear to be supporting the governments position yet we have mr nelson and mr robb rowing in exactly the reverse direction
6245178 i think it is time the liberal and national party the opposition sorted out whether they have got any policy on this at all

6245187 okay i need to put all this in a nicely structured system and then i can decide what to do with it all
6245188 i will as far as i have been able to learn them give you some of the particulars relative to colonel beaus fight in the chickasawhachee after marching about four miles in mud and water from knee deep to near their waists the advance guard discovered the enemys tents pitched on dry ground and such being their eagerness for fight they cracked away at an indian who chanced to be walking down to the water to wash his hands this alarmed the whole camp and they rushed out and commenced a regular fire at our men behind the cover of trees amp c led on by a chief who did all that he could to encourage his men until an unerring ball from a rifle laid him prostrate upon the earth the firing lasted about twenty minutes when the charge was made and the enemy fled with precipitation leaving thirteen dead upon the field and ample evidence of a much greater number being slain many were seen to be picked up and carried off they were pursued for some distance the indians had thirty six tents and an incredible quantity of beef bacon horses saddles bridles homespun cooking utensils amp c amp c all of which fell into the hands of the victorious whites many rifles were also taken in a word the whole camp equipage was taken and destroyed by the troops their situation now is desperate the whites had nine wounded of which one has since died mr john hardison of early mr james buchanan of this place a gallant soldier had his thigh broken but is doing well it is generally admitted that if the advance guard had reserved their fire until the main body could have gotten up every rascal of them would have been taken as an evidence of their desire to fight when it was necessary for a guard to be placed over the horses during the absence of the troops the officers were compelled to detail them regularly for that purpose no one being willing to remain after buchanan fell he called some men to him and begged them to hold him up until he could shoot but his gun had been wet and it would not fire two dead indians have been found since the battle and some twenty five or thirty horses and mules taken the swamp is from four to eight miles wide and fifteen miles long and now and then a dry spot of earth appears it is infested with alligators bears wolves amp c not a human being save the savage has ever explored it it is impossible to say how many indians there are tom carrs estimate is generally believed to be correct he was in the battle and fought gallantly he numbers them at three hundred there were at any rate thirty six cloth tents beall had two hundred and seventy five the indians will now without doubt use every effort to escape for their situation is as i have before stated desperate it is feared by some that they have already gone if they have riot their time has well nigh drawn to a close for the boys are mad and determined to have them beall has now three hundred men under his command our battalion will augment that number to five hundred it is believed that yet a greater number of men will be necessary to force the indians from the swamp or to keep them in it
6245189 near the road leading from albany to blakely in a solitary place about two
6245190 alarmed by the shouts of the savages they attempted to escape a horrid
6245191 a party of whites next day visited the spot they found some dead some
6245192 in their blind rage the savages had missed the object of their vengeance
6245193 the appearance of the place is in keeping with its history the woods look dark and gloomy long moss hangs in curtains from the trees as if nature in sympathy for the murdered family had clothed herself in the habiliments of woe
6245194 in many cases schools put barriers in the way of students trying to do two things at once
6245195 we have not organised schools on the assumption that kids might be in and out we need to reconstruct education and schooling to acknowledge that there are blurred boundaries
6245196 how stupid does australia look when we are flying people in from overseas to do these jobs
6245197 how can we have an entire industry out there under threat because we cant get people to work here
6245198 theres not enough encouragement in the system to get people off the dole and into these jobs
6245199 there has to be tougher rules because indigenous people just arent taking up the jobs if youre not prepared to put your hand up for a job no matter where it is we shouldnt have to continue paying the dole
6245200 the vast majority of indigenous people need to work and are ready to work
6245201 it would be a tragedy if it had to be farmed out to other nations
6245202 i think it is because at a time when entry level work is shrinking these are areas where our people can show they can enter
6245203 the most difficult end of the labour market young indigenous people with no skills
6245204 the bottom line from our end is you cannot force people to work
6245205 all the attempts we have made in getting indigenous workers involved have failed the best form of aid for anyone is employment and opportunity
6245206 if we can give people work its a win win situation but they just wont take the work
6245207 how can we have 22 000 low skill jobs go begging when we have so many indigenous people who are unemployed
6245208 unemployment benefits should be suspended in places like mildura during the picking season if jobs cant be filled
6245209 its not entirely realistic to force people to move vast distances
6245210 but if unskilled work is readily available in a particular area unemployment benefits should no longer be available
6245211 dont we have our first priority and responsibility to australians particularly those who havent got work
6245212 no way stop indigenous australians from getting a job as a seasonal worker
6245213 overseas low skilled seasonal workers will be employed only after employers have demonstrated they have first made reasonable efforts to employ australians
6245214 the bad news is st louis doesnt know you youve got to make them love you
6245215 if we do that well help the whole team out
6245216 but in the meantime i know quite a bit more about our backfield now
6245217 there are a million reasons that i could tell you for why things happen but this is a bottom line business
6245218 no one is going to help us we have not been a good team we really struggled last year
6245219 but i feel were well prepared to meet the challenges this year
6245220 last year was bad for us and it was good for us

6245225 i felt great out there until i hit the last lap and those guys hit a gear i just didnt have today blincoe said
6245226 i couldnt think of anything else i could have done except maybe get a race in i havent had a race for the last month
6245227 it was a very stacked field so i knew going into it that it was going to be a handful but i felt confident with the way id been training i thought i could give those guys a crack but i came up three or four places short
6245228 they wound it up from five or six laps out and that deadened my legs but ill learn from that experience and next year at the world champs ill have another crack at the 5 and hopefully make it into the final
6245229 there hasnt been one year in the last eight that i havent improved somewhat first over 1500 and t hen in the transition to the 5k
6245230 a fuel pipeline was incorrectly connected letting some fuel flow towards a welding bay some distance away
6245231 a petrol tank with about 1000 litres of petrol caught fire
6245232 the concern everyone had was trying to stop the fire spreading to the nearby buildings
6245233 i thought i was ocs over the line at the start so when i arrived at the top mark i checked the board to see if i was over i just turned my head to look and lost my balance
6245234 nick shouted a little bit and made it look closer than it was but it wasnt an issue he had a bit of nerves and made a bigger deal of it than it should have been and i figured that stage he was broken and struggling a little bit
6245235 i saw nick afterwards and just felt really sorry for him its pretty tough when something like that comes down one race
6245236 hes a friend ive known him for a long time and hes a very good sailor with lots of experience hes had an amazing year
6245237 i wont say ive lived like a monk for the last little while but ive been really focused and i need to take some time off and think about life
6245238 i was a little bit emotional but not as much as i expected ive been on verge of tears for the last 24 hours but the relief of winning killed a bit of that all through last night and this morning i was pretty nervous it was a pretty stressful day and a stressful race
6245239 el culpable hay que buscarlo en un sistema social b rbaro donde el ser humano no cuenta para nada a la vista est y donde s lo se valora el mercado y la obtenci n del m ximo beneficio a toda costa
6245240 and although countless tech pundits will chime in and discuss exactly why google has been able to run roughshod over its competition few will point out one basic fact that is too often overlooked google search is designed to get rid of you as quickly as possible surely some will attribute googles success to its better search results or yahoos management troubles or microsofts poor offering but it goes far beyond that search isnt simply about relevant results or the competition instead search is all about getting you to your destination as quickly as possible
6245241 both facebook and google are beating each other up to lock up the next phase social recommendation and participation

6245245 isolation characterization and structure of bacterial flagellar motors containing the switch complex
6245246 you see it looks like a man made machine if it looks like a duck then it must be a duck all machines we are familiar with have been designed therefore the flagellum must be a product of intelligent design
6245247 structure of the bacterial flagellar hook and implication for the molecular universal joint mechanism
6245248 complete atomic model of the bacterial flagellar filament by electron cryomicroscopy

6245252 in january 2009 alex bogusky the man whose agency made burger king a pop culture icon and is carving out a similar path for pizza giant dominos will be debuting a new book the 9 inch diet
6245253 the volume claims to be not just another diet book and a look at the twisted conspiracy thats making our country fat the books marketing says it will focus on what many call proportion distortion how our plates and average serving sizes have increased over the past few decades to secretly forge a nation of fatties this idea and the motivation to stop the dinnerware expanding insanity seems to stand in sharp contrast to the agenda pushed by crispin porter amp bogusky on behalf of some of its clients

6245257 charlottesville area community foundation for the leroi moore memorial fund
6245258 do you want to buy the extended warranty with that hon
6245259 well hon you have to pay for that at the time of purchase you cant buy it later
6245260 i thought you didnt want it so ive already deleted it hon
6245261 if you call me hon one more time im going to reach down your throat and rip out your tonsils
6245262 so when you compound that with students who already have obstacles to a good education like african american students or special education students that really creates a double edged sword
6245263 you know they may think about doing something but when they think about corporal punishment that fear will make them say no i dont think im going to do that right now
6245264 it makes them more aggressive more delinquent and makes them have more mental health problems
6245265 los cad veres destrozados estaban fundidos con ramas con rocas y con restos del avi n
6245266 i think that the relationship between people that are great is they have a common thread of knowing how to beat their competitors and they know how to constantly be in shape and in top form
6245267 if thats the case id know everything about how to beat michael hed also know everything to beat me wed have to tie
6245268 but they need to change the order in which its participated on that particular day so that he would have more than 27 minutes of rest
6245269 i was training as hard as i could and while my diet was healthy i figured that nutrition might be the key
6245270 so i went to a sports nutrition seminar afterwards i collared the speaker kerry kayes and we chatted about my injuries he went through my diet and said i wasnt getting enough protein it made sense so i started taking protein supplements that was the turning point
6245271 the trauma that modern triathletes put their bodies through is immense
6245272 that calls for extra protein to help muscles repair themselves to get enough extra protein from an ordinary diet would mean eating huge amounts of food and having to deal with subsequent weight issues a good protein supplement delivers the protein in a low calorie easily digested formula that gives the body what it needs when it needs it
6245273 i tend to go back to certain races each year to gauge my level of fitness
6245274 at wetherby in 2007 i came sixth with an overall time of two hours eight minutes this year in much worse conditions i came third in two hours three minutes
6245275 typically in the past id take around 25 minutes for a 1500 metre swim ive shaved at least two minutes off that this year
6245276 its the best job i could be doing i get to train every day while other people are at work and i can keep a close eye on my diet too
6245277 i live nine miles from the fire station so i run or bike in every day
6245278 theres no doubt that kerrys protein supplements have made all the difference this year
6245279 my performance has improved and im really enjoying competing theyre very easy to drink too absolutely spot on
6245280 hills reluctance to fight late in the day regardless of his own physical condition was the second confederate mistake of the evening
6245281 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined medical doctors and neurosurgeons from huron hospital and cleveland clinic sadly report that at 6 12 p m congresswoman stephanie tubbs jones died
6245282 i was stunned by the news today of the passing of congresswoman stephanie tubbs jones there is a great gap where she stood on behalf of affordable health care womens issues access to quality education and fairness in voting
6245283 whether you were a presidential candidate a colleague debating on the floor or a friend passing time you wanted her on your team for her quick legal mind tenacious debating skills her infectious humor and that thousand watt smile my heart is heavy she was larger than life and we will all greatly miss the gentlewoman from cleveland my prayers are with her family friends and staff
6245284 teach us to number our days aright that we may gain a heart of wisdom
6245285 it was great to be back though not so nice to start out down 2 0

6245297 at this point in time like i told you guys yesterday were going to have to be looking for guys that are maybe not having their best years and hopefully a change of scenery type of thing will help
6245298 occupy a country and say you are going to leave
6245299 honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom
6245300 there was a lot of discussion among the different parties so what we plan is to take a look at those and factor them into our decision making
6245301 its obvious but i just havent said it yet billy stull has had an outstanding camp
6245302 the guy has played smart hes made good decisions with the football and hes thrown the football very accurately hes shown great leadership skills and hell be the starter on opening day
6245303 imagine being buried deep in sand and wanting to move but cannot

6245305 the okanagan mountain park fire became the most destructive interface wildfire in canadian history before it was controlled it had razed nearly 26 000 hectares of forest and burned through the southern neighbourhoods of the city of kelowna consuming 239 homes
6245306 in the boreal forest natures way provided a mosaic pattern of fire ravaged stands of same age trees creating a natural firebreak interfering with nature through suppression of fire in these stands set in motion the mechanism for larger wider ranging and often devastating blazes
6245307 what is your opinion on harvesting the beetle destroyed trees in canada for the wood pellet industry how would you rate the logistics of such an endeviour cutting the trees transportation to a mill and mill availability
6245308 this will more than double the graffiti reduction fund of one million dollars per year
6245309 so in addition to the grant program for cctv were also putting extra money into the cleanup so we can actually have that graffiti removed
6245310 weve indicated were not proposing to do something thats compulsory but we are looking at ways to ensure that we can revive services on campuses non academic services that in many parts of australia have been seriously eroded by the changes the howard government has made
6245311 the report suggests that we are both going to do something that is compulsory but also have an opt out clause but it cant be both so im not quite sure of the logic of the position thats being put
6245312 weve indicated that were not proposing to do something compulsory but we havent concluded those consultations and investigations of what the options are
6245313 the way the former bill was drafted it was not so much an abolition just of student union fees it was an abolition of the capacity of the university to pay for other infrastructure that surrounded the universities and makes up intrinsically what a university is
6245314 if somebody puts forward a bill that really does start taking money for political purposes or issues such as that which are really of a personal view then i wouldnt agree to that
6245315 animal cruelty is often a mechanism for kids to take out anger for their own abuse persistent early age animal cruelty is an early indicator of a child whos in trouble
6245316 dogs are more likely to be abused while being disciplined and cats are more likely to be killed and tortured
6245317 were so human centric as a society that its hard to get people interested in looking at animal cruelty unless we can directly relate it to the human benefits
6245318 by treating animal cruelty particularly in children were assisting in preventing other forms of violence
6245319 im thrilled to face a new challenge beyond current affairs broadcasting
6245320 to balance my broadcasting career with a different genre of television and show people new facets of myself as a presenter is an exciting opportunity
6245321 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come
6245322 but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived
6245323 the burden of damascus behold damascus is taken away from being a city and it shall be a ruinous heap
6245324 our position is that we are ready to co operate with russia in any project that can strengthen its security
6245325 i think russia really has to think of the response it will make when it finds itself closed in a circle
6245326 in order to have a base you need a decent navy ours is weak
6245327 a base is expensive to keep is it just to have a flag there a show of strength to scare
6245328 georgia began the crisis and the west accuses russia syria suffered the same thing attempts to destabilise the country distortion of the facts and double standards
6245329 the entire front line of the armys brass stepped down because of the war gal hirsch who was defeated in lebanon went to georgia and they too lost because of him
6245330 relying on israeli experts and weapons georgia learnt why the israeli generals failed what happened in georgia is a message to all those the americans are seeking to entangle in dangerous adventures
6245331 and say thus saith the lord god behold i am against thee o gog the chief prince of meshech and tubal
6245332 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6245333 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6245334 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6245335 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6245336 after what happened in georgia i believe that this is good protection for us
6245337 made the americans agree to this deal sooner because the russians are getting too bossy
6245338 will help both the alliance and poland and the united states respond to the coming threats
6245339 in troubled times the most important thing is to have friends
6245340 but it is more important to have friends who share your values and your aspirations and your dreams and poland and the united states are those kind of friends
6245341 in australian politics you have to appear competent but not over confident
6245342 one of john howards strategies was always to suggest that the election was going to be close
6245343 one of the phenomena of australian politics is that if you have an opportunity to claim underdog status you claim it even if the basis is a little bit flimsy
6245344 i think it is incumbent on governments to say well look we have to be very careful about what we do locate in those areas because down the track they may be subject to inundation and then the question is who will be liable for that
6245345 in future priorities should be given to what we call coastal dependent uses uses that need to be by the sea and those uses that dont need to be by the sea should seriously be thinking about having them set back
6245346 but you know what i reckon tasmanian lifestyle is about
6245347 the ees fails to consider that there are far cheaper economically and also with respect to carbon costs there are far cheaper alternatives than this desalination project to deliver the amount of water that this project intends to deliver it also fails to acknowledge or look at the cost of desalinated water
6245348 although the recent correlation in dollar and oil prices is clear it is important to emphasise that each of these assets are driven by multiple varying factors put differently there is more to oil than the u s dollar and vice versa
6245349 there are quite a few signs of demand warnings from asia it is a new development and it has not been factored in
6245350 cant see fit to give his brother even a hundred bucks a year
6245351 we know we can play better and be more of a unit so we will start that hopefully against andorra and then croatia
6245352 i asked to play against the czechs for this reason to know where the problems are
6245353 typically we see copycats shortly after a major campaign but this was sent by the same people
6245354 but remember it took about three days for the cnn spam to peak

6245357 esfuerzos estadounidenses por cambiar el equilibrio estrat gico en su favor
6245358 los misiles interceptores de largo alcance que van a ser desplegados en polonia no tienen y no van a tener en el futuro previsible ning n otro blanco que los misiles bal sticos intercontinentales de rusia
6245359 est claro para nosotros y los l deres de estados unidos no lo niegan que el sistema estadounidense de defensa antimisiles en europa ser ampliado y modernizado es ese caso rusia se ver forzada a reaccionar y no s lo por medios diplom ticos
6245360 today we are about to make an important step on the way of our development we are launching our brand
6245361 the team has already been created the strategy has been outlined and the procedures for considering and financing the projects have been arranged now the corporation has acquired its own corporate style
6245362 we are pleased to note that differ took part in the development of the russian nanotechnology initiative defining the concept of the rusnano brand we wanted to create a modern and innovative logo a visual identity that reflects the unique position of the corporation in the world of nanotechnologies we share the desire of the corporation to link rusnano brand with the leadership of russia in the world nanoindustry
6245363 the corporation represents russia at the international innovations market therefore we have set high requirements to the logo we must meet international standards in all aspects of our activity including our outer image the creation of the corporate image is over and now our task is to implement the brand we have a challenging task the promises of rusnano must become a reality i can say that the atmosphere in the corporation our approach to work our ability to conduct a dialogue with partners fully comply with the selected concept
6245364 i dont want to speculate on what treasury secretary paulson might do they have not offered anything and we have not asked for anything i dont anticipate that we will do that
6245365 i would observe that this treasury department has been all over the issue they have been thoughtful they have been constructive in their approach
6245366 if we can get through this rough patch and everybody is pulling on the same rope on the other side is a very strong future for housing
6245367 tira una bomba a mano al vicino di casa finanziere si sentiva spiato mentre scaricava musica da internet

6245374 with an eye on the clock the white house continues to drag its feet and do everything possible to postpone public access to the records of this presidency
6245375 a backup system isnt designed to be a 100 percent complete inventory of all e mails
6245376 its designed to make a copy of data at a specific point in time
6245377 data is backed up on a daily weekly and monthly basis as part of a disaster recovery strategy to ensure to protect the organization from data loss
6245378 generally when the scope of the work is expected to fluctuate by a factor of nearly ten i can only take you so seriously
6245379 contractors cannot accurately plan for or staff based on such an estimate
6245380 we will continue to work with members of congress and the national archives and will communicate the results of our accounting effort at an appropriate time
6245381 americans across our country are hurting because of the cost of energy
6245382 its time for america to get serious about energy independence and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this
6245383 everyone says america is the land of opportunity for renewables
6245384 the tax policy center a research group run by the brookings institution and the urban institute has done the most detailed analysis of the obama and mccain tax plans and it has published a series of fascinating tables
6245385 for the bottom 80 percent of the population those households making 118 000 or less mccains various tax cuts would mean a net savings of about 200 a year on average obamas proposals would bring 900 a year in savings
6245386 so for most people obama is the tax cutter in this campaign
6245387 mccain by continuing the basic thrust of bushs tax policies and adding a few new wrinkles would cut taxes for the top 0 1 percent of earners those making an average of 9 1 million by another 190 000 a year on top of the bush reductions
6245388 shooting hoops with the guys gave me a comfort level around them that ive never lost
6245389 ive always felt i deserved to be on the team and it also gave me the understanding that having another sister around makes a difference
6245390 in all professions you need to have someone demystify and demythologize the process
6245391 seminaries teach you about pastoral care but not how to do it you learn the theory and the theology of it but not the everyday walk of it we would talk about every sundays service after it was over break it down i learned how to raise money how to run a stewardship campaign
6245392 and we will be missing it if we dont do all we can to elect barack obama president
6245393 transformative candidacy that would advance progressive politics for the long term

6245395 his campaign has the clearest message of unity and progressive change
6245396 this election can begin to turn the tide it can help bring universal health care save the environment and start the restoration of our democratic rights
6245397 this group is for self proclaimed marxists communists socialists for the election of barack obama to the presidency we support barack obama because he knows what is best for the people
6245398 are socialists because we reject an international economic order sustained by private profit alienated labor race and gender discrimination environmental destruction and brutality and violence in defense of the status quo
6245399 obama is the choice for change and renewal he gives hope to millions of americans and europeans for a fairer world progressive europeans are united in hope that barack obama will be the new president following the u s elections

6245402 when a patient with a broken leg that is not healing properly comes to dr basset columbia presbyterian medical center in new york city ny he is likely to go home with two heavy pads connected by wires to a box that can plug into an electrical wall socket the patient puts one pad on each side of his broken bone and turns on the device coils of wire in the pad induce a pulsing electromagnetic field into his flesh and bone a field of energy that somehow commands the bone to heal itself
6245403 we live on a sun lit planet and most living things have acquired some means to use the light we live in a world filled with sounds and most living things have developed a means to sense vibrations since our planet is also a giant magnet it should not surprise us to discover that we and many other living things have a sensitivity to earth s magnetic force field
6245404 currently the fbi must have evidence or allegations of wrongdoing before opening an investigation of u s citizens or legal residents from other countries as described by some law enforcement officials the new policy would let agents open preliminary terrorism investigations after mining public records and intelligence to build a profile of traits that taken together were deemed suspicious
6245405 mukasey defends plan to use terror profiles to open investigations
6245406 escorted defendant to the middle of the street and told him to cross to the sidewalk defendant for the fourth time refused the verbal commands and thats why he was arrested
6245407 yankee go home whos leading the anti war movement congressional republicans
6245408 the press vs al gore how lazy reporting pack journalism and gop spin cost him the election
6245409 it starts with the premise that the data services and architecture should be on servers we call it cloud computing they should be in a cloud somewhere and that if you have the right kind of browser or the right kind of access it
6245410 were not celebrating our eighth wedding anniversary with bronze or pottery fie on ye traditionalists were going to vancouver instead
6245411 britain was a little tired after the unpleasantness of the late 1700s france was over the whole empire building phase and uh look can i get points for being able to recite all ten provinces and three territories how about being able to recite the sketch from kids in the hall
6245412 he took advantage that we scored a lot of runs but you pitch 5 innings and youre at 100 pitches were looking for better stuff
6245413 obviously he won the game and they only scored a couple runs but in the meanwhile when you go out there with the lead we dont want to use the bullpen more that what we used
6245414 i kind of caught myself relaxing a little too much
6245415 i tried to stay focused and keep on pitching the game that i usually pitch and try to stay in the game as long as possible sometimes you think whew ive got a little breathing room but you really dont want to make it close you still have to go out there and pitch because anything can happen in this game
6245416 we can match the 2007 wins with my kids on the field
6245417 that was not a good season the only thing i worry about is making sure we win as many games as we can no matter regardless of what happens or how we finish i feel proud of this ballclub they stick together we went through a tough time we went through a lot of injuries to key people and we are still fighting and still having fun
6245418 a j told me he was fine to catch this morning
6245419 we will pick a time to rest him later on right now im not going to say were not going to win with toby but a j was ready to go today and thats why hes there
6245420 i do my routine my style of play remains the same and paying close attention to the pitchers im facing and the coaches and thats basically the result but ive stayed the same through the stretch
6245421 if you look at the mechanics of his swing ive looked at it hes in the zone so long
6245422 obviously i dont know what exactly his height and weight are but he definitely has a lot of power he has a fundamentally sound swing and thats why you see him do well hes an aggressive hitter and he attacks the zone and i think hes just going to get better
6245423 you see guys on top of the plate like that and all of a sudden people think they can get by him his bat speed is one of the best ive seen in a little while and thats how he creates so much power
6245424 it really feels like a dream right now that i dont want to wake up from to be in the same lineup as a ken griffey jr and jim thome
6245425 in certain lineups griffey has been hitting behind me its an absolute honor to be in the same lineup with those guys
6245426 ivan volta para casa que a tua natasha quer fazer amor
6245427 it is with great pleasure that i accept this nomination funny word nomination it has a no in the front of it yet it is a positive word unlike notorious which is sometimes used negatively like when i was accused of plagerizing during my first run for the presidency so many years ago which reminds me of a funny story well i thought it was funny anyway but humor like looks is in the eye of the beholder or actually the ear of the the beholder but that doesnt make much sense either and theres another eye so now lets talk about
6245428 it seems a little like the dance we went through with zimbabwe at the commonwealth where eventually as the commonwealth stuck to its guns mr mugabe left rather than face his peers
6245429 one hopes that fiji sees the sense of sticking to the commitments it gave to leaders and i would think the message coming out of the forum should be that thats what it should be doing
6245430 its not just that the commodore is balking at the commitment he gave for march 09 there is no timetable for 09 10 11 12 or any other time i think people have run out of patience and theyll be looking to communicate that pretty clearly
6245431 the russians restored order there is no more looting in the area
6245432 i think for the moment its necessary to have the russian troops in gori until theyre replaced by the georgian police
6245433 because if there are neither police nor troops in gori there is no doubt that the city will be looted
6245434 the russian soldiers walked behind the ossetians who looted the city and did nothing to stop them
6245435 we ran out of all our food supplies and what is the use of humanitarian aid if its impossible to get it
6245436 why cant they organize a more civilized way to distribute it
6245437 we didnt go out to use the toilet or for food we were too scared we fear any loud sounds even a clap seems like a gun shot
6245438 how would you feel if a guest came to your house and then forced you out
6245439 it is the same with south ossetia it is ours our ancestors lived there centuries ago
6245440 we were promised by the russians that we would be taken back but so many years have passed since then and still nothing is happening we are not taking away any part of russia why are they doing this to us
6245441 we are all brothers we are all christians we have lived as neighbors for centuries
6245442 i have never had any problems either with the ossetians or the russians this is our governments war not the peoples this war could have been avoided
6245443 the overall number of the displaced was decreasing because of the people who return to join to volunteer militias of south ossetia
6245444 russia is keeping the peace it is the georgians who committed atrocities against ossetians
6245445 my husbands sister lives near a military airport not far from tbilisi she said the russians did bomb georgia but they specifically and exclusively targeted military objects and did not touch a single house
6245446 the way that the west tries to present russia in the conflict in southern ossetia has one major goal the talk is about changing the charter of the united nations where russia is one of five countries who have the veto right
6245447 theres no legal mechanism to deprive us of this right therefore everything is being done to discredit russia and to change the charter today the world is balanced by that charter
6245448 as for georgian actions in south ossetia theyre illegal especially when taking into account the carpet bombing of civilians which is prohibited
6245449 what russia is doing now in south ossetia is legally forcing georgia to peace
6245450 i think georgia is to blame for everything that has happened in south ossetia and i want this conflict to be over as soon as possible
6245451 it really is genocide carried out against a small nation by georgia russia was right to take its troops there as it was time to defend its own interests
6245452 any european country would behave the same way in such a situation
6245453 however russia has a special status certain parts of the world have for a long time hated us and are afraid of us therefore we had this reaction in the west to russias role in the
6245454 however the russian authorities simply didnt have any other choice in that situation inaction in this case would have meant revealing russias failure in peacekeeping if russia hadnt taken action in this situation it would have lost the respect of everyone russians ossetians abkhazians and georgians too
6245455 the irreversible secession of south ossetia and abkhazia from georgia
6245456 therefore i think this conflict is in the interest of the worlds major powers who are not interested in having russia as a strong economic and political rival
6245457 freely moves its troops across the globe as it pleases
6245458 two democracies at the very least states that are moving toward democracy that are clashing
6245459 countries that are involved in regional or internal conflicts cannot become members
6245460 social obligation in making sure everybody could participate in the next generation of broadband services because increasingly thats what people want
6245461 i am always looking for volunteers our volunteers work very hard and i wouldnt be in this job without them
6245462 i just want people to know the service is available because im really worried that potential clients just dont know we exist
6245463 we are really asking the whole town to help out and support the cause if anyone can go outside and pick up some rubbish off the streets this week it will help
6245464 these meetings are usually held at a function centre but i think forbes high was specifically chosen to host this time due to the access we have to technology
6245465 and also we are fast developing a reputation as being willing to become involved and take a leadership role in terms of training we are always one of the first to put our hands up to get in and have a go so it was a pretty big deal for us
6245466 the response from the local business houses has been phenomenal
6245467 quite often staff and proprietors participate in the activities and i know a number of businesses look forward to the children attending
6245468 the whole purpose is to encourage parents to read to their children from birth so we will be handing out a lot of books to children and in particular the parents guardians of younger children in the hope they will take them home and read to their children
6245469 what i would say to any of the candidates is go in with an open mind be prepared to read all your business papers and dont be afraid to ask questions because council staff are there to help you make your decision
6245470 i couldnt speak highly enough of the staff not once did they ever say no they couldnt help
6245471 one of my achievements i set out to do was to make council a very open council and i think ive done that
6245472 i think what is more important is what youve got in your heart and what you are willing to put into the job
6245473 it has been a learning curve at times but no one person knows everything
6245474 for me it was a combination of work and family
6245475 ive been a councillor for nine years and i needed to have a break
6245476 i loved it his time on council and it was a hard decision to make not to nominate again but i promised my family i would take a break
6245477 it gives you an insight into how local government works or sometimes doesnt work
6245478 who knows in the future i might have a go again
6245479 cuando era peque a a los cuatro a os los blancos me raptaron en la selva y fui vendida varias veces a familias propietarias de haciendas me enviaron a escuela y all puede aprender a leer y escribir

6245481 vamos a ayudar inmediatamente a nuestros compa eros de otras comunidades que est n experimentando una situaci n dif cil debido a la falta de agua potable comida y ropa
6245482 el informe nos reflej que existe una mayor cantidad de v ctimas en tiempos de dictadura y que son dram ticas porque no hay m todos de defensa lo que no sucede en democracia
6245483 estos pol ticos ahora tienen que ponerse las pilas para trabajar a favor del pueblo y demostrar que en la oposici n no s lo hay gente que quiere robar al pa s pero quien sabe si estos son s lo oportunistas que est n escapando del nido que un d a les dio cobijo nosotros estaremos atentos para fiscalizar sus actos
6245484 detr s de todo esto hay una estrategia orientada para tener ocupado al gobierno en una serie de demandas que le impiden llevar adelante su plan de reformas y sus pol ticas de gesti n
6245485 mientras se mantengan estas posiciones irreductibles por parte de la media luna y tambi n del gobierno se muestren inflexibles el clima de conflictividad en el pa s seguir en aumento
6245486 ahora el presidente tiene un aval para negociar y para pactar y la oposici n pol tica tiene que construir ese acuerdo pol tico
6245487 con estas medidas quien m s pierde es la ciudadan a y las regiones que a la larga termina generando fatiga dentro de la poblaci n pero por otro lado tambi n est n agotando la paciencia del gobierno
6245488 la pol tica del gobierno nacional continuar seguir redistribuyendo este recurso idh al pueblo boliviano y a sus instituciones eso es lo que piden los distintos sectores y regiones del pa s
6245489 en tema del idh el gobierno nunca ha cerrado el di logo pero busquemos un nuevo pacto fiscal que de esa lucha los sectores sociales se beneficien como todas las instituciones y regiones del pa s
6245490 there are reports of some movement out of gori and were going to have to see whether or not that is the beginning of a true withdrawal of if this is some sort of token effort designed for you and others to report on
6245491 well see i think its too early for us to determine whether or not this is really the russians committing to withdrawing their forces

6245493 weve had a lot of flooding in isolated neighbourhoods people with anywhere from 6 inches 15 cm to 4 feet 1 2 metres of water in their homes
6245494 weve had just under 1000 homes impacted by the flooding weve had to rescue people in boats and airboats
6245495 were getting beat on and beat on and beat on its still over us
6245496 this storm is turning into a serious catastrophic flooding event particularly in southern brevard county

6245498 opt out system to replace voluntary student unionism with students able to choose which services their fees were spent on and whether they wanted to belong to the student union fairfax reported
6245499 we have indicated we are not proposing to do something that is compulsory he said to abc radio today
6245500 but we are looking at ways to ensure that we can revive services on campuses non academic services that in many parts of australia have been seriously eroded by the changes the howard government has made
6245501 impacted negatively on the provision of amenities and services to university students
6245502 our policy is clear cut and stated before the election he said
6245503 so when you compound that with students who already have obstacles to a good education like african american students or special education students that really creates a double edged sword
6245504 you know they may think about doing something but when they think about corporal punishment that fear will make them say no i dont think im going to do that right now
6245505 it makes them more aggressive more delinquent and makes them have more mental health problems
6245506 we think public schools ought to have more elements of choice
6245507 in the current environment it is hard to find any specific triggers for these moves
6245508 i think were seeing consolidation but personally i think that theres scope for a rebound in the aussie dollar
6245509 the us dollar is consolidating after what we saw in the last couple of weeks which were fairly dramatic moves
6245510 we think this pullback is going to happen eventually in the short term however the overall sentiment remains us dollar positive
6245511 the comment says if you dont happen to look like nicole kidman come to the isa you can have a lot of fun and that says a lot of nice things about the isa and our outback towns
6245512 we have a terrible imbalance between male population and female population we have always had that problem and he has brought national attention to bear upon it
6245513 i am certain there will be an awful lot of girls going to mt isa
6245514 when we country people assert who we are and what we are then you find some way of twisting that around and out a malevolent interpretation upon it

6245518 cms goal for updating and enhancing the hospital compare web site is to provide usable and accurate information about hospital performance to providers and communities that will encourage hospitals to excel in the quality of care they provide
6245519 with these new enhancements consumers and health care providers will be able to look at individual hospital mortality scores we hope that this new information will cement the web sites role as a key driver in improving the quality and reliability of care in the nations hospitals
6245520 people in the general public look at mortality or survival rate as being a very key indicator
6245521 and pneumonia heart attack and heart failure are three areas in which we have national agreement in how to define measure and report outcomes
6245522 its great to know how you are doing you need to know how youre doing so you can do better
6245523 in the short run it will allow the hospital to look more carefully at their own data and improve things but for individual patients who want to choose their own care it can be more misleading than helpful
6245524 it is a good way to get the process going but it is not enough and not the right type of information
6245525 we are still in the early stages of this process
6245526 it is a bit hard to digest for the average consumer
6245527 we have been working with cms for five or six years to come up with measures that people could trust
6245528 but one thing that is true is that no one sees this measure as a means to select hospital when critically ill
6245529 we think that putting this information out and clearly communicating it to hospitals and their boards means that people have to look at their performance it is a tool to understand how you are doing
6245530 i do hope that it empowers groups of patients and community groups and hospital boards to engage in a conversation with their institution they really need to be held accountable

6245561 this isnt against us its part of a new global game
6245562 the aircraft carrier to syria is supposed to show that russia has allies and that it wants access to the mediterranean israel as a western state is merely one player in this global realignment russia is signalling in the strongest possible way that it is willing to activate its old soviet military alliances
6245563 today russias interest is to show the us and the west that it is a superpower again its back in the mediterranean its telling the west you need us in this region and you need us to deal with iran this is happening because it senses that the west is weak
6245564 as far as assad is concerned his new found russian friends could provide a deterrent against a future attack on syria
6245565 pakistan has done problematic things without any connection to arms sales to india such as the proliferation of nuclear know how to iran which has been going on for many years

6245569 overall these are a very satisfactory set of results in the face of declining earnings for our sydney and melbourne metropolitan newspapers in australia and tough trading conditions particularly in new zealand fairfax chief executive david kirk said
6245570 these results highlight the successful implementation of our strategy of diversification of revenue investment in digital earnings growth and constant focus on operational improvement to drive earnings per share growth he said
6245571 farmers organisations have been saying to us since we came into government how can we help stop fruit rotting on the vine
6245572 this is their practical proposal we have responded in a modest way with a pilot program over three years that is a practical piece of action farmers want it we have done it
6245573 kay hulls therefore i presume the national party the national farmers federation appear to be supporting the governments position yet we have mr nelson and mr robb rowing in exactly the reverse direction
6245574 i think it is time the liberal and national party the opposition sorted out whether they have got any policy on this at all

6245582 im very stressed out right now im worried about my kids and what theyre going to do
6245583 we got some good work done focused on third downs and worked with different personnel packages

6245601 if i know i didnt burn my house down i wouldnt be in a hurry to do this either
6245602 i decided to find a better way to react to frivolous lawsuits than just being reactive
6245603 if you think of the litigation cycle as a sandwich
6245604 then were the two pieces of bread and the medical malpractice attorney is the meat in the middle before a case ever gets started you first try to prevent it and then set up an infrastructure to enable viable countersuits down the road
6245605 theres no basis for suing someone for suing you if they have a legitimate complaint
6245606 if an attorney brings a suit without basis he can be sanctioned by the courts but that rarely happens
6245607 but now the fish have uzis were arming the fish
6245608 then north carolina is a pretty good place to be
6245609 medical justice is just another option for physicians trying to navigate a rough malpractice environment
6245610 its hard to tell from their website what they can do and cant do
6245611 in north carolina they cant do a countersuit against a plaintiff or a plaintiffs lawyer sometimes physicians after the case is over and theyve been sued will make a case against the expert but thats something thats relatively new within the last five years
6245612 rating a doctor is harder than rating a toaster or a car because patients comes in all flavors
6245613 the risk you run is getting doctors who try to game the system by choosing only patients who are healthy and easy to treat
6245614 if they figured that out they ought to patent it and can it and bottle it and sell it because it would be very valuable

6245629 i never thought pamba would actually make it this far in the competition but we are thrilled she has
6245630 she has an incurable disease contracted from proto theca a type of algae found in puddles grass and ponds which is extremely rare and is always fatal
6245631 but not only has she lived far longer than anyone dared hope she also puts up with horrible treatment while staying happy and cheerful she really is a joy
6245632 it really is awful dogs suffer terrible diarrhoea often blindness and eventually organ failure usually followed by death within a few months of diagnosis
6245633 but pamba is a fighter she has had this disease for two and half years but she is not blind and she is very much alive she is a heroine
6245634 its not important that pamba wins she is already a winner to me
6245635 we cant come to terms with what weve gone through
6245636 it feels unreal within a day my wife and i show up at the hospital our daughter is born and declared dead later we find out she is still alive and a few hours later we are told again that she is dead
6245637 i showed up at the intensive care unit and saw that she was dead my wife will suffer from this and well have to deal with it im sure shell need psychological help

6245657 luego escribieron en la prensa musical que mi pedido al p blico de hacer un signo de la paz fue grosero

6245686 social networking needs to get out from the houses and into the bars
6245687 because you have your phone with you when youre out it allows you to meet up with your online friends thats the real value
6245688 if you know you like absolut vodka and theres an absolut vodka party on youll go if your friends go
6245689 social networking is a reason to come back to a mobile site again and again
6245690 weve been massively surprised by the amount of usage and the number of times people come back
6245691 we offer myspace and video sharing site youtube on a capped package because theyre both quite data hungry
6245692 two of the most popular services are uploading photos directly from your phone into your myspace account and streaming music

6245728 the government has always had confidence that our plan to secure the states future energy needs represents the best result for the economy taxpayers and the environment
6245729 the owen report the unsworth review and the rural community impact statement have all endorsed the governments strategy
6245730 thats why we look forward to the release of the report and we hope it will provide a clear path forward and settle any outstanding concerns
6245731 its release will also set a test for barry ofarrell who has dithered and delayed and hinged his decision on the recommendations of the report hell have to finally declare his hand
6245732 apart from a few matters that we feel could be swiftly addressed we found no major issue with the sale lease arrangements proposed by the state governments advisers
6245733 while we consider our new designation a monumental accomplishment the ultimate benefits of this recognition and adherence to stringent standards will be to our students faculty and staff
6245734 our students will receive a high quality adult centered professional education setting up a lifetime of possibilities
6245735 we would like our students faculty and staff and minot state in general to accept and appreciate our place in north dakota get us engaged in helping our place survive and do well and thrive thats a term that when you first just say place is a little hard to understand but i think people are accepting that

6245741 workforce development has everything to do with recruiting and retaining workers and retraining workers
6245742 there has been lots of work that has happened here and that is the goal of today to hear about the progress that has been made
6245743 we thought it was appropriate to bring greg up so that he could help us understand what the state was doing and we could dovetail some of our efforts with those of the state
6245744 what do we have to do to make sure we retain the workers we do have and then second what can the community do to recruit workers to minot

6245776 a senior vet from taronga zoo examined the whale last night and while the whale is not distressed his condition has deteriorated as he hasnt fed in days
6245777 the plan today is to use an inflatable sling to try to get the whale further out to sea where he might hook up with another pod of whales
6245778 previously the whale was lured out to sea by following a yacht that it thought was its mother but then it turned around and came back in because i think it was still attached to the yacht
6245779 if we can get it into the sling we can get it further out to the ocean into deeper water and hopefully closer to another pod of whales

6245783 when youve got thousands of jobs being lost thats tough but its not unique
6245784 we live in a global economy we cant always stop people from moving but we sure as heck dont have to give them incentives to move we dont have to give them tax breaks to move we should give companies tax breaks that are investing right here in martinsville and right here in henry county
6245785 i think he got a good start a good start but i need to know more i need to hear more
6245786 the fact that youve got the same guy who wrote a book swift boating kerry running a book about me this is standard practice i mean i dont think anybodys surprised by it it doesnt matter who the democratic nominee was going to be theres an apparatus theres an infrastructure thats been developed to run negative attacks on democratic candidates
6245787 anche se le persone fossero diverse soltanto nei gusti questa sarebbe una ragione sufficiente per non cercare di uniformarle tutte allo stesso modello ma persone diverse richiedono anche condizioni diverse di sviluppo individuale e non possono vivere tutte in salute nello stesso clima morale piu di quanto tutte le piante non possono esistere salubremente nella stessa atmosfera e clima fisici gli stessi fattori che favoriscono lo sviluppo della natura piu elevata di una persona ostacolano quello di un altro se non esiste una corrispondente diversita nei loro modi di vivere non ottengono la felicita che spetta loro ne sviluppano la statura intellettuale morale ed estetica di cui la loro natura e capace

6245789 we expect to reach 500 million opensocial users by the end of the quarter its also very international as social networking is a global phenomenon
6245790 when we launched opensocial javascript was the center but the community wants more choice we agreed upon a restful api that gives access to the social bits and is already implemented in
6245791 hi5 launched with opensocial very early january 1 2008 and we ended up building the system which had a lot of undefined pieces
6245792 we had a lot of custom work with the rest endpoint so that applications could contact our server directly as time went by all participants came up with one offs but now we are bringing it all together in the community with common types of solutions for these problems standardizing on a single specification will allow application developers to write code once and it will work on all different containers we are already seeing others build on rest specification plaxo for example has enabled privacy enabled exchange of contact info
6245793 templates and markup are now in discussion on public mailing lists but we believe we are pretty close

6246121 in 1986 peter davies was on holiday in kenya on a hike he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air the elephant seemed distressed so peter approached it very carefully he got down on one knee inspected the elephants foot and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it as carefully and as gently as he could peter worked the wood out with his knife after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot the elephant turned to face the man and stared at him for several tense moments peter stood frozen thinking of nothing else but being trampled eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly turned and walked away peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day twenty years later peter was walking through the chicago zoo with his teenage son as they approached the elephant enclosure one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where peter and his son cameron were standing the large bull elephant stared at peter lifted its front foot off the ground then put it down the elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly all the while staring at the man remembering the encounter in 1986 peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant peter summoned up his courage climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure he walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder the elephant trumpeted again wrapped its trunk around one of peter legs and slammed him against the railing killing him instantly probably wasnt the same elephant this is for everyone who sends me those heart warming bullshit stories

6246245 mind you plants cant run away from bugs and other pests they need to deal with them one of the things they do is to release volatile substances into the air so as to attract predators of the bugs
6246246 genetic engineering modification gm of green leaf volatile production holds significant potential towards formulating environmentally friendly pest control strategies it also has important implications for manipulating food flavor
6246247 for example the aroma of virgin olive oil stems from the volatiles synthesized by olives by modifying the activity of enzymes that generate these substances it may be possible to alter the flavor of the resulting oils
6246248 our work shows how you can convert one enzyme to another and more importantly provides the needed information for modifying the glv production in plants
6246249 a notable strength of this manuscript is the combined use of structural and evolutionary biology to draw new insights regarding enzyme function these insights led to the striking demonstration that a single amino acid substitution converts one enzyme into another thereby showing how a single point mutation can contribute to the evolution of different biosynthetic pathways this begins to answer the long standing question as to how the same starting molecule can be converted into different products by enzymes that look strikingly similar

6246270 the heroes of this great artistic labor tend to be semimonastic intro verts who like woods beloved henry james and gustave flaubert toil with the doors shut and locked in soundproof splendid isolation attentive to the subtle frictions among nouns and adjectival phrases
6246271 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
6246272 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature
6246273 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
6246274 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
6246275 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
6246276 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
6246277 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
6246278 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent

6246281 the stresses in question are those that would be experienced in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane a terrorist attack or a sudden bereavement
6246282 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
6246283 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother
6246284 these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6246285 a developing fetus requires some exposure to maternal stress hormones as it normalizes their stress functioning
6246286 but women experiencing anxiety or excessive stress would do well to address it before a planned pregnancy and to have good social support systems

6246523 few americans have landlords who sometimes fail to cash their rent checks ignore unpaid rent or accept furniture in lieu of rent that sen coleman has just such a landlord who also happens to financially benefit from his relationship with the senator creates exactly the sort of appearance of impropriety that undermines the publics faith in government

6246542 in less than two weeks republicans from across the country along with the national news media will descend on
6246543 but this time he has nowhere to hide without thousands of the republican faithful and the national media descending upon
6246544 for this reason i am here to offer payment to the first minnesotan who can take a picture of norm coleman and president bush together at the republican national convention
6246545 now i would love to be able to pay a minnesotan for that photo but whether or not i get to i want minnesotans to know that we remember what they remember about norm coleman his support of george bush his loyalty to the republican party and his record in st paul i wouldnt be at the convention
6246546 coleman said convention attendance is a simple election year decision for many senators who are facing tough re election battles
6246547 is it a plus to stand with the president in my state am i going to get you know votes for that probably not but in the end good policy i hope and believe becomes good politics in other words ultimately folks get that yeah this is the right thing
6246548 the republican national convention is scheduled for sept 1 4 in minneapolis st paul but the onslaught of party faithful is likely to be more of a liability for coleman than anything else coleman frankly at this point is in a pretty strong position so i think the strategy for coleman is not to let the republican convention hurt him university of minnesota professor larry jacobs said coleman is positioning himself as a pragmatic independent
6246549 vice president dick cheney a conservative favorite but a divisive national figure will join president bush in addressing delegates on the opening night of the republican national convention the white house said friday
6246550 you dont ignore your party on the other hand part of what my whole record of public service has been about is bringing people together to get things done and thats what i sell and i think thats what folks are looking for in these times
6246551 in 1996 norm became increasingly frustrated with a democratic party that he felt was moving away from minnesotas hardworking middle class roots and values he joined the republican party which shared his vision on holding down taxes growing jobs reforming education and increasing public safety in his 1997 campaign for re election as a republican he received 59 percent of the vote
6246552 in 2003 while cq found sen coleman to have supported the president 98 of the time it also found him to be the eighth most likely republican to break from his party on party unity votes at 92 the 2006 survey placed him in exactly the same position eighth most independent republican
6246553 is it a plus to stand with the president in my state am i going to get you know votes for that probably not but in the end good policy i hope and believe becomes good politics in other words ultimately folks get that yeah this is the right thing
6246554 im looking for an ally i want somebody from this
6246555 believe me when i say we need fresh air in the united states senate the future of rests with norm coleman not only do i like to promote somebody who is a good honorable person im looking for an ally i want somebody from this great state with whom i can work somebody with whom we can work to help all the people
6246556 when we sing god bless it is a prayer and i believe this person is part of gods answer
6246557 im out there rallying the faithful in other states and im proud of that im thrilled to have that opportunity
6246558 to be very blunt and god watch over pauls soul i am a 99 percent improvement over paul wellstone just about on every issue
6246559 lets talk about the campaign ad i mentioned in which the senators wife brings up the point that a lot of people think that he is a rubber stamp for the bush administration if you look at the record definitely for the first four years he was i mean he really did vote with the president in the past two years he has clearly distanced himself
6246560 i want to make see the bush tax cuts made permanent
6246561 i want to see the bush tax cuts made permanent

6246574 we are very thankful to wheaton college president duane litfin and provost stan jones for welcoming us to campus they worked with us admirably to plan this visit and the presentations and discussions went smoothly and fairly
6246575 it is unacceptable for an institution of higher education with a reputation like wheatons to suggest that a student could not after study thought and prayer come to the conclusion that homosexuality is not a sin without risking expulsion

6246591 in the latest tests the tiguans performance is a standout
6246592 it sailed through the front and side crash tests without a single downgrade for structure or measures of injury likelihood recorded on the dummy this is 1 of 4 models in this group that afford superior crash protection in their class this is a huge change from just 5 years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side airbags and electronic stability control were rare
6246593 weve rarely seen a vehicle go in the wrong direction and get a worse rating after it has been redesigned

6246647 the media interpret caveats as expressing doubt there is a lot of denial about so people are looking for uncertainty so they dont have to change their lifestyles fair and balanced coverage doesnt spur people to action
6246648 i think its fair to say that the majority of people are unlikely to change their behaviour in the face of uncertain evidence
6246649 the greater the scientific uncertainty the greater your own belief faith needs to be to change
6246650 science has to be transparent to be trustworthy so accepting and reporting uncertainties is vital that leaves a tough job for policymakers who will need to take tough decisions in the face of considerable uncertainty are our policymakers sufficiently brave to do this its a good question however i find some comfort in the fact that i make a whole host of everyday decisions under conditions of considerable uncertainty even things like where best to cross the road
6246651 any strategy has to have both a mitigation and an adaptation side
6246652 we will need to think about handling the impact of climate change

6246659 quite frustrated about the soundbite nature of the public debate
6246660 the substantial element of hide and seek between a reporter looking for juicy quotes and a scientist trying to minimise damage to his reputation from oversimple public pronouncements or outright media distortion

6246663 the challenges for the region is no longer a matter for research or scientific theory and modelling
6246664 the evidence is quite clear that climate change is already wreaking havoc here
6246665 who could have believed that my own country which is so much higher above sea level than many countries in the pacific could be battered by a severe cyclone the way it was in 2004
6246666 we shouldnt wait until a worse human catastrophe occurs before acting and the international attention now focused on climate change presents an opportunity for the region to negotiate and secure tangible assistance for people already affected by climate change

6246669 they are responsible for the affairs of their own nations and i think they must not be unnecessarily preoccupied with forum matters
6246670 because of this the essence of delegation and priority setting requires another look by leaders to engage our ministers in decision making and only reserve those matters requiring high level political consideration for the attention of the leaders
6246671 it really saddens me to think what has happened to the schools
6246672 when i graduated in the seventies we were hot property with practices anxious to get hold of the best of the years crop because we had all the latest technology at our fingertips we were somewhat wet behind the ears in terms of professional practice but as far as technology was concerned we were definitely up to scratch
6246673 its amorphous its abstract architecture schools have gone down that same postmodern path of thinking that ideas on their own are more valuable than the realisation of them architecture cant be like that because the buildings have to be real
6246674 theres a huge gulf between ribas view of architectural education and that of the practising majority and riba seems to be blind to the crisis
6246675 all they need to do is provide students with a broad grounding in building technology and materials
6246676 the schools have said we dont have the people to do this
6246677 you dont need to be a practising architect to study and research the theory of design those characters are the people who populate architect schools now they havent got the skill set to teach technology they openly admit it
6246678 one of the best litmus tests of quality of architectural practice
6246679 the proposals for significant developments projects that we design review suggest that there is an issue with the quality of architectural training for instance cabe recently evaluated the 700 schemes that we have seen over the past two years and found that only a handful are driven by the sustainability imperative universities have a duty to ensure that training standards are constantly improving and moving with the times
6246680 the thing i hear all the time as a head of school is that we are not producing students that are ready to work in practice my response is that merchant bankers need them skilled workers too but they dont complain about their graduates there is stuff that you learn in university and there is stuff that you learn afterwards
6246681 if you are simply educating or skilling students to be immediately useful for practice it means that the status quo perpetuates itself
6246682 architectural practices are so varied that its now impossible to produce a graduate who can fit into any practice
6246683 i think the diversity of architectural practice has fundamentally changed the type of project youre working on the technologies the sustainability agenda the globalisation the different types of building its not as if youre aiming at one single target
6246684 they todays architects need to think back on their own education the one key thing for schools to teach is design that cant be taught in practice we have to keep our eye on the ball of the primary purpose of education
6246685 we pride ourselves on being very professional in the way we teach
6246686 the students certainly come out with a strong professional sense as well as a creative sense they have no problem getting jobs
6246687 we have been worried about students about debt we have been trying to find ways to reduce the time but its a long course because its complex and a very broad subject
6246688 a certain amount of this learning can be done in practice
6246689 at the time that the last mason in the construction of the acropolis was looking around for help he started complaining about the quality of graduates from the local architecture school
6246690 a lot of this is to do with practices wanting to get people into the office who have already got earning potential
6246691 the currency of information and the relevance of what graduates can do is constantly under review
6246692 the good graduate will have got the constructional technical understanding in their work that doesnt necessarily mean that they can go out and produce a detailed cross section of a really complicated building such as norman fosters gherkin in the first week after graduation
6246693 my personal view is that even though accredited schools of architecture address issues of sustainability many do not go into enough depth to really make a difference
6246694 there is demand from people who want to do it properly
6246695 in some cases they have delayed returning to education at part 2 because they werent happy to go back to what they felt was an unsatisfactory situation
6246696 we have assembled a fantastic group of people who have said they are willing to give up time to teach on the course as visiting tutors and lecturers because theyre so excited about what were trying to do
6246697 they want to teach people to be good designers but good with the practical and environmental issues at the same time
6246698 ultimately when you look at this whole situation its not just an issue of what is taught and needs to be learnt but about how that happens and where it happens where learning best takes place
6246699 constructionarium is one of the ways in which one can give individuals that practical hands on site experience the reality of being able to work with other disciplines is an important feature of the industry and its not as easily developed in a university setting
6246700 our students are generally recognised to have a good level of understanding of technology but understanding doesnt mean that its at the level that would allow them to hit the ground running
6246701 its a well known fact that there is a general lack of technology application in universities they know the theory but theyve never applied it
6246702 its an income generating scheme for them its a real shame because architects are just as important
6246703 i was very much interested as all my colleagues are and they have been very supportive of the initiative its just finding the money to do it and finding somebody to project manage the students
6246704 if one only has full time courses where people sit in college for three four or five years and are then thrown into industry that clearly wont work as well as a sandwich programme or where there is a part time element or opportunities for work experience during the course
6246705 we could probably get a lot of the basic technology and materials understanding into a student in six weeks its not all that difficult to do but it just needs to be done
6246706 the reason for this approach is not that i think there is something lacking in schools but rather that i think the education of future world class professionals is best achieved through a rich dialogue between the profession and academia
6246707 both have something to offer and that knowledge transfer is a positive driver for education
6246708 there is in my view a growing need for higher education to move out from the traditional ivory tower to create a dynamic relationship with the industry where there are no barriers to learning
6246709 the resilient walls of our ivory towers need to be perforated the most dynamic schools of the future will be without any walls at all
6246710 plenty has been spent on defence internal security and industrialisation but education has always lagged far behind its picking up now as people are realising that something has to be done about it and across the whole gulf theres a changing mood that education has to come first
6246711 lets say youve got a 21 year old national of the united arab emirates
6246712 he will have to compete with expat arab nationals or indian nationals who will probably work for less will be bi or trilingual and will have good qualifications the gulf states desperately need more of their young nationals to play an active role in the future of the economy if things continue as they are at the moment they will be left as bystanders on the sidelines of their own countries development
6246713 the population hasnt needed qualifications and hasnt needed jobs they could laze around and still be ok because the social security system is so generous there arent the incentives to pursue higher education you can walk into a shopping mall during the day when everyone should be at work or college and find legions of perfectly able bodied young gulf arab men drinking coffee and playing video games they dont need to study or go to university
6246714 these countries understand they have a serious economic and political problem in getting their citizens to be good employees and getting them into the labour force
6246715 at the same time theyve got the biggest challenge because these are rentier states where people have been paid to do nothing how do you shift from paying people for just being citizens to paying them for working this is the challenge they face and its not clear they are going to be able to do this it is a work in progress
6246716 you will typically get married at 18 or 19 probably to an uneducated man an army cadet for example if you go to university and get a degree youve bought yourself some time to mature and the sort of man youll be paired with will be a lot better thats the feeling
6246717 you cant have indigenous professors and lecturers when you barely have any degree holders so for years most of the academics in the gulf have been foreigners
6246718 the problem is that gulf nationals who do a degree in the west will rarely want to come back theyve pretty much escaped the system or view education as a low esteem profession compared with business and making money
6246719 at zayed university which is the largest in the uae there was not a single emirati member of faculty just a few years ago this was a university with a student body of about 10 000 and a good few hundred faculty similarly when i was working in dubai last summer we discovered there were only four male uae nationals working as schoolteachers in the emirate the profession has such low status that its very difficult to recruit young men
6246720 this has made qatar the educational hub of the gulf so any aspiring gulf national who wants a top class university education doesnt need to go to canada america or australia any more they can stay in the gulf and go to qatar
6246721 qatar has given huge salaries to the faculty it employs built lavish campuses and got big names such as georgetown texas a amp m virginia commonwealth and others
6246722 is vying to become a sort of higher education supermarket of the gulf where students can come from elsewhere in the gulf and surrounding region because they also want south asian and east african students you could describe it as educational tourism in the way that dubai has healthcare tourism where people come for a particular service and the economy benefits from student fees and so on
6246723 educational institutions in the gulf do not work in the same way as educational institutions in the west
6246724 there are more constraints both political and personal institutions are not as strong or as impersonal and typically student bodies are not as good
6246725 a lot of western academics have real trouble adjusting to that georgetown university in qatar is not georgetown university in washington dc cornell university in qatar is not cornell university in new york these institutions do take on aspects of local culture and the political environment and one needs to be aware of that they are global models but theyre local in their operations
6246726 it is not clear what the long term impact of this is going to be youve got a higher education system largely built on standards systems and faculty imported from the us and europe operating almost entirely in english and one wonders what the impact will be on the population in five or ten years time
6246727 a concern is the extent to which all this activity reflects domestic requirements how far can you run an education system that is dominated by external influences and what will that do for any home grown initiatives or ideas about education
6246728 the academic city is a designated free zone so we are operating as a uk university subject to our own regulations with qaa quality assurance and all the rest of it all the academic staff are hired by us and it is exactly the same degree course so students can start an undergraduate course in dubai and then move to scotland if they wish
6246729 by and large the foreign faculty come for three year contracts so theres never a core of people to improve the research trajectory of the institution
6246730 there is a research expectation but they have no means of assessing research output its great to work in a part of the world where the research assessment exercise doesnt count but there does need to be some way of measuring or requiring research output
6246731 you have people popping into work for just a couple of mornings a week so theyre not around on campus and students dont benefit from interaction with them
6246732 led by our pro vice chancellor for learning and teaching and they were really impressed by the quality of what was being offered and by the commitment shown by staff to quality of teaching indeed in many respects because the student staff ratios are often quite favourable it is actually a very good student experience
6246733 its great to have both those groups energetic newcomers and old timers who have experience but there do need to be active researchers in the middle too
6246734 you need those people who are at the peak of their game and at the moment the gulf just doesnt have that rising stars wouldnt touch it with a bargepole
6246735 you find that if you begin your career working at a university there you will never get promoted particularly far because your experience wont count for much because it is only in the gulf
6246736 another issue is accreditation the gulf universities are all desperately seeking western accreditation for their degree programmes but theyre struggling they dont have faculty governance they dont have student councils theres no atmosphere of democracy and most things are done behind closed doors every member of department is paid a different salary depending on the deal theyve cut with human resources the dean and the provost
6246737 a lecturer earning 36 000 in the uk will be offered a little more in the gulf with no income tax so take home pay will substantially increase
6246738 but its not just the salary that counts they will also be given free accommodation and free private tuition for up to four children and some of the private schools are very good
6246739 they will get a free villa for the tenure of their appointment and you tend to be given one more bedroom than your family needs free flights every year free private medical insurance its very attractive
6246740 when i worked at zayed university my apartment in abu dhabi where i lived alone had three bathrooms
6246741 there is not a great expectation of political freedom its not just in the gulf its throughout the middle east and north africa and egyptians who teach in the gulf often feel they have more freedom than they would at home
6246742 however western academics almost always find it difficult they find there are political and cultural differences that are hard to adjust to
6246743 institutions are so undemocratic the dean or provosts decisions are not open to discussion and theres a lot of unfairness
6246744 the students themselves are very pleasant and sweet to teach very innocent in some ways but you have to deal with a lot of problems
6246745 there are a lot of problems surrounding grade inflation as well students have very high expectations of their grades and you are working in a dictatorship so if you have royals in your class as will often be the case you cant easily fail them
6246746 students have a lot of power because they are nationals of the country and if they go en masse to the provost they can cause problems for a member of faculty
6246747 teaching politics as i did was the biggest minefield of all and there are certain subjects you just cant discuss
6246748 i managed to teach a class for two years called social and economic trends in the gulf which was really social economic and political trends in the gulf but i left political out of the title because the sheikh in question asked me to to get it ratified even with hard science you have to be careful with things such as theories of evolution and in art classes you have to be careful about nudity and the naked form theres still heavy censorship a team of guys with black marker pens going through magazines blocking things out and even classical paintings with nudity will be blacked out
6246749 britain hasnt missed the opportunity this has been a high risk strategy by us universities with the potential to backfire and harm reputations
6246750 the big question mark for british universities is whether the course that will be taught in the gulf will be to the same high standards
6246751 in some cases universities have lost a lot of face the university of connecticut tried to open a branch in dubai last year and the whole thing collapsed due to pressures back in the us about being involved in a country that doesnt acknowledge israels existence britain has been a lot more cautious and avoided any controversy so far but i think in the next couple of years as things start to mature there will be a few more opportunities for big names to get involved in abu dhabi and dubai in particular
6246752 the buzzword at the moment is sustainability especially in the countries that have run out of oil and this education village idea is one of many new non oil sectors that are ways of bringing in money
6246753 abu dhabi and kuwait have years of oil left but theres also the question of prestige abu dhabi cant handle qatar leading the way on this and wants the prestige of having universities
6246754 when i worked in abu dhabi it was amazing how many presidents and heads of state i met every week there would be some visiting dignitary and even if they were there for just one day one of the stops would be to the university there would be a knock on the door and oh its the president of india or oh its gerhard schroder or even on one occasion robert redford im not sure what he was doing there but it was seen as a high status place to show these people
6246755 noyes has threatened to kill me and my family and will not rest until we are dead all the evidence you need is in his computer and that little girls mind please save her
6246756 extreme punishments such as locking her in a closet with no food for three days
6246757 the captain came on and said the water line or water system had been stuffed up and they had to turn around and come back
6246758 there are a lot of people waiting around at the counter trying to get onto another flight
6246759 im confident that australia will find a solution to challenges but im less confident about the global industry
6246760 australias national aviation policy review is a golden opportunity for australia to take a leadership role and drive change in security environment and liberalisation
6246761 nobody can predict where the price will go but even a us 1 increase adds us 1 6 billion to industry costs few expect it to go below us 100 anytime soon and efficiency gains are a long way from filling the gap
6246762 we are in a perfect storm of uncontrollable fuel costs and falling demand in recent months at least 25 airlines have gone bust and airlines could lose as much as us 6 1 billion this year fundamental changes are critical
6246763 not enough to get any investor too excited but in the airline industry even this was a reason to celebrate
6246764 the global system remains a us 5 9 billion uncoordinated mess because governments are not thinking or acting globally decisions driven by fear cannot build a more secure global air transport system governments must take a risk based approach to security and harmonise with global standards
6246765 that means challenging europe on its unilateral ets what right does europe have to charge an australian plane flying from asia to europe for emissions over afghanistan
6246766 auctioning permits would set a very bad precedent it raises several questions with a focus on economic measures where are the operational efficiencies and why punish the good carbon intense industries with less impressive records of improvement are being given breaks that airlines are not
6246767 the impact the competitiveness of australian tourism must also be taken into account anything that makes an australian vacation disproportionately expensive is an incentive for tourists to go elsewhere to maintain a level playing field we need to keep focused on global solutions
6246768 in this time of crisis the bilateral system with its restrictions on ownership must change its time to move from the world of flags and politics to brands and business who cares who owns an airline as long as it is safe and provides efficient service
6246769 i believe that we can work through the bilateral system to allow airlines to do business like any other business with governments ensuring a level playing field governments must also effectively regulate safety security monopoly suppliers and environmental standards
6246770 thirty two million people and us 3 5 trillion in business depend on an air transport industry that is safe secure environmentally responsible and financially sustainable in this perfect storm of rising costs and falling demand growth the courage to change will be the key to survival and to fulfilling this important responsibility

6246776 consumption of alcohol excessive consumption of alcohol and consumption of alcohol by underage students is a problem or underage people and we need to get the conversation on the table to get a debate on that
6246777 underage and binge drinking is a tough problem and we welcome an honest discussion about how to address that challenge but this discussion must honor the science behind the 21 law which unequivocally shows that the 21 law has reduced drunk driving and underage and binge drinking
6246778 i agree with it i think kids are drinking anyways
6246779 i think a lot of kids agree with that they dont want to wait and are going to do it anyway
6246780 i think its wrong because they have enough pressures without having that
6246781 i know the fear of getting a drinking ticket is definitely here as a freshman and if its not here any more everyones going to do it and go crazy
6246782 i think they should keep the age where it is when youre in college you need to focus on your studies and not be drinking
6246783 i think people are going to drink regardless so i guess it would be just easier and possibly reduce the binge drinking
6246784 the legislature needs to re look at the fact youre sending your children over 18 to fight in a war and they cant get a beer

6246800 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers
6246801 while i am pleased to make todays undertaking our medium and long term funding and our retail deposit base represent the greatest proportion of our funding costs and the average cost of these sources of funding continue to increase
6246802 the recent fall in short term funding costs provides an opportunity to undertake to move rates in line with the rba decision but future interest rate decisions will need to reflect an assessment of all the cost of funding factors
6246803 all australian banks are reliant on offshore funding and increases in the average cost of long term funding are likely to be with us for some time

6246817 the committee for the liberation of iraq was the brainchild of the bush administration
6246818 it is said that once the saddam regime has been overthrown the cli will act as a shadow government for baghdad
6246819 but it will limit itself to policy matters and will not deal with details it will eventually press for a competitive petroleum production sharing regime which could make opec irrelevant to iraqs oil output or supply decisions
6246820 sessions with opinion makers contacts for journalists and mass marketing when the time is ripe

6246822 with nato now set to enlarge from 19 members to take on seven east european nations including the three baltic states it is said that both the bush team and the committee for the liberation of iraq want the political mechanism of the atlantic alliance to replace the un security council in giving multilateral legitimacy to any major u s action outside north america
6246823 this is because unlike the un security council where the french or russians might block american action natos political decisions do not require consensus only natos military decisions require consensus
6246824 considering the nations including the baltic states signed on the group at the expense of creating a schism in the european union the scheunemann initiative was unanimously regarded as a diplomatic triumph for washington and a coup detat in brussels

6246826 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
6246827 thats right i actually spent three years at university getting a degree in pe
6246828 i have been stonewalled even in my repeated request for something as simple as an index of olc opinions
6246829 on june 16 2003 i sent then attorney general john ashcroft a letter requesting an index of all memoranda and opinions rendered by the olc since january 2001
6246830 i reiterated that request on may 12 2004 and again directly to attorney general mukasey at an oversight hearing this july
6246831 we have never received this information nor were we ever provided with an explanation as to why the information was withheld examining the role of this justice department office in authorizing controversial activities is squarely within the oversight responsibilities of this committee in carrying out that responsibility we are entitled at the very least to know the subjects on which olc has provided final legal advice that after more than five years this committee has been refused even this simple request is unacceptable
6246832 unable to understand how statutes within this committees jurisdiction are being interpreted
6246833 to validate the statute an individual must have the specific intent to inflict severe pain or suffering
6246834 because specific intent is an element of the offense the absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture
6246835 such as death organ failure or serious impairment of body functions
6246836 if a government defendant were to harm an enemy combatant during an interrogation in a manner that might arguably violate a criminal prohibition he would be doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the united states by the al qaeda terrorist network
6246837 in that case we believe that he could argue that the executive branchs constitutional authority to protect the nation from attack justified his actions
6246838 among other issues we are examining whether the legal advice contained in those memoranda was consistent with the professional standards that apply to department of justice attorneys
6246839 the cia was seeking to determine the legal limits of interrogation practices for use in cases like that of abu zubaydah the qaeda lieutenant who was captured in march 2002
6246840 comprehensive index of all legal memoranda letters or opinions that were issued by the olc between september 11 2001 and the present to provide legal advice to the white house or any department or agency of the executive branch including the department of justice and its components
6246841 to give anything less than your best is to sacrifice the gift
6246842 because he could not get to the leaders of the liberal movement he would then target those that had voted them into office

6246844 prematurity was associated with increased death rates around the time of birth and continuing into infancy and childhood

6246891 many of the pennsylvania delegates worked their heart out for sen clinton and theyre excited to cast a vote for her from my vantage point that will be closure for them
6246892 the government has taken tremendous liberties with our liberty taking away our liberty in the name of fighting terrorism using fear to take away peoples rights and their privacy in this country
6246893 and thats caused me and a lot of americans to lose a great deal of faith in the government which ought to be protecting our liberties not taking them away
6246894 they simply dont want the competition from an outsider so to speak somebody that might make them feel uncomfortable by raising some issues some new perspectives some new choices for the american people
6246895 youll get to see hillary speak on tuesday and barack obama the next president of the united states on thursday
6246896 and i hear hillary and you will have a chat ill make sure to stop by
6246897 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6246898 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6246899 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6246900 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6246901 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6246902 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6246903 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6246904 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6246905 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6246906 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6246907 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6246908 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6246909 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6246910 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6246911 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6246912 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6246913 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6246914 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6246915 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
6246916 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
6246917 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
6246918 hey this makes sense its charles krauthammer and hes talking on this subject this will convince you
6246919 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6246920 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6246921 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes

6246923 ibland blir inte allt som man har t nkt sig
6246924 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6246925 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6246926 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6246927 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6246928 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
6246929 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6246930 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6246931 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6246932 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6246933 after the crimes they know they have committed and that many of us know they have committed because we have seen the evidence some of which has even appeared on the corporate whore news media of late
6246934 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6246935 das ist ein bekannter iphone bug der im n chsten software update im september behoben wird

6246937 the liver is the major fat burning organ in the body and regulates fat metabolism by a complicated set of biochemical pathways the liver can also pump excessive fat out of the body through the bile into the small intestines if the diet is high in fiber this unwanted fat will be carried out of the body via the bowel actions thus the liver is a remarkable machine for keeping weight under control being both a fat burning organ and a fat pumping organ
6246938 everything is low and slow if a person has a tendency for motion sickness it may not be the ride for them its more like a boat on the ocean
6246939 youre not dealing with the death and dying and the grief
6246940 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6246941 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6246942 democrats on the ground and their operators from the democratic national committee and the state organization and the gore campaign deliberately and systematically scrutinized for challenge every military absentee ballot and knocked out as many as they could on whatever technicality they could find or even invent
6246943 the iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not insurgents or terrorists or the enemy they are the revolution the minutemen and their numbers will grow and they will win
6246944 osama bin laden and these non nation state fighters with religious purpose are very similar to those kinds of atypical revolutionaries that helped to cast off the british crown
6246945 in this byelection you can tell harper how you really feel
6246946 se qualcosa pu essere pensato allora pu essere raccontato in un film
6246947 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
6246948 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
6246949 nixon was bad enough without fictionalizing him and demonizing him
6246950 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
6246951 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
6246952 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6246953 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6246954 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6246955 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6246956 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6246957 they told me there are going to be resources here
6246958 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6246959 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6246960 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6246961 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6246962 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6246963 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6246964 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6246965 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6246966 cooking with biofuels such as wood dung and crop residue
6246967 open biomass burning associated with deforestation and crop residue burning
6246968 soot and other forms of black carbon could have as much as 60 percent of the current our italics global warming effect of carbon dioxide
6246969 black carbon particles only remain airborne for weeks at most compared to carbon dioxide which remains in the atmosphere for more than a century
6246970 over 400 000 annual fatalities among women and children are attributed to smoke inhalation during indoor cooking
6246971 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
6246972 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
6246973 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
6246974 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
6246975 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
6246976 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
6246977 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply
6246978 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
6246979 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
6246980 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
6246981 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6246982 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6246983 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6246984 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
6246985 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
6246986 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
6246987 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
6246988 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
6246989 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6246990 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6246991 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6246992 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6246993 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6246994 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
6246995 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
6246996 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
6246997 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
6246998 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6246999 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6247000 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6247001 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6247002 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6247003 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6247004 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6247005 democrats would need 60 votes to get a budget passed with the drilling moratorium attached
6247006 its often very difficult with residences such as this to have a definitive list of people who were in the building and afterwards to determine precisely their whereabouts
6247007 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6247008 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6247009 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6247010 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6247011 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6247012 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6247013 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6247014 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6247015 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6247016 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6247017 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6247018 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6247019 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6247020 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6247021 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6247022 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6247023 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6247024 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6247025 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6247026 lei con questo caso non sa che p ne rischia
6247027 oh god i guess we should start by saying that this is really a coastal suburb of that small city chichester or chi as it is referred to by the local scuffers
6247028 gresford a small village a part of wrexham gresford is home town to all types of chav old young poor rich all united in a hatred against those who oppose them and their chav tastic ways
6247029 the presentations have typically generated some open discussion about how we can reduce the amount of carbon emissions
6247030 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6247031 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6247032 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6247033 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6247034 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6247035 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6247036 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6247037 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6247038 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6247039 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6247040 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6247041 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6247042 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6247043 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6247044 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6247045 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6247046 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6247047 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6247048 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6247049 nicht nur ist das kein union es nicht nicht einmal pilsener es geht bergab mit der welt

6247051 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6247052 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6247053 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6247054 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
6247055 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
6247056 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
6247057 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
6247058 she was a stray but she worked her way up
6247059 well just be sending each other e mails at two in the morning instead of two in the afternoon
6247060 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6247061 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6247062 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6247063 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6247064 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6247065 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal

6247067 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
6247068 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
6247069 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
6247070 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6247071 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6247072 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6247073 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6247074 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night

6247088 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
6247089 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
6247090 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
6247091 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
6247092 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
6247093 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director
6247094 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again

6247096 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be

6247119 as consumers look to stay connected and entertained regardless of where they are and what device they are using the web continues to affect our lives in new ways and is quickly moving to the tv thanks to a new generation of internet connected ce devices

6247122 the big cache and six cores will give customers a nice bump in performance
6247123 it looks like at least from the benchmarks were seeing that six core chips offer more performance than quad cores so yes customers are going to want them what we dont know is how much power the chips consume and how much heat they will dissipate and those are key concerns but all in all this is a pretty big advance in the state of the art and all the major vendors are on board
6247124 these chips outperform anything amd has and probably win on price performance too this could cut amds share of the server market considerably
6247125 intel doesnt have to crank up chip performance right now to thwart amd
6247126 their current products handily outperform amd on server products from my own research i can tell you that x86 server customers have moved away from amd and towards intel so intel didnt need to release this stuff now to catch up to amd or to top them but theyre doing it anyway just to keep the pressure up on amd and on themselves
6247127 if software cant take advantage of it what does it buy you
6247128 you still have software partitioning issues and when you put more cores on a chip you have to run it slower or increase the power consumption budget or thermal limitations
6247129 what are the odds that any trail not available on maps available on the websites of your local park and open space organizations or sold at your local bike shops that you discover through the methods explained in your article will be legal and open to the public the discovery and use of more of such illegal trails is the last thing we need

6247136 we have a once in a generation chance to bring meaningful and lasting change to our country by electing barack obama president and sending a stronger democratic majority to the senate
6247137 we need a stronger majority in the senate to enact obamas broad sweeping agenda and our outstanding group of candidates is ready to deliver it
6247138 they wont grant a stay if we dont have a good chance of prevailing
6247139 he souter has to get there in order to give us a stay hes not going to place hoffman on the ballot lightly if he does it will be because the dynamics are strong

6247149 egs could be the killer app of the energy world it has the potential to deliver vast quantities of power 24 7 and be captured nearly anywhere on the planet and it would be a perfect complement to intermittent sources like solar and wind
6247150 innovation is the path to massive quantities of cleaner cheaper energy the people were funding today have a real shot at lowering the cost of egs and bringing us closer to our goal of renewable energy cheaper than coal
6247151 egs is critical to the clean electricity revolution we need to solve the climate crisis but egs hasnt received the attention it merits thats why were pressing for expanded support from government and increased investment from the private sector

6247164 i believe that bin laden has been able to get into the good graces of omar who is very poorly educated and unsure of foreign affairs and to influence him in his way of thinking
6247165 the potential ramifications of a mullah omar who is drifting toward pan islamism are grim first and foremost it could mean that the taliban would under no condition expel bin laden because they see his cause as theirs
6247166 time for a diplomatic solution may be running out taliban brush off of our indictment and other evidence may indicate movement from tolerance
6247167 when a lady asked me a while back if i minded her putting my name into consideration for the new high school i had to laugh
6247168 i thought you had to be dead to have a school named after you and i told the lady it would be hard for me to die right away

6247171 our districts growth shows no signs of slowing causing us to devote considerable time to proactive planning in both academics and instruction
6247172 the district and county courts were the same way at first because it took a while for people to start using the e file system
6247173 my judge is one of those that likes to be on the cutting edge
6247174 the e filing really helps those attorneys who do them in mass bulk
6247175 it is not the most efficient way if you are a landlord with two rental homes but this is for bigger filings or those who file many a year

6247192 were going to be on the street all during the convention helping people to find their way around and have a positive impression of denver
6247193 the citys never looked so good its just exciting theres just a buzz everywhere were ready
6247194 all the businesses downtown are anticipating increased business and traffic coming into town and wanting to put on a great show for denver

6247198 sometimes its very obvious what the cause was but other times when its not that clear you need to bring somebody in to assist you sometimes insurance will send fire cause investigators but other times youre kind of on your own in this case we got one from the city of austin to come out and investigate
6247199 he took out all these large bills and placed them on the bed and said dont touch i was instructed to take my clothes off everything no foreplay so i got on the bed and he just stood at the edge of the mattress and stared he told me that all the money was going to be mine by the end of the night they were all hundreds maybe 50 of them once i got naked he got on the bed and unzipped his pants and told me to start playing with myself i kind of just laid there and faked an orgasm he started jerking off and he shot all over the money
6247200 so then he grabs all of it in a bundle and throws it at me
6247201 you know it was degrading for sure but so was cold calling
6247202 because the cost is suffered by the benchmark index itself it will remain hidden from index investors who simply focus on the explicit fees of index funds and their performance relative to the index yet it represents an unambiguous drag on returns and it can be avoided with simple index neutral strategies which have otherwise similar risk and return characteristics
6247203 we cannot win passing economic prosperity at the cost of the environment
6247204 but an outstanding example is the resolutions with morgan stanley dean witter citigroup and merrill lynch concerning their involvement in financing the construction of the three gorges dam
6247205 i favor the pristine and classic all u s stock market and all bond market approach
6247206 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged
6247207 the three factor model is as fama and french have repeatedly emphasized only a model it is not reality
6247208 i never attempt to make money on the stock market i buy on the assumption that they could close the market the next day and not reopen it for five years

6247219 i expect barack obama to win washington state and i expect to be his partner as governor to bring the kind of results weve achieved in washington state all across america
6247220 we have so many obama supporters that are our supporters one of my bigger fundraisers is an obama supporter
6247221 were going to have tens of thousands of people who are voting for obama who will vote for us
6247222 the effort around the state has been magnificent there have been people whove set up lemonade stands at little league games supporting lummis for congress

6247232 i would have each team give me one guy they can play for a week without 25 guys on the roster
6247233 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6247234 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6247235 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6247236 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6247237 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board

6247244 theres a big negative feedback loop and theres no way out of it
6247245 as the stock falls more and more its more likely the government steps in and more likely equity holders get wiped out
6247246 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6247247 they cant keep playing games with the accounting rules to avoid taking their losses

6247253 barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6247254 positive bio spots that theyve been running the balance of the summer dont appear to be making any significant connection with undecided voters
6247255 when the senate investigated the senator in charge never even called reed to testify and that senator john mccain
6247256 and whos now raising money for mccains campaign ralph reed
6247257 because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6247258 you come here and you see a lot of drugs going on drug sales people smoking dope
6247259 its only going to change if people make it change
6247260 i wouldnt come in here after dark there is no possible way
6247261 i mean i went over there to use the bathroom and i come out and a guy says hey can i use your lighter and he was smoking a crack pipe
6247262 ive come through here i used to drink here and get drunk and pass out and i dont want to see that anymore
6247263 i can see their efforts but its kind of like theyre in a fight holding back the ocean these people are still around here i know how dangerous and desperate some of them are and being here having my lunch i have eyes in the back of my head right now
6247264 are we just putting lipstick on a pig is your question and this is different from the past its a real challenge and its a real challenge for people who live in the neighborhood to use the park thats the only solution
6247265 seems like a pretty major omission for a service thats specifically aimed at roaming users
6247266 mobileme is suppose to be microsoft exchange for the rest of us but microsoft exchange does things in a secure manner
6247267 as it is if you run a business using your mac then you cannot use mobileme because it transmits data insecurely
6247268 i wouldnt say that its a critical issue or something thats a reason not to use the service but its definitely something that should be addressed
6247269 tv is a great thing the way it is we dont want to replace tv we want to augment and add value to the tv experience
6247270 we want to marry the best approaches from the tv world with the best approaches of the internet world
6247271 wow the tone and placement of that one drum hit was perfect
6247272 wed joke about how were not sure if a lot of our fans have jobs because theyre always here
6247273 its 8 in the morning on weekdays and theyre here 5 in the afternoon theyre still here its pretty cool its been nice to have that kind of support
6247274 the fans have come out and supported us for years and now it obviously wont be as easy unless they want to hike over there but the good thing is were not that far away
6247275 i think its big because the jets roots are from long island
6247276 theyve been here since the days of joe namath the fan base really is long island its going to be a little weird a little strange
6247277 being from new jersey itll be about half the commute but ill miss it out here
6247278 its going to be better for the team though with a state of the art facility florham park will be a setting like this though quiet and clean
6247279 over the time ive been here whether it was this time or the last time i was here its always great to have the energy from the fans
6247280 it gets a little bit long during training camp at times and there are some days where the coffee is just not getting it done having them there and having the kids here having the passion here its always great
6247281 when i first got here in 2000 i really didnt know what to expect but there was always a good crowd out there
6247282 we wont be in their backyard anymore but these fans are true fans theyll follow us wherever we go
6247283 it is sad and i cant not feel sad about it but the team is getting a new facility and a new stadium and its going to be a good thing
6247284 when i first started coming here there was no fencing around the fields so you could put a blanket out and sit there and watch but its become so popular over the years
6247285 it used to be a few hundred people here and there theyll be missed out here
6247286 new jersey doesnt have teams other than the devils so the jets and giants are new york new jersey teams anyway
6247287 if the jets win the super bowl the ticker tape parade will be down broadway anyway
6247288 so it looks like hilton sounds like hilton but really isnt
6247289 yeah actually now im familiar with the concept but just didnt know the term
6247290 in the print media world in tv you cant say come to mcdonalds and give and address and then when you show up at the address it is burger king
6247291 to take either money from you or expose you to spyware or viruses
6247292 there was over 9 billion spent last year alone on search engine ads
6247293 if they see that consumers are smartening up and they are not clicking on these ads then they are generating a lot less money and hopefully will go away
6247294 what this is if you will is a campaign that were running
6247295 my overall impression is that sun has seized upon a legitimate market opportunity here stemming from the usual fud surrounding the rationalization and integration of two such daunting product portfolios oracle and bea and more uniquely the purported price increase oracle announced for weblogic in july
6247296 sun is hoping to make some inroads with existing and potential weblogic customers that may find oracles road map and pricing structure too daunting
6247297 our goal is to provide a forum for focused collaboration to solve interesting and difficult performance problems tuneup gives developers deep visibility and relevant information to debug and improve the performance of their application and a community setting to collaborate with others to solve tough problems
6247298 these instances get attention because they cut against the grain the trend is overwhelmingly in the other direction
6247299 its very possible for a well meaning manager to shove the employee out of the corporate jet without a parachute
6247300 can they get through a days work without leaving their desk
6247301 really its about pushing that information out to end users
6247302 bringing the end user into the whole problem of master data management
6247303 that strategy execution loop is of no value if you dont trust the data thats feeding you
6247304 do you have data integrity around that to be able to make business changes based on those risk thresholds that you set
6247305 so you dont have to do it over and over
6247306 how long did it take you to think up that question
6247307 i will nominate a person to be vice president my running mate who shares my principles my values and my priorities and thats what i can tell you
6247308 theres already been things out there in the media hes already made up his mind hes going to announce on such and such a day
6247309 i have not made the decision and were in the process and if i say anything more than that i guarantee you theres going to be another one of these firestorms obviously were going to be announcing soon because we have no choice but ive got to tell you its one of the toughest things ive ever done
6247310 yesterday sen obama got a little testy on this issue he said im questioning his patriotism
6247311 let me be very clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6247312 one of the least experienced candidates for president in the last 100 years
6247313 he wants to continue the same economic policies that george bush has been doing for the last eight years
6247314 so my job in this election is to say i honor his service but i dont honor his policies and i dont honor his politics
6247315 engaging in lawful profession trade or business of any kind
6247316 historically the view from many courts for many years was that those non solicitation agreements were okay because they didnt prevent someone from participating in a trade or occupation
6247317 this is the first time california has said thats wrong
6247318 most other states allow non compete and non solicitation agreements as long as theyre reasonable
6247319 the movie doesnt look or sound like most s f tours of alternative futures its got a unique well i was about to say charm but the movies last scene doesnt quite let me get away with that
6247320 i gotta get back in the dirt so i feel clean
6247321 the politicians had finally solved the problem of urban blight

6247323 a man well hell walk right into hell with both eyes open but even the devil cant fool a dog
6247324 muir weaves commentary thoughtful analyses and humor into a true art form
6247325 muirs genius lies in his giving context to the films
6247326 as a critic muir is acute in his analysis and as a writer he is easy to read
6247327 well grounded in the love and minutiae of sci fi and fantasy adventure
6247328 john kenneth muirs books for mcfarland are distinctive because of their authority and effective research
6247329 he really scrapes beneath the surface of the film and looks for the subtext every nuance is analysed
6247330 an independent film scholar muir explains film studies concepts in a language that is reader friendly and engaging
6247331 john kenneth muir must have had one mis spent youth
6247332 i have read quite a bit of horror film criticism and analysis in my day and john muir is one of the very best if not the best i have ever encountered
6247333 a good 18 steps above the usual dubious faux scholar blogger he takes enormous time and effort analysing unmercifully yet attuned to heretofore dismissed value every release he turns his attention to
6247334 but when the senate investigated the senator in charge never even called reed to testify and that senator john mccain and whos now raising money for mccains campaign ralph reed for 26 years in washington john mccains played the same old games we just cant afford more of the same
6247335 59 of respondents had no intention to buy and another 26 had no interest that left 2 5 who intend to buy and another 13 who may think about it
6247336 all i really need to know i learned in kindergarten

6247373 im just going to tell you from the conservative perspective we are literally imploring you to not turn your back on your great pro life record over decades
6247374 i have not made the decision and were in the process and if i say anything more than that i guarantee you theres going to be another one of these firestorms
6247375 i have a pro life record that i have pro life policies and my administration will have pro life policies
6247376 are you going to pick a vice president that conservatives can actually rally around in the future or are you going to give us someone who will cause us to want to stay home
6247377 i will nominate a person to be vice president my running mate who shares my principles my values and my priorities and thats the best that i can tell you
6247378 let me just begin by saying that to save you some time im not going to comment on the vice president
6247379 it would seem to me that the republican party is not as far as i can tell and i traveled to thousands of places last year not a one issue party
6247380 i know john mccain his seriousness his love of country hell select the person who is best and if that person happens to be among other things pro choice the party will support that
6247381 we could do a call all day on senator mccains vp choices
6247382 this could be one of the biggest breaks for the early clinical application of embryonic stem cells
6247383 there is still work to be done but we could certainly be studying these cells clinically within the next year or two
6247384 the fuselage is destroyed the plane burned i have seen a kilometer of charred land and few whole pieces of the fuselage it is all destruction
6247385 we want to be on location there are many questions
6247386 we are trying to bring the agreement to a close it is not done yet
6247387 we have given ours the other side has given theirs
6247388 i wanted to prove to my dad that i could play in the nhl
6247389 i think he would do for foreign policy experience a long and distinguished senate resume and he is one of the most effective surrogates that senator obama has right now who can go toe to toe with any republican on any issue at any time
6247390 not something that lends itself to on the job training
6247391 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
6247392 i made it clear to him and everybody else i never worked for anybody in my life
6247393 i got here when i was 29 i never had a boss i dont know how id handle it
6247394 i often thought that if i could have given up and done something else i would have done
6247395 retrospectively i can see that i was learning all the time but it was often difficult i was employed sometimes and i had things in development but there were a lot of disappointments it was not so much stubbornness or even belief i just carried on writing to deal with disappointment i had to write for the sake of writing not some imaginary reward
6247396 the richard amp judy booker venn diagram crossover no i dont think theyve ever done that
6247397 he raised his hand again quickly and she flinched and hated herself for flinching but he didnt hit her he smiled at her and they both knew this was the beginning
6247398 its about our fear of young men our fear of outsiders
6247399 were doing it at the moment with young men too anybody standing at a corner wearing the wrong sort of hood is a devil as if the rest of society isnt imploding around us anyway
6247400 it was always a compulsion to write to tell stories but it just never occurred to me that i might be a novelist that seemed a much scarier thing to do
6247401 my sister said to me youd be so good at writing something really funny about women and i thought oh god thats the sort of book i wouldnt want to read and who wants to write that
6247402 all the life of it was still there so i just felt as if it hadnt been told it wasnt done all of lewiss early life was unfolding i didnt know where to put it all it wasnt another film and really to keep myself sane i thought ill put it down as a book but i still wasnt thinking i was going to write a novel just thinking ive just got to tell this
6247403 its such an emotional story love and grief and all these giant feelings i was always trying to find that balance where it wouldnt tip over into overstating a thing but where it wouldnt be so cool as not to tell it
6247404 in my mad head it was sort of a novelisation film scripts are like the tops of little mountain peaks or the tips of icebergs then having the rest of the iceberg there and being liberated to write that iceberg it was like being let off the lead it was wonderful
6247405 wont that be fun ill be thinking do we need to have this and that bits rubbish were not going for that i think i have to liberate myself from whats there itll be hard to do
6247406 it will do my head in its too precarious im not happy with it i might never show it im in one of those states
6247407 if in fact a person is generating enough packets that theyre the ones creating that situation we will manage that consumer for the overall good of all of our consumers
6247408 the settlers try to frighten people and make them leave
6247409 the israeli authorities deny it but with the cameras we can prove what happens and force them to do their jobs
6247410 in the past we have had private agencies to do surveys of the partys prospects in different constituencies it is for the first time that they are assessing the prospects of individual candidates there is nothing wrong with this process but what is the credibility of these organisations do we know the background of the promoters of these agencies
6247411 it is a more objective method of shortlisting the best candidates instead of relying on leaders who try to promote their own candidates we will have an independent view about ticket seekers
6247412 clarks essentially a good person and deep down im not
6247413 id rather be hated for who i am then loved for who im not
6247414 were hoping we can get this thing squared away real quickly
6247415 steven is one of the best players in the nfl and wed like to have him back
6247416 reclaiming public spaces as a space for public imagination and enlightenment where they have become propagandistic barriers to thought and awareness
6247417 id like to tell you a time on it but i cant i dont know what that time is on it
6247418 he practiced tuesday and just felt like he couldnt get up and go full speed
6247419 other guys will have to step up for the time that hes out
6247420 shawns going to give it a go and well just see how he does
6247421 were going to try to keep good communication with him during the game and give him an opportunity to play
6247422 he will play as much as we need to have him play
6247423 the thinking is that kyle has had 42 starts and we have a good idea of what he is and what hes been we need to find out more about troy smith he needs those reps he needs them against a defense in a third preseason game where theyre game planning him a little bit and well see how he does
6247424 no i say that because i am confident in what i can do and what i will do
6247425 obviously being a young player i havent had that much time on the field im very very thankful for the situation and the opportunity and im grateful for everything to come
6247426 anytime passes are in the game plan you want to try to hit them all but nothing is perfect when you get out there on the football field this is still the preseason weve still got a long way to go
6247427 el pnp est desesperado pues no tiene funcionarios de colegio pero nosotros no queremos trabajar para

6247429 nino ha declarado que el var n que estaba junto a l era rodr guez uno de los acusados
6247430 one of our biggest challenges is to mature as rapidly as this region needs us to mature
6247431 a gift of this magnitude really torques that maturation process
6247432 not typical of the type of awards we will be making
6247433 i know in my heart this is exactly what they would want me to do
6247434 its an extraordinary investment that affirms the value of a strong economic development strategy
6247435 this is a clear sign to companies that this is a place you want to do business
6247436 we want to make sure we always live up to the haile name
6247437 its about building a community where young people feel they can come to lay down roots raise their families build their companies build their community

6247448 i had something called the greg roll and it is one of the best rolls i have ever had
6247449 of course military and technical cooperation is the main issue weapons purchases are very important
6247450 i think we should speed it up moreover the west and israel continue to put pressure on russia
6247451 you for example are highly critical of israel without demonstrating even the slightest inclination toward anti jewish sentiment
6247452 i have utmost faith that the police can continue this in a proper manner

6247463 tv will fundamentally change how we talk about imagine and experience the internet
6247464 this is the beginning of a number of distribution announcements that will go beyond content producers to oems
6247465 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6247466 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6247467 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6247468 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6247469 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board
6247470 you never picture yourself coming home with a medal due to a dq
6247471 every time i look at it im going to be like this medal was given to me
6247472 i just stood there like man what do i do
6247473 by the time they announced the dq they were already lining up for the 400 hurdles i didnt want to take a victory lap anyway that just didnt seem classy to me
6247474 he did the whole victory lap and had the flag for the whole world to see
6247475 thats heartbreaking if that was me i probably would have broken down and cried right there on worldwide television
6247476 we then went through the rules process we wanted to make sure that the results of the race were fair
6247477 for this generation of teenagers were not going to have data for the next 15 or 20 years on how effective it a cervical cancer vaccine is what it changes about the dynamics of cervical cancer how long the vaccine lasts whether you can then extrapolate this to decreasing screening guidelines
6247478 we need more long term data from this generation of girls getting vaccinates now to make decisions on a population basis
6247479 our main findings were that preadolescent vaccinating targeting 12 year old girls is fairly attractive
6247480 we found consistently that catch up vaccination up to the age of 18 was cost effective that extending catch up vaccinations in women to the age of 21 was cost effective when we made very generous assumptions about vaccines properties and that generally speaking the catch up up to age 26 was not cost effective
6247481 theres a lot of uncertainty in the data and we had to make a lot of assumptions about the vaccines properties
6247482 we made very optimistic assumptions and we havent looked at the vaccine long enough to know how these assumptions will bear out
6247483 can you imagine two old ladies in their 70s being re educated through labor
6247484 i feel very sad and angry because were only asking for the basic right of living and its been six years but nobody will do anything to help them

6247491 collapsed when she suffered a very serious brain hemorrhage caused by an aneurysm that burst in an inaccessible part of her brain

6247496 is producing historic flooding across a large portion of brevard county
6247497 fay has and will continue to produce copious amounts of rain over a large portion of northeast florida as the storm turns westward on august 21

6247499 on this track fay is forecast to move very slowly across northern florida on thursday

6247501 no significant change in strength is anticipated before fay moves over land

6247503 a well placed official in the russian ministry of defense
6247504 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6247505 it is our understanding that other nato countries will receive similar notes
6247506 if this indeed is the case it would be unfortunate we need to work with russia on a range of security issues but we are obviously very concerned about russian behavior in georgia
6247507 conseguiria mais votos porque um quarto de seus partid rios ainda n o entrou na onda de obama est o flertando com o republicano john mccain ou est o apoiando a campanha nader gonz lez

6247509 the kind of stress in question are those that would be experienced in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane a terrorist attack or a sudden bereavement
6247510 it is a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for a long time
6247511 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6247512 there is overwhelming experimental evidence that stress to pregnant mammals alters neurodevelopment in the offspring and affects their subsequent behavior both in childhood and as adults
6247513 the knowledge that maternal stress affects the fetus has important implications for mental health in a world threatened by acute violence and war

6247525 we think that this is the biggest most fundamental change we have made
6247526 from 2000 to the end of 2007 ebay kind of fought the trends they tried to keep auctions the focus of the company
6247527 we believe by making the fees more success based buyers will have more choice better values and that sellers will sell more
6247528 we wanted to make sure that the trust factors were in place
6247529 the vocal minority is going to be exceedingly vocal about this
6247530 i think it is a great step and for the fixed price sellers it is a big step
6247531 were at high tide and the water is up 18 inches and we expect it to be up two feet over today

6247545 it was one minute and 11 seconds i was surprised i was able to do it this fast actually
6247546 well we are a big ice cream family we usually have 8 to 10 pints in the freezer at all times so were always used to eating ice cream just usually not for speed but i have done pints in single sittings
6247547 i just shoved it all into my mouth and tried to swallow it all at the same time i had big heaps of piles in my spoon
6247548 my braces started to freeze though so my mouth was kind of cold it was bad
6247549 i couldnt feel my mouth and i think i got frost bite
6247550 instead of putting the whole spoon in your mouth i was doing a half of spoon at a time
6247551 i was really hoping for vanilla but i got stuck with chocolate and i really like chocolate more but i thought for speed vanilla would be better

6247563 i honor his service i dont honor his policies i dont honor his politics
6247564 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6247565 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6247566 sen obama got a little testy on this issue he said i was questioning his patriotism let me be clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6247567 the bottom line is that sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much
6247568 we think we can open up fractures thats not a problem you can certainly drill wells and directionally you can convert the hot water into steam
6247569 the fireball that sits within the earth is a resource
6247570 we walk on it we sleep on it we work on it the question is how do we harness it
6247571 the deeper you drill the more expensive it is geology brings magma and heat closer to the surface in the western u s if we could drill deeper then we could move east
6247572 there are roughly 1 900 drilling rigs in the u s
6247573 you have to reduce the cost of drilling to be able to go deep you have to improve the efficiency of the pumps so you dont lose too much electricity pumping water around

6247798 its powered by a battery not the boat and should be good for a couple years sittin in the box and bout a week goin off
6247799 i guess we ought to tell the others i guess
6247800 i know but we cant hide it from em they oughta know
6247801 i wouldnt say anything until you have some sort of of plan
6247802 you have to have a plan dont you i mean a fail safe back up sort of thing
6247803 the beacon is the back up fail safe thing kira its broke too we dont have nothin else fogs so thick i dont think a flared work either
6247804 but you do have flares right and they do work right
6247805 the boats in perfect workin order everything checked out fore we set off that freaky ass storm knocked the stuffin out of the equipment and there aint a damn thing i or you or anybody else for that matter coulda done bout it kira you might not be happy with your prize here but it aint my fault and it aint willys neither
6247806 look everyone down in that cabin is going to be looking to you for answers guidance leadership if youre not the expert skipper we were told you were youd either better come right out with it or start faking it pretty damn quick the last thing you want is charles or edward taking charge
6247807 are you sure the dinghy works i mean nothing else youve tried does dont you think you ought to test it
6247808 i we cant if it inflates theres no way to un inflate it
6247809 then youd better inflate it because we need to know if it works or if the storm took it out too
6247810 im goin to tell the others whats happenin hope thell it dont cause mayhem and panic
6247811 you might as well be ready for panic and mayhem from charles
6247812 he panicked before he knew we were screwed now that we are mayhem is next
6247813 oh my god were gonna die out here heelp haaaaaaaaaaaalllllllp
6247814 for christs sake you incompetent jack ass whatre we going to do
6247815 huh what the hell are we going to do now no motor no radio no emergency beacon sounds fucked to me is that what we are captain fucked

6247821 okay then thats what well do willy you got that dinghy yet
6247822 well go head an inflate it get it tied off over the side the rest o you start getting provisions together
6247823 y yeah im okay god it came out of nowhere
6247824 and nobodys come out to see what the hell happened neither
6247825 think theyre havin trouble like us no lectronics no motor
6247826 no sir i dont cant tell but it looks like an old schooner maybe
6247827 i try a light willy get a flashlight an see if we can get some attention thataway
6247828 its dead skip just like the beacon and radio and stuff
6247829 board her shes adrift they musta known somethin happened why wouldnt they answer
6247830 yeah okay take a volunteer go over an see what gives
6247831 thanks mr beausha charles i appreciate you steppin up willy go on over and see what gives come back with the raft when you got some answers
6247832 why is this vessel moving when yours wasnt were you anchored
6247833 i dunno why might have a sail down but we were in a dead calm far as i could tell storm came through and didnt budge us no current to speak of and even the bump by this big tub didnt knock us adrift i been scratchin my head over it since we set off cant figure why this ones movin and we were dead
6247834 you know what else before the ship hit us i checked my watch you know while you and willy were working on the engine and it worked i mean i noted in my journal that a couple of hours passed so i couldntve known that without the watch working i think
6247835 but now that i think bout it it musta happened after this boat rammed us
6247836 matter of fact i think kiras right i think i used my watch fore we got clipped too and im pretty sure it was workin
6247837 not exactly things didnt work after the storm blew by engine radio gps stuff like that but our watches stopped when the ship appeared
6247838 i aint noticed it gettin darker neither like like the suns not settin or somethin
6247839 what if what if times not working right i mean this vessel came out of nowhere its its old right i mean its not a new ship is it built to look old
6247840 what if that storm was some sort of some sort of temporal anomaly
6247841 thats thats like something out of star trek isnt it
6247842 yeah it is ive been on the water a long time and ive never seen any sorta tempral anemone
6247843 maybe its something like what goes on in the bermuda triangle
6247844 and youre talkin nonsense tboot triangles a myth nothin more and were a long way from it
6247845 i know i mean im just throwing out possibilities you know what else could this be
6247846 this might be a schooner set off from some port whos crew hadta abandon ship same as we did maybe th same storm got em maybe it broke loose o some port or moorin somewhere i dont know for sure but i know it aint a tempral whatever
6247847 right now we needta find charles so lets focus on that awright
6247848 shes just trying to understand the weird ass shit going on flanagan you dont have to be an ass with her
6247849 im im sorry im bushed its gettin dark well least it was and ive got other things on mmind right now i shouldnta been like that though im sorry kira
6247850 well i wasnt til just now when you brought it up thanks kira one more thing i need to be worried about
6247851 dont worry about it you did it for me with edward
6247852 you you didnt need my help youd have told him off yourself i just opened my mouth first
6247853 i mean im not shy and im not weak but for some reason where edwards concerned ive never well ive never told him off whatever the reasons i cant tell you why but for a couple years now ive let him hang around and hang around i guess i was hoping
6247854 i cant see my hand fore my face in here but i think theres a door at the bottom
6247855 hopefully it wont be even darker in the main area
6247856 well ida thought youd want a bit more weatherproofing case your outer hatch failed for some reason but i aint ever been on one o these you know a tall ship
6247857 get the outta the way so we can see too
6247858 i i dont know not this big thats for damned sure this is like cruise ship big
6247859 holy crap how how it didnt look this big before is it
6247860 no and this aint right there should be a wall dividin the focsle from the main cargo hold and the aft area too three main sections i think
6247861 aaaahh yeah a mirrored walld look like that wouldnt it
6247862 a mirrored wall would show us too our reflections i dont see us do you
6247863 whats going on is weird but not impossible the ships been modified to hold people stead o cargo thats all took out the dividin walls and just made cabins nothin impossible bout that
6247864 bullshit flanagan dont treat us like idiots okay there wasnt that much boat left in front of us when we came down here its not a tanker or cruise ship for petes sake it was what 150 feet long less and theres a lot of hallway in front of us too much and behind us it goes til we cant see the end now piss in your own ear and tell yourself its raining but dont try that with us
6247865 sorry captain i have to agree here this hallways longer than the ship was
6247866 i dont have an answer i just know we got a man missin and needta find im so lets solve the mysteries later an find charles now
6247867 i say we start right here where we are and work toward the front of the boat then well have this as a marker this door i mean the stairwell out to mark our progress i dont know about you but to me all these walls doors and carpet look the same
6247868 fine by me we have to search the whole place anyway at least this way we have a reference to guide us
6247869 okay well stick together its pretty dim in here even with the lamps
6247870 probly not lectric though id bet the batteries woulda gone dead a long time ago if they were without runnin the alternator
6247871 i mean we just havent seen anyone that doesnt mean there isnt anyone
6247872 the sudden crash of flanagans voice scared kira and sam into hard jumps and shrieks
6247873 you dumb ass tell us before you do that next time you scared the hell out of us you idiot
6247874 sorry if someones here though they damned sure heard me

6247934 its fine by me just come home and tell me all the details
6247935 the global standard by which all leagues around the world are measured
6247936 several england internationals are being headhunted with the carrot of professional contracts
6247937 we are hoping to create full time opportunities for girls in english clubs and we will do all we can to retain the players
6247938 if these girls and other england players go to america it could set the game here back 10 years
6247939 the idea for this particular project was brought to methodist hospital by the watershed district
6247940 wish i had something to tell ya cap but nothin i mean the boats intact the motors working fine the gps the radio and of course the emergency beacon are all functioning perfectly i dont get it
6247941 not one no flotsam and jetsam either no debris of any kind divers say the hull doesnt have a scratch on it theres a little nick above the water at the bow on the port side like maybe they bumped a dock pullin in but other than that shes ship shape and sea worthy no water on her anywhere
6247942 this is damn peculiar how far offshore was she when we picked up the signal
6247943 six people on a day charter what would they get out of it few hundred bucks nah if pirates or terrorists took em theredve been some money involved or at least some group wantin the credit and why hit a small boat shes 42 feet why not a cruise ship with butt loads of money and valuables and rich people wouldnt that make more sense
6247944 this is damn weird what would cause a skipper to pull his emergency beacon and then abandon ship
6247945 didnt abandon ship in his dinghy whatever it was they went swimmin
6247946 it was tied alongside er just off the aft port inflated and ready both oars on it a cooler of water and food stowed life vests nothin else no sign they ever left the boat
6247947 a journal one of the passengers kept one like a diary i guess looks like it got left behind when they went overboard
6247948 the last couple entries here theyre odd this one says a storm blew in its dated yesterday did we have a storm yesterday
6247949 no sir we didnt weathers been like this most of the week and all weekend clear skies calm seas good days for charterin a fishin boat
6247950 thats what i thought too so whats this talkin about
6247951 and up til then theres pretty much an entry every day nothin for today though last ones yesterday
6247952 this mustve i dunno i guess she left it behind
6247953 says it belongs to someone named kira here on the inside front cover
6247954 hm weird a storm i wonder what shes talkin about
6247955 i dont know no storm came through though and she says the storm had lightning but no thunder and moved quick but no wind ever heard o anything like that
6247956 well keep the copter circling for a while how far you figure they coulda drifted overnight if theyre in another raft
6247957 not that far less than a hundred miles no major currents round here no wind to push em along well circle a few times theydve drifted inland anyway so theyd probly have made land or see it anyway if they were adrift
6247958 well keep lookin cap should we get ready ta tow the tub back in
6247959 course i do registered to a small time skipper name o flanagan steven flanagan his mates names william jurgen passenger lists on file with the port his reg was kept up up on his payments too
6247960 so hes not fakin his own death ta get outta payin for her
6247961 nope well i dont think so anyway he had a good solid business goin income was decent had a deal with some radio show syndicate they sent him passengers once in a while i guess one o these missin was a contest winner
6247962 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6247963 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6247964 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6247965 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6247966 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6247967 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6247968 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6247969 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6247970 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6247971 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6247972 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6247973 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6247974 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6247975 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6247976 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6247977 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6247978 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6247979 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6247980 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6247981 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6247982 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6247983 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6247984 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6247985 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6247986 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6247987 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6247988 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6247989 go to school and get a great job then retire
6247990 thats high enough to see the curvature of the earth and the stars of space
6247991 there isnt a geek out there who hasnt dreamed of being an astronaut
6247992 get your affairs in order you have two months to live
6247993 i didnt think about anything during todays race i knew that if i kept passing one after another that victory would be mine
6247994 for an old athlete competing in this olympics was hard ive had many injuries in the past four years i was able to persevere until now because i wanted to make china proud in the olympic games that china is hosting
6247995 todays race is a true reflection of her past 10 days races she had a good start but immediately fell behind in the middle and had to catch up one by one it was difficult but in the end she caught up with one after each mark and entered the top three it was not easy
6247996 this is the sport that europeans excel in and they are usually good at making a last push in the final race so today yin relied on herself to deal with surprises she did it well and took all the important opportunities
6247997 what were seeing now is a clear regrouping and also again some kind of deception campaign saying look were moving out
6247998 they are going around now and trying to grab new strategic areas in georgia
6247999 we still believe this is not all that this is just a beginning
6248000 dreaming to turn my country into chechnya into some kind of insurgency warfare field where they go around and operate with brutal force
6248001 the last thing im worried about is about my political future right now
6248002 we are trying to bring the agreement to a close it is not done yet
6248003 we have given ours the other side has given theirs
6248004 i want to make sure it meets my needs before i jump in
6248005 go back to postville and take care of your children and dont leave
6248006 they are never going to do that to me again
6248007 now about 20 to 25 women remain tethered to the bracelets black electronic monitoring devices that dig into the skin of their right ankles leaving dark bruises and painful cuts some women try without success to protect their flesh with makeshift bandages fashioned from bandanas and shorn socks
6248008 and the women who happily embraced hard work are forced to subsist on donations from st bridgets and the local food pantry while they await court dates
6248009 last week the iowa labor commissioners office said an investigation had uncovered 57 cases of child labor law violations at the facility at agriprocessors which has also been cited for numerous safety and health violations the claims have prompted debates among rabbis about kosher laws protections for food workers and how orthodox oversight officials should involve themselves

6248019 the collaboration between microsoft and novell has been built on our desire to meet our customers real life it requirements as well as give our partners greater breadth in their solution offerings
6248020 some customers have told us they want to be able to run windows server and linux together seamlessly but in many cases they need help with the transition to suse linux enterprise server from other linux environments our increased investment in the relationship with novell is intended to give these customers and partners the best possible windows linux interoperability solution while also extending their existing windows server investments and helping to give them ip peace of mind
6248021 cross platform interoperability is something that we all want and need to achieve but its difficult to accomplish this
6248022 the pragmatic approach microsoft and novell are taking to address this complex challenge including ip assurance through engineering as well as offering tangible support and training programs will make it easier for us to develop a path forward
6248023 the strategic partnership between our companies continues to attract customers by building a bridge between proprietary and open source software
6248024 the interoperability delivered by microsoft and novell has resulted in very high demand for suse linux enterprise from customers and channel partners further validating novells linux strategy

6248051 would it not be ironic if i describe myself as indescribable
6248052 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6248053 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6248054 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6248055 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6248056 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6248057 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6248058 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6248059 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6248060 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6248061 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6248062 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6248063 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6248064 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6248065 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6248066 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6248067 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6248068 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6248069 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6248070 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6248071 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6248072 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6248073 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera

6248076 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6248077 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6248078 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6248079 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6248080 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6248081 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6248082 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6248083 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6248084 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural

6248087 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6248088 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6248089 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6248090 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6248091 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6248092 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6248093 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6248094 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6248095 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6248096 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6248097 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6248098 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso

6248101 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
6248102 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
6248103 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
6248104 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
6248105 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
6248106 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
6248107 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
6248108 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
6248109 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
6248110 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6248111 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6248112 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
6248113 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6248114 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6248115 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6248116 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
6248117 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
6248118 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6248119 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
6248120 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
6248121 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
6248122 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
6248123 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
6248124 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
6248125 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra

6248140 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6248141 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6248142 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6248143 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

6248156 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6248157 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6248158 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6248159 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

6248162 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6248163 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6248164 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6248165 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6248166 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6248167 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6248168 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6248169 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6248170 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6248171 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6248172 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6248173 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6248174 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

6248180 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6248181 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

6248193 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6248194 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6248195 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6248196 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6248197 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6248198 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6248199 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6248200 we left the house we left everything and came on foot because to stay there was impossible
6248201 they are burning the houses from most of the houses they are taking everything they are stealing everything even such things as toothbrushes and toilets they are taking the toilets imagine they are taking broken refrigerators
6248202 we are so heartbroken i dont know what to say or even think our whole lives we were working to save something and one day we lost everything now i have to start everything from the very beginning
6248203 it means we can appeal to people who are disillusioned with traditional church
6248204 the flip side is the uncertainty has meant weve seen people we otherwise wouldnt have seen who have come along because they are asking the big questions about life
6248205 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6248206 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6248207 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6248208 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6248209 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6248210 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6248211 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6248212 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6248213 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6248214 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6248215 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6248216 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6248217 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6248218 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6248219 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6248220 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6248221 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6248222 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6248223 matt and lucy damon had a baby girl named gia zavala on wednesday aug 20th everyones doing great she is a healthy baby girl
6248224 their friends are quite pleased that theyre getting back together and are trying to give them space
6248225 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6248226 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6248227 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6248228 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6248229 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6248230 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6248231 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6248232 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6248233 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6248234 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6248235 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6248236 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6248237 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6248238 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6248239 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6248240 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6248241 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6248242 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6248243 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6248244 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6248245 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6248246 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6248247 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6248248 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6248249 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6248250 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6248251 if in fact a person is generating enough packets that theyre the ones creating that situation we will manage that consumer for the overall good of all of our consumers bowling said
6248252 comcast may on a limited basis temporarily delay certain p2p traffic when that traffic has or is projected to have an adverse effect on other customers use of the service
6248253 we expect to reach 500 million opensocial users by the end of the quarter its also very international as social networking is a global phenomenon
6248254 when we launched opensocial javascript was the center but the community wants more choice we agreed upon a restful api that gives access to the social bits and is already implemented in
6248255 hi5 launched with opensocial very early january 1 2008 and we ended up building the system which had a lot of undefined pieces
6248256 we had a lot of custom work with the rest endpoint so that applications could contact our server directly as time went by all participants came up with one offs but now we are bringing it all together in the community with common types of solutions for these problems standardizing on a single specification will allow application developers to write code once and it will work on all different containers we are already seeing others build on rest specification plaxo for example has enabled privacy enabled exchange of contact info
6248257 templates and markup are now in discussion on public mailing lists but we believe we are pretty close
6248258 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6248259 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6248260 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6248261 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6248262 we expect to reach 500 million opensocial users by the end of the quarter its also very international as social networking is a global phenomenon

6248267 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6248268 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6248269 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6248270 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6248271 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6248272 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6248273 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6248274 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6248275 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6248276 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6248277 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6248278 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6248279 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6248280 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6248281 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6248282 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6248283 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6248284 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6248285 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6248286 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6248287 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6248288 this is a planning took where all things are going
6248289 in the finnish navy spats are part of the winter uniform they are colloquially known as
6248290 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6248291 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6248292 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6248293 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6248294 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6248295 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6248296 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6248297 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6248298 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6248299 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6248300 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6248301 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6248302 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6248303 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6248304 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6248305 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6248306 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6248307 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6248308 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6248309 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6248310 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6248311 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6248312 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6248313 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6248314 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6248315 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6248316 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6248317 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6248318 and i beheld that they were white and exceedingly fair and beautiful
6248319 and he had caused the cursing to come upon them yea even a sore cursing because of their iniquity for behold they had hardened their hearts against him that they had become like unto a flint wherefore as they were white and exceedingly fair and delightsome that they might not be enticing unto my people the lord god did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them
6248320 and it came to pass that those lamanites who had united with the nephites were numbered among the nephites and their curse was taken from them and their skin became white like unto the nephites and their young men and their daughters became exceeding fair
6248321 o my brethren i fear that unless ye shall repent of your sins that their skins will be whiter than yours when ye shall be brought with them before the throne of god
6248322 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6248323 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6248324 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6248325 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6248326 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6248327 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6248328 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6248329 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6248330 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6248331 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6248332 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
6248333 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
6248334 meant vermouth became largely ignored and as a result misunderstood
6248335 it was great getting to know you for the past insert time of relationship take care of yourself
6248336 i just want to let you know how much i love you and you are so special to me

6248338 die eu nahm das lissabon abkommen an das weitgehend die wichtigsten bestandteile des abgelehnten verfassungsvertrages 2004 verfechtet vor allem in sachen der au en und sicherheitspolitik die eu kann sich jetzt ihr erhebliches potential zunutze machen indem sie die neuen rechtsstrukturen in politisches handeln umsetzt
6248339 staatliche schw che war einer der kritischen faktoren welcher die zersplitterung und die wachsende widerspenstigkeit der waffengewalt im jahr 2007 f rderte um gewalt in schwachen konfliktgesch digten staaten zu verringern sollten die anstrengungen zur unterst tzung des aufbaus staatlicher strukturen welche funktionalit t mit lokaler rechtm igkeit verbinden als vorrangige aufgabe gesehen werden im inland entstandene bewegungen welche betr chtliche unterst tzung in der bev lkerung genie en und breite gesellschaftliche politische und sicherheitsrelevante programme verfolgen sind am besten in der lage diese verbindung zu erreichen auch wenn ihre ideologien und programme sich deutlich von denen der f hrenden internationalen akteure unterscheiden

6248342 ma i blitz delle forze dellordine che leggo sui quotidiani non dovevano aver eliminato il problema dellabusivismo commerciale
6248343 se il sindaco pensava che bastasse un colpo di bacchetta magica e qualche blitz con qualche sequestro per eliminare il commercio abusivo ci dice lo stesso turista si sbagliato di grosso
6248344 povera gente che cerca di guadagnare qualche spicciolo la voce di un anziano che da giovane immigrato a viareggio dal sud in cerca di lavoro che nelle sue terre era impossibile trovare e sfruttata da italiani e chi si arricchisce sulla pelle dei neri che dovrebbe essere colpito
6248345 the idea of euthanasia is the idea that we are alowd to play god that we can decide whether or not a person should live or die
6248346 the patient in question decides its his life why should he not be able to decide what happens to it
6248347 is your pain as a human worth the pain as a spirit
6248348 plus if you really want to be more like him and want to show the people how you can endure all the suffering just dont ask for euthanasia p
6248349 so why endure it if no one really benefits from it or finds salvation in it
6248350 sometimes i cry because i dont know what to do or because i miss you and daddy when youre not home i cry when im hurt or when i feel guilty
6248351 you keep track of all my sorrows you have collected all my tears in your bottle you have recorded each one in your book
6248352 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6248353 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6248354 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6248355 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6248356 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6248357 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6248358 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6248359 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6248360 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6248361 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6248362 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6248363 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6248364 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6248365 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6248366 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6248367 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6248368 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6248369 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6248370 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6248371 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6248372 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6248373 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6248374 um olhar me atira cama um beijo me faz amar
6248375 ele quis obter por meio do decreto o que n o conseguiu nos tribunais
6248376 n s dissemos que n o poderia mudar por decreto uma decis o do supremo
6248377 o ministro n o deve participar do julgamento dessa quest o porque n o ser um juiz isento imparcial
6248378 na mesma poca ele dizia que n o se podia fazer ilhas no parque porque isso descaracterizava toda a vida cultural dos ind genas
6248379 mas hoje como presidente do supremo e solid rio s posturas do ministro jobim acho que tudo pode acontecer e isso significa que dependendo da decis o do supremo todas as demarca es no pa s podem ser revistas

6248391 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6248392 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6248393 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6248394 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6248395 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6248396 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6248397 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6248398 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6248399 combines connected personal gps navigation and real time points of interest poi with internet based entertainment and full web browsing
6248400 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6248401 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6248402 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6248403 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6248404 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6248405 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6248406 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6248407 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6248408 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6248409 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6248410 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6248411 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6248412 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6248413 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6248414 yeah i mean you left out a bunch of things spying on citizens without a warrant going around fisa on and on look i have always said it should be on the table
6248415 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6248416 the laurel packinghouse is an important asset for this city but it is now showing its age
6248417 we are taking the necessary steps to understand exactly which repairs are needed so that the building can be enjoyed for many years to come
6248418 in addition the mechanical electrical and sprinkler systems are nearing the end of their service life the building also needs upgrades to meet current codes for accessibility
6248419 the building has stood for nearly a century and has been well used by the community since the second floor was added 25 years ago we encourage the public to continue to visit the museums
6248420 sutherland said he understands why companies such as weyerhaeuser is selling land for home development
6248421 i can buy an acre of timberlands for between 750 and 1 500

6248423 in january the provincial government gave western forest products permission to remove 28 283 hectares of private land from three tree farm licences on vancouver island and wfp then put 2 532 hectares on the market
6248424 its an abuse of process to take this land out of the tfl and ask the community to beg for crumbs
6248425 the group is also asking for a debate in the legislature and that the auditor general conduct a formal audit into the deletions something already requested by the university of victoria environmental law clinic
6248426 as announced in august 2007 timberwest expects to close the sale of 9 700 hectares of timberland on southern vancouver island to the capital regional district

6248436 while the brennans strongly endorse the countys photo enforcement efforts they are baffled as to how terence brennan could be accused of driving their toyota echo economy car at 100 mph

6248461 projects such as migraine expressions are rare priceless and sorely needed they offer an intimate view of the impact of migraine disease the works of art in this book are deeply personal and revealing while both heart wrenching and inspiring filled with both terror and hope
6248462 migraine is all this and more that encircles me pulls me away from life and finally leaves me dizzy and hanging with an aura that doesnt bleed
6248463 it kept like sliding forward and the wheels were coming off and my aunt was trying to get us inside the station because it didnt look like it was stopping

6248469 el xito de los gobiernos de la concertaci n en el combate a la delincuencia
6248470 esta ha sido una negociaci n entre dos aliados y amigos cercanos y a pesar de que han habido altibajos naturalmente a lo largo de todo el proceso nos gratifica que ambas delegaciones hayan tratado esto en el esp ritu de intentar hacer algo que es importante para la seguridad de ambos pa ses y como aliados y amigos
6248471 lo que suceda en los pr ximos d as y meses determinar el futuro de las relaciones entre estados unidos y rusia pero del mismo modo mi opini n personal es que tienen que haber consecuencias para las acciones que rusia ha tomado contra un estado soberano
6248472 acuso al gobierno ruso de adoptar una pol tica de limpieza tnica y puedo probarlo con organizaciones internacionales que ya est n dando testimonio de lo que digo y recibimos 1 400 denuncias de ataques brutales asesinatos violaciones e internaci n de personas en violaci n de la convenci n de ginebra y del derecho humanitario internacional
6248473 como ya he dicho de acuerdo con el c digo de las naciones unidas estamos intentando imponer la paz a georgia que empez la agresi n consideramos que esta t ctica es muy efectiva y es la nica posible perm tanme recordarles que en la historia hemos visto muchos ejemplos de pacificaci n del agresor de esta manera los pa ses occidentales lo hicieron hace 70 a os y conocen las tr gicas consecuencias de eso quiero decir la lecci n del tratado de munich de 1938
6248474 rusia invadi un estado vecino soberano y amenaza a un gobierno democr tico electo por su pueblo
6248475 entendemos que el actual liderazgo de georgia es un proyecto especial de estados unidos pero un d a estados unidos tendr que elegir entre defender su prestigio por sobre un proyecto o una sociedad real que requiera acciones conjuntas
6248476 quiero dialogar con los rusos quiero que se retiren del territorio georgiano lo m s r pido posible y me interesa mantener buenas relaciones con rusia pero en el siglo xxi las naciones no invaden otras naciones
6248477 estamos sumamente decepcionados este informe aparentemente consiente el uso de la fuerza letal en una situaci n en la que los soldados no pod an y lo admiten estar seguros de lo que ten an frente creemos que hab a fundamentos suficientes para que se dieran cuenta que estaban frente a periodistas esto nos pone en una posici n en la que los periodistas no pueden levantar una c mara en presencia de los soldados israel es sin correr peligro de que les disparen eso es inaceptable y hablaremos con las autoridades israel es sobre c mo podemos mejorar la seguridad de nuestros periodistas en el futuro
6248478 el informe israel sobre el asesinato de fadel ha suscitado temores entre los periodistas palestinos que cubren el conflicto con israel en gaza entre los palestinos y los israel es en la franja de gaza sobre la misi n ustedes saben la misi n de cubrir y filmar y hemos estado escuchando comentarios de todos los otros colegas de que ya no est n seguros de sus vidas tras un informe como este que deja en claro que el simple hecho de levantar una c mara en la calle en un campo de refugiados o cerca de la frontera puede poner la vida de una persona en peligro
6248479 en este incidente del 16 de abril seis civiles fueron asesinados con proyectiles tipo flechette un arma ilegal que no deber a ser utilizada en estas condiciones en la franja de gaza y una de estas seis v ctimas era un periodista por todas estas razones era de esperarse que el ej rcito iniciara y dirigiera una investigaci n minuciosa sobre este caso pero decidi no hacerlo la falta de responsabilidad en este caso se refleja en la falta de responsabilidad en la muerte de miles de palestinos que fueron asesinados en los territorios ocupados

6248488 curfews essentially are placing an entire demographic in this case youth under house arrest for the inappropriate actions of a few
6248489 we need to keep the young people off the streets
6248490 and the parents need help the law is the law
6248491 this dude pulled a gun on me last week to take my bike we are moving to atlanta the whole family
6248492 and the mothers are always looking to have fun they dont make time to look after their young ones

6248549 the national executive is taking this matter very seriously and is awaiting the results of medical tests before determining the full extent of the discipline that will be imposed upon him
6248550 we are very concerned for the many people who have been or will be hurt by michaels actions
6248551 we encourage all of our churches to pray for all those affected

6248565 en el congreso la derecha tiene mayor a la candidatura de lugo cont con el respaldo del partido liberal radical aut ntico plra de ideolog a de derecha y representante de terratenientes
6248566 ellos van a defender sus intereses y no van a aceptar ninguna ocupaci n de tierras ni reducci n de los latifundios
6248567 lugo est en una posici n m s de izquierda ya sali a decir que cree que las ocupaciones de tierras son leg timas como ltima instancia en la negociaci n pol tica y respalda la lucha de los campesinos por una reforma agraria integral sin embargo creemos que se va a encontrar con muchas contradicciones va a tener que asumir algunos acuerdos con la burgues a por ello el movimiento social se est preparando para apoyar las posiciones del presidente lugo y llegado el momento presionar para que se concreten los cambios
6248568 ni bien gan lugo los compa eros se organizaron y empezaron a ocupar tierras especialmente en el norte del pa s donde hay una zona muy conflictiva y donde el movimiento campesino est m s organizado e ideologizado
6248569 el an lisis realizado por nuestro movimiento es que este no es un momento estrat gico para presionar no se puede presionar al gobierno saliente que no va ofrecer garant as ni soluciones y tampoco al entrante al que hay que darle un poco de tiempo para ver si efectivamente cumple con lo que ha prometido
6248570 creo si que los compa eros en el interior est n preparados para ocupar como una medida de fuerza que me parece correcto y creo que el movimiento campesino est lo suficientemente maduro pol ticamente para tratar primero de agotar las instancias institucionales para despu s en caso de que no se cumpla con lo prometido comenzar a presionar
6248571 tambi n hay una presi n sobre todo de los medios de comunicaci n para crear en la opini n p blica una opini n desfavorable al gobierno de lugo creando temor y miedo
6248572 cuando el gobierno act e tocando intereses pol ticos fuertes la oposici n e incluso el partido liberal integrante de la coalici n de gobierno va a presionar para defender sus privilegios van a tratar de desestabilizar sectores para defender esos privilegios
6248573 y es b sicamente por eso que creo que mucho del peso pol tico que va a tener lugo depender de si puede llevar a cabo una reforma agraria integral
6248574 hay casi un mill n de empleados p blicos una clase media que vive directa o indirectamente de los recursos del estado
6248575 esas estructuras represivas siguen existiendo y lamentablemente ser dificil romperlas hoy d a los compa eros siguen siendo torturados en las c rceles del interior siguen siendo secuestrados por la polic a est n presos en situaci n ilegal siendo ocurriendo asesinatos pol ticos el a o pasado nos asesinaron a un compa ero y en lo que va de este a o han asesinados otros dos compa eros del movimiento y esto en un marco de democracia de elecciones y de libertad de expresi n
6248576 por sobre todo la acci n del nuevo gobierno estar focalizada en que los ministerios sean eficaces en sus gesti n que la salud la educaci n funcionen hay que recordar que en 61 a os en el poder el partido colorado ha creado una maquinaria impresionante de asistencial smo usando los recursos del estado en su beneficio y distribuyendo empleos p blicos y van a defender sus privilegios
6248577 espero que ojala se cumpla con lograr que los servicios del estado funcionen debidamente eso ser a un buen primer paso
6248578 en los ltimos a os el movimiento social se ha fortalecido ha logrado parar las privatizaciones la ley antiterrorista y fundamentalmente es el movimiento campesino el que m s capacidad de movilizaci n tiene creo que los compa eros del movimiento social est n conscientes de la necesidad de defender la institucionalidad en este momento
6248579 se logr acumular bastante fuerza y constituirse en el movimiento que present y apoy la candidatura de fernando lugo despu s en el trabajo se lograron acordar algunos proyectos program ticos lamentablemente en las discusiones program ticas en la coalici n fueron mimetizadas
6248580 ahora el gran desaf o es hacer un buen trabajo en los ministerios lograr una buena gesti n pero sin negligenciar el movimiento social de base que dio apoyo y crecimiento a todo esto
6248581 tomaron distancia del movimiento social concentr ndose sus cuadros en ocupar los lugares del gobierno y eso no permiti que el propio partido se dinamice
6248582 el gran desaf o seguir creciendo con la base seguir formando y construyendo el poder popular que es lo nico que nos va a garantizar un movimiento social ideologizado que nos va a permitir en el futuro y creo que es v lido para toda am rica latina poner freno a pol ticas neoliberales capitalistas para mi la nica forma concretar un cambio social estructural es constuyendo el poder popular

6248606 si me ratifican con m s de un 54 voy a convocar a todas las autoridades para buscar consensos y que el pueblo pueda aprobar una constituci n pol tica del estado boliviano que es un tema pendiente
6248607 el triunfo de la revoluci n democr tica de bolivia y del pueblo boliviano est dedicado a todos los pueblos revolucionarios de latinoam rica y el mundo
6248608 por primera vez en esta historia del pueblo boliviano hubo un referendo revocatorio y cont con la participaci n masiva de todo nuestro pueblo
6248609 no solo elige a sus candidatos adem s de eso los ratifica o los revoca
6248610 estamos ac para seguir avanzando en la recuperaci n de nuestros recursos nacionalizaci n de las empresas fundamental en la retoma de las empresas del estado
6248611 la participaci n que hoy se vio es para unir a los distintos sectores campo y ciudad y esa unidad se har juntando la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado con los estatutos auton micos respetando las normas existentes
6248612 pese a la alianza de la derecha fascista racista y algunos medios de comunicaci n
6248613 m s del 90 por ciento de los medios est n contra el proceso de cambio por lo tanto contra el pueblo esos periodistas est n contra m s del 65 por ciento de bolivianas y bolivianos que le dicen s al cambio
6248614 este gobierno insensible totalitario masista incapaz le niega el desarrollo al pueblo y s lo busca concentrar el poder y convertirnos en mendigo de l sigue siendo un pretexto de la dictadura masista el atender a los ancianos con el idh la verdadera intenci n es destruir la autonom a departamental
6248615 porque eso es autonom a democracia participativa real y es una forma de llevar el poder de decisi n a la gente
6248616 estamos impulsando la creaci n de la agencia tributaria departamental para contar con una entidad que defienda nuestros recursos de forma eficiente y transparente que permitir la ejecuci n de un fondo solidario de apoyo a otros departamentos
6248617 lo confiscado por el neopopulismo masista debe ser recuperado y eso no se negocia
6248618 estas leyes promulgadas est n apegadas a la constituci n
6248619 el jefe de estado s est facultado para dictar leyes org nicas cumpliendo el requerimiento de enviarlas a la sala constitucional del tribunal supremo de justicia tsj
6248620 en 2007 se publicaron 20 leyes muchas de stas a la espera de la propuesta de reforma constitucional que al no darse se tuvieron que reformular las legislaciones de manera que se mantuvieran dentro del texto constitucional vigente
6248621 estuve tentado a titular este art culo de manera distinta por ejemplo
6248622 en venezuela en mi punto de vista vivimos cambios intensos mas no una revoluci n todav a hay muchas cosas del pasado mucho lastre que no logramos superar la trama heredada opera como controlador del proceso y tardar tiempo para que sus logros se perciban con nitidez y se consoliden pero estamos viviendo tiempos de cambio estos se est n dando y quiz sea ste el rasgo m s significativo en libertad y en democracia con arreglo al estado de derecho consagrado en la constituci n de 1999
6248623 esos cambios tropiezan a cada instante con poderosos obst culos obst culos que colocan en el camino grupos econ micos poderes transnacionales viejos h bitos pol ticos y en general un pasado cargado de negatividad de revanchismo y la voluntad de garantizarse a como d lugar que las cosas sigan siendo como eran
6248624 la facultad del parlamento de habilitar al jefe del estado para dictar decretos con fuerza de ley siempre estuvo consagrada en el ordenamiento constitucional venezolano y la ejercieron los gobiernos en diferentes etapas de nuestra historia no es una novedad y menos a n un golpe de estado o una violaci n de la carta magna como algunos lo plantean
6248625 lo que sucede es que ahora se legisla con otro signo con otra orientaci n pero los 26 decretos leyes aprobados por ch vez en el marco de la habilitaci n que le otorg la asamblea nacional son inobjetables la otorg con la mayor a requerida la representaci n popular y la ejerce un presidente electo por el pueblo
6248626 va en el mismo dise o de los proyectos de 2001 con las leyes habilitantes que estaban destinadas a una mayor injerencia del estado y adem s lesionar la propiedad privada
6248627 aqu el problema no es el control del estado de las instituciones es la confiscaci n la ocupaci n de los espacios sociales y por eso se habla de un neototalitarismo que es distinto a la dictadura pol tica
6248628 que el mandatario venezolano tras decretar la semana pasada leyes que fueron rechazadas en el referendo de 2007 sobre una reforma constitucional inici nuevos pasos para implementar el socialismo en el pa s y lograr la reelecci n continua
6248629 el presidente de la rep blica con la participaci n del tribunal supremo de justicia han desconocido la constituci n vigente han pisoteado el estado de derecho han impedido el derecho a la participaci n han aplicado una sistem tica estrategia de desinformaci n han actuado de manera arbitraria ilegal y contra el inter s y la opini n del pa s
6248630 26 leyes que el gobierno aprob en las ltimas horas aprueban las mismas cosas y peores a las que el pueblo venezolano dijo no el 2 de diciembre
6248631 por devoci n y fe nos la hemos tra do desde tan lejos a la virgencita para que nos acompa e aqu en lo bueno y en lo malo hacemos esta fiesta para integrarnos entre los bolivianos y con los espa oles

6248635 aqu no hay ni cambas ni collas hay s lo bolivianos
6248636 en medio de los bolivianos me siento m s boliviano parece que estuviera en bolivia estos momentos y espacios de encuentro fortalecen m s mi identidad boliviana hemos inmigrado dejando lo que m s queremos para que a bolivia le vaya bien pero ahora en bolivia est n peleando unos contra otros eso duele

6248640 nothing remains that looks like a plane its horrific everythings burned its a horror i dont want to tell you its the most like hell ive ever seen
6248641 its been very hard emergencies of this kind leave an enormous mark on you
6248642 the problem was that after the plane crashed the area around it was engulfed in flames the firefighters could not get to the plane
6248643 that is why the helicopters came with their water tanks they were putting out the fire
6248644 from my seat i could see smoke coming up from the end of the runway there was a small mushroom cloud as you might expect after an explosion
6248645 when we came in to land the emergency services were alongside our plane as we slowed they overtook us and went straight to the crash scene they were at the scene within two minutes there must have been about 80 or 90 ambulances
6248646 i could see flames coming from the tail end of the plane it looked like the left wing was broken and the aircraft was lying on its side
6248647 the scene is devastating the fuselage is destroyed the plane burnt i have seen a kilometre of charred land and few whole pieces of the fuselage
6248648 the plane was set to take off it was late on the second take off attempt there was fire in the motor of the plane which crashed very shortly after take off

6248671 to get back into the work force and be able to see that i can succeed and that what i wrote down on my resume is true and that i can do it and i have a lot to offer has really decreased stress

6248673 we cant lose their productivity we cant lose their skills we cant lose their value to society

6248675 an initiative like this is terribly important because if youre going to have one in five veterans coming home with this theyre just not people we can afford to forget or lose
6248676 they didnt forget us they did their job and we cant forget them
6248677 what labor is trying is to do in my judgment is help employers understand that if you support the employee hell perk back up again

6248713 im just looking forward to playing against north harbour really i havent played for a few weeks
6248714 it was good to get a week off before we left for south africa and be at home while it was good to be home again when we got back from south africa too and for me personally its all good now happy off the field happy on the field
6248715 i just feel more alive it wasnt just that all black game alone before but also life in general i had stuff happening at home and it was a big challenge for me on top of that getting dropped from the team
6248716 your confidence is shot and you want to redeem yourself but in saying that the all blacks are a special team and you cant afford to make those mistakes
6248717 im over that and just want to play some good footy i want to start for waikato and get the feel of the game again
6248718 i have a lot of goals in place as to where i want to be in a few years time but i do want to play well for waikato this weekend not just for myself
6248719 whatever else happens it happens but i want to play good rugby for waikato not just this week but next week as well
6248720 i cant really keep quiet ive got to say what has to be said in order to help those young guys
6248721 corporal punishment discourages learning fails to deter future misbehavior and at times even provokes it
6248722 we need forms of discipline that makes children understand why what they did was wrong
6248723 i just enjoy the peace and quiet and the sound of the water and it gives me time to think about things said eric lough
6248724 the water is very clear and there are a lot of fish in here
6248725 some studies have shown that as the treasure valley grows our demand for water may double by the year 2025
6248726 in order to meet the needs of the people of the treasure valley in the future we need to start using water wisely now
6248727 if we let all of this go away theres no way to ever replace it we cant make it come back
6248728 its a beautiful day i think ill resign and go fishing
6248729 in the end president pervez musharraf went if not quietly with remarkably little strife
6248730 failed to produce papers and things as directed by duly authorized subpoenas by the committee on the judiciary of the house and willfully disobeyed such subpoenas thereby assuming to himself functions and judgments necessary to the exercise of the sole power of impeachment vested in the constitution in the house of representatives
6248731 endeavoring to cause prospective defendants to expect favored treatment and consideration in return for their silence or false testimony
6248732 the third day into the most critical investigation of the entire bush administration
6248733 maybe the most frustrated person attempting to exercise the oversight responsibilities that i have on judiciary
6248734 the presidency must also be stripped of the special dictatorial powers that mr musharraf seized for himself including the power to suspend civil liberties
6248735 president bush underwrote mr musharrafs dictatorship but says nothing of the example bush himself set including rigging elections as musharraf did
6248736 its fantastic it shows that they still think of us he would like us to visit
6248737 they are a wonderful family they have always been good to the jews they treated us like all the other citizens i wish other arab countries could learn from bahrain
6248738 i also reminded him of who i was he was in a class with my husband and my husband reminded him of the times they had together
6248739 it was a wonderful gesture by his majesty and were just all very honoured to be here hes got a fantastic vision for the future
6248740 they said no thank you we were really touched and appreciative and if we ever wanted it open its no problem but the community is very small and hardly gets a minyan
6248741 it doesnt matter whether they are jewish or christian or muslim or whatever
6248742 bahrain has reached out for hundreds of years we have got at least 30 churches in a very small country and mosques next to churches and synagogues next to churches they are all living there and i think this is the real arab neighbourhood
6248743 really a normal event between his majesty and his people
6248744 we are one society this cohabitation this coexistence is deep rooted and we want it to continue we dont want any external factor to have an affect on it or to change it

6248850 i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
6248851 he certainly should return here where he can be managed

6248866 cms goal for updating and enhancing the hospital compare web site is to provide usable and accurate information about hospital performance to providers and communities that will encourage hospitals to excel in the quality of care they provide
6248867 with these new enhancements consumers and health care providers will be able to look at individual hospital mortality scores we hope that this new information will cement the web sites role as a key driver in improving the quality and reliability of care in the nations hospitals
6248868 people in the general public look at mortality or survival rate as being a very key indicator
6248869 and pneumonia heart attack and heart failure are three areas in which we have national agreement in how to define measure and report outcomes
6248870 its great to know how you are doing you need to know how youre doing so you can do better
6248871 in the short run it will allow the hospital to look more carefully at their own data and improve things but for individual patients who want to choose their own care it can be more misleading than helpful
6248872 it is a good way to get the process going but it is not enough and not the right type of information
6248873 we are still in the early stages of this process
6248874 it is a bit hard to digest for the average consumer
6248875 we have been working with cms for five or six years to come up with measures that people could trust
6248876 but one thing that is true is that no one sees this measure as a means to select hospital when critically ill
6248877 we think that putting this information out and clearly communicating it to hospitals and their boards means that people have to look at their performance it is a tool to understand how you are doing
6248878 i do hope that it empowers groups of patients and community groups and hospital boards to engage in a conversation with their institution they really need to be held accountable
6248879 with an eye on the clock the white house continues to drag its feet and do everything possible to postpone public access to the records of this presidency

6248891 karenanya wajar jika muncul asumsi bahwa pembukuan quran hanya siasat bangsa quraisy melalui usman untuk mempertahankan hegemoninya atas masyarakat arab dan islam hegemoni itu tampak jelas terpusat pada ranah kekuasaan agama dan budaya dan hanya orang yang mensakralkan quranlah yang berhasil terperangkap siasat bangsa quraisy tersebut
6248892 satu dari tiga miuslimah dunia yang menciptakan perubahan positif dalam islam
6248893 pokoknya membaca promosi di sampulnya sepertinya buku ini sangat hebat

6248895 sebagai seorang pedagang buta huruf muhammad bergantung pada para pencatat untuk mencatat kata kata yang didengarnya dari allah
6248896 itu kemudian diangkat juga oleh salma rushdie menjadi judul novelnya the satanic verses ayat ayat setan novel yang terbit pertama tahun 1988 ini memang sangat biadab dalam menghina nabi muhammad saw para sahabat dan istri istri beliau menurut armstrong cerita dalam novel salman rushdi ini mengulang semua mitos barat tentang nabi muhammad saw sebagai sosok penipu ambisius yang menggunakan wahyu wahyunya untuk mendapatkan sebanyak banyak perempuan yang dia inginkan para sahabat nabi juga digambarkan dalam novel ini sebagai manusia manusia tidak berguna dan tidak manusiawi tentu saja judul novel itu sendiri sudah bertendensi melecehkan al quran it repeats all the old western myths about the prophet and makes him out to be an impostor with purely political ambitions a lecher who used his revelations as a lisence to take as many women as he wanted and indicates that his first companions were worthless inhuman people
6248897 apa yang dikatakan salman rushdie padaku ketika aku mulai menulis buku ini teringat lagi saat aku berefleksi terhadap hidupku sejak penerbitan buku ini
6248898 die syro aramaeische lesart des koran ein beitrag zur entschluesselung der koransprache
6248899 jika al quran dipengaruhi budaya yahudi kristen yang sejalan dengan klaim bahwa al quran meneruskan wahyu wahyu sebelumnya maka bahasa aramaik mungkin telah diterjemahkan oleh manusia ke dalam bahasa arab atau salah diterjemahkan dalam kasus hur dan tak ada yang tahu berapa banyak lagi kata yang diterjemahkan secara kurang tepat bagaimana jika semua ayat salah dipahami

6248903 one of the things that we have to change in this country is that people cant disagree without challenging each others character or their patriotism
6248904 im very happy for the cubs to do that its great for the community hopefully more good things can come
6248905 a little wrigley field i think the kids there will be motivated to play
6248906 little cubs field will not only be a wonderful asset to humboldt park it will also support opportunities for neighborhood children to learn and grow through baseball
6248907 this project is one of many examples of the chicago cubs longstanding commitment to support our parks and contribute to the quality of life in communities across the city
6248908 were excited to bring this great new stadium for the people of humboldt park
6248909 that community is middle class and poor class and having a stadium like that will have a big impact for them they can feel like theyre in wrigley field hopefully good things come from that ballpark and a good player for the cubs comes from that ballpark
6248910 i need to have a little talk with my bat
6248911 was that even though he wasnt swinging the bat as well as we know he can he has the ability to keep his head in the game he won some games for us with his glove in toronto the way he played second base was off the charts
6248912 were comfortable this guy can handle himself at the big league level were excited about his talent hes multi dimensional offensively he can get a bunt down and hes got power too
6248913 itll be good for him to let his body regroup a little bit and watch a game
6248914 i didnt want them to think we were flippant about their pitchers
6248915 i understand i dont want to see a kid go on the dl anyway not if i have something to do with it
6248916 i said something to george i think it was after an inning and a third can you go back out for another
6248917 he said ill go out all night and he meant it now obviously we werent going to do that but i think he threw 24 25 pitches
6248918 i dont think we were disrespectful or ignorant of him i do understand that now hes on the dl so i called him
6248919 obviously jim johnson is a guy that figures very prominently into getting those opportunities but in all honesty i dont really want to get locked in to naming a closer on this team while sherrill is out
6248920 its fun its a different animal but thats part of pitching later in the game thats when the games on the line thats when you want to be in there
6248921 i think he proved what kind of makeup he had when he came up here earlier in the season
6248922 i think he faced every situation he possibly could for a guy who never pitched out of the bullpen at this level before
6248923 at least the fielding and batting is better than before
6248924 now batting and fielding is about 85 or 90 percent of what it was
6248925 if the pitchers pitch their normal game we expect japan to score four or five runs not 11 a lot of those runs scored on wild pitchers
6248926 players stand near the home plate by their own decision
6248927 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined

6248937 there is no indication of any change in the near future regarding the current state of competition market forces have not yet met the challenge of controlling price increases
6248938 its a problem given that were probably heading into a recession and weve been borrowing extensively

6248945 plm apps are routinely cracked and pirated so are many other high value niche applications
6248946 ive talked to a software vendor who manufactures geology mapping software for oil drilling and every version of their software has been cracked and pirated
6248947 it could be a lead to a var value added reseller who could go in and say its great youre using this software but you need to pay up
6248948 its not easy to flag or reverse engineer our code its different in each implementation
6248949 they only want to do as much work as they need to meanwhile our technology lies dormant during that initial crack cycle

6248951 they were found by a specialist volunteer who helps us clean the statuary in cliveden
6248952 he went to a talk at the local archaeological society given by a snail specialist mentioned his find and it turned out hed spotted the colony which had almost certainly been there since 1896
6248953 it was purchased and brought over from rome by the first viscount astor
6248954 hed been an ambassador in rome and was a great collector the villa borghese in rome which he bought it from now has a copy
6248955 what theyre doing what theyre eating we dont rightly know although its likely theyre feeding on lichen or algae growing on the marble
6248956 but whats important is theyve also been found in two possibly three other places at cliveden so all our eggs are not in one basket from a conservation point of view
6248957 what were seeing now is a clear regrouping and also again some kind of deception campaign saying look were moving out
6248958 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states
6248959 so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6248960 theyve stolen everything theyve bombed everything this is fascism thats what this is
6248961 we cant let a bully do this because if they do it here theyll do it other places and if we dont stop it here well have to stop it in a much more difficult way

6248977 we want our customers to know despite what they see on television or read in the paper that mortgage financing is still available at very competitive rates to average borrowers and that we can help them through the qualification process quickly and easily most mortgage applications can be approved within 48 hours
6248978 currently 1 253 home and business disaster loans have been approved in the amount of 60 455 300 for affected victims
6248979 seems like a pretty major omission for a service thats specifically aimed at roaming users
6248980 mobileme is suppose to be microsoft exchange for the rest of us but microsoft exchange does things in a secure manner
6248981 as it is if you run a business using your mac then you cannot use mobileme because it transmits data insecurely
6248982 i wouldnt say that its a critical issue or something thats a reason not to use the service but its definitely something that should be addressed
6248983 i have a great feeling its a dream come true
6248984 im shocked i have been aspiring to the world record for so long i never expected this i knew the track was a fast track but i didnt think this was possible
6248985 i was worried but i told myself to leave everything on the track
6248986 i had come here to do it and im so happy with myself
6248987 i worked so hard to become the champion and i will work harder to stay on top
6248988 the guy came out and made the best olympics of my lifetime
6248989 to me bolt is like what michael phelps is to swimming
6248990 i dont think his training has been geared to that part yet
6248991 but in a few years it will be and then i will be ready to kiss my record goodbye
6248992 information on the number of people involved is not yet available but spanair is doing everything possible to help the spanish authorities at this difficult time
6248993 sas is doing everything possible to help passengers and next of kin and to assist spanish authorities
6248994 it was beautiful to be back a bit less to be 2 0 down
6248995 there was a little lack of attention in part because while they might not be a great team they have great physical and athletic qualities and they showed them
6248996 then we started to speed things up especially in the second half we fixed the result which is always important
6248997 we went after the win until the end passing the ball around quickly
6248998 it wasnt easy against such a physical side they were very tall they only conceded us the flanks
6248999 its ridiculous how fast can you go before the world record cant be broke how fast can the human
6249000 to bel air someone is to tell them a shaggy dog story supposedly relating to a serious matter and
6249001 akahi and his merry band of monarchists forcibly entered iolani palace on statehood day intending
6249002 moses leading the faithful into a promised land where science proves religion
6249003 if history is any guide dark clouds remain on the horizon
6249004 this just sweeps away all that post zionist poison doesnt it
6249005 if youre not moved by whats going on here then you probably have no heartbeat
6249006 hey yossie did ya catch the cute soldier girl with the blond dreads
6249007 we know we can just wear teams down well play all comers we want to play the champions
6249008 now we must try to go for a miracle against the states
6249009 i think we got this far with our courage but we had our limitations
6249010 if it works in japan it will also work in america
6249011 i want anime companies to offer affordable legal downloads to eliminate the need for fansubbing
6249012 if i was just going to become a transformers girl
6249013 bill pullman is talking about wine the grape has to struggle and the dirt has to be dry for the wine to be good but thats a lovely metaphor for all artists actors painters candlestick makers there needs to be struggle conflict and evolution
6249014 transformers was important and defining for me because it taught me about what kinds of movies i want to make and the kind of actor i want to be and i have a long way to go before i become that actor
6249015 its in independent film where im closer to becoming that actor
6249016 so im going to stick to that world for a while i have to earn my stripes i dont believe in winning the sprint i would prefer to win the marathon so i dodged a bullet there or a robot
6249017 i saw you in such and such and thought you would be great for this
6249018 he was not well liked by anyone on the team
6249019 el avance de las obras cumple realmente con lo programado
6249020 lleva tres meses de gesti n de trabajo efectivo y los plazos se est n cumpliendo de manera que si seguimos a este ritmo en los 30 meses previstos vamos a tener la autov a para transitar desde santo tom a san francisco
6249021 hacia septiembre u octubre del a o 2010 va a quedar habilitada
6249022 en la provincia de santa fe tenemos casi 3 000 kil metros de rutas nacionales y eso lleva a que haya un gran tr nsito desde y hacia provincias y regiones vecinas tanto hacia el noroeste noreste centro y sur
6249023 necesitamos pr cticas cotidianas de manejo responsable y educaci n que es lo que est llevando a cabo la subsecretaria de seguridad vial hebe marcogliese
6249024 al ser una obra nacional significa tambi n el endeudamiento de la naci n con la provincia de santa fe y en el marco del federalismo invertido en el que hoy vivimos resulta muy complejo para santa fe tener autonom a para hacer obras que son vitales para nuestra provincia
6249025 were in the process and if i say anything more than that i guarantee you theres going to be another one of these firestorms
6249026 and so my job in this election is to say i honor his service but i dont honor his policies and i dont honor his politics
6249027 scots irish you know there are a whole bunch of those folks here in virginia alright so yall didnt know but we may be cousins
6249028 let me be very clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6249029 even today with victory in sight over and over hes advocated withdrawal
6249030 hes made these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether american wins or loses
6249031 will be one of those states where we say wow were still up late waiting for new mexico to come in
6249032 barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6249033 positive bio spots that theyve been running the balance of the summer dont appear to be making any significant connection with undecided voters
6249034 when the senate investigated the senator in charge never even called reed to testify and that senator john mccain
6249035 and whos now raising money for mccains campaign ralph reed
6249036 because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like went to jail
6249037 what the obama people are doing is they apparently have developed individual targeted strategies for states and
6249038 its more than ok to just give the change yes
6249039 we hope to raise awareness amongst the very people that need to see our message maybe some of these men have never drawn a link between hardcore pornography and sexual violence
6249040 cbd business association heart of the city recently spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on its big little city marketing campaign however the only advertising queen street is getting at the moment is around a tacky parade potentially its so damaging it could almost be viewed as a form of economic sabotage inflicted by one man for his gain only
6249041 when you look at natural features like grass roads and walls you wonder how those textures would look on a prim
6249042 we expect to use the robotic arm heavily over the next several weeks delivering samples to our instruments and examining trench floors and walls to continue to search for evidence of lateral and vertical variations in soil and ice structures

6249047 angie harmon and jason sehorn are thrilled to announce that they are expecting their third child
6249048 the couple originally denied reports that they were pregnant in an attempt to take back the right to release the joyous news themselves
6249049 anyone who uses digital technology even a cell phone will relate to the performances and exhibitions
6249050 new forms has become the largest new media arts festival on the west coast and has something for everybody
6249051 hay mucho temor al cambio yo creo que es un grave error y cumplo proponiendo las cosas dl 1015 y como dije es un error hist rico no comprenderlo y se condena a un siglo m s de miseria a los campesinos
6249052 claudio era nuestro jugador so ado un delantero de gran nivel lo conocemos y estamos seguros de que ser un buen refuerzo para el werder
6249053 cuando hice este lbum yo ven a de vivir cosas muy intensas como el xito repentino de per blue y una ruptura amorosa demasiado dolorosa entonces cuando termin de grabarlo me sent como se siente la persona al llegar a la orilla despu s de la tormenta
6249054 desde ni a yo iba a las grabaciones estaba metida en ese ambiente
6249055 pero en medio de mi tercer a o me llamaron de per para hacerme una propuesta que interpretara a santa rosa de lima en una obra musical
6249056 la obra fue un xito y una experiencia muy linda para m como artista y como persona
6249057 entonces comenc a cuestionarme cosas por qu estudio jazz cuando tengo una cultura musical inmensa en mi pa s se me ocurri hacer fusiones musicales explorar la m sica criolla regres a texas pero mi coraz n ya estaba en otro lugar
6249058 es un disco que me refleja tal como soy porque me considero una persona de contrastes soy contemplativa y efervescente sentimental pero con un gran sentido del humor y me lo cuestiono todo
6249059 espero un hijo pero no creo en el matrimonio como tal
6249060 many people who would never throw for instance a plastic bag on the ground would go ahead and toss a cigarette butt on the ground and step on it and leave it there
6249061 because theres no nutritional value when an animal eats a cigarette butt or several cigarette butts they feel full and can actually starve to death
6249062 although the news isnt all good this report provides us with an important benchmark
6249063 the data in the report will serve as a baseline that sanctuary staff can use to measure future changes in grays reefs extraordinarily valuable and productive marine ecosystem
6249064 given the ability of rhodactis sp to rapidly reproduce and completely smother reefs managers are now facing the possibility that even with removal of the ship sheer reproductive capacity of r howesii may continue to fuel its spread along the western reef shelf of palmyra
6249065 and roll away smirking at this point im all worked up and its probably a testosterone issue on both our parts that and its before 8 in the morning
6249066 there was nothing unusual happening at this point i just thought i was preparing to turtle under the oncoming wave i remember sitting on my board while still underwater
6249067 i began to feel the glimpse of danger i remember telling myself over and over to stay calm
6249068 i reasoned that my surfboard and my wet suit float and would pop me up above water while i continued to hold my breath and sit on my surfboard underwater i realized that i was not rising and was running out of air in my lungs
6249069 i have done this a million times before i was supposed to pop up by now just stay calm
6249070 the next time you have a bad wipe out what would a couple of breaths of air be worth to you
6249071 for more than a century ichthyologists have thought that pacific and atlantic goliath grouper were the same species and the argument was settled before the widespread use of genetic techniques the genetic data were the key to our finding two species one on each side of the isthmus
6249072 in light of our new findings the pacific goliath grouper should be treated with separate management and conservation strategies
6249073 its a critical time for the vaquita and the mexican government has stepped up to the plate
6249074 the fda has promulgated no regulation concerning the risk posed by mercury in fish or warnings for that risk has adopted no rule precluding states from imposing a duty to warn and has taken no action establishing mercury warnings as misbranding under federal law or as contrary to federal law in any other respect
6249075 were taking sharks out of the water faster than we are putting them back in
6249076 they eliminate the weakest population of fish so the biggest and strongest are the breeding animals
6249077 we used to have a whole series of sharks that could be taken now its reduced to such a point that no one can go shark fishing
6249078 lack of opportunity coupled with the economy thats in the wastebasket means there are no jobs its a very bad situation
6249079 since the u s has helped make china so rich the chinese started living the good life
6249080 the process also doesnt innately kill the animal either they dump a still living shark into the water so it hops around on the bottom and bleeds to death or starves its a real inhumane way to go
6249081 ive spent a lot of time on the water and i can tell you that we just dont see the shark
6249082 there was a big market for shark fin soup so they started cutting every fin off of every shark in the atlantic it seemed
6249083 if you look at record catches of sharks they are going down
6249084 nobodys catching great white sharks over 20 feet they get to be 24 to 25 foot animals were not going to see that again probably
6249085 in some species the meat is worth less because of the high urea content but the sharks have big fins
6249086 fishermen do not like this rule because they can only partially dress at sea and finish at the dock
6249087 but we need the rule for enforcement and its crucial for identification
6249088 these assessments done for amendment 2 showed a need to take action to reduce or eliminate fishing on several sharks species
6249089 these comments from affected fishermen and others were considered carefully when drafting the final rule noaas fisheries service works to minimize the negative affects of regulations on commercial fishermen to the extent possible the magnuson stevenson act requires noaa to rebuild depleted stocks to a level at which they can be sustainably fished this is the main goal of amendment 2 as well
6249090 i dont know if there should be shark fisheries at least not for a while id go even further than what the government has
6249091 the unfortunate part is that the rules effect peoples pay checks in a time when there are problems with the economy
6249092 the way they see it its like sharks are falling off the face of the earth
6249093 theyre not the changes the government made are based on bad science now were out of business we cant operate a vessel with the quotas
6249094 the government doesnt know fishing they put a lot of people in charge of something they dont understand
6249095 we have considered all possibilities and exhausted all possible rescue scenarios and along with other experts in the field we agree the animals suffering should not be prolonged and advocate for a humane outcome
6249096 it is a good thing that people care about animals but in this case we are asking the community to consider the animals welfare first over their own emotional empathy
6249097 the chances of survival for the calf even with human intervention are extremely low
6249098 this animal is approx 4 5 metres long and will weigh around four tonnes so logistically it will be extremely difficult to transport house feed and rehabilitate
6249099 even if the whale were successfully nursed it will have no life skills it wont know how to communicate or socialise with other whales and it wont know how to migrate to antarctica
6249100 a few lads have reported seeing the shark off the pilot pier and as these are experienced anglers they will easily recognise it as it is distinctive as the name suggests
6249101 over recent years we are seeing more of them coming nearer shore for food and thats because they feed off the mackerel shoals
6249102 they must be treated as a threat and are classed as dangerous but have made just 38 recorded attacks on man ever
6249103 the shark may be coming in so close because it is chasing other prey fish which are in turn chasing the mackerel shoals
6249104 they are about as dangerous as an alsatian dog i have dived amongst them without a cage and come to no harm
6249105 about meeting people where theyre at their fears of going hungry or of the thug on the street thats the swamp that needs draining if were to compete with extremism we have to be able to provide these things that were not providing
6249106 this is why obamas advisers argue national security depends in large part on dignity promotion
6249107 its about attacking pools of potential terrorism around the globe
6249108 look at africa with 900 million people half of whom are under 18 im concerned that unless you start creating jobs and livelihoods we will have real big problems on our hands in ten to fifteen years
6249109 social entrepreneurs and leading nonprofit organizations that are assisting schools lifting families out of poverty filling health care gaps and inspiring others to lead change in their own communities
6249110 many credit card companies are tricking americans into agreements they cant afford because thats how they make big profits
6249111 i brought pictures in and presented them to the committee of very premature babies from my neonatal resuscitation book from the american pediatric association trying to show them unwanted babies were being cast aside babies the same age were being treated if they were wanted
6249112 doctors really dont care about children who are being born with a reasonable prospect of life because they are so locked into their pro abortion views that they would watch an infant that is viable die
6249113 that may be your assessment and i dont see any evidence of that what we are doing here is to create one more burden on a woman and i cant support that
6249114 avoid manipulating exchange rates or the international monetary system in order to prevent effective balance of payments adjustment or to gain an unfair competitive advantage over other members

6249117 regarding the partying well you grow up and see the bigger picture
6249118 it takes a lot of hard work and dedication i decided it was time to change not everything only a little
6249119 i just chill i dont try to think too much about the race
6249120 i just relax and try to think about cars or something like that
6249121 i never really doubted i worried a little bit after two years of injuries
6249122 however things changed dramatically when i joined up with glen
6249123 he mills is like a father figure to me he has never done me any wrong and he has always made the right decisions
6249124 he is a guiding light in my career and he has shown me the way to improve myself both as a person and as an athlete
6249125 this is more than i can handle really im a bit overwhelmed i didnt think a 200 metres record was on because i felt tired after the heats
6249126 but i told everyone i was going to come out here and leave everything on the track and i did just that
6249127 hes off life support theres not much you can say its more or less waiting
6249128 a bunch of things have happened in our favour a great athlete the right time zone and interest in china and the event itself people are concerned about the economy and this is a nice relief people like thinking about something other than the credit crunch
6249129 but housing prices are still going down until they stabilise i dont think consumers are going to be the same engine of growth that they have been they just dont feel as rich businesses have to be ready for that
6249130 business is booming here and the job for ge is to go where its growing
6249131 most people see china only through beijing and shanghai but now all these other cities like xinjiang and chengdu are developing these are all chicagos or londons and their infrastructure needs are huge
6249132 clean energy and clean water is a big priority for the government
6249133 im never presumptuous about cultural changes in china or anywhere else but i think there is an awareness of the environment that has been growing inside china that i think the olympics amplify we see it in business in dialogue with steel customers or airlines we want to capitalise on that
6249134 being an olympic sponsor means we can show how we would replicate customer support and services across the country in other venues
6249135 nick diaz will take this fight any place anywhere noons management won t even return our calls i don t understand it this fight on cbs is maximum exposure and the opportunity for maximum sponsorship dollars way more than he could make on showtime at this point i question his management we believe in k j as our champion
6249136 for some reason his camp is not coming straight out and saying no but they are making it very difficult to make it happen his manager doesn t want us talking to him directly who knows what k j even knows about the situation but his management is holding us hostage
6249137 all the americans are doing is paying them just to be quiet
6249138 justify paying monthly salaries to people on the grounds that they are ex insurgents
6249139 you cant get rid of a program by shoveling it on the iraqi government shoulders
6249140 we cannot stand them and we detained many of them recently
6249141 many of them were part of al qaida despite the fact that many of them are helping us to fight al qaida
6249142 if they disband us now i will tell you that history will show we will go back to zero
6249143 i will not give up my weapons i will never give them up and i will carry my weapon again if it is useless to talk to the government i will be forced to carry my weapons and my pistol
6249144 we wish we were part of the army with deep remorse the government is sectarian
6249145 the sons of iraq achieved security dont they deserve to enter the army
6249146 if they only take a portion of them its possible they will return to their insurgent ways
6249147 what were seeing now is a clear regrouping and also again some kind of deception campaign saying look were moving out
6249148 they are going around now and trying to grab new strategic areas in georgia
6249149 we still believe this is not all that this is just a beginning
6249150 dreaming to turn my country into chechnya into some kind of insurgency warfare field where they go around and operate with brutal force
6249151 the last thing im worried about is about my political future right now
6249152 what were seeing now is a clear regrouping and also again some kind of deception campaign saying look were moving out
6249153 they are going around now and trying to grab new strategic areas in georgia

6249174 the consequences to these kids may not be the same in terms of criminal justice but the impact on them is huge because they dont get their degrees

6249176 in the process of weeding it out it got a lot of attention and people may have come to the wrong conclusion that its rampant here

6249190 it is an honor and a privilege for you to cover the new york jets
6249191 but you have an obligation to hold up your end of the bargain by being objective and fair in what you report yet you didnt do that
6249192 the result largely due to mike nugents missed 23 yard fg attempt to tie the game as time expired it hit the left upright along with a 43 yard miss earlier was the only disappointment for the jets
6249193 but it hardly mattered this was all about favres debut and he didnt disappoint
6249194 nosotros hab amos presentado un proyecto que fue aprobado en el recinto denominado r o grande ciudad con valores pero el ejecutivo lo vet con fundamentos verdaderamente pobres aludiendo como siempre a la falta de presupuesto yo creo que a mart n s lo le interesa sacarse la foto y aparecer como el nico promotor de este tipo de proyectos estas contradicciones son las que le hacen mucho mal a la pol tica y a la comunidad en general cuando una idea sale de la oposici n no sirve y se termina impulsando un proyecto similar con bombos y platillos como si fuera de su propia autor a y para el cual pareciera no haber objeciones presupuestarias al parecer ahora s aparecieron los fondos para educar en valores es verdaderamente triste que ocurran este tipo de cosas que se desprecie el trabajo de otros s lo por mediocridad intelectual y pol tica y esto lo perciben los vecinos no se puede esconder finalmente los resultados hablan por s mismos no hay m s que dar un paseo por la ciudad y darse cuenta cu n lejos estamos de vivir en el lugar que r o grande podr a ser si mart n tuviese la capacidad y la generosidad de mirar un cent metro m s all del monedero en esta ciudad no hay desde hace a os pol ticas serias de crecimiento integral por pura incapacidad y mezquindad de algunos funcionarios municipales a esta altura creo muy dif cil que esto cambie lo que est claro es que este modelo de hacer pol tica est agotado y solo es cuesti n de tiempo para que la sociedad elija una alternativa que encare la gesti n local desde otra perspectiva y con una manera distinta de hacer las cosas

6249216 touch screens are becoming much more popular because they are easier to operate in future the keyboard and mouse will eventually be phased out we are seeing a slow down in consumer spending the market is not good and people dont want to spend as much money
6249217 as a result we are bringing out more products and expanding on what products we can offer to counteract the market people want something that is different that they dont already see on the market our aim is to become a one stop shop for our customers
6249218 it is good for choice a good price and we offer a good service we have a free range service on choice because we can adapt the product according to what the customer wants
6249219 there are not many manufacturers making them at the moment but we think they are a sign of the times because in the future everything will be touch screen from in the home such as in the kitchen or the bathroom to banks hotel chains and shops
6249220 pe mine ma si avantajeaza daca vorbesc acum cinic faptul ca un astfel de personaj mona musca n r candideaza in continuare in dreptul pdl ne permite sa spunem ca pdl este un partid nesincer oportunist care a capturat tema luptei impotriva comunismului si a securitatii de o maniera foarte oportunista

6249228 nu stiu despre cine este vorba sa vina totusi la noi cu o oferta
6249229 noi am dat anunturi ne am aratat interesati de a achizitiona carbune dar nu a venit vom discuta conditiile cerute in cadrul unei sedinte a consiliului de administratie
6249230 domnul buhac s a laudat si cu alte ocazii ca poate aduce carbune si nu a facut o sa vina totusi cu o oferta concreta si scrisori de garantie nu cu vorbe

6249245 a petrol tank with about 1000 litres of petrol caught fire
6249246 the concern everyone had was trying to stop the fire spreading to the nearby buildings
6249247 the settlers try to frighten people and make them leave
6249248 the israeli authorities deny it but with the cameras we can prove what happens and force them to do their jobs
6249249 the idea is to give palestinians the technology and know how to document the reality of their lives thereby exposing human rights violations and the reaction or non reaction of the israeli authorities
6249250 the defense minister called it a very serious and unusual incident
6249251 but btselems point is that this is not unusual mistreatment of detainees is very common
6249252 its unlikely they will be able to get a prosecution and conviction on the basis of this footage but it was clear that spurred the police to act

6249255 before the intifada we were allowed to use about 80 percent of our land
6249256 da vinci provides a means to overcome both the challenges presented by advanced pathology and the surgical limitations of conventional laparoscopy it does this by providing surgeons with improved precision and dexterity coupled with advanced imaging which allows for the completion of complex minimally invasive procedures in a fashion analogous to open surgery
6249257 i can operate with greater precision and control which is especially valuable with more complex pathology such as enlarged pelvic adhesions or endometriosis
6249258 with da vinci i can discern the tissue planes more easily and perform more difficult dissections which enables me to offer minimally invasive surgery to more of my patients
6249259 after youve become comfortable with the system operative times for the da vinci cases are comparable to that of open procedures and based upon recent data 3 can even be faster than conventional laparoscopy
6249260 while more complex cases take longer i routinely perform a simple benign hysterectomy in 60 minutes
6249261 and with new robotic instruments being introduced specific to gyn applications uterine fibroids procedures are becoming even easier and quicker to perform
6249262 having used ue3 to build grimm and spent considerable time in the past working with id s tools i ve followed this story with amazement
6249263 to expect a licensed engine fresh out of the box would require no modification or improvements to achieve development goals on a new title is ludicrous
6249264 but to build an entirely new engine as an alternative to improving an existing one sounds a bit unreasonable and to build that new engine inside 1 year then ship a title with it now things are starting to sound surreal
6249265 my guess is that there s more than a little ue3 still in too human
6249266 if downstream brokerages deliberately stuck their heads in the sand but continued to actively market these products to unknowing investors that will certainly be relevant to our calculus of the firms culpability
6249267 these firms are licensed broker dealers and were obviously well paid by their clients for their specialized knowledge and diligence regarding the appropriateness of various products as investments
6249268 you cant grab your food you cant grab your tv grab what you can and go
6249269 i had no idea what it looked like out there until today

6249272 theyre probably areas of the state that found the rains very beneficial
6249273 the fact is that theyre not plummeting this morning as the headlines would have it theyve plummeted already and now theyre fluctuating at levels modestly around zero since no one really has much of an idea what the option value of the shares might be
6249274 while prince william countys recent efforts to have everyone down to the local librarian checking patrons immigration status may have seemed extreme to some ideas now circulating in herndon border on the absurd confiscating bicycles chained to trees or signposts revoking abc licenses of some businesses and removing pay phones these measures would affect all residents not just day laborers as the main reason that the laborers are in herndon is for work the proposals also seem unlikely to meet the councils goal of chasing the laborers out of town
6249275 they come here to do the jobs americans wont do
6249276 i can just tell you fairfax county is not going to go the route of some of our neighbors were not going to demagogue were not going to essentially roll back the welcome mat

6249278 conform legii nu aveti nevoie de aprobare de la cet ca sa faceti debransarea ci doar de cea a asociatiei de proprietari si dovada ca nu aveti datorii la intretinere
6249279 pot face debransarea fara nici o problema si fizic doar sa aveti aprobarea asociatiei de proprietari veniti la firma si discutati cu crina si va lamureste
6249280 in ce zona locuiti veniti la firma cu o schita de la apartament si facem un calcul
6249281 v am spus sa veniti la firma daca sinteti interesat veniti la firma

6249283 fiecare om are dreptul sa si aleaga sistemul de incalzire dar sa o faca legal noi nu putem face nimic oamenii vin cu documentatii incomplete pe care noi nu le putem aproba pentru ca nu este respectata legislatia asociatiile de proprietari sint insa de acord
6249284 pregatim un material in acest sens care peste o luna va fi prezentat la primarie vom cauta ca printr o hotarire de consiliu local cei care sint in neregula sa poata fi sanctionati cei care se debranseaza trebuie sa respecte in primul rind prevederile legii 325 2006 privind serviciul public de alimentare cu energie termica si ordinul anrsc 91 2007 privind regulamentul cadru al serviciului public de alimentare cu energie termica

6249289 as we look to expand the ea sports brand and captivate sports fans from around the world with rich new interactive experiences it was obvious that the renaissance were seeing in the sport of tennis provides us with a big opportunity
6249290 our new tennis franchise coming first to the wii will put fans right into the action and provide the excitement tension and drama that true champions feel in legendary matches like the classic from wimbledon just last month
6249291 this is an ambitious and completely unique feature that has never been attempted before for football videogames
6249292 the game will feel and play differently each week with adidas live season if ronaldinho has a great match on the weekend youll feel the difference when you pick up the controller as his in game attributes increase

6249298 la toti este vorba de consum de canabis cred ca au acces mai usor la el si este drogul cu pretul cel mai accesibil
6249299 cei mai multi au inceput sa fumeze canabis prin strainatate in spania sau italia chiar daca deocamdata nu sint dependenti noi incercam sa ii facem sa constientizeze ca riscurile sint mai mari decit cred ei si sa ii convingem ca la iesirea din penitenciar sa nu se reapuce sau sa treaca la alte droguri mai puternice
6249300 cei mai multi spun ca au inceput cu droguri asa zise usoare pentru ca oricum toate au un risc sau iau tusin cu alcool au inceput fie din cauza anturajului fie pentru ca le a spus un prieten sa incerce fie pentru ca au probleme de comunicare cu parintii depinde insa de informare si de slabiciunile fiecaruia
6249301 moldova nu aduce heroino dependeti la noi la socola cei mai multi dintre cei internati sint din sudul tarii doar la inceputul anului am avut doi heroino dependenti dar acestia erau persoane din strainatate
6249302 george bushs record as a student military man businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure and the part that troubles me most is he seems content with himself he will leave office with the country 10 trillion in debt fighting two wars our international reputation in shambles our government cloaked in secrecy and suspicion that his entire presidency has been a litany of broken laws and promises our citizens faith in our own country ripped to shreds yet bush goes bumbling along grinning and spewing moronic one liners as though nobody understands what a colossal failure he has been i fear to the depth of my being that john mccain is just like him
6249303 ms taylor i drive daily on macarthur blvd and it happens to me all the time i dont disagree with mr arundel deborah deborah howell washington post ombudsman
6249304 i am writing specifically about a letter to the editor titled
6249305 ive spent a large part of my career at united the last nine years and ill remember that time fondly but feel im ready for a new challenge
6249306 arsenal is known for playing technical and skilful football and has a young but experienced squad
6249307 im really excited about this next stage of my career hopefully playing my part in helping the club to new successes
6249308 we have a strong squad but a young squad and mikaels versatility experience and calibre will provide the extra depth we need to reinforce our challenge for honours this season
6249309 his defensive adaptability will serve us well and its a big plus that mikael has top level experience and a great understanding of football in the premier league
6249310 im sure johnny cash would have been a john mccain supporter if he was still around
6249311 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so
6249312 i knew my father pretty well at least better than some of those who entitle themselves to his legacy and his supposed ideals and even i would not presume to say publicly what i know he thought or felt
6249313 in contrast to piezoelectric actuators that typically deflect or move a fraction of a micrometer comb drives can deflect tens to hundreds of micrometers and unlike conventional comb drives which only move in one direction our new device can move in two directions left to right forward and backward an advance that could really open up the door for many applications
6249314 twenty nanometers is about the size of 200 atoms so if you are scanning for a particular molecule it may be hard to find
6249315 with our design the higher atomic scale resolution should make it easier to find
6249316 this is a proof of concept the technology im developing should allow researchers to practically and efficiently extract dozens of geometric and material properties of their microdevices just by electronically probing changes in capacitance or voltage
6249317 sugar is fast and allows me to easily try out many design ideas
6249318 after i narrow down to a particular design i then use finite element analysis for fine tuning finite element analysis is slow but it is able to model subtle physical phenomena that sugar doesnt do as well
6249319 we have options on our set situations and more options when it comes to positions
6249320 they are sponges and just trying to absorb information they are making adjustments session every and thats all we can ask for
6249321 we have an inquisitive group that is very engaging that is so important in learning and having all of us be on the same page
6249322 we had a chance to see some combinations and had some questions answered today
6249323 ideally we would like to see every athlete play two positions and we got to try some of that out we need more practice on our set situations but we also havent done a lot of those yet now we can start specializing those to some degree
6249324 my pleasure maybe you can buy me a drink later
6249325 but as you can see we are very busy tonight and there wont be a free table until 9 30
6249326 it looks like im going to be your white knight for a second time today
6249327 this dress has a bugger of a catch could you unfasten it for me please
6249328 dont worry theres more where that came from itll just need a little rest
6249329 its obvious but i just havent said it yet billy stull has had an outstanding camp
6249330 the guy has played smart hes made good decisions with the football and hes thrown the football very accurately hes shown great leadership skills and hell be the starter on opening day
6249331 it feels awesome but im just glad that i was able to prove to the coaches myself and my teammates that ive earned the spot again
6249332 its out in the open and now im ready to move on to bowling green
6249333 oh her anal glands are full thats probably why shes been licking back there
6249334 you are an idiot there will not be a summer
6249335 nu stiu daca problema tine de prefectura sau de primarie dar va rog faceti ceva cu bucata de drum pina la terasa breazu pur si simplu iti rupi masina in doua prin gropile de acolo dupa ce mergi numai cu viteza intii cam 800 de metri ajungi la zona de agrement am vazut ca in urma cu doua luni s au adus citeva gramezi de piatra cubica probabil pentru a se efectua reparatii dar carutasii din zona si au incarcat carutele cu piatra asa ca nu a mai ramas mare lucru faceti ceva cu bucata asta de drum va rog
6249336 this news has come as a great shock to everyone including it seems his own wife and family
6249337 michael has confirmed that he is not suffering with a terminal illness and is seeking professional help in adelaide with the support of his family we are asking our church to pray for the guglielmucci family during this difficult time
6249338 the national executive is taking this matter very seriously and is awaiting the results of medical tests before determining the full extent of the discipline that will be imposed upon him
6249339 we are very concerned for the many people who have been or will be hurt by michaels actions
6249340 we encourage all of our churches to pray for all those affected
6249341 what good for which beneficiaries at what cost to the organization
6249342 you are an idiot there will not be a summer
6249343 we suspect there is a correlation people who were thinking of having a family but were waiting and saving intending to buy a house first have decided its too hard and have decided to rent and have a baby anyway
6249344 its speculative but people have had to save longer for a house
6249345 well pass it as and when we can muster the majority for it and i would hope that would be before the election
6249346 there are about three or four weeks of sitting days before the election and we need about three or four days to put the bill through its remaining stages
6249347 we have time if we can get agreement by the time parliament resumes
6249348 too soon to know whether the greens can support the legislation
6249349 we want the bill to go down even though the price goes up
6249350 under the current tax regime it does not make financial sense to transfer retirement savings back to new zealand in fact for an individual with a balance of 100 000 over 20 years you could be up to 36 000 better off if you leave superannuation savings in australia
6249351 our modelling is from a conservative basis and errs in new zealands favour but it still confirms with new zealands current tax regime that leaving the money in australia would provide a better financial return
6249352 after five months of digging and re digging to see what else they could obtain they had to return to the original allegations
6249353 i wouldve expected some urgency actually it was quite a shock for us that the water was up already to just under a metre
6249354 its risen since the last time we dug a grave down there
6249355 weve put up with a lot of development out our way but this is the last straw
6249356 they had a tangi on and i was actually really concerned about the grave site filling up with water
6249357 there wouldve been quite a bit of water in there within an hour and it wouldnt have been a good look
6249358 i dont know whos going to pay for it but i would like to see a beautiful stone wall constructed around the edge of the urupa and i would like it filled up with topsoil so that the graves have a certain amount of soil over them because it has certainly washed away it has reduced considerably
6249359 everybodys saying its not their problem and you have to contact such and such and when weve contacted them basically nobody wants to know you thats the part that really revs you up
6249360 what concerns me is theyve had qualified consultants and engineers come right along that creek
6249361 we have got a place set up for students to receive support we have been in touch with mental health services and crisis teams have been put in place for all students
6249362 counsellors are spending time with boys and we have set up an area this week
6249363 we have about 70 to 80 boys going to the funeral
6249364 suicide is still an incredibly rare event when you get a little cluster sometimes its just out of the blue
6249365 most of these deaths sit at 21 to 24 year olds
6249366 one of the key messages is that you can seek help
6249367 were advised to give it to the medalist as a gift
6249368 the fuselage is destroyed the plane burned i have seen a kilometer of charred land and few whole pieces of the fuselage it is all destruction
6249369 we want to be on location there are many questions
6249370 any dates in an agreement will be based on conditions on the ground because we do not want to lose the hard fought gains of the surge
6249371 we have given ours the other side has given theirs

6249389 even though nascar has given us that number for next year if mr mcclure is going to run a car were excited to have him back in the series so we wanted him to have his number
6249390 as a fellow car owner i know how important that would be to me so we wanted to make sure that hes got his number back for next year with the word that hes going to be running some races next year

6249396 americans are anxious theyre worried about the present and theyre worried about the future
6249397 but understand its happening everywhere in southern ohio in southern illinois

6249636 si bien todos nosotros somos como suciedad y todas nuestras justicias como trapo de inmundicia y ca mos todos nosotros como la hoja y nuestras isa as 64 6 inclusive lo que para nosotros nos parece moralmente justo y ticamente correcto para dios es una cosa sucia como un trapo inmundo con el cual no se puede limpiar ning n pecado y mucho menos justificar a ning n ser humano debemos reconocer que en el fondo muchas de las buenas obras que creemos hacer en realidad no son motivadas por un deseo de agradar a dios sino que tienen una motivaci n menos noble cu ntas veces le hemos dado algo a alguien por obtener alguna cosa o esperar que esa persona nos devuelva el favor cu ntas veces hemos puesto algunas monedas en la mano de un mendigo s lo para acallar nuestra conciencia por ser m s afortunados o porque alguien nos est viendo cu ntas veces hemos visto una necesidad real y sencillamente hemos cerrado nuestros ojos ahora bien si nuestras buenas obras son malas entonces qu ser n nuestras malas obras es precisamente por esto que muchas personas no se acercan a dios condenaci n que la luz vino al mundo jesucristo y los hombres amaron m s las tinieblas que la luz porque sus obras eran malas porque todo aquel que hace lo malo aborrece la luz y no viene a la luz para que sus obras no sean reprendidas
6249637 ciertamente no hay hombre justo en la tierra que haga el bien
6249638 porque por gracia sois salvos por medio de la fe y esto no de vosotros pues es don de dios no por obras para que nadie se glor e

6249645 se hizo en tiempos de monse or samuel ruiz y es una biblia ecum nica es decir hecha entre diferentes confesiones cristianas
6249646 para nosotros es muy importante que la palabra de dios nos una en vez de que sea una causa de divisi n entre cat licos y protestantes
6249647 es un ejemplo de que s se puede avanzar en la unidad a veces nos encontramos algunas confesiones cristianas muy fundamentalistas y muy contrarias a buscar la unidad y en cambio sucede al rev s con el pastor abner l pez y con la sociedad b blica de m xico
6249648 hemos encontrado un ambiente cordial y de respeto de saber valorar nuestras diferencias pero sobre todo de trabajar juntos para que la palabra de dios llegue en los idiomas de los pueblos ind genas

6249867 i might consider a draft i dont think its necessary but i might consider it if you could design a draft where everybody equally would serve

6249925 there are many many more latinos here than when we opened
6249926 we need a serious study because the census tells you nothing about the undocumented population
