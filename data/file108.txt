1080119 in the past week my leadership role in the political environment of dominica has been the subject of national attention on account of a highly politicized attorney client matter in my legal practice
1080120 this issue has raised questions about the leadership of the united workers party and its capacity for self correction at a time when the nation is diligently searching for solutions to the integrity crisis that engulfs our government
1080121 nonetheless this is not a united workers party matter and it is only fair that in accepting full responsibility for it i ensure that the partys mission to rescue dominica from the social and economic degradation is not adversely impacted by events in my legal and or private life
1080122 in the circumstances i have decided to resign as leader of the opposition in parliament and political leader of the uwp the president of dominica and the secretary of the uwp have been advised accordingly
1080123 let me take the opportunity to express sincere thanks to my family members friends colleagues in the uwp and in particular my beloved supporters in the salisbury constituency during this period
1080124 i am confident that when all of the details are eventually revealed i will be vindicated
1080125 i deeply regret the circumstance that have necessitated my decision to step down and while i leave with a heavy heart rest assured that as someone who has always placed the national interest above selfish personal interest i am duty bound to honor the wishes of the people of my constituency and will therefore remain their devoted servant in the nations parliament

1080150 the uk has massively overstated its reduction in carbon emissions say two new reports which cast a harsh light on britains environmental policy
1080151 government claims of reduced emissions are based on calculations which exclude significant contributing factors to global warming the reports read
1080152 if aviation shipping and the importing of goods are factored into the calculations uk greenhouse emissions are actually 49 per cent higher than reported
1080153 that means uk emissions have actually risen since the 1990s contrary to government claims both reports are by the stockholm environment institute sei in the university of york

1080178 okay i finally get why deron williams has it in for chris paul
1080179 williams is positively paul ian hes got that jordan esque kobe esque indignation and will to destroy that people jock so hard in paul when hes pissed or increasingly whenever he decides the game belongs to him williams does shit on offense thats every bit as phenomenal as cp3s streaking drives as a passer too he gets more and more brazen as these playoffs go on making plays with little or no regard to the logical order of that line up
1080180 the bottom line of it is not that williams detests being second best though thats part of it he also cant stand that pauls seen as a transcendent talent while because of his size and system hes denied that superstar aura for too long williams was seen as having a natural advantage over paul and also inhabiting a controlled situation that supposedly played to his strengths he had it better and yet was best when limited no more no more williams seems to be moving faster feeling more and going for the jugular now like hes out to prove that pauls not the only one on the fast track to immortality i joked about this on deadspin but now im convinced its for real its almost enough to make me want to see hornets jazz in the next round even though on a sentimental level id prefer to see kobe and odom advance

1080219 in the mid to late 90s there were a lot of music fans out there like myself that picked up on the internet long before the music industry ever took it seriously now many of the labels out there are still trying to catch up and with cd sales on the decline and digital sales on the rise the industry knows that it has to stay on top of any new technology or trend if it wants to survive
1080220 as far as my dolly site goes i consider myself very blessed because the work ive done over the years has been very well received by both fellow fans and dollys people ever since the site started ive been able to connect with hundreds of fans around the world many of which have helped contribute to the site
1080221 it all started out of just loving dolly parton and her music and i think its the same for anybody who runs any kind of fan site
1080222 theres never been a more exciting time to be a music fan especially if youre digitally inclined fan sites are a unique way for fans to not only pay tribute to their favorite artists but to actually help promote their work and possibly make some money at the same time i think anytime a fan can help increase the exposure of an artist its a good thing to look back and know that i was able to play an active role in promoting music that i love is really exciting
1080223 thats just crazy i dont know what they are thinking theyll never get any kids to go along with that
1080224 youll have to make some tough choices m amp ms or god sour straws or jesus a crunch bar or baby jesus in a manger choose wisely

1080241 here are just five of many interesting testimonials ive had from my customers
1080242 we take pride in making quick decisions that benefit our patients and families
1080243 passages hospice is a relatively small company with a big heart our team is trained to listen well to wishes expressed by patients and their families we then do everything we can to help make that goal a reality hospice is all about cherishing life in whatever remaining time is allotted to each person as an organization we strive to do whatever we can to support patients in achieving those goals they have set for themselves
1080244 recently one of our patients recalled to me how much he loved watching cubs games as a kid
1080245 growing up he lived close to wrigley field and could walk to games all summer long so hes been a huge baseball fan his entire life whether it was watching his grandchildren play ball or following the major leagues then he expressed his dream to see the cubs play again at wrigley field accompanied by his two grown sons although this patient is on continuous oxygen and would also require a wheelchair i just knew i had to do whatever i could to get him three tickets to a cubs game
1080246 i only made one phone call and instantly had three tickets later i found out from co workers just how lucky this was i had no preconceived ideas that obtaining cubs tickets would be difficult
1080247 i was really excited at the chance to go to the ballpark with my sons it was a dream come true as a youngster i grew up near diversey amp damen and could walk to wrigley field and watch the games all summer ive always loved the cubs and this was a great surprise
1080248 with a life limiting illness the patient and their families are stressed and drained because of so much focus on the persons illness however when a cherished goal is shared and the plans are put into motion for achieving it everyones outlook lifts and good feelings come flooding back in it is great to be a part of that dynamic change for the better
1080249 our staff becomes like a surrogate family member because of the amount of time we spend with our patients and their families
1080250 during our frequent visits we take the time needed to learn about their individual and personal preferences
1080251 when people express their desires such as for a favorite food and share why it shifts them to a happier time a happier moment
1080252 suddenly they are focusing on something that brings enjoyment and often we can supply it to them quickly
1080253 were taking the spotlight off the life limiting illness and instead encouraging the patients capabilities
1080254 id like to spend my 61st birthday dinner at a nearby steakhouse
1080255 plus i am so grateful to passages for arranging this for me obviously i dont get out much anymore and this was a wonderful treat
1080256 hospice patients have goals too just like the rest of us theres still life in a person who has a life limiting illness and our staff is dedicated to finding that special something that will make a big difference meeting patients needs in body mind and spirit is what hospice is all about and its what passages strives to deliver every day

1080283 samd be mad with you if you made yourself sick just cos you were worried about her
1080284 ill call tealc huh he can take you to the commissary what dyou say to that
1080285 ill be with her all the time she wont be alone and deetie
1080286 shes gonna be fine i swear to you its just her shoulder
1080287 well okay but not for long you need your sleep too
1080288 you stay here with me until cassie comes then you two can spend the night in our quarters after all
1080289 sam and i arent going to sleep there tonight sams not going anywhere and i think ill spend the night in here just in case she gets nightmares
1080290 thought you might like this if youre staying with carter for a while
1080291 her shoulders been seriously compromised again though so were trying to get a hold of jacob so he can use the healing device but shes not in any danger
1080292 i thought maybe you and deetie could spend the night in our quarters you should find most of what you need in there though youll probably have to wear sams pajamas hon i think mine may be a bit small for you these days
1080293 what about you mom you cant spend the whole night in that chair
1080294 dont you worry about me i just dont want to leave her cass you know how she can get with morphine shes had a bad enough day as it is
1080295 i thought she was supposed to be on desk duty anyway
1080296 it was less than an hour at the beta site its all the fault of some jerk who input the wrong information into the dialing computer the mission itself was a piece of cake
1080297 dont worry honey your uncle jacks going to see hes punished for his stupidity and if he doesnt i will hes not going to get away with it
1080298 i know sweetie and im sorry were trying to get your dad back here the mri showed that the damage is significant but if we can just get your dad to give you a few blasts with the healing device
1080299 shes okay but the pains bad i think the bruisings really coming out she did a real number on it this time i dont suppose youve had any luck with getting in contact with jacob
1080300 no joy there yet im afraid but the little guys on it he likes carter hes doing all he can
1080301 why dont you two go get some breakfast you can come back later
1080302 i just realized what a crazy world this is deetie thats all cmhere
1080303 what did janet mean when she said she thought she could find a way to fix sam up real quick i didnt really understand that
1080304 she said shed tell me all about him soon but she hasnt yet
1080305 shes had too many other things to show you ill bet
1080306 well her dads called jacob carter and he does live a very long way away but he visits regularly and he loves sam in fact
1080307 he and sam have got on a lot better in the last few years they didnt have the best relationship for a while but its all good now
1080308 i think they kind of drifted apart but theyre real close now despite being so far away from each other does that make sense deetie
1080309 well it gets a bit more complicated you know about the goauld
1080310 youve been spending too much time with uncle jack deet yes i do mean the snake heads i suppose well theres a special branch of snake heads who are good guys they dont like the goauld and fight against them theyre called the tokra theyve got snakes in their heads too but they are happy about it and they live happily side by side so a tokra is basically two souls in one body are you following
1080311 but the tokra snakes are good and they are fighting for peace and happiness sams dad jacob used to be an ordinary human like you or me but then he got sick real sick and the only way to save him was to give him a snake the tokra call them symbiotes they can cure illnesses so he blended with selmak a tokra so now he and selmak live together in the same body
1080312 but she was so pleased that her dad got better and now she really likes selmak too i think sometimes
1080313 that selmak and sam tease jacob a bit selmaks got a really good sense of humor
1080314 well its quite simple deet theyve got different voices and very different personalities so its all obvious youll understand when you meet him
1080315 because thats the thing you see the tokra have a very special skill using a healing device they can make people feel much better when theyre sick or injured
1080316 because the tokra are big enemies of the goauld they have to stay hidden from them so we never know where they are but sams got some good friends out in the galaxy and theyre all trying to track jacob down i dont think itll be long deetie
1080317 well it may take a few goes with the device but yes she should be
1080318 not yet dita and dont let my dad hear you call him a snake head hes a tokra you dont want to make him mad
1080319 sore as hell but im okay dad how are you
1080320 im good sam great in fact certainly compared to you were going to fix that
1080321 youll be back in fighting form in no time anise is bringing the healing device shell be another hour or so weve modified the device recently so its more effective but shes making some final adjustments shes coming as soon as its ready i couldnt wait though i wanted to see my kid
1080322 and ive been wanting to see you for ages theres a very good reason for that dad id like you to meet someone very special to me this
1080323 is perdita shes part of the family we met on a mission and she agreed to come back with me
1080324 well ill bet shed never seen you cook when she said yes
1080325 theres nothing wrong with my cooking its just a little unorthodox sometimes
1080326 your cookings not unorthodox your cookings lethal but perdita looks like shes survived so i can only surmise that janets still in charge of the kitchen hello perdita
1080327 this is jacob youll like him he can be a bit of a grumpy old man sometimes but hes a teddy bear really
1080328 but hes in there and hell want to meet you too
1080329 as much as a symbiote can have a gender and youre right cassandra i think shell like perdita though thats all youre right about i am not a grumpy old man
1080330 you just hold on to me if theres anything you dont like well leave itll be fine i promise
1080331 i am delighted to make your acquaintance and cassandras right jacob can be a very grumpy old man but im training him slowly and hes much better than he used to be
1080332 why dont you cass dad and selmak go to the commissary for some cake you can get to know each other for a bit while we wait for anise to arrive
1080333 and then send jacob back in on his own sam needs a break honey
1080334 i think it was all a bit much for her the sooner you start to heal her the better
1080335 dyou think you can take those off without waking her
1080336 no not a chance in hell but thats okay she can sleep afterwards sam
1080337 your dads back hon and hes got the healing device i just need to get you unwrapped so hes knows what hes working with
1080338 this is going to take a few sessions sam but we should be able to do it i think ill let sel take over i think we need the experts in on this one

1080347 in the last 6 olympic games there had been an average 19 12 increase in the hosting countries stock indexes in the six months following the games in the 12 month after the olympics the stock indexes had a strong 26 14 average increase
1080348 these factors caused the increase on the stock market 6 months after the sporting event
1080349 the infrastructure construction system establishment and environmental protection among others for the olympics gave a lasting boost to the hosting countries economy therefore although gdp growth in those hosting countries showed a certain degree of slow down generally speaking the hosting countries economy maintained a relatively high speed of growth whats more the reduction of bubbles in the post olympics capital market has typically ensured steady and benign growth history clearing indicates that the lasting winner of the beijing olympics will be the beijing economy

1080357 i think we should be in a post racial environment
1080358 i think sen barack obama has done an admirable job of that i dont think he has race baited i think he has been very good about that
1080359 according to the book of revelations the anti christ is the anti christ will be a man in his 40s of muslim descent who will deceive the nations with persuassive language and have a massive christ like appeal the prophecy says that people will flock to him and he will promise false hope and world peace and when he is in power will destory everything is it obama

1080367 i thought anthony randolph changed the game with his energy level in the second half he showed great hustle and had some blocked shots
1080368 i thought his energy level and how he played the second half changed the game for us

1080371 and senate republicans have no idea what to do about it
1080372 as for the big picture i think its fair to say the republicans culture of corruption hasnt been front page news for a while but it hasnt gone away either
1080373 today i am encouraging voters who have filed out any of these voter registration forms to immediately contact their registrars and virginians should exercise caution when approached by a stranger who asks them for their information

1080382 it appears that what brought him to this horrible event was his lack of being able to obtain a job his frustration over that and his stated hatred for the liberal movement

1080395 i am not sure that there is going to be some immediate political impact
1080396 i wouldnt even be surprised if that in some polls that you saw a little bit of a dip as a consequence we have been out of the country for a week people are worried about gas prices and home foreclosures
1080397 while no election outcome is guaranteed and mccains prospects could improve over the next 3 1 2 months virtually all of the evidence that we have reviewed historical patterns structural features of this election cycle and national and state polls conducted over the last several months point to a comfortable obama democratic party victory in november
1080398 trumpeting this race as a toss up almost certain to produce another nail biter finish distorts the evidence and does a disservice to readers and viewers who rely upon such punditry
1080399 again maybe conditions will change in mccains favour and if they do they should also be accurately described by the media but current data do not justify calling this election a toss up
1080400 john mccain complaining about media coverage is a little like an oil company complaining about profit margins
1080401 hard to believe and even harder to feel much sympathy
1080402 americas election 08 barack obamas nearly inevitable march to the white house
1080403 people of berlin people of the world this is our moment this is our time
1080404 a political speech or a speech that maybe the german people would be interested in but id much prefer to do it as president of the united states rather than as a candidate for the office of presidency

1080407 this is a clear choice that the american people have i had the courage and the judgment to say i would rather lose a political campaign than lose a war it seems to me that obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1080408 i cant remember a more scurrilous statement by a major party candidate it smacks of desperation it renews questions about whether mccain has the right temperament for the presidency how sad
1080409 today he says never again a year ago stopping genocide wasnt a good enough reason to keep u s forces in iraq doesnt that strike you as inconsistent
1080410 i know mccain brought in roves team to run the show but his campaign operation is getting ugly
1080411 a lot of oil spills occurred on those oil platforms
1080412 not so not so dont let em give you that baloney there were none
1080413 were about telling the truth on this network and thats why we want you to come back
1080414 senate republicans have dropped the arctic national wildlife refuge from their energy policy discussions focusing instead on persuading democrats to lift a moratorium on offshore drilling
1080415 if we were to drill today realistically speaking we should not expect a barrel of oil coming out of this new resource for three years maybe even five years so lets not kid ourselves
1080416 were going to look at this barren arctic desert where im hoping to see some wildlife
1080417 boehner would likely be less skeptical if he just visited the u s fish and wildlife services website for the the arctic national wildlife refuge which notes that it is renowned for its wildlife and is inhabited by 45 species of land and marine mammals 36 species of fish and 180 species of birds view photos of some of the wildlife here
1080418 as for offshore drilling its safe enough these days that not even hurricanes katrina and rita could cause significant spillage from the battered rigs off the coasts of new orleans and houston
1080419 well he says hes a christian but not any kind of christian my church accepts real christians interpret the bible the same way i do
1080420 oh my freakin god oh sweet jesus were all gonna die
1080421 if you think of missile defense not as a military project but as a corporate picnic it begins to make perfect sense
1080422 they spent 75 billion on star wars and got nowhere fifty nobel laureates felt compelled to sign a statement declaring the whole thing insane
1080423 effective missile defenses are critical to protect america from rogue regimes like north korea that possess the capability to target america with intercontinental ballistic missiles from outlaw states like iran that threaten american forces and american allies with ballistic missiles and to hedge against potential threats from possible strategic competitors like russia and china
1080424 effective missile defenses are also necessary to allow american military forces to operate overseas without being deterred by the threat of missile attack from a regional adversary
1080425 we have to have a prompt resolution to these matters
1080426 t hats the issue the executive branch is struggling with
1080427 the u s government is blocking the american civil liberties union from paying attorneys representing suspected terrorists held here insisting that the aclu must first receive a license from the u s treasury department before making the payments
1080428 had tribunal hearings but none was able to submit testimony from witnesses outside the detention facility

1080432 when i am commander in chief there will be nowhere the terrorists can run and nowhere they can hide
1080433 what is needed what can best be done what must be done
1080434 as president i will pursue a tough smart and principled national security strategy one that recognizes that we have interests not just in baghdad but in kandahar and karachi in tokyo and london in beijing and berlin

1080436 barack obama believes in the constitution hes a constitutional scholar i believe that he will have a better chance to look at these powers that have been given to the executive branch even though hell be running the executive branch
1080437 i think he will understand and help take the lead in fixing some of the worst provisions
1080438 well im going to let this go through but that doesnt mean im going to give the telecoms a pass
1080439 it was a move aimed at ingratiating the shiite ruling majority in baghdad with the man they expect to win the november presidential election
1080440 the matter was taken up at a meeting of iraqs national security council on thursday on the recommendation of mr maliki who had been advised by the iraqi politician ahmad chalabi to express public support for the obama withdrawal plan

1080500 assuming that positive developments continue this is about the same time period that corresponds to our wishes
1080501 iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki told a german magazine he supported prospective u
1080502 exploit obamas position on the war to force the bush administration into accepting concessions considered unthinkable a few months ago
1080503 i come to the floor to talk about why we need a timeframe for the withdrawal of u s troops from iraq
1080504 i dont mean a rigid timetable nor do i mean a timetable that isnt connected to clear and achievable benchmarks what we need is a public flexible realistic timetable that will tell people when and how we expect to finish the military mission in iraq
1080505 his domestic politics require him to be for us getting out
1080506 the military says conditions based and maliki said conditions based yesterday in the joint statement with bush regardless voters care about the military not about iraqi leaders
1080507 we dont care about the iraqi government were going to do what we want
1080508 well if that scenario evolves then i think its obvious that we would have to leave because if it was an elected government of iraq and weve been asked to leave other places in the world
1080509 speaking as a private individual i would not vote for john mccain under any circumstances
1080510 i have seen no evidence that sen mccain is successfully unifying the republican party or drawing conservatives into his fold to the contrary he seems intent on driving them away
1080511 in an advance copy provided to the associated press dobson said that while neither candidate is consistent with his views mccains positions are closer by a wide margin
1080512 in a calculated ploy to strip away votes from christian pro life pro family conservatives obama has made a concerted effort to make his faith a campaign issue
1080513 if obama is a victim he is a victim of his own radical theology and policies they are so radical in fact that faithful christians cannot simply stand by and let obama defame and attempt to redefine the faith by associating it with his wildly aberrant beliefs and radical policies
1080514 to the extent that obama wants to make headlines by making his faith an issue he should be required to define and defend his beliefs and actions
1080515 the mainstream media cannot or will not do it thank god for dr dobson and others who will not sit back and watch the christian faith be defamed by being associated with obamas most radical beliefs and policies
1080516 i believe there are many paths to the same place and that is a belief that there is a higher power a belief that we are connected as a people
1080517 i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
1080518 all people of faith christians jews muslims animists everyone know the same god
1080519 we christians joyfully recognize the religious values we have in common with islam today i would like to repeat what i said to young muslims some years ago in casablanca we believe in the same god the one god the living god the god who created the world and brings his creatures to their perfection
1080520 on his presidential style visit to the western wall in jerusalem last week obama left a written prayer intercepted by an israeli newspaper asking god to help me guard against pride and despair
1080521 he seems to have the despair part under control but the pride could be a problem
1080522 candidate a helped draft legislation to keep child molesters out of schools
1080523 all i can say is one word his condition is serious
1080524 asking them to donate gift bag items for an a a a list baby shower
1080525 he came in with 80 guests or so around 10 30 p m and stayed until close

1080530 renewables are poised to tackle our energy crisis and create millions of new jobs worldwide
1080531 meanwhile fossil fuel jobs are increasingly becoming fossils themselves as coal mining communities and others worry about their livelihoods
1080532 just as thousands were drawn to california and the klondike in the late 1800s the green energy gold rush is attracting legions of modern day prospectors in all parts of the globe
1080533 what is unfolding is nothing less than a fundamental transformation of the worlds energy infrastructure
1080534 climate change poses real risk to human health and the human systems that support our way of life in the united states
1080535 a likely increase in food and water borne germs as the world warms and habitat ranges expand for some disease causing organisms
1080536 many of the expected health effects are likely to fall disproportionately on the poor the elderly the disabled and the uninsured
1080537 i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1080538 for a number of years ive watched the wind turbines develop and i feel like its time for it
1080539 i think that oil has peaked at 85 million barrels in the world weve got to develop other forms of energy wind i think solar will be next and i hope im still around to be in the solar deal
1080540 we are in talks with a couple of networks right now we have one picked out but nothing is signed yet

1080544 i want to lose 5lbs in the next 60 days by eating three healthy meals plus two nutritious snacks everyday as well as 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise 10 minutes of stretching daily and weight lifting 3 times a week
1080545 well i ate really healthy yesterday so i can cheat a little today

1080555 it parted the trees like parting the red sea but with a wall of wind and water for 15 20 seconds
1080556 lessentiel est invisible aux yeux on ne voit bien quavec le coeur
1080557 its scares me to death because its a realization that the world is getting a little out of control and people need to calm down it scares me that we are capable of huge devastation to our world and its all we have im not sure people are acting consciously anymore i have a very very hard time even talking about it id rather be in denial
1080558 well it hits me like post partum depression if i start to really think about it i feel helpless and tired and overwhelmed and i just want to lay down and go to sleep i almost cant know to much about global warming at once i cant go there for my own sanitys sake its really devastating to me
1080559 my fear is that there are not enough people in this world thinking about climate change and what it will mean for our children and i dont want to go to that place where i think there is no hope
1080560 are there places or people that give you hope and inspiration
1080561 i like to find the little loop holes where real information lives and i am selective of what i read because i dont really trust mainstream media and newspapers to give me the news in a way that makes me feel empowered there is too much devastation in the news and for me to survive i have to find the loopholes in the media that keep my faith in humanity the stories of what is happening and the people who are making a difference
1080562 well as much as i feel people are going too far in their consumerism and in quelling their huge appetite for
1080563 yes because i think there are many people in my situation that feel overwhelmed and lonely kind of with their thoughts about it its certainly not something people want to greet each day talking about its hard right now to know who to talk to because its a sensitive and upsetting topic
1080564 what does climate change mean when you think about your children
1080565 oh monica i cant go there you are going to make me cry shes crying
1080566 its going to mean a life of survival for them
1080567 i think that as a parent part of my role right now is to bring them up in a way that i know they can take care of themselves they know how to grow their own food and tend a garden reintroduce the techniques we have lost like living off your land and being self sufficient
1080568 its too big to think about sometimes and thats the stuff i cant deal with
1080569 i have to live in the moment in order to stay sane
1080570 when i was a kid my mom used to tell me something that has really stuck with me
1080571 well one thing i do every day is i teach my kids every day lessons of conservation and sustainability within our home having them understand how to garden recycle etc i do not let them in on my fears about the climate change because i dont want to burden them this is their childhood and as adults we need to fix it because we are the ones who broke it
1080572 its about teaching them now activities that i think will really make a difference in their future i also try to make a difference by looking at what other household practices we can adopt to lesson our carbon footprint
1080573 we are looking into alternative energy right now and actively trying to get educated about wind powered energy each day is a new opportunity to learn something new about how we can live more consciously and create awareness in our children even simple things like conserving water when bathing tinfoil i wont throw it out now i wash it and reuse it my children do the same we used to throw it away
1080574 we dont use plastic bags at the grocery store we use reusable bags and we keep them in our car
1080575 is there a parting thought that you would care to leave based on the fact that you know a parent might read this
1080576 the only thing i want to say is that its our children that causes everyone to really want to work together to make a difference our love for them is so motivating
1080577 i thank god that we are parents and have been given the opportunity to have children in our lives and we have to continue to support one another and be strong we have to know that we are linked to every other parent around the world and share a common bond love for our children
1080578 from one parent to another i feel like we are all joining hands with every parent around the world taking a deep breath our collective consciousness around the world can be elevated if we do it together and can make a huge difference as long as people are willing to go there and stop ignoring it as an issue or waiting for someone else to make a difference
1080579 one of the recent things i read talked about christie brinkley a big star in her day and her own fears the poverty food challenges and water supply issues makes her very scared and how its going to affect her children its humbling to know that these same issues affect us a common bond and i can relate to her easily it was so interesting to realize that she shares some of my fears thats hope
1080580 hope is we are not alone in this and parents everywhere can make the difference
1080581 it would have been impossible to do this project alone
1080582 czech printmaking 2008 had six printmakers from the czech republic exhibit to an opening crowd of 200 art lovers
1080583 theres a lot of big play potential in our receivers and backs
1080584 if these guys break one tackle with the speed and talent they have they could go all the way so the faster i can get rid of the ball and get it in their hands the better off well be
1080585 i swear as much as i couldnt stand kissinger if kissinger were in the current bush government id be easier because i know this madness thats played out in front of us every day would be tied to whatever kissingers game would be probably to some contract or oil deal somebody would know what the reality is
1080586 this group just doesnt want to hear bush thinks the road from al qaeda leads from afghanistan through baghdad are you kidding me secular baghdad
1080587 and he believes it so hes ineducable what does the president say when asked about torture we dont torture theyre just words words mean nothing to him so i think hes a believer and i find that much more frightening
1080588 hersh horn rimmed and somewhat pudgy showed up for dinner in old tennis shoes a frayed pinstriped shirt that might have been at its best in his college freshman year and rumpled bleached khakis he was unlike any reporter we had ever met he did not hesitate to call henry kissinger a war criminal in public and was openly attracted and repelled by the power of the new york times
1080589 there is more solid history in that book than any book i know of on that era
1080590 hersh has with precision and method disassembled and obliterated his own career and reputation
1080591 i dont like people calling me up with things now because im so worried about having somebody walk something in
1080592 so i deal with my tried and true people mostly
1080593 i like it when a three star general retires that means he didnt make four and everybodys mad about that
1080594 what you have to do is tell them something they dont know if youre a bright guy and youre working in the intelligence community you could be making three times as much outside and here you are inside and the only reason youre there is you get to know these secrets and here comes this punk reporter who knows a really good secret what the hell is this youre going to show him what a secret is
1080595 little of the newspaper reporting in the middle east gets reported in america
1080596 it wasnt our job to cheerlead the us into iraq our job was to raise questions about why this guy was going
1080597 yeah it wasnt so much woodward and bernstein as it became it wasnt just the washington post i mean they made the story happen it is one of the greatest feats of journalism what they did but nixon won the 1972 election 61 39 and then the story was dead and then the new york times and jack nelson of the la times did incredible work a lot of people began to bang in so it became more of a collective thing the bringing down of the president actually took place the next year
1080598 look im not saying anything i havent said to him i think he was dead wrong in his respect and support for bush i think hes now come to that sense and so i dont think he could feel so good about the first two books about iraq but if he hadnt written them we wouldnt know half the things that were going on inside the white house he still is the source for a lot of the presidents thinking he gets things right
1080599 ive done some really horrible stories in my time too i had a front page story in the new york times saying that john dean nixons white house counsel who manipulated the cover up of watergate had nothing to say before watergate
1080600 problem unauthorized disclosure of classified national security information by sy hersh and the nyt
1080601 search warrant to go after hersh papers in his apt
1080602 hes really smart he had very smart people working for him and he kept ties to all of them he said i think it was the first sunday after 9 11 were going to have to go to the dark side well we had no idea what he meant but you know renditions sanctions murders at least 12 countries as of now are free fire zones our special force teams can go in and hit anybody without the ambassador knowing it the cia station chief knowing it
1080603 what youre reading is wild speculation which happens quite frequently here in the nations capital
1080604 were still doing crap there a lot of stuff thats not publicly known and our intentions are not good and now we have the israelis with us who see iran as an existential threat youve got the clock running youve got a guy running obama that neither the israelis nor the white house wants to win hes a different kettle of fish he doesnt collect 50m a year from the american jewish contributors in new york they dont have their hooks in him as much
1080605 tell your friends the iranians that if israel does something stupid not to respond because if they respond we cant guarantee what were going to do you know what side were going to come in on
1080606 cheney has said many times privately if israel goes by itself were going to be blamed
1080607 i had an old tough cia guy say to me before the baseball playoffs sy for all we know bin laden could be selling hot dogs outside yankee stadium today
1080608 i dont think id use a payphone in london my god youve got that place wired but it seems to be working you did well with the subway stuff and others i think you are more intrusive and maybe well end up that way too its sad because it does change your quality of your life
1080609 its a genetic thing i guess my legs havent gone i dont get bored and i still make that last call you know when you really dont want to make the call
1080610 i hate saying i think i cant stand the talking heads on television i was giving a speech somewhere and somebody asked me a question and i actually said i dont have a goddamn idea and people began to applaud almost nobody ever says they dont know
1080611 my lai led to a court martial for lieutenant william calley in 1971 a court of lieutenant calleys peers his fellow officers found him guilty of premeditated murder after that bush a freudian slip hersh means nixon couldnt rally the public any more the war was over
1080612 these guys will be dangerous until 11 59 on january 20th 2009
1080613 my guess is that its much more than blind patriotism and payback that enabled the neocons to change the structure of american government i think and i know this sounds a little whacko that there was big money to be made by joining in in the black world of covert ops and special access programs mind you im only talking about the secret worlds of black ops etc which is now a huge huge enterprise making careers and millionaires every day very tough case to make for sure but also original and interesting
1080614 a robust and reliable network is at the heart of everything we do at orange and we are dedicated to ensuring our customers in each and every region of the uk feel the benefit of this we are investing heavily to improve our network and this investment is one step closer to our goal of becoming the best uk network for coverage and reliability by 2009
1080615 clearly we are not saying the powervault or any rgpc product is green
1080616 however if an rgpc dealer can sell a 25 000 power management device like powervault because the homeowner offsets a percentage of that cost with rebates or tax credits earned by installing a renewable energy system everyone benefits the dealer the homeowner and the planet
1080617 but i havent yet had an opportunity to get greater clarify as to exactly to what mr maliki was referring or if in fact thats an accurate reporting of what he said
1080618 see we told you so this proves that we were right all along
1080619 were cooking something up just you wait its gonna be really bad
1080620 he didnt sit down in a negotiation with the religious extremists in iran
1080621 he made it very clear that those hostages were coming home
1080622 iran political economic and security rewards if it verifiably suspends its enrichment related and reprocessing activities
1080623 with vincent its the ties there how he would fit into the system and the fact that michigan offered him first
1080624 with brandin he feels comfortable with that staff and feels he can come right in and play linebacker or whatever position they are going to play him theres no guarantees but those are reasons why i think those two will pick michigan
1080625 i went to michigans camp and i think im their number one guy
1080626 if they end up offering both of us at the same time and it is first come first serve then i will probably take it
1080627 but if they give me a week or two then i would probably take that week or two and talk it over with my parents
1080628 i know michigan has come on strong as of late and if i had to guess id say thats where darius is currently leaning
1080629 they always have good defensive backs and i liked guys like charles woodson and desmond howard they always have their players highly drafted and i like the new coaches they seem nice and i definitely plan to take a visit there this fall
1080630 i love their new style of offense they are gonna run under coach rich rodriguez
1080631 its the same offense we run at my high school and they said i could play quarterback there
1080632 coach rodriguez says they need a guy like me to run his offense
1080633 but they are also looking at me for corner or receiver i guess the defensive coordinator wants me for cornerback and the offensive coordinator wants me for quarterback either way theyve got a spot for me
1080634 they michigan want to come see me play they havent seen me play in person theyve just seen my film they are going to see a game and go from there i think in september
1080635 we both agree that the progress has been significant but the progress is also fragile and theres a lot of work that needs to be done
1080636 in my personal opinion we are in need to have some at least some military bases as a symbol for preventing
1080637 we have reached an impasse because when we opened these negotiations we did not realise that the us demands would so deeply affect iraqi sovereignty and this is something we can never accept
1080638 of course precisely because america isnt perfect precisely because our ideals constantly demand more from us patriotism can never be defined as loyalty to any particular leader or government or policy
1080639 as mark twain that greatest of american satirists and proud son of missouri once wrote
1080640 my country right or wrong if right to be kept right and if wrong to be set right
1080641 same sex wisconsin couples willing to risk criminal penalties to marry in california
1080642 what we might be looking for is outside recognition of our relationship recognition from society
1080643 this is a way to ask for that recognition happily california is willing to give us that
1080644 it would really bring up a reaction in the public sentiment
1080645 collectively we feel that he will support and advance those moral values that we hold much greater than obama who in our view will decimate moral values
1080646 none of these people want to meet their maker knowing that they didnt do everything they could to keep barack obama from being president
1080647 youve got these two people running for president one of them is going to become president thats the perspective that thats the whole discussion
1080648 the marriage amendments had a buoying effect for president bush and other conservative candidates pushing to the polls many voters who otherwise might not have voted
1080649 in ohio for instance a huge marriage amendment campaign registered 54 500 new voters and thousands more ohioans who were registered but rarely voted cast their votes for the marriage amendment on the strength of the marriage initiative bush won in the battleground state as did 13 of the 17 republican candidates running for congress there
1080650 most ardent champions of conservative causes a man of bold colors and few pastels
1080651 he personified the unvarnished uncompromising attack dog brand of conservatism
1080652 his opponents have accused him of using race to win elections
1080653 an unyielding icon of conservatives and an archenemy of liberals
1080654 one of the most powerful conservatives on capitol hill for three decades
1080655 what is unique about helms and from my viewpoint unforgivable is his willingness to pick at the scab of the great wound of american history the legacy of slavery and segregation and to inflame racial resentment against african americans
1080656 helms campaign literature sounded a drumbeat of warnings about black voter registration drives
1080657 the negro cannot count forever on the kind of restraint thats thus far left him free to clog the streets disrupt traffic and interfere with other mens rights
1080658 by far the sharpest debate this sunday was between john mccain and his own surrogates
1080659 since john mccain himself has been trying to have it both ways on the social security payroll tax its no surprise that his surrogates are confused about which position to defend no amount of double talk can change the fact that john mccain is promising more of the same failed policies that have left americans struggling under the failed bush mccain economy
1080660 senator mccain believes you cannot tax your way into social security solvency if you want to deal with social security youve got to deal with all the moving parts that is whether or not you allow young people to invest uh have an account in their own name do you adjust the age do you adjust reschedule the benefits based on upper income people john is not going to tax our way into solvency because it will ruin the american economy but to raise taxes to save social security from bankruptcy wont happen its a dumb idea
1080661 hes making his position very clear which is payroll tax increases are not the solution he has been consistent in that position for the last many many months even as his opponent has proposed increases in payroll taxes
1080662 last september he was forced to defend his refusal to sign a no new tax pledge offered by the conservative americans for tax reform
1080663 meeting with us last december before the primaries he declared that
1080664 no look here we are americans are hurting you know that i know that these are tough economic times do we want to raise their taxes and have the government take more of their money we cant raise peoples taxes particularly at this particular time
1080665 mccain no i have said and will say i will say that everything has to be on the table if were going to reach a bipartisan agreement
1080666 megyn kelly alright but youre waffling now tucker youre off point youre off point were talking about on a go forward basis if mccain gets in the white house is he going to raise the payroll tax might the social security tax go up is that on the table tucker bounds no megyn there is no imaginable circumstance where john mccain would raise payroll taxes its absolutely out of the question
1080667 campaign contributions from oil industry executives to sen john mccain rose dramatically in the last half of june after the senator from arizona made a high profile split with environmentalists and reversed his opposition to the federal ban on offshore drilling
1080668 the centerpiece of sen mccains plan to stimulate the economy actually the whole plan is large tax cuts for corporations it would deliver 3 8 billion in tax cuts to the five largest american oil companies according to an analysis released today by the center for american progress action fund
1080669 republican sen john mccain criticized sen barack obamas call for a windfall profits tax on the oil industry on tuesday despite leaving the door open to the same idea last month mccain criticized obama his democratic rival repeatedly in excerpts of a speech planned for delivery tuesday evening he cited obamas advocacy of a tax on excess oil industry profits as well as the democrats vote for president bushs energy legislation in 2005 mccain reserved his sharpest words for the windfall profits tax if that plan sounds familiar its because that was president carters big idea too im all for recycling but its better applied to paper and plastic than to the failed policies of the 1970s mccain said in the excerpts
1080670 would deliver a 3 8 billion tax cut to the five largest american oil companies
1080671 but john weaver a former mccain adviser who resigned from the campaign last year said yesterday that the ad was childish that such attacks diminish mccain and that his campaign is a mockery for mccain to win in such troubled times he needs to begin telling the american people how he intends to lead us that mccain exists he can inspire the country to greatness weaver told the atlantic magazine in a comment quickly noted by the obama campaign
1080672 david winston a gop operative in washington argues that mccain has erred by issuing negative personal attacks
1080673 hes not emphasizing the contrasts that can actually help him win
1080674 ed rollins a longtime republican strategist said mccain sometimes appears frustrated and angry when he talks about obama especially when complaining that the press does not treat him fairly
1080675 yes look i got to tell you mccain made i think a mistake in his television ad in saying that obama didnt go because he couldnt take cameras you know thats arguable
1080676 why then is the arizona senator stumbling headlong with a largely dishonorable presidential campaign camoufl aging his own shortcomings by fecklessly impugning his opponents integrity and spouting what amount to outright lies as evidence we reference the mccain tv commercial blaming sen barack obama the democratic candidate for the high cost of gasoline mr mccains mendacious comment that mr obama went to the gym in germany rather than visit wounded american troops and the even more desperate claim that his opponent would lose a war in order to win the presidency such vicious nonsense nothing more than the political equivalent of drive by shootings gives the distinct impression that mr mccain is willing to destroy his own reputation for honor in order to save it and win the november election himself
1080677 of late sadly mccain is saying goodbye to all that the once bullish optimist is starting to come across as a churlish naysayer mccains presidential campaign is evolving into nonstop attacks on sen barack obama salted with distortion and innuendo after years as a media darling the candidate has taken to complaining about his opponents press coverage whats happened an infusion of political talent from the bush operation karl rove trained operatives have hijacked the straight talk express and are driving it into the mud
1080678 the straight talk express has taken a nasty turn into the gutter
1080679 the straight talk express has taken a nasty turn into the gutter sen john mccain has resorted to lies and distortions in what sounds like an increasingly desperate attempt to slow down sen barack obama by raising questions about his patriotism instead of taking the democrat down a few notches these baseless attacks are raising more questions about the republicans campaign and his ability to control his temper the most offensive line comes from mccain himself the arizona senator has repeated that obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign that is one of the more outrageous statements by a major political party candidate seeking the presidency
1080680 the mccain ads claim that obama says hell raise taxes on electricity is based on an interview obama gave to a san antonio newspaper in february in which he said what we ought to tax is a dirty energy like coal and to a lesser extent natural gas according to the obama campaign what obama was referring to in the interview was his proposal for a cap and trade mechanism that would set a limit on greenhouse gas emissions allowing entities to buy and sell rights to emit if that is the case mccain is criticizing obama for a proposal that he too supports
1080681 even some mccain allies have winced at the paris britney spot
1080682 well that certainly didnt take long on july 3 news reports said senator john mccain worried that he might lose the election before it truly started opened his doors to disciples of karl rove from the 2004 campaign and the bush white house less than a month later the results are on full display the candidate who started out talking about high minded civil debate has wholeheartedly adopted mr roves low minded and uncivil playbook
1080683 in every presidential campaign candidates of both parties will say something over the line sen john mccain has already hit a low mark
1080684 even by the elastic standards of political ads this is more than a stretch its baloney its also a marker on the path toward the kind of simplistic counterproductive demonizing that many expect will poison the fall campaign
1080685 mccains new ad claims that obama says hell raise taxes on electricity
1080686 mccains facts are literally true but his insinuation that the visit was canceled because of the press ban or the desire for gym time is false in fact obama visited wounded troops earlier without cameras or press both in the u s and iraq
1080687 long answer both mccain and obama would make electricity derived from fossil fuels more expensive since theyre both committed to setting mandatory limits on greenhouse gas emissions through a cap and trade system in fact they would raise energy costs by the same amount over the next 12 years since they have identical short term emissions goals
1080688 one worry was passengers would keep other passengers awake during the night but this has not happened
1080689 research shows that the lack of legislation coupled with bigger noisier means of transportation is a deadly combination
1080690 this kind of technology is essential if major airports and airlines are to achieve growth targets for 2020
1080691 that can only be done with acceptable noise and emissions levels
1080692 efficiency is still very low you need a lot of water and wind just to power a bicycle light
1080693 if you are healthy and able please take the time to help save a life and be a hero
1080694 and it was not just the taxpayers of kansas city who footed the bill for kay barnes big spending ways she passed the bill on to our children by letting the citys debt grow by 300 percent
1080695 kay barnes is a typical big city politician who treats taxpayers like a no limit credit card
1080696 it is always better to be ahead than behind in a poll but the only one that matters is the one on election day sam graves is winning the independents and conservative democrats who will decide this election we are leading but we are taking nothing for granted we will continue to have an aggressive grassroots campaign that talks about lowering gas prices securing our borders and getting our economy back on track
1080697 this idea doesnt work because of this this and this this idea could work if we did this this and this
1080698 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country

1080720 christian and conservative students shouldnt fear discrimination or censorship by university officials simply for expressing their beliefs the university is a marketplace of ideas where all viewpoints are welcomed and this significant ruling makes that clear
1080721 universities cannot use vague and overbroad policies to stifle student speech the 3rd circuit was right to conclude as the district court did that the old speech code at temple university is unconstitutional
1080722 speech cannot be prohibited in the absence of a tenable threat of disruption furthermore the policys use of hostile offensive and gender motivated is on its face sufficiently broad and subjective that they could conceivably be applied to cover any speech of a gender motivated nature the content of which offends someone this could include core political and religious speech such as gender politics and sexual morality t he policy provides no shelter for core protected speech
1080723 kidnappings by islamists to raise money for their cause are a routine occurrence in algeria and not a day goes by without terrorists attacking military personnel government employees or ordinary civilians whom they regard as allies of the government

1080725 our general goals are the same goals of al qaeda the mother
1080726 they have not actually pulled off a single terrorist attack in europe in the eight years theyve existed and thats a fact that you have to put in balance against european security services that say the group is a major threat

1080737 i believe with great conviction that barack obama should be the next president of the united states he was against the war when it was an unpopular position is for energy and environmental conservation and supports real health care reform he has awakened a massive grass roots movement and engaged the creative community in a way unseen before art provides the perfect platform to express our collective enthusiasm and commitment for change the manifest hope gallery will shine a light on artists using their works to engage their community and challenges other artists to do the same

1080740 prior forecast for q208 large area tft lcd panel shipments were for sequential shipment growth of 5
1080741 growth in end market demand exceeded this however due in part to the strong pull by downstream customers
1080742 the strong demand placed on large area lcd panel producers created a panel inventory pile up at the brand and system integration level which is believed to be the main reason for rapid downward panel price adjustments from the middle of june

1080758 we are extremely excited about lfas pro for lenders since many common fraud schemes such as chunking flipping and multiple closings would be much more evident to lenders in pre funding
1080759 lenders now have a tool that helps them ensure the loans they are about to make are not tainted by fraudulent activity and detect patterns indicative of fraud within their loan pipeline and other contributed lender pipelines
1080760 according to the federal bureau of investigation based on existing investigations a staggering 80 percent 1 of all reported mortgage fraud losses are committed by industry insiders
1080761 the mortgage industry is going through a dramatic transformation as standards are tightened and processes are changed so must the tools that detect and prevent fraud by incorporating a holistic solution like lfas lenders can ensure that the loans they make have less risk involved which contributes to more predictable revenue in the long run

1080820 the reaching of the three parts of our strategy 45 days ahead of schedule and the need to double the total store goal shows the strength of where we are headed to be more specific about the sale of servenation we are already in close contact with the firm that we will use for the sale once we are able to release news on that front we will we do want all of the holiday season sales on the books to increase the value as much as possible work has already begun to facilitate the sale when it is the right time

1081103 david and all israel were rejoicing before god with all their might with song and lyres and harps and tambourines and cymbals and trumpets
1081104 uzzah was not an innocent man he was not punished without a warning he was not punished without violating a law there was no caprice in this act of divine judgment there was nothing arbitrary or whimsical about what god did in that moment but there was something unusual about it the executions suddenness and finality take us by surprise and at once shock and offend us
1081105 i am still reading the minor prophets and where i once would have only seen wrath i now see abundant grace and mercy where i once would have been suspicious of god i am now delighting in him where i once would have been demanding answers from god i am now examining my own heart for sin where i once met with frustration and emptiness i now find life for my soul

1081111 the only reason why their affections are so much higher than the holy affections of saints on earth is they see the things they are affected by more according to their truth and have their affections more conformed to the nature of things
1081112 they are all as a pure heavenly flame of fire in their love and in the greatness and strength of their joy and gratitude
1081113 it should be considered affections may arise on occasion of the scripture and not properly come from the scripture as the genuine fruit of the scripture and by a right use of it but from an abuse of it
1081114 all that can be argued from the purity and perfection of the word of god with respect to experiences is this that those experiences which are agreeable to the word of god are right and cannot be otherwise and not that those affections must be right which arise on occasion of the word of god coming to mind
1081115 it may be observed that the more excellent anything is the more will be the counterfeits of it
1081116 so there are perhaps no graces that have more counterfeits than love and humility these being virtues wherein the beauty of a true christian does especially appear
1081117 what they have been the subjects of may indeed not be from themselves directly but may be from the operation of an invisible agent some spirit besides their own but it does not thence follow that it was from the spirit of god there are other spirits who have influence on the minds of men besides the holy ghost we are directed not to believe every spirit but to try the spirits whether they be of god
1081118 what evidence is there that the devil cannot bring texts of scripture to mind and misapply them to deceive persons
1081119 and as the devil can abuse the scripture to deceive and destroy men so may mens own folly and corruptions as well the sin which is in men acts like its father mens own hearts are deceitful like the devil and use the same means to deceive
1081120 i have run across his reference to animal spirits several times and don t really understand what he is referring to anyone have an idea
1081121 here as in the case of freehold are to be recognized the essential features of a genuine revival conviction of sin faith in christ joy and peace in believing and a holy life there was however apparently a greater admixture of mere animal feeling in this than in the preceding case
1081122 what is happening in me was done to me by god

1081124 and then i will declare to them i never new you depart from me you who practice lawlessness
1081125 perhaps i have missed the point of this book i m not finding anything in it so earthshaking that i couldn t have lived without it why is this considered a classic

1081139 in addition to being sexually assaulted the female suffered bruising and scratches to her face and legs it is believed that the suspect also was scratched by the victim the female finally managed to get away and walked on westminister ave where she met two unidentified females who walked with her until they met a male walking with a cell phone who called the police

1081141 they had originally planned to come here last may but that was scheduled for a few days after one of their pilots died during a rehearsal so of course the show was cancelled but they promised to come back at a better time this year to make up for it and they kept their word
1081142 because they are performing over water there can be no boats in the area beneath the show box and there can be no observers on munson mountain because they will be flying over it there are more than 100 volunteers working to put this show together and they will be supported by the rcmp
1081143 its not threatening any structures overnight it got within about 500 meters of a trailer but there was a swamp between the structure and the blaze and crews hit that area really hard to keep the trailer safe it is not near any structures right now
1081144 it was originally burning on some bad ground on a hill that was very hard to access and fight on crews worked overnight to bring it down off the hill to an area they can access better
1081145 it has grown from when it was reported first saturday night it started off as about 10 hectares and is now around 30 however instead of having to fight it on bad ground by bringing it to us we can get our heavy equipment on it a lot easier
1081146 we have a fresh crew on it this morning including two helicopters we will likely be ordering in another crew later today we dont have an estimate on how much of the blaze is contained but we are making good progress
1081147 at this point if we get high winds that could be a concern because the area is so dry the entire south okanagan hasnt had much rainfall lately

1081217 women leaders are role models to early and mid career women and simply by being there at the top encourage pipeline women to aspire to senior positions they see that their skills will be valued and rewarded
1081218 whats good for women is good for business simply put more women on corporate boards correlate with more women in the c suite and better financial performance a real win win for companies shareholders and talented women seeking companies that support their advancement
1081219 whats the point in pouring a fortune into educating girls and then watching them exceed boys at almost every level if when it comes to appointing business leaders in top companies these are drawn from just half the population friends who have been recruited on fishing and hunting trips or from within a small circle of acquaintances
1081220 the new dc 30 collar is designed to stand up to the torturous abuse of hunting dogs whether its hounds crashing through thick and swampy woods or bird dogs bounding through dense crp fields the dc 30 is made to take the beating that working dogs dish out daily
1081221 warren as far as ups they drive trucks full of packages in heavy city traffic all day so making as many rights as possible saves time because they dont get stuck at lights or waiting for oncoming traffic to clear the final stop being on the right has nothing to do with saving gas and time
1081222 then it should be no problem to give me a 1 specific example of when it would be better to go all the way around the block or even add a mile or 2 to the route just so the final stop is on the right
1081223 i believe the 7100 also has a larger poi database in the 4 million range though to be fair no modern gps holds a candle to the old magellan 700 760 which had 12 million pois and only very rarely failed to find the important ones even garmins top of the line gpss often miss very major pois along the midwest interstates i travel as do the other current manufacturers products
1081224 somebody once argued i think it may have been gps4me that the older larger poi databases contained many more inaccurate entries but in years of use i never had a problem with that its much more frustrating to watch the new ones completely miss lots of pois than to worry about an occasional inaccuracy in the older databases

1081232 thank you for contacting garmin international unfortunately this is a limitation with the unit and you would either have to install the lower 48 states or the canadian states to the unit and this are interchangeable
1081233 what strikes me most is a lot of posters here down garmin for not putting lane positioning system

1081243 ms macia contacted us because she had received a summons for her council tax
1081244 ms macia believed that she had made all of the payments that were due but unfortunately had quoted the wrong reference number when she paid junes instalment
1081245 because of this we were unable to identify the account to which the payment belonged
1081246 you dont get any sleep its too cold and noisy its awful really
1081247 it is ultimately their decision whether or not to accept a particular property mrs galloway has been offered at least 10 private sector properties but none has proved acceptable to her
1081248 the council also arranged and paid for temporary hotel accommodation for the family but that accommodation is no longer available
1081249 due to the number of dependent children involved in this matter we have done over and above what is required of us by law

1081253 poor thai women from the countryside with a modest education can make well educated worldly western men do really crazy things

1081255 i was eating the nuts and asked him if he wanted one he had one but then said his mouth and throat were itchy i gave him a tablet and we called 999 he was panicking and wanted to walk to the ambulance
1081256 we went to the hospital and they did everything they could we are care assistants so we were allowed inside when they tried to save him
1081257 he was booked in and then minutes later he was gone
1081258 there are so many ifs buts and maybes i gave him the nut and i cant forget that
1081259 im supposed to be his mum the one who looks out for him
1081260 he always said you should support the team from where you are from and i know you hear people say it all the time but he really was perfect
1081261 he was an altar boy at church and a friend to all young and old
1081262 he wanted to be cardiothoracic surgeon and that was typical of him always wanting to help others he was perfect his smile would light up a room
1081263 wed been before and he was really looking forward to it
1081264 they both really loved sport and they were both season tickets holders for the leeds rhinos rugby league team
1081265 james was a lovely smashing lad he was really thoughtful and very clever he loved sport in particular cricket snowboarding and golf
1081266 he had saved his pocket money with the intention of buying a new set of golf clubs while on holiday in america gary and james regularly played golf together
1081267 gary was quiet and unassuming with a good sense of humour and loved a laugh both he and catherine idolised james they were looking forward to the holiday of a lifetime
1081268 we acknowledge that we should have done better in communicating this to the residents but the work will go ahead
1081269 we havent heard anything from the council yet but we hope that they may now give us a chance to put our view
1081270 we are not opposed to the removal of diseased or dying trees but we want the council to replace them so we still have trees along the street
1081271 we appreciate some residents have strong feelings about the trees but the issue remains that a number are unsafe and need to come down
1081272 the pavements are heavily used particularly by children on their way to the local primary school and we have a duty to make them as safe as possible this means felling a number of trees that are already dead and pruning the roots of those that have caused the pavement to buckle
1081273 this work will be carried out at the same time as traffic calming measures are introduced on the street as part of a safe routes to school scheme
1081274 though we have held a number of meetings with residents over the past few years we recognise on reflection that we should have made them aware that work was actually about to start setting out again why this work is necessary
1081275 we apologise for this and are happy to discuss with residents any concerns they may have
1081276 as a principle we always look to replace every tree that we remove but that is unfortunately not an option along pine grove
1081277 the volume of utility cables and pipes means that new trees cannot be planted in the same locations and narrow streets prevent us from indenting them into the road itself
1081278 it is with immense pride and a great sense of achievement that i look back and contemplate the success of the srs not to mention the teamwork and expertise at daresbury that went into building maintaining and operating this great british scientific facility
1081279 of course this is a sad occasion for me but since the day the srs was first switched on it has always been subject to a fixed lifespan and this day was always going to come

1081363 todas las leyes est n ajustadas a la constituci n vigente hay cosas que realmente se pueden hacer sin necesidad de reformar la constituci n sino apeg ndose y desarrollando los preceptos constitucionales
1081364 aqu se encuentran la ley org nica de turismo que fue considerada en el consejo de ministros 567 del 15 de abril la ley de transporte ferroviario fue considerada en mayo y as sucesivamente las ltimas fueron unas reformas para el sector vivienda para la ley de procuradur a general de la rep blica y para la ley general de bancos y otras instituciones financieras

1081369 durante el 2007 se publicaron unas 20 leyes muchas de ellas estaban a la espera de la propuesta de reforma constitucional que lamentablemente no se dio y tuvimos que sentarnos a reformular las leyes de manera tal que se mantuvieran dentro del texto constitucional vigente y con un estricto apego y respeto de todo el articulado de la constituci n
1081370 dentro de las 26 leyes est n la ley de agricultura y tierras la ley del banco agr cola de venezuela y la ley de salud agr cola integral y la ley para el sector agrario y la ley de beneficios y facilidades de deudas en rubros estrat gicos para la seguridad y soberan a alimentaria son todas un sistema orientado fundamentalmente a buscar la soberan a alimentaria y a ordenar el sector estamos tratando la salud agr cola integral y se tienen las previsiones para crear una reserva de alimentos que no existe en este momento en el pa s

1081372 but which child is more likely to develop as a creative thinker
1081373 andy whose toys do everything on their own or sid who is inventing his own toys
1081374 popular culture too often represents the most creative children as misfits
1081375 im skeptical whether children learn very much as they interact with them
1081376 scratch shows us the importance of play in the role of education
1081377 for too long weve told students to be still be quiet and be bored youre learning but if we can open up creative experimental pathways in their minds and show them that learning can be as fun for the students as it is for their teachers we can accomplish incredible things
1081378 i use scratch to get kids to come to school they stay at school longer and do better
1081379 hopefully scratch will get us to rethink our ideas about education and how people learn
1081380 we want to help develop creative thinkers we know that success and even happiness are linked to our ability to think creatively and there are simply not enough opportunities to do that in our lives

1081400 in the context of an agent who exercises a capacity to freely act for a purpose explanation is grounded in an internal similarity relation of the content of the prior purpose to that of the effective intention

1081404 the united states word should not be so carelessly broken nor its standing in the international community so needlessly compromised
1081405 there is no dispute that if texas executes mr medellin in these circumstances texas would cause the united states irreparably to breach treaty commitments made on behalf of the united states as a whole and thereby compromise u s interests that both this court and the president have described as compelling
1081406 i was so tired of feeling weak i wanted to start my life over by tracking bears through the cascades and washing my face in a stream spilling off a thousand year old glacier

1081408 the cactus eaters how i lost my mind and almost found myself on the pacific crest trail
1081409 why would someone take the time to sculpt and sand down and set up this marble lump and plant it right in the middle of the pct where a hiker might run right into it
1081410 and what exactly was the sculptor trying to prove was the artwork an expression of guilt i was getting myself all worked up and annoyed when the statue suddenly moved
1081411 sold me on the notion that a man could internalize the beauty and harmony he finds within nature and bring those qualities home with him he might even use these qualities to mend the broken pieces of himself

1081420 in the well written laugh out loud self deprecating spirit of bill brysons walk in the woods and nora ephrons when harry met sally dan white takes us along for a walk on the wild side of adventure and love i couldnt put it down
1081421 dan white forges miles past travelogue to carve a poignant uproarious and deeply compelling love story between man woman and the land between
1081422 think into the wild with a touch of annie hall as told by woody allen and you begin to get the picture of dan whites riveting account of a long life altering walk most of us will never take whites tale of hiking the pacific crest trails grueling 2 600 miles from mexico to canada is by turns funny and achingly painful physically and emotionally as white and his long suffering girlfriend encounter a cast of extraordinary characters as well as bears rattlesnakes and nasty bugs you feel like you are with them every step of the way a wonderful read even if your longest hike is usually out to the driveway

1081543 thank insert deity joke is being told to im not a woman
1081544 there are things that you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
1081545 we will not bow our heads before taliban terrorists but will face them the conspiracy of talibanization is on the rise in karachi and mqm activists should remain mentally and physically prepared to face hard times ahead
1081546 today terrorists strangle innocent people and the educational institutes are being burnt all in the name of islam the holy prophet pbuh said that it is obligatory for every man and woman alike to get an education but is it correct according shariat to strangle people and burn educational institutes
1081547 the people here in pakistan were muslims and are muslims so what sort of muslims do they the taliban want to make us actually they the taliban want to bring the shariat of the kalashnikov into force but the people will not tolerate such a forced shariat
1081548 we dont want the government shutdown to be an issue but the fact is the democrats are so overconfident that theyre willing to talk about a ban and theyre willing to talk about raising taxes on gasoline so this is just pretty incredible
1081549 but i think that once americans realize that this drilling ban will expire unless we pass something i think there is going to be just an outcry to not vote for anything that had a ban in it
1081550 if the democrats choose to hold the continuation of government operations as a hostage then as far as im concerned i cant vote for anything that has a ban in it
1081551 that would just be a betrayal of everything were talking about as republicans and i think that most republicans are going to feel that way
1081552 on october 1 the bans on offshore drilling and oil shale recovery will end enabling us to finally be able to develop more american energy unless democrats actively prohibit exploration
1081553 i hope that speaker pelosi and democrats in the house and senate recognize the pain americans are feeling and will not actively enact legislation to block the development of american energy
1081554 as far as im concerned on october 1 we should be able to begin the leasing process of drilling and mining in both of those areas of american energy supply
1081555 in this environment where energy is the most important issue and the only thing youre fighting over is whether you allow drilling well have to wait and see but id rather be on the side that wanted to go after american energy sources than the side that didnt

1081591 we have to guard against infodemics in which inaccurate false information is disseminated prompting social unrest that spreads like an epidemic
1081592 the reality is that we lack the means to effectively deal with harmful internet messages
1081593 the regulations violate the autonomy of the internet and are an effective tool for tighter media control by the government
1081594 the regulations would bring about a reverse in the advancement of the internet media as a whole
1081595 south korea is a leading testbed for the it industry and the internet media here certainly has a frontier like aspect in leading experimental democracy
1081596 but the internet media should also serve public good and compared with other countries south korea has lacked the institutional control over the media in which people tend to expand and reproduce unverified one sided information

1081674 id say that the author of a popular book has far more aggregate influence than do one set of parents so if the book is very popular and captures the imaginations of kids presto youve done a lot to insure that the ideas that are important to you live long after you pass on if its the ideas that matter then i suppose that there are ways that folks like you can propagate the ideas without having your own kids be your lab rats

1081746 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president the former president told abc
1081747 i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year
1081748 you can argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can be fully ready for the pressures of the office
1081749 his strategic sense and his ability to run an effective campaign he clearly can inspire and motivate people and energize them which is a very important part of being president
1081750 and hes smart as a whip so theres nothing he cant learn

1081759 this is one of those searches that could have gone on for days had we not had the cellphones stuff
1081760 ive been doing this search and rescue for 14 years fossett should have been found
1081761 its not like we didnt have our eyes open we found six other planes while we were looking for him were pretty good at what we do
1081762 what ive strived to find out is what happened to this man in the run up to his disappearance why did he disappear
1081763 i spoke to reporters who were on the scene people who were helping out with the search efforts anyone whom i thought could shed some light on this
1081764 i discovered that there is absolutely no proof that steve fossett is actually dead im not a conspiracy theorist im a man who deals in facts and i dont really care if he is alive or dead it make no difference to me
1081765 what i am interested in is the truth and a proper criminal investigation of this mans disappearance was never undertaken by law enforcement or officials in the state of nevada

1081775 its an amazing thing that they are trying to do there
1081776 the school has great academics and they want to be great at football too
1081777 they e mail me regularly and keep in contact the most
1081778 im going to try and visit florida this summer too but the others will have to be official visits in the fall

1081780 everything is pretty good grant golding a gymnast from calgary said monday
1081781 the athletes village is really nice the gyms are great
1081782 i am trying to find problems the former olympic gold medallist diver said while eating lunch at the athletes village
1081783 we are working out the little details making sure the athletes are comfortable
1081784 the athletes are very pleased with the village and the training venues and competition sites most have been here for test events but to come back and see all the improvements that have been made we knew the chinese were going to be ready but we are very pleased with what we see right now
1081785 its one of the nicest apartments ive ever stayed in said burnes who is competing at his first olympics
1081786 i have been here three days and two of the three were very nice said bernier
1081787 we are still confident that by the time the games start the air quality will be good
1081788 we are hoping in the next three days the sky will be blue and the air quality will be there
1081789 you try not to get out in the sun too much so you dont get tired from sweating all day he said
1081790 all the athletes are shooting in the same climate he said
1081791 every athlete that we have talked to is very impressed and amazed by the quality of this village said bernier
1081792 personally i have never seen such a nice village in nine games
1081793 after being here a week you get the same kind of things
1081794 they were taking every question seriously and making sure they will solve every problem she said
1081795 of course we will have a couple of problems along the way
1081796 every where you go there are not two or three people trying to help you there are 10 or 15 people that want to help you and make it easier for you bernier said
1081797 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1081798 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1081799 this transformation will be costly and given the fiscal disaster we will inherit from the last administration it will likely require us to defer some other priorities
1081800 like all compromises this one has its drawbacks it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1081801 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1081802 like george bush and dick cheney before him he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than 1 million from big oil just last month
1081803 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1081804 a windfall profits tax on big oil to give families a thousand dollar rebate
1081805 it was sen obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election

1081843 our project seeks to deliver electric power that is not only reliable but also compatible with a natural environment in harmony with people and animals
1081844 although the electricity grid has been designed for a one way transfer of power from central station generators to consumers with the distributed generation system being developed at the zoo using on site renewable energy sources such as photovoltaics the grids controls can be adapted for reverse power flows
1081845 all of the zoos exhibits and programs are designed to engage and inspire visitors to treasure the natural world and act wisely on its behalf
1081846 this partnership offers a great opportunity for the zoo to lead by example by developing and testing a renewable solar energy system we hope to reduce the impact on the environment by conserving conventional power
1081847 tampa electric is pleased to partner with usf and tampas lowry park zoo to study and encourage the use of solar power in our communities
1081848 one of our companys strategic goals is to engage the community while dramatically improving tampa electrics environmental profile this is consistent with governor crists challenge to develop and sustain renewable energy resources in florida

1081856 most people dont give one thought to the chair they are sitting in while they work yet they will spend years of their lives molded to that piece of furniture
1081857 a well balanced ergonomic chair at work is one of the best preventative interventions one can do for their spine it could prevent many episodes of back and flare ups and in some settings even help prevent spine surgery
1081858 poor resting posture and inadequate office chair design contribute heavily to the epidemic like back ailments people face every day a significant number of the back neck and shoulder problems that we see are the direct result of a home office that does not have the proper equipment
1081859 the kitchen table and chair is not a functional work space it was designed for a 20 minute meal not seven hours of work
1081860 but unfortunately when it comes to planning a home office thats the place people often start they dont recognize the fact that they make their living sitting in that chair and its worth the investment to get one that works for them ergonomic research shows us that with proper equipment we work more efficiently so more tasks get done investing in the proper equipment is how you work smarter
1081861 you can be comfortable even if you are working at a computer for long periods of time but understand that a product being labeled ergonomic doesnt guarantee it will address your specific needs

1081865 it was quite a big deal to me i lost all my e mails and quite a lot of private stuff on the bebo page

1081869 this suggests that the deceased may have been alive somewhere in the south wairarapa in or about 1742

1081922 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1081923 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1081924 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1081925 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1081926 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1081927 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires

1081943 athletes from across scotland and the rest of the uk will be taking part in the beijing olympics and fans should be allowed to show their support by waving the national flag of their choice
1081944 with participants like andy murray often wearing saltires on their kit as a symbol of national pride it will be a shame if fans are not able to echo that by waving saltires from the stands
1081945 the olympics like the davis cup are represented by great britain so andy jamie and the other members of the olympic squad will be playing for scotland england wales and northern ireland in line with the olympic regulations
1081946 however the fact that andy is playing for great britain in no way diminishes the pride that fellow scots will feel watching andy play and his fans all over the world will continue to support him all the way
1081947 with so many internal critics silenced i am not surprised to see the chinese authorities trying to control everything that happens at olympic venues but clamping down on freedom of expression in this way is completely unacceptable
1081948 we dont want politics to overshadow the games which are a wonderful expression of global humanity and shared values but the chinese government promised to improve human rights when they were awarded the olympics and this promise has been completely broken
1081949 these restrictions on freedom of expression mean that anyone supporting andy murray at the tennis must wave a union jack and not a saltire
1081950 local athletes winning medals at the beijing olympics should be able to do a victory lap with a saltire if they wish

1081958 juan pierre reiterated sunday that this has been the toughest season of his career without a doubt he said the dodgers trade for manny ramirez last week forced pierre to change positions again and the fleet footed leadoff hitter is facing the threat of being sent to the bench again
1081959 all ive ever done was be juan pierre he said
1081960 to be honest if were winning and andruw starts hitting ill probably be back on the bench he said
1081961 to be honest andre ethier is a superior player to me and regardless of the fact that im old and make a lot of money he should probably play because this is a pennant race and decisions should be made around winning baseball games not making crappy veterans like me feel good about themselves
1081962 someone is a little agitated and when theyre placed in handcuffs they rethink things
1081963 he made a decision to have one of the valets park his car for the night
1081964 sometimes we give just a verbal warning its based on the totality of the circumstances

1081968 the son radiates gods own glory and expresses the very character of god and he sustains everything by the mighty power of his command
1081969 the angel of the lord encamps around those who fear him and he delivers them the angel of the lord guards us when we fear and trust in the lord
1081970 o fear the lord you his saints for to those who fear him there is no want
1081971 the righteous cry out and the lord hears them he delivers them from all their troubles
1081972 the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous run into it and are safe
1081973 for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the he is all these things and he can and will be all things to us and for us we need trust in him
1081974 everything is for the best in this best of all possible worlds

1081978 just wait dude hes not that good his numbers look good at the end of the year but he does nothing when the games on the line
1081979 sexuality has always been very complicated and when you have to prove it as a matter of life and death you will use any resource you have available to you
1081980 during pride we took hundreds of pictures and we have a facebook group and when people sign up to that group we encourage them to show their membership to the irb member
1081981 i have used facebook because people put stuff on there about themselves and who they are and in a relationship with
1081982 basically its like a jigsaw puzzle and you just try and take the little pieces here and there and you try and construct a larger picture of a persons life
1081983 a refugee claimant may not have typical documentation to support their claim and individuals may have to be more resourceful in their submissions
1081984 a member of the board can accept any relevant evidence and then assign an appropriate value to that evidence
1081985 i do foresee the irb saying this is not an acceptable form of evidence
1081986 going to and fro on the earth and from walking back and forth on it
1081987 be it far from thee lord this shall not be unto thee
1081988 get thee behind me satan thou art an offence unto me for thou savourest not the things that be of god but those that be of men
1081989 though coniah the son of jehoiakim king of judah were the signet on my right hand yet i would pluck you off 25 and i will give you into the hand of those who seek your life and into the hand of those whose face you fear the hand of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and the hand of the chaldeans
1081990 behold i am the lord the god of all flesh
1081991 simon simon indeed satan has asked for you that he may sift you as wheat 32 but i have prayed for you that your faith should not fail and when you have returned to me strengthen your brethren
1081992 were going to sit down take all the information and make a decision
1081993 if he gets suspended two three or four games it will hurt the team
1081994 i read all the blogs on the internet and it opened my eyes when people all were talking oh we dont know if the coaching staff will be intact or not
1081995 thats all hearsay right now but people started saying it if enough people say it it will eventually be true
1081996 a lot of guys were saying why would you commit to syracuse
1081997 i got leery because i didnt want to get up there and be stuck
1081998 if i went there and coach robinson and his staff was gone now what am i going to do i would have to deal with new coaches who dont know me or how i play
1081999 one kid anthony young wiseman out of bethesda md he and i were talking and i thought he would be good for syracuse
1082000 he said hey man im going to duke im sorry i dont know why but he didnt even think about it
1082001 i actually committed earlier that week i did not want to go public with it until now
1082002 coach jimbo fisher said that once i committed i would start a big train
1082003 i chose fsu because of the way the coaches treated everything
1082004 i will still take my official visits to most likely tennessee auburn boston college and probably south florida as well as coming back up to fsu
1082005 schools are incorporating computers into their curricula at very early grade levels its not unusual to find a computer loaded with learning software in preschool and daycare settings
1082006 children who have experience with computers at home will have an edge over those who first encounter technology in the classroom
1082007 fis takes note of the result and reiterates its complete shock at a controversy that involves an athlete that has always been distinguished for his sportsmanship and correctness
1082008 the surprise is even greater given that baldini like all the other top level fencers in the italian national team has repeatedly undergone tests during the course of the season that have always been negative
1082009 doping does not exist in fencing it has no sense
1082010 this tournament has elevated the sport of tennis in the countrys heartland while providing significant contributions to community causes
1082011 this is a legacy we look forward to building upon
1082012 the itf is very disappointed with the decision and feels that the precedent set today could ultimately harm the rights of international federations to set qualification criteria and puts the role of the international federation in the olympic games into discussion
1082013 it is very disturbing for the itf and should be for the ioc when players who do not meet the itf qualification criteria approved by the ioc are entered at the expense of players who qualified and deserve to represent their countries at the 2008 olympic games
1082014 how good would sullinger and all ohio be at the 17 and under level

1082023 there is a sound to my discontent last i heard its where my hope went
1082024 drive and drive to the break of day i know if i could just get away i wont lose my mind this time

1082028 fallure to collect the tax not only hurts public health it hurts the rest of the states small business who must sell cigarettes at far higher prices worse theres reason to believe that tobacco smugglers are funneling profits from indian reservation sales to terrorist orginizations overseas
1082029 of course revenue will decline when business on indian reservations have to compete on an even footing with the rest of the state
1082030 i hope the day will come when christians may become the carriers of love for everyone
1082031 give us your poor your tired your huddled masses yearning to be free

1082036 last month june american morning saw its best ratings in nearly two years among total viewers
1082037 arguably the most infamous biomedical research study in u s history
1082038 the mens status did not warrant ethical debate they were subjects not patients clinical material not sick people
1082039 the longest non therapeutic experiment on human beings in medical history
1082040 so far we are keeping the known positive patients from getting treatment
1082041 what was done cannot be undone but we can end the silence we can stop turning our heads away we can look at you in the eye and finally say on behalf of the american people what the united states government did was shameful and i am sorry
1082042 lied about inventing hiv as a means of genocide against people of color
1082043 the hour is coming and is now here when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and truth for the father is seeking such people to worship him
1082044 the objective of redemption is making worshipers the primary reason we are redeemed is not so that we may escape hell that is a blessed benefit but not the major purpose the central objective for which we are redeemed is not even so that we might enjoy the manifold eternal blessings of god in fact the supreme motive in our redemption is not for us to receive anything rather we have been redeemed so that god my receive worship so that our lives might glorify him any personal blessing for us is a divine response to the fulfillment of that supreme purpose
1082045 the glory of the immortal god for images resembling mortal man
1082046 worshiped and served the creature rather than the creator who is blessed forever
1082047 but you are a chose race a royal priesthood a holy nation a people for his own possession that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light once you were not a people but now you are gods people once you had no received mercy but now you have received mercy
1082048 we were all battling the water from the side of the wall with towels
1082049 it was like being at the beach with all the water you couldnt see no plants only the high ones and the trees other than that it was just debris and water
1082050 were going to pump it out as much as we can
1082051 now at least we can get in our vehicles without having to pull our pants
1082052 were going to keep working at it weve got to clear it out life goes on
1082053 perch tu conti pi del mondo che circonda anche noi

1082061 were far from perfect and we try to learn from lessons every single day
1082062 but i would also remind you that we have to cover the game at the moment
1082063 and the clinton campaign started by presenting itself almost as the incumbent we are inevitable we are a powerhouse we have more money we have more organization we have a stronger more tested candidate the clintons are coming back to power
1082064 that was their pitch and so we covered them as the fortress clinton
1082065 ive done six of these and this is by far the most consequential election of my lifetime and if we cant find a way to make that interesting and compelling well then i should go back to tending bar
1082066 isnt your job to take what they say to analyze it to hold it against their former quotes to show how the policies may change and screw the drama
1082067 isnt your job to help people make their own decision on their votes instead of just trying to make these conventions interesting
1082068 i would argue im going to cut out of the line here i would argue not to screw the drama marry and challenge the drama
1082069 its their convention they have the right to do whatever they want at their convention and we have a right to cover it
1082070 to me the issues iraq afghanistan international relations the middle east climate change taxes health care the undone list from both the clinton administration and the bush
1082071 real men do the best they can they dont cheat steal or lie to get their way they are humble honest and their hearts are soft with love and compassion real men can be gentle as a lamb and fierce as a lion they are both lovers and protectors
1082072 although it may be possible for a new u s administration to repudiate the disastrous bush policy
1082073 a tremendous amount of damage will already have been done
1082074 im not surprised by their opposition to auctions what is somewhat surprising is they think they have the legal authority
1082075 its pretty clear the airports dont have the authority to just unilaterally decide they dont want certain carriers to serve their airports
1082076 i can guarantee theres going to be a great deal of legal action against them
1082077 were not going to allow it to come to a terminal
1082078 appears hell bent on jamming this unworkable plan down the throats of the port authority and new york city air travelers but we are going to fight this every step of the way
1082079 the details are being worked out with the doctors this week but the tentative plan is for radiation and chemotherapy
1082080 i think they are all homosexual communists in satans army i espect as well they all live together and bathe together every morning and have the anal sex with one another with the fisting and the guinea pigs

1082093 generamos muchas ocasiones y marcamos muchos goles y eso me da mucha fe para seguir nos demuestran que si no lo hacen es porque no quieren se est n retratando ellos mismos porque lo est n haciendo a muy buen nivel
1082094 como todo el mundo se esfuerza defensivamente no tenemos problemas
1082095 todos saben que hay que luchar correr y ayudar al compa ero y eso es lo que desde el primer d a es innegociable
1082096 las sensaciones es que juegue quien juegue el equipo funciona y eso me da tranquilidad sabiendo que esto es el principio y que a n queda mucha temporada por delante
1082097 pedro es un jugador con el que cont mucho el a o pasado lo quer a probar a un nivel alto y nos est demostrando a todos que si hay que contar con l podemos contar con l porque da fiabilidad y eso me da tranquilidad s que es un jugador m s que puedo utilizar y lo conozco mucho casi como su padre y s lo que nos puede dar
1082098 todav a nos encontramos con un enorme d ficit de recursos
1082099 para dar respuesta al vih y al sida se necesita una financiaci n sostenida y a largo plazo a medida que aumente el n mero de personas que se sometan a tratamiento y que por ende vivan m s a os los presupuestos tendr n que incrementarse de manera considerable en los pa ses en los pr ximos decenios

1082120 we are bound by the decisions of cas but even if it is a decision that is negative for the players i would say let them play
1082121 the clubs should then say we were right to appeal to cas but in the spirit of the olympic games we will let them stay and play
1082122 in 1988 the fifa congress made the decision that the olympic tournament should be open to players under 23
1082123 since then we have not had a single complaint or problem with the release of players
1082124 also when the tournament was opened to include three over aged players it remained without problems
1082125 we need everybody to work together players should be given the opportunity of playing at the olympics

1082144 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
1082145 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
1082146 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
1082147 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
1082148 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
1082149 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
1082150 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
1082151 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
1082152 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
1082153 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
1082154 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
1082155 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
1082156 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
1082157 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
1082158 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
1082159 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
1082160 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
1082161 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny

1082165 we are committed to supporting family life and stability and commitment in relationships precisely because the secure start in life a stable family background provides is the best guarantee of maximising opportunity
1082166 i believe we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males
1082167 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available
1082168 we should ask those who make profits out of reveling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing
1082169 the relationship between these titles and their readers is a relationship in which the rest of us have an interest
1082170 the images they use and project reinforce a very narrow conception of beauty and a shallow approach towards women they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude
1082171 the contrast with the work done by womens magazines and their publishers to address their readers in a mature and responsible fashion is striking

1082253 the government particularly under tony blair thinks it is wonderful to have children brought up with their traditional religions i call it brainwashing
1082254 most devout muslims are creationists so when you go to schools there are a large number of children of islamic parents who trot out what they have been taught
1082255 teachers are bending over backwards to respect home prejudices that children have been brought up with the government could do more but it doesnt want to because it is fanatical about multiculturalism and the need to respect the different traditions from which these children come

1082260 if all incompatible donors and recipients were simply listed in one common pool the problems related to incompatible and poorly matched donors and recipients would be a thing of the past
1082261 this is a rare instance of a living donor kidney being shipped across the country to initiate a chain
1082262 if we can become comfortable shipping living donor kidneys like we do with deceased donor kidneys then thousands of patients will have the opportunity to receive a kidney who otherwise would have been forced to remain on dialysis
1082263 the hope is that this marks the first of many such collaborations among the nations transplant centers donor chains have enormous potential to expand the donor pool and to provide better matched organs for the many individuals who are in desperate need of lifesaving transplants
1082264 most paired exchanges are swaps and they end whereas the chain involves an extra donor in the beginning so you can initiate a self propagating cascade
1082265 but in this case ucla received a live donor kidney from new york which hasnt been done before
1082266 living donor exchange represents the pinnacle of teamwork and professional and personal trust and good faith that ideally epitomizes the organ transplant endeavor
1082267 the team consists of surgeons physicians nurses coordinators patients and donors all working together toward the same goal
1082268 patients can wait up to eight years for a deceased donor transplant
1082269 this donor chain may enable hundreds of patients to receive a kidney thanks to one generous altruistic donor rather than in the past where only one patient benefited from an altruistic donor this could significantly decrease the waiting list for kidney transplantation
1082270 i have had the incredibly sad experience of having a colleague die while waiting for a kidney transplant
1082271 i have a close friend who donated a kidney to her brother and i have a close friend who received a kidney more than a decade ago and i see the terrific experiences shes had since
1082272 when i started thinking about it i thought im able and healthy at this point in my life to do this to help someone have more years of a better life why not donate the beauty of this partnership between excellent doctors transplant coordinators and staff at newyork presbyterian weill cornell ucla and a group of seven people a partnership connecting both coasts is that a chain of people have better lives and the chain goes on
1082273 if we can get this exchange program going its going to be the answer to lots of peoples situations
1082274 this is going to help so many people down the line
1082275 pam couldnt sit on the transplant wait list for several years something needed to be done im glad i could do my part to help
1082276 everyone would benefit if more donated today its me tomorrow its someone else
1082277 it was like a closed door that is now being opened again
1082278 randy and i talked about it and we said ok hes willing to give to somebody else and i wont have to take as many medications after the surgery

1082284 one subsection of the visible consists of images and by images i mean first shadows then reflections in water and in all close packed smooth and shiny materials
1082285 in the other subsection of the visible put the originals of these images the animals around us the plants and the whole class of manufactured things
1082286 now the doctrine that is taught in secret about this matter is that we men are in a kind of prison and must not set ourselves free or run away
1082287 it goes away into that which is like itself into the invisible divine immortal and wise

1082289 the great archetypes of the mind pure ideas find themselves usurped by mere sense images
1082290 eye half turned toward the great archetypes of the imagination we carry within us
1082291 do you truly wish to see the beloved in the cold clarity of the visual apparatus it may be in your best interest to throw a veil over the gaze so as to keep her alive in her archetypal goddesslike form
1082292 we cannot live our daily lives in a realm of pure ideas cocooned from sense experience the question is not how can we keep the imagination pure protected from the onslaughts of reality the question has to be can we find a way for the two to coexist
1082293 kept as fleeting as possible as a means toward stirring or activating the idea that lies buried more deeply
1082294 sense organs reach the limit of their powers their light begins to go out
1082295 that light leaps up one last time giving us a glimpse of the invisible

1082302 do you hope you can expiate the crimes of the past by suffering in the present
1082303 you have not been listening to me i am not the person you know

1082307 there is no higher life this is the only life there is which we share with animals thats the example i try to follow to share some of our human privilege with the beasts

1082335 what is required of the imagination is not simply relocation of the self from one subject position to another position that is already presupposed and defined in opposition to a position it itself has vacated instead the imagination must divest itself of all subject positions and language

1082347 landelijk wordt daarbij de norm gehanteerd van 2350 pati nten min of plus 400 op dit aantal is het norminkomen van een huisarts gebaseerd maar die norm kan niet als valbijl worden gehanteerd wie met minder inkomen genoegen wil nemen kan gerust minder pati nten aannemen

1082426 the argument came from when it started raining real hard then we were trying to blame one another for the idea of coming he said it was my idea i really felt like it was his idea thats where the argument came i had to leave the pit box because i was worried bob was going to like punch me in the neck or something

1082571 we have found an innovative way to kill the virus by finding this small region of hiv that is unchangeable
1082572 im on four different medications three of them are brand new and its the first time that ive ever been non detectible
1082573 im down to about just for the hiv about nine pills per day five in the morning and four at night
1082574 the virus is truly complex and has many tricks up its sleeve
1082575 the virus needs at least one constant region and that is the essence of calling it the achilles heel
1082576 what we already have in our hand are the abzymes that we could be infusing into the human subjects with hiv infection essentially to move the virus
1082577 that is the worry of the researcher this is what nightmares are made of that after 30 years of work you find it doesnt work
1082578 this is the holy grail of hiv research to develop a preventative vaccine

1082585 this group was one of the most vile antisemitic pro terrorist sites on the internet moreover it was the most active hate group of all heartily promoting hatred murder and genocide while proliferating abominable propaganda paralleled only by the fables of goebbels while such content clearly violates facebooks own terms of use and code of conduct provisions that users agree to abide when they register on the site facebook refused to take action despite thousands of user complaints over the course of eighteen months facebook allowed this group and its ubiquitous antisemitic lies to flourish facebooks own negligence and abdication of responsibility gave us no option but to take matters in our own hands we wish to be clear we have no issues with legitimate political discourse so long as it is contextual comparative and truthful however when it comes to encouraging the murder of jews and purposefully disseminating misinformation to demonize jews and to delegitimize israel there is a moral obligation to remove the platform of such repugnant hate mongers unfortunately we do not need to search too far back into history to realize that such evils have a real cost in terms of human lives
1082586 i thought we were in a total rhythm tonight offensively and it was predicated off our defense

1082593 you wont hear me say this too often but i couldnt agree more with the explanation that senator mccain offered a few weeks ago
1082594 what senator mccain neglected to mention was that during those thirty years he was in washington for twenty six of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil he voted against increased fuel efficiency standards and opposed legislation that included tax credits for more efficient cars he voted against renewable sources of energy against clean biofuels against solar power against wind power against an energy bill that while far from perfect represented the largest investment in renewable sources of energy in the history of this country so when senator mccain talks about the failure of politicians in washington to do anything about our energy crisis its important to remember that hes been a part of that failure now after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices the only energy proposal hes really promoting is more offshore drilling a position he recently adopted that has become the centerpiece of his plan and one that will not make a real dent in current gas prices or meet the long term challenge of energy independence

1082671 new york courts have a proud history of interpreting the new york constitution as providing greater protections for individual rights than the federal constitution this case presents an opportunity to continue that tradition by declaring that the new york constitution prohibits the government from seizing private homes simply to turn them over to a developer who covets them for a massive luxury condominium project

1082827 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
1082828 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
1082829 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

1082881 news flash channing tatum to appear at 2008 teen choice awards
1082882 will become in the near future part of the routine tee examination
1082883 you can essentially produce images in real time that look exactly like what you would see if you had the heart in front of you
1082884 its a display that surgeons or anyone else with any knowledge of the structure and function of the heart can immediately relate to
1082885 even for the trained eye a picture is worth a thousand words and this is a three dimensional animated picture that you can see in real time
1082886 this is much more than an incremental advance just like tee has overcome some of the limitations of tte 3d mtee will overcome some of the limitations of 3d tte and that will have its greatest impact on the ability to guide procedures and treat patients better both surgically and in a minimally invasive interventional manner this could be the key to opening up a wide range of procedures to patients in whom they otherwise would not have been possible
1082887 the use of 3d mtee imaging which is feasible in most patients provides superb imaging of native mitral valves making this modality an excellent choice for mitral valve surgical planning and guidance of percutaneous interventions
1082888 optimal aortic and tricuspid valve imaging will depend on further technological developments
1082889 the images will always be best of the structures that are closest to the imaging probe and since the probe is in the esophagus images of structures that are immediately adjacent to the esophagus will always be better
1082890 i think that the promise of this technology is ultimately a paradigm shift in terms of how we view ultrasound images
1082891 it will bring a shift in the way we acquire ultrasound data and on the display end it gives us the ability to have an infinite number of images from any given patient and the ability to display those images in a way that even an inexperienced observer could understand
1082892 this definitely has the potential to improve patient selection for procedures to provide improved imaging guidance during procedures and therefore to improve outcomes going forward 3d echo i believe will replace 2d echo as the default mode for echo imaging within 10 years
1082893 the human retina is part of the central nervous system yet it is separated by the optic nerve from the brain and a lot of the initial processing occurs in the retina before the information gets to the brain theyve basically done the same thing with this transducer having much of the processing occurring up front
1082894 as we show in this paper it is possible to obtain routinely excellent views of the mitral valve interatrial septum left atrial appendage and pulmonic veins
1082895 in its current stage of development the aortic valve leaflets are less well visualized nevertheless the aortic valve annulus and outflow tract can be nicely visualized which might be useful for guiding the placement of percutaneous aortic valves
1082896 this late in the game i didnt think there would be something new enough to really get me enthused about what new toys i had to play with
1082897 our results show that on the whole emergency physicians are doing a good job in picking up the patients with evolving mi before conclusive troponin tests are in
1082898 it was hard to tell from this study which factors are the most important in identifying these patients it was a combination of findings from the patients history clinical examination and ecg but what we have shown is that the emergency doctors best guess is usually right in finding these patients
1082899 we showed a strong association between burning chest pain and evolving mi burning chest pain is often taken as a symptom of gi reflux but i think one message from our study is that we should not be discounting burning pain as reflux as actually there is quite a high likelihood that it could be an acs
1082900 there are places where the triage system could be improved but on the whole i am happy with what we saw here it is reassuring to see that the admission patterns among the evolving mi patients were more aggressive than with the patients found not to be having an mi even though in both these groups the initial troponin results were not elevated this suggests that clinicians are not allowing the initial negative troponin results to overshadow their clinical impression
1082901 if patients with evolving mi are lumped in with this group then we could have a problem but our results suggest that this is relatively unlikely to happen in our study of 4136 patients just 187 were found to be having an evolving mi on the basis of the second troponin test because 76 of these were initially thought to be having an mi unstable angina or high risk chest pain only about 40 of these patients were not flagged after the initial examination

1082945 for over the last 200 years youve seen big companies grow off the concept of real time updates

1083057 today an unprecedented coalition has come together to confront the racial disparities in education and address the issue of education as a new civil rights movement to bring equality to education in this country
1083058 we challenge both presidential candidates to recognize that we havent come close to achieving racial equality in educational opportunity
1083059 it took our country 165 years to conclude that under our constitution separate isnt equal in education but still 54 years after brown v board of education too often our schools fail our highest needs students

1083148 vi ser et skift fra at stater blot styres via lovgivning til at de ogs reguleres gennem standardisering for 30 r siden var det n rmest ut nkeligt at man p internationalt plan kunne benytte disse redskaber
1083149 i esbjerg kommune har vi en h j andel af passive kontanthj lpsmodtagere det er s dan at s l nge ledige er passive f r vi kun den lave refusion p 35 procent fra staten men kommer de i aktivering stiger refusionen til 65 procent derfor er et af vores vigtigste m l at f de ledige i aktivering s hurtigt som muligt
1083150 vi har haft en meget stor personaleudskiftning i jobcentret hvilket har medf rt at for mange sager bare har ligget stille i for lang tid n r nye medarbejdere er kommet til har de ofte skulle starte forfra i sagerne hvilket ikke har v ret hensigtsm ssigt for hverken borgeren eller jobcentret med motorvejsprojektet og de nye arbejdsgange fastl gger vi nu hvad der skal ske i en sag n r en ny ledig melder sig i jobcentret og hvem der tager action p sagen vi holder med andre ord den ledige i gang mens sagsbehandleren s tter sig ind i sagen
1083151 vores m l er umiddelbart at komme op p en aktiveringsgrad p 55 procent hvad ang r antallet af aktiverede arbejdsl se men vi har ogs en r kke andre m l som indg r i en st rre kommunal sammenh ng en af vores opgaver er eksempelvis at bist med at skaffe arbejdskraft til omr dets virksomheder der er i jeblikket mangel p arbejdskraft og vi har cirka 2 400 kontanthj lpsmodtagere og ca 1000 forsikrede ledige i esbjerg kommune s det er en klar udfordring at f s mange som muligt af dem ud i jobs dertil kommer naturligvis at det er en stor samfundsm ssig udgift at have s mange ledige ser vi p den enkelte ledige borger s er der ogs en r kke fordele ved at vedkommende f r et arbejde et arbejde er jo med til at afhj lpe hvad der ellers m tte v re af sociale problemer
1083152 vi ser eksempelvis at det p byr dsniveau diskuteres hvordan vi i kommunen kan n lokale v kstm l blandt andet ved at sikre at der er arbejdskraft til r dighed det er en af positive ting der er sket efter kommunalreformen p omr det at vi har en st rrelse og indflydelse der g r at jobcenteret bliver en vigtig brik i det kommunale spil vi kan se at n r vi spiller ud med nye forslag s bliver der lyttet til os
1083153 jobcenter esbjerg bliver mere end nogensinde f r m lt og vejet p resultater og sammenlignet med jobcentre andre steder i landet det er en udfordring i en tid med stor personaleudskiftning ny lovgivning og nye sagsgange derfor er vi n dt til at effektivisere
1083154 ernst amp young har hjulpet os til at blive skarpe og m lbevidste vi l gger nu vores sagsbehandling i nogle meget faste rammer og hele vores sagsstyring er blevet meget strammere derudover har vi gjort brug af ernst amp youngs viden om hvordan man kan benytte investeringstankegangen p besk ftigelsesomr det alt i alt har vi haft et godt samarbejde med en fin ping pong af ideer
1083155 snitflader mellem de forskellige trin p motorvejen og snitfladerne omkring overlevering fra en medarbejder til en anden skal v re knivskarpe s arbejdsgangene er klare for alle gode sagsoverleveringer og korrekte registreringer er vigtige instrumenter i at sagerne kommer til at k re godt p tv rs af afdelinger og p tv rs af trin p motorvejene
1083156 n r vi kalder det et motorvejsprojekt s illustrerer det at man n r m let hurtigere hastigheden er lagt fast p forh nd det illustrerer ogs at der med god skiltning vises hvor der skal drejes af motorvejen er et godt billede p den vej borgerne skal have gennem jobcenterets system
1083157 det er noget de misunder os i udlandet vi har v ret stand til at blive enige om langt st rstedelen af statens udgifter i perioder der r kker langt ud over de siddende regeringer det betyder at erhvervslivet borgerne og de offentlige institutioner kan regne med en stabilitet og det er unik for danmark
1083158 den borgerlige regering ndrede strategi i forhold til finanslovsforhandlingerne da den kom til det har p flere m der gjort det lettere for politikerne at p virke finansloven f rhen var forhandlingerne under den tidligere sr regeringen meget gennemgribende i forhold til konomisp rgsm l hvor man nu forhandler aftaler p plads om dette ved siden af finanslovsforhandlingerne desuden har skattestoppet haft en stor disciplinerende effekt p politikerne da der nu ikke i l bet af forhandlingerne kan opfindes en ny afgift eller skat i l bet af forhandlingerne
1083159 i forhold til fordelingen af statens ressourcer spiller v rdisp rgsm l selvf lgelig ind det er en bevidst strategi fra dansk folkepartis side at s danne sager bliver taget op under finanslovsforhandlingerne
1083160 det er s ledes forskel p som parti at indg forlig i t r og s 10 r i rkenen og v re et parti der er med i forhandlingerne hvert r
1083161 det skal samlet gerne give 2 mia i nye penge og omprioriteringer indenfor rammen
1083162 n r de politiske resultater i forbindelse med finanslovsforhandlingerne er markante er det nogle gange rgerligt at der skal bruges s meget tid p at rette op p misforst elser der bliver i offentligheden fokuseret meget p sm symboler som at der blev serveret fl skesteg under finanslovsforhandlinger eller at der blev bevilliget et temmelig beskedent bel b til kystsikring af maabjerg kirke ved vesterhavet det skyldes nok at medierne finder det nemmere at skrive om de h ndgribelige enkeltsager fordi det er et meget stort arbejde at s tte sig grundigt ind i finansloven der er ikke mange der orker at l se de digre v rker
1083163 nogle gange m vi glemme vores politiske st steder og s tte os ind i sagerne eksempelvis har vi i 2001 indf rt to hele rlige arbejdsdage hvor den enkelte minister i selskab med et par embedsm nd skal pr sentere finanslovsforslaget p sit omr de for udvalget hvert medlem kan s skiftevis stille sp rgsm l til forslaget det er dog kun rent teknisk og g r eksempelvis p at hvor pengene f r var samlet p en konto er det nu splittet op i konto x og konto y det er en god m de at adskille politik og teknik p og det fungerer som et f lles udgangspunkt for det videre arbejde i finanslovsprocessen
1083164 jeg mener derimod at finansudvalget snarere b r blive det naturlige omdrejningspunkt om diskussionen om den almindelige konomiske udvikling som det er nu bliver vism ndene to gange rligt inviteret ind til en dr ftelse af deres seneste vismandsrapport i finansudvalget dette vil jeg gerne udbygge til et n rmere samarbejde med vism ndene om hvor de inviteres ind til diskussion af det konkrete finanslovsforslag det b r v re en diskussion af hvorvidt dansk konomi holder sig p sporet p l ngere sigt eksempelvis i forhold til m ls tningerne i regeringen 2015 plan p baggrund af det konkrete forslag
1083165 p den m de kan finansudvalget blive et v rksted hvor vi holder kursen og l bende justerer i forhold til de langsigtede m l slutter kristian thulesen dahl af
1083166 vi ser tit at der er en uhensigtsm ssig opdeling som egentlig er gammelt arvegods fra f r kommunalreformen de forskellige aktiveringsindsatser er stadig ikke integrerede inden for kommunerne og det betyder at vi oplever at der eksempelvis kan v re ledige pladser hos en aktiveringsudbyder mens der er booket helt op hos en anden indenfor den samme m lgruppe det er et typisk ressourcespild som kan ndres ved at udarbejde mere effektive arbejdsgange og aftaler mellem akt rerne eksempelvis ser vi at der er indg et aftaler om fast honorering for et forud aftalt antal pladser som kommunen skal betale uanset om pladserne anvendes til borgerne eller ej vi ser ogs at der er indg et aftaler om fast honorering af aktiviteterne s ledes at der skal afregnes fuld pris p forl b hvor udbyttet ikke p nogen m de kan v re tilfredsstillende samtidig ser vi ogs at kommunerne har vanskeligheder ved at op og nedjustere hvis der eksempelvis sker et fald i antallet af ledige s er der ingen grund til at have et apparat k rende som ikke har brugere men det er hvad der sker mange steder
1083167 de er slet ikke tidssvarende l ngere revalideringscentrenes sagsbehandling producerer ikke noget der umiddelbart kan oms ttes i den kommunale virkelighed i dag indsatsen p de tidligere revalideringscentre sigter ikke umiddelbart mod aktivering eller hurtigt arbejdsmarkedsintegration og tager meget lang tid her ser vi gode muligheder for at omstrukturere og samle kr fterne om et f lles m l
1083168 vi arbejder blandt andet ud fra en r kke idealprocesser om vi udbygger i t t samarbejde med den enkelte enhed i kommunens jobcenter sammen med ledelse og medarbejdere og som vi ved fungerer men det er ikke nok at opbygge et system af arbejdsgange vi er n dt til at g et skridt dybere og se p hele afdelingen eller enheden vi tror p at en effektiv arbejdsplads der leverer kvalitet starter med at v re en god arbejdsplads hvor det er rart at v re dern st kan vi begynde at se p hvilke tiltag vi kan udvikle i de enkelte tilf lde
1083169 rent styringsm ssigt er der en r kke fordele ved at benytte eksterne leverand rer p aktiveringsomr det vi kan eksempelvis mande op og ned meget hurtigt efter det aktuelle behov og vi kan stille meget specifikke krav til de eksterne leverand rer
1083170 det viser sig at de private leverand rer er bedre til nogle ting de har metodefrihed og de rammer der bliver tilbudt passer nogle ledige bedst det handler meget om kemi og der er det vores opgave i jobcenteret at vurdere hvad der er bedst i hvert enkelt tilf lde ud fra vores socialfaglige ekspertise
1083171 jeg tror egentlig ikke at vores resultater er enest ende vi ligger vel meget t t p landsgennemsnittet n r man ser p vores resultater p aktiveringsomr det de store resultater skal ses internt vi har f et bearbejdet og tilpasset vore arbejdsgange og samarbejdet og partnerskaber med de private er p mange m der praktisk viser vores erfaring brugen af andre akt rer kan ogs v re et redskab n r jobcenteret har rekrutteringsproblemer det kan v re en m de at flytte opgavel sningen fra kommunen til det private marked en anden v rdifuld ting er at vi med de private f r udvidet vores kontaktflade til arbejdsmarkedet de har simpelthen kontakter blandt virksomhederne som vi ikke vil v re i stand til at opbygge selv

1083180 its impossible to imagine a writer whose effect on a society has been greater than alexander solzhenitsyns effect on the fate of russia and the soviet union you could easily make the argument that he has done more than any other person to undermine the soviet union and lead to the collapse of the last empire on earth thats saying a lot for a writer

1083218 congressman kucinich has been a well known political figure in greater cleveland since 1967 when he first started running for office
1083219 and the scrutiny that was put on his presidential campaign by the local media probably wouldnt be construed as very positive frankly as well as the primary campaign by his primary opponents
1083220 and im talking about people who are not a bunch of republicans those folks havent liked him for a long time these are independent minded people as well as a surprising amount of democrats
1083221 hes had 12 years to show what he can do
1083222 and i think that people feel that while hes a very well intentioned person he has not been able to do a whole lot to benefit the greater cleveland economy
1083223 i think that it is the most cost effective and realistic goal that society should go for
1083224 i am convinced that you absolutely need to do more to get more resources out of the united states of america so drilling for oil offshore and in the alaskan wilderness i think are central things that symbolically send the message to the country and to the world that were not going to rely on foreign oil anymore but we need oil we cant pretend that the economy overnight is going to transition to fuel cells it will take years
1083225 id like to make the government a partner in doing that rather than a problem in doing that
1083226 my proposal would take the 2 billion dollars that the federal government spends today on fuel cells and make it 40 billion dollars
1083227 i get that number from the amount of taxes that one oil company exxon mobile pays on the average per year based on whats going on i would take the money that those folks are generating right now i would put it into fuel cell technology i think it could create tens of thousands of jobs in ohio over the course of the next 50 years and maybe even more
1083228 i would work diligently understanding that im not going to be passing a lot of legislation and neither has congressman kucinich hes only passed one bill in 12 years i would work diligently to get money for our cultural institutions for our businesses here for our higher education institutions for our health care institutions do the things that you can do to truly help your constituents and to make alliances to help make that type of thing happen i am kind of a builder i dont tend to get involved in the partisan fray and my job is to represent everybody so i think i can truly help working class people as well as middle class and wealthy people i dont have biases i want to help as many people as i can
1083229 they know that im trying to fight for this region and not going out doing my own agenda

1083232 we cant do better at least in our caucus until we dedicate ourselves to a new direction
1083233 and as a first step in this direction i believe it is imperative that bill deweese resign as house majority leader
1083234 bill deweeses presence as the leader of our caucus the face of our caucus dramatically undermines that effort to expand our majority and may even compromise it
1083235 i may even be in the minority in my belief that his resignation as leader is necessary
1083236 we owe it to our majority and to the citizens of our commonwealth to start having this conversation

1083301 we are seeing increasing demand for installations of solar energy systems as evidenced by our announcement of a contract with mc gowan builders inc mbg to install a solar energy system at the companys new headquarters in east rutherford nj

1083308 while the u s investment total is down compared to last yearsimpressive second quarter we still saw steady deal activity and investmentin the first half of the year which is encouraging
1083309 venturecapitalists commonly take the long view when it comes to investing whileipos and acquisitions may be rare now vcs arent concerned about that theyre focusing on whats next and thats reflected in the healthyearly stage investment were seeing in areas like renewable energy information services and business support services
1083310 the health care industry is the most concerning at the moment asinvestment is down 31 compared to the first six months of last year anddeal flow is at its lowest level in three years
1083311 the movement of venture dollars from the traditional areas ofinformation technology and health care toward burgeoning sectors likerenewable energy power management and agriculture or cleantechnology areas proves that venture capitalists are making good ontheir promise to tap opportunities in the massive energy market
1083312 the most encouraging part of this quarters report is that early stage investing is holding relatively steady thus far in 2008
1083313 it may be harder for entrepreneurial companies to raise venturecapital these days but its by no means impossible continued early stagedeal flow is a good sign that the venture industry is prepared to weatherthe economic downturn and will continue to back the next wave of disruptivetechnologies

1083325 what is unfolding is nothing less than a fundamental transformation of the worlds energy infrastructure
1083326 investment in the sustainable energy sectors must continue to grow strongly if targets for greenhouse gas reductions and renewables and efficiency increases are to be met
1083327 investment between now and 2030 is expected to reach 450 billion a year by 2012 rising to more than 600 billion a year from 2020 the sectors overall performance during 2007 and into 2008 sets it on track to achieve these levels
1083328 2007 was a banner year for the clean energy industry wind continued its strong progress with installed capacity passing the 100 gw mark solar is maturing rapidly with heavy investment to ease the silicon bottleneck and new thin film technology beginning to reach scale and there are plenty of other technologies lining up to be the next ones to begin a real march to scale including biomass and geothermal carbon capture and storage ccs is the only sector where we did not see as much progress as we had expected with the regulatory and funding environments for these projects remaining murky and timelines for the first commercial projects being extended
1083329 sharpened the countrys political resolve and strengthened programmes to promote cleaner generation and cut energy intensity
1083330 arguably the region that has the most to gain from renewable energy
1083331 the willingness to look beyond mature technologies suggests that investors are taking renewable energy and energy efficiency increasingly seriously
1083332 likely to encourage the larger publicly listed companies they normally invest in to expand into sustainable energy and other low carbon sectors
1083333 one reason for the steady growth of renewables is simple economics while the cost of fossil fuel energy is rising the costs of renewable energy technology are falling and with renewables there are no fuel costs and no carbon emissions
1083334 according to the iea a massive amount of us 20 trillion is projected to be invested to meet the worlds energy demand in 2030 if these investments are not made in a climate friendly way emissions of green house gases might go up by 50 in 2050 while science tells us they need to be cut by 50 in 2050 i hear businesses crying out for clear policy signals to make the right investment decisions today setting a long term target for 2050 is useful but i think it would give investors much more clarity if rich countries would indicate where they want to be in 2020 or 2030

1083377 speaker roberts remains committed to clean elections but concedes the supreme courts ruling is a major setback the speaker is reconvening the legislative working group later this month to explore possible ways over the roadblock created by the court
1083378 we are disappointed that the supreme court in washington has threatened such a promising program to clean up government in new jersey
1083379 it would be very difficult to convince candidates to do it without rescue money
1083380 i would say it is all but certain that were we to pass something it would likely be challenged constitutionally so we need to make sure that whatever we do it will pass constitutional muster
1083381 as far as clean elections is concerned it seems to me that the davis decision applies to individual candidates not to programs
1083382 i think that the supreme court decision confirms what ive been saying all along that this program was flawed from the beginning
1083383 i think we need to scrap it and at this point we dont have the money in the state of new jersey to operate a program like this its not the time for it and i think we need to more carefully study other states who have more carefully switched over to these other systems

1083425 and to conclude i dont believe in the sodomy allegations against anwar ibrahim in the same manner that i dont believe in the contents of rpks statutory declaration
1083426 source ktemoc konsiders meanwhile it appears that anwar ibrahim has now sought refuge in the turkish embassy which if nothing else adds to the melodrama of the entire incident but it does do one other thing bring the whole thing to an international level of visibility anwar earlier today issued a statement as to why via pkrs website and subsequently picked up by malaysiakini i am issuing this statement from within the embassy of the republic of turkey in kuala lumpur i was transported to the embassy earlier this morning fearing that my personal safety was in danger i thank all those who offered to assist me in this time of need and am grateful to the turkish ambassador for extending an invitation to seek refuge within the embassy since the march 8th elections numerous credible sources from within the government and military intelligence have advised me that certain agents from within barisan nasional leadership have initiated plots to cause harm to me or my family or my supporters i have been told that my assassination has not been ruled out as means to subvert the peoples will and bring an end to the transformational changes taking place in malaysia notwithstanding the threats which are intended to silence my voice i intend make public new evidence implicating that the inspector general of the police musa hassan and the attorney general gani patail engaged in criminal acts of fabricating evidence in cases launched against me in 1998 the allegations that have been made against me on saturday are nothing more than a replay of the events which transpired in 1998 when i was sacked from the office of the deputy prime minister jailed and beaten and then charged and convicted by a kangaroo court for crimes which i never committed this charade was orchestrated by a corrupt barisan nasional leadership which made use of the entire apparatus of the state power including its control of the judiciary the police force and its grip on the mainstream media these actions are being repeated today to undermine the forces of reform and renewal which were unleashed in the march 2008 elections i would like to assure my family friends and supporters in malaysia that i am safe and remain committed as ever before to continuing the struggle for a free and just malaysia source pkr website so since the above up to this point is walski pretty much rehashing whats been reported elsewhere you might be wondering whats walskis take on all this lets just say that walski can think of a few possibilities possibility 1 all this is a political melodrama tit for tat walski up until now has not commented on the statutory declaration made by raja petra kamaruddin needless to say without any concrete evidence to back it up rpks sd is quite far fetched and walski is not alone in thinking this walski will not however go as far to say that rpk made the whole thing up merely that without proof its one mans word against another many others in fact then again petes shown the proof of other allegations in the past it could also be a chess game on rpks part whos biding for time before the checkmate move with rpk you can never really tell for sure possibility 2 that this is certain high ranking people in bn orchestrating moves to eliminate anwar ibrahim from the malaysian political landscape now the problem walski has with this scenario is can bn really be that stupid nothing is impossible of course and there is evidence to suggest this possibility like the current igp and attorney general both being involved with the earlier conviction of anwar on sodomy charges which were subsequently overturned in 2004 and anwar says that he will release the proof of the 1998 collusion which adds to the plausibility of this scenario unless bn is in terminal denial however pulling this stunt off now is going to further hurt bns credibility which in walskis opinion is at an all time low its another attempt at political suicide if that were the case possibility 3 the real truth lies somewhere in between and this to walski is the most plausible explanation at this juncture to paraphrase what kaytees said in the post quoted above theres simply been too much bullshit slung in all directions lately to discern the truth anymore the multitudity of pungent odors just clouds the mind and nose needless to say the situation we have before us is to put it mildly interesting and intriguing if anwar says he has to goods to prove the collusion 1998 now would probably be a good time to make it public and by the way up until now were still waiting for those bn defections another thing that anwar has been talking a lot about in recent times incidentally helen ang frequent contributor to the peoples parliament has proposed an interesting scenario about the possible defactions of minor bn component parties they could go independent of both bn and the peoples coalition pakatan rakyat so if this scenario does happen anwars prognostication of bn losing the right to form government indirectly would come true which leaves us with the evidence that anwar says he has and intends to release the lingam tapes created quite a few ripples what sort of big splash can we expect with the next promised revelation until then all walski can say is that we definitely are living in interesting times where change is the only constant and uncertainty the only thing we can be sure of posted by walski69 at 11 31 00 pm post categories politics scandals 2 comments ckgord said jom liwat sama sama anwar gay gay why not jom gay gay ar gua gay lu gay kita gay

1083627 its easier when youre picking up stunting defensive lines because the angles are a lot easier for the offensive linemen to take on the defensive linemen because really what youre doing is your working an area so if your man stunts inside you know the guy next to you is coming in that direction hell take him so all you have to focus on is your steps and your technique then its up to the back to pick the hole based on what he sees which is what edge is comfortable with because thats a lot of what did when he was there
1083628 the advantage of blocking down and pulling linemen is it creates holes because youre essentially cutting the defense in half youre more determining where the hole is going to be and if the blocks are done correctly there will be bigger holes for the back to go into in the power scheme more of those runs are going to hit into the holes where they were designed where in the zone scheme we can start in one direction and it can actually bend all the way back

1083720 if some problem happened on the air people would just joke with each other saying well nobody watches us anyway it was very self defeating
1083721 arabs sit in their homes in front of the television and they surf like crazy
1083722 you rarely find someone who says they watch al hurra it may be number 10 on their dial but definitely not first not second not third not fourth
1083723 registered lobbyists have donated large amounts of money to senator john mccains presidential campaign even as he denounces their profession so far mr mccain who has locked up the republican presidential nomination has received more than 181 600 from lobbyists and trade groups while mr obama has received just over 6 000 senator hillary rodham clinton who ended her bid for the presidency in june got more than 87 000
1083724 the republican hunt for a vice president has focused on one word money
1083725 john mccains new ad is dishonest and shameful and i say that as the former chief of medical operations senators hagel and reed confirmed to bob schieffer yesterday that senator obama visited the combat support hospital in baghdad as a part of their codel with no media present
1083726 in germany senator obama made the right decision to respect wounded troops and the doctors and nurses doing crucial and time sensitive work by not making a visit that was characterized as a campaign event by the pentagon
1083727 senator obama has voted for the troops when john mccain has not most recently on the new gi bill i am happy that senator obama puts the welfare of our troops above politics

1083733 judge ambro said that the core guarantee of equal protection ensuring citizens that their state will not discriminate on account of race would be meaningless were we to approve the exclusion of jurors on the basis of race i respectfully dissent
1083734 mumia and i had a legal conference this afternoon july 22
1083735 the indisputable facts are that the prosecutor engaged in racism in selecting the jury in this case and that bigotry lingers today in philadelphia it would be naive not to realize that this case continues to reek of politics and injustice

1083739 en principio hay reticencias a cerrar tratados de libre comercio con econom as que producen lo mismo que nosotros y as lo dijimos cuando defendimos el acuerdo con panam en la asamblea legislativa hace unas semanas
1083740 el pa s vecino tiene una econom a muy complementaria y est n en servicios y nosotros en la producci n de bienes lo cual brindar a grandes ventajas
1083741 por eso cuando escuchamos al gobierno hablando de colombia per y de brasil sobre un posible tlc les pedimos que se concentren en sacarle el provecho a los acuerdos ya firmados m xico canad rep blica dominicana comunidad del caribe y chile y a potenciar los beneficios del comercio con estados unidos y del acuerdo de asociaci n con europa que aunque es un mercado muy exigente en calidad paga mucho mejor
1083742 el gobierno debe de tirar con un rifle que tenga mirada telesc pica y no con una escopeta a todo lo que venga ya que puede perder realmente el norte hacia las econom as que son complementarias y que realmente nos permitir an obtener m s beneficios
1083743 the most influential legal thinker in the development of modern american interrogation policy is not a behavioral psychologist international lawyer or counterinsurgency expert i quickly realized that the prime mover of american interrogation doctrine is none other than the star of fox televisions 24 jack bauer

1083745 were definitely going to investigate and look into things and if there are any changes that need to be made were certainly going to take those into account and do what needs to be done to make sure the jails run properly
1083746 its our position that at this time and pending investigation and research the searches that we have conducted have been reasonable to ensure that weapons contraband things are not introduced into the jail population and thats for the protection of the people that we house there
1083747 there was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war with iran
1083748 the one plan that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the strait of hormuz start a shoot up
1083749 might cost some lives and it was rejected because you cant have americans killing americans thats the kind of thats the level of stuff were talking about provocation
1083750 look is it high school yeah are we playing high school with you know 5 000 nuclear warheads in our arsenal yeah we are were playing you know whos the first guy to run off the highway with us and iran

1083753 saya berharap bisa menambah pemain ke dalam skuad sekarang juga demi menjaga keseimbangan dan menghidupkan persaingan tidak hanya satu saya membutuhkan sejumlah wajah baru
1083754 real madrid cf dan hamburg sv telah mencapai kesepakatan untuk transfer lima musim pemain belanda rafael van der vaart kesepakatan ini tercapai setelah sang pemain menjalani pemeriksaan medis dan ia pun telah menandatangani kontrak
1083755 saya bahagia sekaligus sedih saya memiliki saat sat indah di sini hamburg terasa perih saat akan pergi masyarakat selalu mendukung diriku bahkan di masa masa sulit seperti saat insiden valencia van der vaart pernah gagal ditransfer ke valencia
1083756 saya merinding setiap kali bermain untuk hamburg sangat klise untuk berkata bahwa hamburg selalu akan ada di hatiku namun hal tersebut sungguhan dan akan tetap demikian

1083758 its a serious situation but theres a lot of things we need to do we have a lot of work to do and im afraid its a very hard struggle particularly given the situation on the iraq pakistan border
1083759 ma il paradosso che entrambi i due operatori che distribuiscono
1083760 non serve a niente discutere con linevitabile lunico argomento possibile con un vento maligno mettersi il cappotto
1083761 nobody in the history of modern politics has been a bigger media sweetheart than john mccain and in this campaign he is allowed to virtually say or do anything without being called on it for mccain to make the claim that he is getting screwed by the mainstream media is truly laughable but give mccains campaign credit theyve done a good job of shoveling this manure into the public consciousness
1083762 should i really watch this daytime t v is rubbish wow isnt the x files looking old
1083763 el orgullo de haber sido y el dolor de ya no ser
1083764 i dont know how you respond to something that is as such a false depiction of what actually happened colonel macfarland was contacted by one of the major sunni sheiks because of the surge we were able to go out and protect that sheik and others and it began the anbar awakening i mean thats just a matter of history
1083765 why would we expect political officials to do anything other than break the law if we continuously tell them as weve been doing that they are exempt from consequences and how can bush or nixon be criticized for conceiving of the presidency as being above the law when thats how our political establishment including many democrats explicitly conceive of it as well
1083766 the blogs were a bit out of control were very mindful of the media coverage and blogs in controlling misinformation all i can say is were going to continue to stay on top of it the misinformation that came out over the weekend fed a lot of depositors fears
1083767 i think its going to be months that were working our way through this period clearly months but again its a safe banking system a sound banking system our regulators are on top of it this is a very manageable situation
1083768 i think the right word to describe this is incremental in terms of a change in the complexion of the court
1083769 i dont think it will return them to being the most conservative court in the country but it wont make them more liberal either well just have to wait and see
1083770 it certainly helps in term of caseloads and moving appeals
1083771 justice agees qualifications to serve on the fourth circuit are as impressive as any circuit court nominee for whom i have voted in my 30 years in the senate

1083782 in every case i was involved in i thought it was an abuse
1083783 we dont know how many guns were actually confiscated or returned to their owners
1083784 in fact the firearms were found in a locked safe when the officers executed the warrant
1083785 the whole point was to make sure it was limited and constitutional
1083786 the bottom line from our perspective is it may very well have saved lives

1083819 die saxo bank hat einen punkt und eine gr sse erreicht bei denen es nur nat rlich scheint zwei erfahrene profis hinzuziehen die daran gew hnt sind eine grosse internationale firma zu leiten
1083820 wir gehen keinesfalls in rente indem wir einen alten plan umsetzen trennen wir uns lediglich von den routinen des tagesgesch ftes und werden nat rlich nach wie vor an der entwicklung der bank beteiligt sein
1083821 wir ben tigen einfach die hilfe der beiden um zur n chsten etappe berzugehen die umwandlung der saxo bank in ein wirklich globales unternehmen
1083822 wir haben ein schnelles wachstum von 437 mitarbeitern ende 2005 auf heute fast 1 400 erlebt rylberg und poulsen an bord zu holen und sie unseren globalen betrieb rationalisieren und optimieren zu lassen erscheint uns einfach als die perfekte bereinstimmung
1083823 wir haben das wachstum und die entwicklung der saxo bank genau verfolgt und ich kann nur sagen ich f hle mich privilegiert dass man mich zusammen mit karsten poulsen gebeten hat die bank durch die n chste stufe ihres k nftigen wachstums und ihrer entwicklung zu f hren
1083824 die saxo bank ist jetzt schon eine klasse f r sich und ich sehe in einem unternehmen das so schnell zum f hrenden anbieter in ihrem sektor geworden ist ein gewaltiges potential unsere aufgabe wird darin bestehen die organisation zu konsolidieren und die position der bank als f hrender anbieter und trendsetter in den globalen kapitalm rkten zu sichern
1083825 die saxo bank war 16 jahre lang unser leben und steht jetzt besser als je zuvor da
1083826 wir sind fest davon berzeugt dass jetzt die beste zeit f r eine staffel bergabe gekommen ist mit diesem neuen f hrungs team am ruder wollen wir das unternehmen umgestalten und seine position als f hrender anbieter auf den globalen kapitalm rkten konsolidieren

1083828 as i got more and more pregnant i began to gain weight so it looked silly having a really skinny body double
1083829 i think he would be self protective because i dont think his feelings would be reciprocated in that way even though theyve entered into this partnership although biblically speaking you are supposed to take on your dead brothers wife
1083830 ultimately i dont think its going to play out this season because she has other fish to fry
1083831 i wonder which animal they will dream of or pretend to be as they snooze
1083832 al qaeda aimed to literally take down the west to kill thousands and they have to create economic havoc and they have
1083833 they needed enthusiastic uncontrollably enthusiastic warriors like that accused right there salim hamdan
1083834 mr hamdan is not an al qaeda warrior he is not last line of defence hes not even an al qaeda member

1083837 its capital h as in handsome with a capital h
1083838 and its totally valid hes tall dark and manly definitely handsome
1083839 i still havent fully moved in there are boxes i still need to unpack and i havent bought all of my furniture
1083840 ive been meaning to buy a couch but i havent found the time im also at a loss when it comes to decorating this place needs a womans touch
1083841 maybe hes really busy maybe hes freaking out about you guys maybe hes going through something with him family
1083842 i could sort of maybe kind of perhaps one day see myself marrying you ish
1083843 interseroh und alba arbeiten in unterschiedlichen m rkten erg nzen sich aber ber die gesamte wertsch pfungskette zum nutzen beider unternehmen sehr gut
1083844 ziel ist es die marktposition von interseroh im europ ischen rahmen auszubauen und zu st rken im aktuellen konsolidierungsprozess wollen wir eine aktive rolle einnehmen
1083845 die idee der alba group fu t darauf dass zwei eigenst ndige und gleichberechtigte unternehmen am markt gemeinsam agieren wenn dies zu ihrem gegenseitigen nutzen ist
1083846 you sure you dont drink you can have one right you want a sip of mine are you sure really nothing i can do to get you to have one have a shot with me im going to get you drunk when youre not paying attention
1083847 i was partying too much true i was hurting my business being hungover all the time true i was getting sick too often true i have an addictive personality true i have no middle ground
1083848 how am i acting right now is this appropriate what is this person going to say when i say this how is this going to come off what do i look like right now are my hand gestures appropriate am i smiling an appropriate amount am i acting authentic for the situation
1083849 are you saying too much how are people going to perceive this
1083850 hes trying to come back early but i told him to rest hes very frustrated hes upset he wants to rest up so he can play later
1083851 with burwell parrom and lawrence i got three guards who can score and put the ball in the basket
1083852 they all share the ball and im excited about that you need good guards to win and those two parrom and lawrence are real good guards
1083853 we knew there were problems there but thats superintendent del burns call on suspending him
1083854 im going to tell him to check his pockets once he drops us off i think hes going to be happy with what he discovers
1083855 if you see the benster you better check your pockets cause you may find a very nice present
1083856 people have always assumed that people like jamie dont really have opinions on anything remotely complex
1083857 youre not invited to even look for matches date ability fail
1083858 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1083859 this transformation will be costly and given the fiscal disaster we will inherit from the last administration it will likely require us to defer some other priorities
1083860 like all compromises this one has its drawbacks it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1083861 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1083862 like george bush and dick cheney before him he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than 1 million from big oil just last month
1083863 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1083864 al qaeda aimed to literally take down the west to kill thousands and they have to create economic havoc and they have
1083865 they needed enthusiastic uncontrollably enthusiastic warriors like that accused right there salim hamdan
1083866 mr hamdan is not an al qaeda warrior he is not last line of defence hes not even an al qaeda member
1083867 the first thing is to try to get in the habit of saving and this lives within a broader idea of simply living within your means
1083868 if you can consistently find a way to spend less than you make and be comfortable with that then you will be able to generate some required or cushion amount to save yourself from uncertainty in the future
1083869 they want to give you that free money and all you need to do to get it is save
1083870 your relationships are part of your financial stability just like your health is
1083871 the most obvious thing here is that the healthier you are the more productive you will be and the more earnings you will have if you can avoid early onset of diseases that are expensive healthy people have a more secure retirement and will live longer
1083872 set the selectedvalue property of the cascadingdropdown control to the value you want selected
1083873 congress will not stand for any backdoor effort by the political appointees to further cripple our nations ability to respond to vital health and safety concerns
1083874 this entire effort is the product of a flawed politicized process that has failed to properly consider the views of experts or the consequences for workplace health
1083875 mshas report affirms the conclusions reached by our own investigation murray energy should not have proposed the flawed retreat mining plan and msha should not have approved the plan
1083876 especially troubling is mshas conclusion that murray energy misled msha regarding bumps that occurred in march 2007
1083877 we will review mshas investigation report and that of the forthcoming review of mshas actions at the mine the agencys track record however leads me to believe that msha is not up to the task of protecting the health and safety of our nations miners we must ensure that another tragedy such as this never happens again
1083878 as this report confirms congress did the right thing for young children early childhood education programs and taxpayers by ending a test that was poorly conceived and implemented and was never proven to be valid reliable or effective
1083879 nothing is more important than investing in our children from their earliest years on this study should serve as a valuable resource for both the federal government and states as we continue our efforts to strengthen our nations early childhood education programs so that we can help all children arrive at kindergarten ready to succeed
1083880 america wont be able to maintain our great legacy of innovation and discovery let alone compete in todays global economy unless we make investing in math and science education a top priority
1083881 last year congress took a critical first step by enacting legislation to provide workers with the training and skills needed to compete in 21st century jobs now we must build on that down payment by working with business leaders and key stakeholders to help arm students with an excellent foundation in math science and other cutting edge fields
1083882 math and science are the new foundational literacy for everyone
1083883 hands on demonstrations and exercises not only help to bring math and science concepts to life but also work to pique the teachers natural curiosity and awaken their sense of inquiry and problem solving also helping them to see these concepts through their students perspective
1083884 we believe it essential to secure the technical talent pipeline for the future
1083885 mathmovesu is designed to engage middle school students on their own terms and make the connection between math their interests and cool careers
1083886 if our students are to become our future engineers computer scientists mathematicians and environmentalists we need to change the way we approach the teaching of math and science
1083887 academy teachers have been taught how to plan creatively teach constructively and reflect objectively
1083888 while both girls and boys have natural interests and abilities in science math and technology society does not yet have equal expectations for or offer equal support to girls interested in these fields
1083889 when both girls and boys are encouraged to pursue their interests they are inspired to think about their futures and are better prepared to pursue a wide range of exciting opportunities in high school college and beyond
1083890 todays students face daunting obstacles on the path to college from skyrocketing tuition prices to predatory student lending tactics this landmark bipartisan legislation will address these challenges and create a higher education system that is more consumer friendly fairer and easier to navigate
1083891 already this congress has taken historic steps to make college more affordable and accessible with todays vote we are saying that in our nations higher education programs the needs of students and families must always come first
1083892 this bill is a real victory for college students and their families it puts quality information in the hands of consumers and takes meaningful steps to hold down the college cost increases that are threatening students ability to pursue their higher education dreams
1083893 i applaud todays bipartisan vote and look forward to this bills swift enactment
1083894 this bill is crucial to the health of our economy and will ensure that more students graduate prepared for the 21
1083895 it puts smart strategies in place to improve our student aid process restore confidence in our student loan programs and provide more low income first generation and minority students the chance to pursue a college education
1083896 i am thrilled at the passage of the higher education opportunity act the first reauthorization of the higher education act in 10 years
1083897 it is obvious from these events that existing rules and efforts by osha to prevent these explosions are not sufficient the agency should immediately issue an emergency standard to prevent these explosive hazards failing that congress will act to ensure that the agency does its job
1083898 it is clear from oshas report that imperial sugar had a company wide problem with sugar dust not even the deaths of 13 workers raised alarm bells with the company as proven by the dangerous conditions exposed at imperials gramercy la plant more than a month later
1083899 the increase in the minimum wage comes at an important time for the millions of americans struggling to make ends meet
1083900 these pay increases arent just about helping workers provide for their families unlike tax breaks for the wealthy the minimum wage increase for american workers will be spent locally which is good for local businesses large and small and good for a struggling economy
1083901 democrats in congress have been working to ensure that all americans are able to share in the benefits provided by their hard work
1083902 the nations staggering child obesity epidemic is putting the well being of our schoolchildren and our nations long term health and economic strength at grave risk
1083903 with kids becoming less physically active overall educating schoolchildren about the importance of exercise and good nutrition is essential to tackling the childhood obesity crisis in this country
1083904 physical education must return to a standard part of our education curriculum
1083905 for many kids because of economic or environmental concerns school may very well be the only place they are able to participate in any sort of physical activity
1083906 the childhood obesity crisis in the cannot be overstated the epidemic is so severe that some experts predict that this generation of americans may be the first to have shorter lives than their parents
1083907 im struck by the dangerous number of kids who are not yet overweight but are headed down the road to ill health because they get so little physical activity and they have such unhealthy diets
1083908 the solution has to be focused on getting our kids to embrace regular exercise and good nutrition
1083909 movement in classrooms is an exciting development in school fitness regular classroom teachers are leading their students in fitness activities that complement not supplant teaching in core academic subjects were showing teachers that including activity in the regular classroom day gets students ready to learn and also teaches that lifelong habits are essential for good health
1083910 we cannot solve our health care crisis without addressing the obesity crisis
1083911 by teaching kids healthy habits early in life and increasing their physical activity we will help reduce childhood obesity improve academic test scores save billions of dollars in health care costs and save lives
1083912 this is a historic day in the fight for equal rights for women if we are serious about closing the gender pay gap we must get serious about punishing those who would otherwise scoff at the weak sanctions under current law
1083913 any wage gap based on gender is unacceptable especially during these tough economic times by allowing wage discrimination to continue we hold down women and their families while harming the american economy as a whole
1083914 its completely unacceptable that women continue to be discriminated against in the workplace receiving a fraction of the pay of men
1083915 we must confront such discrimination head on and ensure that all americans regardless of gender receive an equal paycheck for equal pay for equal work
1083916 does not sufficiently leverage its existing tools to increase compliance
1083917 although the department of labor has the necessary tools to fight wage theft the gao investigation suggests that the problem of wage theft is only getting worse because of weaker enforcement
1083918 in too many cases the wage and hour division has simply dropped the ball in pursuing employers that cheat its workers out of their hard earned wages
1083919 it hurts workers and their families places ethical employers at a competitive disadvantage robs resources from public coffers in unpaid taxes and denies communities of the economic stimulus provided by wages spent in local communities
1083920 the pension benefit guaranty corporation must comply with our subpoena the administrations dismissal of a legally enforceable congressional subpoena is completely unacceptable
1083921 as the u s district court affirmed just today executive branch officials must fully comply with congressional subpoenas and provide all non privileged documents i take seriously our committees constitutional mandate to investigate matters subject to our legislative jurisdiction and expect the agency to cease its lawless intransigence
1083922 this landmark investment in hbcus will strengthen college opportunities for millions of talented students
1083923 hbcus are a vital part of americas higher education and economic framework and have a long history of producing some of our nations greatest leaders innovators and thinkers by providing hbcus with these much needed federal resources we are saying that the needs of these vital institutions and their students can no longer go ignored
1083924 hbcus have played and continue to play an integral role in furthering the education of black students in america
1083925 unfortunately these institutions face increasing challenges and have limited resources i am very pleased with the historical investment to hbcus that the college cost reduction and access act will provide it is a much needed step in the right direction and will go a long way toward helping hbcus continue to provide a quality education to our nations youth
1083926 as a graduate of the university of arkansas pine bluff i and my brothers sisters nephews cousins and friends know firsthand the opportunities provided by hbcus especially to low income african american students
1083927 chairman george miller and the committee on education and labor are to be commended for this outstanding bill
1083928 this secret regulation is an attempt by the bush administration and the business community to fundamentally weaken the scientific process for enacting new regulations that protect american workers
1083929 for nearly eight years this administration has consistently failed to respond in a meaningful way to the real health and safety threats workers face while on the job but now they will stop at nothing to rush through a secret rule that will tie the hands of health and safety experts when responding to our nations critical health and safety threats
1083930 its outrageous that after spending seven and a half years refusing to respond to known workplace hazards the bush administration is now rushing to make it more difficult to protect workers from these dangers
1083931 if we are truly committed to realizing our vision of an equal and excellent public education for every child in this country there is no question that we need to build on these bold and effective reforms that are turning around some of our most challenging schools
1083932 i believe we should be treating teachers like the professionals they are and that means not only paying them as professionals but also holding them accountable as professionals that would go a long way toward ensuring we have top quality teachers in high needs schools the single most important factor in closing the achievement gap
1083933 we must make sure that as a country the results we are seeing are meaningful in terms of our students results
1083934 im extremely proud to be able to say that in the 13 months since taking over the schools weve already made dramatic meaningful lasting changes
1083935 quality teachers in urban districts successfully raise student achievement levels even in the face of poverty violence high rates of aids and other stds low expectations obesity teen pregnancy and other issues that enter our schools with our children
1083936 the mayoral governance structure has allowed us for the first time to bring a librarian teacher music teacher psychologist and physical education teacher to all schools that need them
1083937 this year all 62 elementary schools including our charter schools met ayp for the first time in history we are still climbing the tough path to total transformation but with achievement gaps melting away and the strong support of our community our goal is in sight
1083938 we are one of the few districts in the country that has shut down underperforming schools and replaced the entire school staff
1083939 this turnaround school strategy has taken some of our lowest performing schools and doubled or tripled test scores within a few years same kids different teachers new leadership and a new educational approach and the results are dramatic
1083940 parents deserve every assurance that they have entrusted the safety health and welfare of their child to a reputable and qualified treatment program unfortunately as the gao found in far too many cases residential treatment programs have violated parents trust in some of the worst ways imaginable with this consumer guide parents will be able to better navigate the myriad of programs and make safer choices for their teens
1083941 parents also need and deserve greater transparency when researching and choosing which residential treatment programs would be the best fit for their children the legislation we passed last month would help prevent deceptive marketing practices and require programs to provide parents with full and fair information about the qualifications roles and responsibilities of their staff
1083942 tomorrow is a pivotal day for the millions of low and middle income students who depend on need based loans to help pay for college
1083943 the democratic congress believes that making college more affordable is one of the most important things we can do to invest in our nations future and build a stronger middle class this first interest rate cut is just the beginning of our efforts to remove the many financial barriers that prevent far too many qualified students from being able to pursue a college degree
1083944 this much needed help for college students and their families couldnt come soon enough senator kennedy believes strongly that we cannot allow todays slumping economy to rob young americans of their chance to achieve the american dream
1083945 im pleased to announce these talented new additions to the staff of the education and labor committee
1083946 i know that they will be able to continue the important work that the committee does to improve the lives of our nations schoolchildren students workers and families

1083949 both occupants had some injuries to what extent i do not know
1083950 theres no indication that either alcohol or drugs were involved
1083951 with todays economy making it harder and harder for families to pay the bills more children than ever are in need of healthy nutritious and inexpensive meals
1083952 it is deeply worrisome that climbing food costs combined with stagnant federal support for child nutrition programs may force schools and programs to offer less healthy options for kids raise prices for school meals or serve fewer children
1083953 you can only stretch the food dollar so far as food costs continue to rise we are challenged to do more with much less
1083954 at the end of the day however what school nutrition directors are doing to lessen the impact of rising costs is still not enough our programs need additional help in order to provide the highest quality healthiest meals available to students each day
1083955 providing nutritious snacks for 0 68 cents or a healthy lunch for 2 98 is an enormous challenge in our area and elsewhere not close to the sources of food
1083956 we would also love to serve our children fresh fruits and vegetables whole grains and low fat milk but the current reimbursement rates for the afterschool and summer nutrition programs make that next to impossible
1083957 i know ill never trust a single thing you say you knew your lies would divide us but you lied anyway and all the lies have got you floating up above us all but what goes up has got to fall

1084018 i asked the head of fas to draft a package of laws which should improve anti monopoly legislation in order to prevent cartel deals create transparent and clear competition rules
1084019 i ask you in your role as deputy prime minister to take it under control
1084020 you must do what you must to protect the consumer as well as to promote economic development because cartel collusion can lead to stagnation
1084021 the flaw in the existing law is that it only covers legal entities as a whole while violations committed by individual company executives cannot be prosecuted
1084022 with the amendments senior executives would be more conscious of their responsibilities knowing fully that it is not only the companys money at stake
1084023 the new rules appear to be part of the ongoing government effort to clamp down on companies with a dominant position in the market to keep prices in check
1084024 however the provision for 10 years imprisonment for an economic crime such as forming a cartel may be way too tough

1084086 our bill strengthens the protections for american businesses which are more and more becoming the focus of identity thieves by adding two new causes of action under the cyber extortion statute threatening to obtain or release information from a protected computer and demanding money in relation to a protected computer so that this bad conduct can be federally prosecuted

1084116 we learn a great deal from our customers through this channel and we learn better ways to present information and what the pinch points are in the relationship one of the more fascinating things has been customers that had complaints but never reached out to us to correct them it is so much better to see them have the service we intend i think companies should be where their customers are social media is just another channel similar to the phone chat or email

1084148 as a force contributing to social and economic development open and distance learning is fast becoming an accepted and indispensable part of the mainstream of educational systems in both developed and developing countries

1084150 dina is still working on the date of the party but its looking like towards the end of the year lindsays new album spirit in the dark is out in november so the wedding could be held around then theyve been keeping the relationship quiet for months and trying to pass each other off as just good friends but theyve decided it isnt a fling its for life so they want to make their romance public

1084155 a crazy old man who cant keep his stories straight hes a doddering fool hes a dangerous burning fuse that cannot be trusted with the reins of government its not so much that hes a flip flopper but that he doesnt even remember his flips or flops even his own campaign says to ignore him
1084156 these are dangerous times we cannot afford to elect a doltish forgetful rash warmonger to lead the nation
1084157 this isnt about age its about competence perhaps in this case thats tied to age or more accurately to the patterns that some people fall into as they age they may have difficulty processing simple events or they cannot remember specific things that they say or they become unnecessarily angry or they view the world as a reflection of whatever thought happens to be passing through their minds at the time
1084158 the man says things that are patently untrue then says the opposite which he then denies that he said
1084159 if mccain is elected his incapacities may well result in a government run not by the president but by his vice president and ideological bureaucrats with their own particular agendas not answerable to the people of course thats what happened upon bushs election in bushs case it was intellectual and moral insufficiencies in mccains case it is most likely mental impairment

1084166 the most important goal is to draw attention to the tibet issue to show sympathizers in the city that we exist and to show the world that such action is possible in russia
1084167 the lack of protests does not mean that russian citizens are indifferent to the issue of tibet and what is happening there
1084168 we were told by a smolny city hall official not to organize any protests during the olympics
1084169 we would fail to coordinate with the authorities any mass protest if we tried to
1084170 its quite a dangerous thing and many people would prefer to meditate on this issue or light a candle at home rather than in a public place
1084171 it will be easy to escape from there if the police interfere
1084172 i think the protests are banned and suppressed for economic reasons rather than political ones
1084173 but on the whole theres a problem with democracy in russia thats why they ban things
1084174 the dalai lama says in his letter of support to our campaign that people in the free world take freedom for granted
1084175 this is the essence of our campaign making people stop and think about their freedom wed like people to think about what it means to them to imagine how it feels to be deprived of it and to have a say about it

1084178 pulkovo airport is meaningful and significant for the city and we are delighted to see numerous bids
1084179 in my opinion india and turkey are unlikely to have good chances if they participate without considerable financial back up but a surprising update on partnership issues may be the next part of the tender process
1084180 the strategic partnership of lider asset management and vienna international airport allows both our companies to coordinate efforts and gain a synergic effect from the cooperation of the two companies
1084181 the rates will at most double investors are attracted because airports are at present probably the only kind of promising asset not being distributed
1084182 we have approved estimates but they are still approximate and the figures are not to be made public
1084183 the terminals at pulkovo 1 and pulkovo 2 are capable of handling the passenger flow
1084184 but only half of the amount has so far reached the state coffers as most of the violators are too poor to afford the fines
1084185 about 80 000 rubles in fines for employing an illegal manual laborer is quite a big burden for most employers but the penalty is worth it as it makes an employer think twice before taking the risk
1084186 judging from random raids our inspectors carry out the violations revealed are only a tip of the iceberg
1084187 we are fighting a war which is almost impossible to win when employers are running for cheap laborers in pursuit of quick and big profits forgetting the fact that illegal immigrants live in this city at the expense of tax payers
1084188 after all thats a question for tax collectors not me
1084189 therell be a fundamental management change after this chain of events

1084210 has been through this several times before so shes a pro
1084211 christopher reeve has been a great example of what a disabled person can do
1084212 people are curious when they see me and i want them to approach me this way they learn about my disability and about me as a person
1084213 i use humor im always laughing and like to see people laugh humor breaks down some of the barriers and makes me approachable i also watch body language which helps me gauge how to deal with people
1084214 be open dont be afraid to ask questions take the time to talk and be sure to listen dont be reluctant to ask how to help in case they ever need assistance or emergency help and please dont assume or be judgmental about a person or their disability for example some assume i was a smoker but i wasnt im on oxygen because of a lung dysfunction
1084215 i believe god put me here so people could see me meet me and be aware of those of us with disabilities
1084216 im here to let students know its okay to get to know me im comfortable with this they can be too a lot of students have never been exposed to a person with a disability so its good that im here
1084217 my supervisor told me to be straight with the kids and explain what happened
1084218 they are naturally curious and need to know after that we were all just fine
1084219 we encourage fellowship and connectedness of the disabled within the entire campus we are here to help everyone learn about the everyday struggles and limitations so we all can understand and support each other
1084220 we all have disabilities some are visible and some are invisible
1084221 but disabilities are only as challenging as our minds let them be
1084222 i know what you mean i could use a cup of coffee myself go ahead you have plenty of time

1084266 jewelry retailers prompt automated decisions and easy to use online processing and reporting
1084267 jewelry retailers told us they wanted a consumer financing program to help them run their businesses more easily and efficiently
1084268 when we created the wells fargo jewelry advantage credit card program we focused on the areas that are important to them quick application decisions and innovative technology to support their processes
1084269 the program helps jewelers offer customers a wide variety of financing options
1084270 customers will appreciate the flexibility especially given economic conditions its an added value for them
1084271 these numbers reflect the hard work of law enforcement and the public and while they are encouraging theres still a lot of work to be done
1084272 dont make it easy for thieves lock the doors and take the keys with you
1084273 i have tried to remove the plural form churches from my vocabulary training myself to think of the church as christ did and as the early christians did the metaphors for her are always singular a body a bride weve got to unite ourselves as one body because jesus is coming back and hes coming back for a bride not a harem
1084274 but when the son of man comes in his glory and all the angels with him then he will sit upon his glorious throne
1084275 then the king will say to those on his right come you who are blessed by my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world
1084276 then these righteous ones will reply lord when did we ever see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you something to drink
1084277 and the king will say i tell you the truth when you did it to one of the least of these my brothers and sisters you were doing it to me
1084278 then the king will turn to those on the left and say away with you you cursed ones into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his demons
1084279 then they will reply lord when did we ever see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and not help you
1084280 and he will answer i tell you the truth when you refused to help the least of these my brothers and sisters you were refusing to help me
1084281 and they will go away into eternal punishment but the righteous will go into eternal life
1084282 ive been on several construction sites where bad accidents have happened this is by far one of the most tragic ones ive ever witnessed
1084283 stamping out such fraud is a high priority of the patrick administration
1084284 the hotline and website are ways to report wrongdoing so that we can restore fairness in our states economy and help those who go to work each day to earn an honest days wage
1084285 plain indifference to or intentional disregard for employee safety and health
1084286 schalk burger who sustained a whiplash injury against the wallabies in perth has been on progressive rehabilitation and will commence training this week with the team where his progress will be monitored
1084287 if all goes well then he will be available for selection this week
1084288 bryan habana suffered an aggravation of his ac joint from the test in perth he has not been involved in any contact sessions since the squad reassembled last week
1084289 habana will progress into contact this week where the medical and conditioning staff will monitor him but the expectation is that he should be ready for team selection for the weekend
1084290 peter grants shoulder operation went well last week and this will now be followed by a six to eight week rehabilitation process
1084291 ryan kankowski sustained a grade two sprain to his left sterno clavicular joint and is undergoing rehabilitation with the sharks medical team and we are hopeful that peter will be able to start playing in two to three weeks
1084292 john smit is now three weeks post his groin operation and he is recovering well he will continue his rehabilitation with muscle activation commencing this week and we are planning for him to be fit for the end of the tour to the united kingdom
1084293 theyve worked with individuals throughout the week and i think it showed tonight we won the kicking duel and that was probably a big aspect from last week that and the physical side of things
1084294 iit is an ongoing process them things arent behind me im still going through the process so ive just got to keep going about my things and play good footy let my rugby do the talking
1084295 i didnt feel the knee at all i felt it once during the warm ups but once it kicked in it was all right
1084296 there is always pressure on the kickers its always a tough kick for a halfback kicking inside your 22m its a 50 50 kick really you either get the right bounce or the wrong bounce couple of wrong bounces tonight but it certainly brings them forward and opens up spaces in behind
1084297 i think we managed to do that they changed their structure a fair bit with the wee kicks it also takes a lot of pressure off dessie carter you cant always rely on him at 10
1084298 it comes from the wingers and the backs i get a wee call but i sort of see it too as i am approaching a ruck
1084299 i tell you straight out mijnheer van riebeeck doman is no good
1084300 mijnheer i also believe that the fat captain of the kaapmans harbours the slaves
1084301 the interpreters doman or anthonij and eva wished to visit their friends and asked for some copper iron beads tobacco bread and brandy as a reward for their services as interpreters and presents for her mother and their friends and all the natives whom they especially eva would visit to induce them to bring a larger number of cattle as well as young horses tusks civet amber seed pearls of which they were shown and given samples and hides to the eland hart steenbuck etc
1084302 the interpreter eva has remained behind to live in the commanders house again laying aside her skins and adopting once more the indian way of dressing she will resume her services as an interpreter she seems to have grown tired of her own people again in these vacillations we let her follow her own will so that we may get the better service from her but she appears to have become already so accustomed to the dutch diet and way of life that she will never be able to give it up completely
1084303 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1084304 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1084305 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
1084306 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
1084307 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
1084308 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

1084311 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
1084312 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
1084313 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
1084314 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
1084315 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
1084316 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
1084317 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
1084318 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
1084319 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
1084320 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
1084321 the worst i can be is the same as everybody else i hate that
1084322 i need to clean out the coat closet and get rid of a bag of stuff then get it to the thrift store by saturday

1084326 we are not trying to cause the economic collapse of the roman catholic church but to illustrate to the court the magnitude of the plot against our order
1084327 there are on earth and always were thirty six righteous men whose mission is to justify the world before god
1084328 to understand this metamorphosis one must be aware of the ancient jewish tradition of the lamed vov a tradition that certain talmudists trace back to the source of the centuries to the mysterious time of the prophet isaiah rivers of blood have flowed columns of smoke have obscured the sky but surviving all these dooms the tradition has remained inviolate down to our own time according to it the world reposes upon thirty six just men the lamed vov indistinguishable from simple mortals often they are unaware of their station but if just one of them were lacking the sufferings of mankind would poison even the souls of the newborn and humanity would suffocate with a single cry for the lamed vov are the hearts of the world multiplied and into them as into one receptacle pour all our griefs thousands of popular stories take note of them their presence is attested to everywhere a very old text of the haggadah tells us that the most pitiable are the lamed vov who remain unknown to themselves for those the spectacle of the world is an unspeakable hell in the seventh century andalusian jews venerated a rock shaped like a teardrop which they believed to be the soul petrified by suffering of an unknown lamed vovnik other lamed vov like hecuba shrieking at the death of her sons are said to have been transformed into dogs when an unknown just rises to heaven a hasidic story goes he is so frozen that god must warm him for a thousand years between his fingers before his soul can open itself to paradise and it is known that some remain forever inconsolable at human woe so that god himself cannot warm them so from time to time the creator blessed be his name sets forward the clock of the last judgment by one minute

1084336 the next president of the united states could be a mormon whose faith requires him to believe that jesus visited america after the resurrection and will return one day to rule the world from jackson county missouri

1084341 estas formas de vivencia en colectividad tienen que recuperarse y fortalecerse
1084342 no estamos negando la inversi n privada pero su participaci n nos genera a nosotros como estado s lo impuestos
1084343 si el estado tiene mayor participaci n una participaci n absoluta en cualquier actividad productiva implica que es part cipe de los excedentes y la sociedad boliviana se beneficia
1084344 el socialismo es una doctrina para destruir la iniciativa privada el mercado y el deseo de la gente de vivir en libertad y democracia
1084345 es una dictadura pol tica y econ mica y si se instaura en bolivia como advierte el presidente la gente debe empezar a preocuparse de sus ahorros y de su futuro hab amos advertido que el mas quiere hacer de bolivia otra cuba un pa s pobre e inviable
1084346 al decir que el pueblo quiere socialismo el presidente implica que el voto del s en el revocatorio l lo va a entender como apoyo al socialismo
1084347 la lectura del presidente es impuesta a nombre del pueblo se puede hacer cualquier cosa esta es una manipulaci n discursiva que creo se va a volcar en su contra en esta campa a

1084353 age is an issue of mind over matter if you dont mind it doesnt matter
1084354 im different now i feel ive been given a chance to start over a new life a new identity a new purpose
1084355 two months into retirement a woman was asked the dreaded retirement question at the grocery store
1084356 unfortunately i didnt have the forethought to have had a card made to reveal my retirement identity
1084357 yes i really want to get in touch with her glad that i had this reminder
1084358 maybe we should change the seating arrangements and have the guys on one side of the table so they can keep talking sports and we could sit on the other side and talk about whatever interests us
1084359 our spirits have been on hold waiting to move out of the cocoon of work to continue the quest like new life emerging from the chrysalis we unfold our wings and move toward full spiritual development as women
1084360 theres a number between 3 and 13 alright i admit im not exactly sure what she meant by that because when i met her she had already begun her journey into a parallel universe
1084361 early mapmakers didnt know what lay beyond chartered territory so they warned of dragons the first few days and weeks of retirement can be filled with dragons

1084364 if our staying is going to make you leave then well just head out tonight
1084365 there are lots of services out there and some are very good and very sophisticated
1084366 fleetmentor integrates tools for all aspects of a fleet business into one subscription based service it is not really high tech either in fact there is no set up no it involved you can start using the service five minutes after you buy it
1084367 we are not watching the data but we are watching the questions people ask
1084368 everybody out there is being squeezed by the same fuel costs for instance so everybody is looking for ways to get more efficient people are definitely looking for the tools to do that
1084369 we are seeing some fleets get hurt by the current conditions but others are thriving
1084370 price increases such as fuel dont seem to impact the organizations that are well managed fleets that went into this high cost period strong appear to be doing the best it is a lot harder on businesses that were already having trouble before things really got tough once rates are adjusted to account for fuel cost increases it will become a level playing field again this downturn is forcing changes though such as using new technologies like online services and automated driver logs to improve efficiency and reduce costs
1084371 we certainly get requests for our products to be multi modal
1084372 trucking is what fleetmentor is all about but fleets want to know how to interact with ports and rail for example and we do cover that
1084373 in addition to fuel prices safety accident prevention recruiting and retention always seem to be jockeying for the top of the importance list
1084374 a fleets safety record and its driver turnover rates are considered to be a key metric that prospective customers look at to help determine for how well a fleet is managed that hasnt changed and we dont see it changing

1084379 every other professor in this department sees how brilliant i am and the fact that you dont proves you dont understand your work as a teacher or as a scholar
1084380 dear professor x i hope you are enjoying the summer weather i hate to bother you about this but i was distressed to see i received a d in your class i enjoyed the class a great deal and feel that i learned much that will be helpful to me in the future my final paper was something i felt proud to turn in and now im left wondering what went wrong ive reviewed the document carefully and dont see how it does not meet the standards for a passing writing assignment in your class though there is obviously room for improvement i know this is not standard practice but as im currently submitting my transcripts for dream program i would be extremely grateful for the opportunity to revise whatever work from the class i can according to any advice you could give me for the chance to improve my transcript please let me know if theres any way i can earn a higher grade at this late date respectfully yours me

1084386 i am excited about our agreement that combines delphis unique technology with iteris distribution and marketing capabilities to provide delphis radar based warning systems to our fleet and oem customers
1084387 i expect our relationship with delphi to expand the opportunity for iteris to provide best in class active safety solutions to the heavy truck market and provide a platform to generate additional revenue
1084388 we understand our customers are dealing with unprecedented fuel costs so we want to provide both short term help with the fuel card and long term help by emphasizing the importance of efficient trucks and engines
1084389 commercial trucks require special equipment like heavier lifts special tools specialized expertise and customer amenities to meet the unique needs of truck fleet and other business customers
1084390 we have built all of these things into our new commercial center
1084391 the technology is there to improve commercial vehicle safety and its proven so what these bills do is encourage fleets to install them on their equipment
1084392 its totally voluntary but the tax incentives help get the technology on the ground faster
1084393 its aimed at trying to get as many fleets as possible to adopt the safety technology thats right for their operation especially the smaller carriers
1084394 rather than mandate the adoption of specific safety technologies at the federal level a process that can take years these bills offer fleets an incentive to get those systems on the ground now and start saving lives now
1084395 also with a change in the presidential administration coming up its good timing to be have these bills already moving through the legislative process
1084396 why did god let a flood kill everybody werent there nice people in the flood too is he going to do that again someday
1084397 why did god let all those little boys get murdered when they were looking for jesus didnt that make the mommies sad

1084405 first of all id really like to apologize to the orginization to the coaches to my teammates to my family
1084406 his issue that happened is going to be an opportunity for the carolina panthers and myself as an individual to show our true colors and be able to show the impact we can have and not have this moment leave the legacy of who i am to my children who i am to my teammates who i am as a man
1084407 i will not put myself in position where i have to defend myself or state my side of the story
1084408 im going to take this opportunity to let god break me humble me and continually let me move forward in being the person i can truly be and thats a god fearing man no matter what people may think or what they may say
1084409 its an opportunity for me to stand tall and take my punishment but take it with god on my side and not me standing up trying to be something that i m not im a fallen man im a man who made a mistake
1084410 i intend to mend the bridges i have burned and help rebuild a bridge if i need to all by myself but not do it in a spiteful way but to do it witih the labor and the sound mind that god gives me which is to do what im supposed to do
1084411 im not going to get into whos right whos wrong im completely wrong it was an asinine decision im going to move forward and move forward better than i probably have had to
1084412 this is the first time in my life that i really havent forgiven myself thats whats im going to work on
1084413 i feel pretty good today its just good to be back out here with my teammates im just trying to get prepared for this season coming up everybody is positive right now and thats a good thing
1084414 probably in two or three weeks depending on the surgery were still waiting on the doctors to tell us the timetable on when ill have the procedure done
1084415 i feel like what happened was a blessing in disguise its something that has brought this team closer together you all may say im crazy for saying that but i really think its bigger than me and steve
1084416 me and steve have talked man to man and one on one we still have some more talking to do as far as the descrepencies of what we feel like are the issues between us but were going to handle it as men
1084417 as far as this incident holding the team back i dont think its going to do so i think its only going to make us better and bring us closer as a team as we work toward the ultimate goal of winning this tropy this year
1084418 thats between me and steve there are a lot of things that have been brewing for four years now i cant possibly tell you what the issues are in this one conversation about what has happened in four years
1084419 sometimes when emotions get involved you do stupid things and unfortunately thats what humans do
1084420 for me to be a christian i have a forgiving heart and im willing to move forward to help this team win this year
1084421 i have to admit its tough as a human but its bigger than me and steve like i said where i get the courage and the grace to do so i know it doesnt come from me it comes from god so i just give all the glory to god for how im handling the situation right now
1084422 when i came over to the stadium i wasnt coming over there to get a warm welcome i was just coming over there to be a part of the team and not separate myself from the team but lo and behold it was very overwhelming for how they responded to me it felt pretty good
1084423 sometimes you can view things as a gift or a curse i look at this as a gift we have the team what it takes to win the super bowl this year this is something i only thing will bring us closer
1084424 for those guys to come and hug me and say man were glad to see you over here that felt so good to me sometimes it takes adversity to really know how much youre appreciated or how much people really care about you
1084425 only two men can do that and think we have what it takes for us to do so
1084426 because hes an ultra competitor and im a ultra competitor and we both hate losing
1084427 if he could do it and if hed had a calmer head im sure he would have made better decisions i dont fault him for that
1084428 there are times when maybe i want to hit somebody but i control myself i tell some of my other teammates you have to keep your composure typically people do crazy things they regret when theyre emotional and i think he just got too emotional at the time and thats it
1084429 sometimes you can view things as a gift or a curse i look at this as a gift we have the team what it takes to win the super bowl this year this is something i only thing will bring us closer

1084436 even so personal conversion is not a goal in itself to interpret the work for the church as the winning of souls is to make conversion into a final product which flatly contradicts lukes understanding of the purpose of mission conversion does not pertain merely to an individuals act of conviction and commitment it moves the individual believer into the community of believers and involves a real even a radical change in the life of the believer which carries with it moral responsibilities that distinguish christians from outsiders while at the same time stressing their obligation to those outsiders
1084437 it moves the individual believer from the world into the community of believers and involves a real even a radical change in the life of the believer
1084438 we are endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights

1084451 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
1084452 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past

1084454 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
1084455 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
1084456 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
1084457 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
1084458 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
1084459 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
1084460 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
1084461 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
1084462 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
1084463 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
1084464 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

1084789 you like many others just seem pissed no one catered to your ego
1084790 a patch was chosen that didnt directly correlate to the vulnerability purposely to give the good guys time to patch wtf you wanted metasploit exploits out the day after the patches were released who would that help
1084791 3 for those who actually care about things like how code works how exploits work etc they absolutely must see it to believe it and understand how it works properly
1084792 ive got a vuln but i cant tell you what it is
1084793 if you can tell with absolute certainty that systems are vulnerable to an exploit without needing to test the mechanism what good is served by releasing weaponized attack code
1084794 doesnt matter if there isnt source port randomization its vulnerable if there is its not okay less vulnerable
1084795 as usual this debate ignores the only question that matters does weaponized attack code distributed well before most systems could be reasonably expected to be patched help or harm customers
1084796 install patch or fear the wrath of the big bad guy that will boil the 1nternekz trust us we are 16 and we know how what is best for you and everybody else
1084797 well before most systems could be reasonably expected to be patched
1084798 given that this vulnerability was partially disclosed on july 8 i suspect a great deal of this traffic is name server vulnerability scanning as opposed to malicious cache poisoning attempts although there may well be a mix of the latter
1084799 i dont want exploits made public but we do need ways of assessing our vulnerability
1084800 if i made comments every time i heard a rumor ill be talking to you every day and have to answer every question you the media ask lets deal with reality well let you guys know when we know something
1084801 we have to start somewhere nate earned the chance to start just by what hes done here in these first eight days its very close we are going to switch off in the middle linebacker position by no means anyone has that job locked up most guys get a chance to work with the first unit at the end of the preseason we will come out with a winner either way we have two good football players that will help us win
1084802 you have to put a depth chart out during the week of the first preseason game its mandatory and we had to do it last night but i think we all know there are a number of positions that are very close you got to put down a first team and second team even though we really dont know its really that close so nate webster will get the start against houston and well switch it off with niko and like i said thats part of the preseason and well see how it folds out
1084803 michael plays both at fullback and tailback hes a guy that can play both very similar to mike bell michael has a lot more experience at both positions and he looked it today coming back from his hamstring injury
1084804 we had kenny peterson as a starter in otas marcus has had a good first week its still close but marcus has earned a chance to work with the first unit hopefully he could keep it hes very solid and hes in excellent shape and hopefully he can keep on getting better
1084805 to be honest with you with 80 players we have guys that are very close and thats what preseason is all about which is getting the chance to evaluate these guys not only in practice situations but also in game situations you really dont know we had terrell davis way back when and didnt know if he was going to be on the final roster and he played really well in the last preseason game thats when you get a chance to see some of these guys that are free agents right now that we havent talked about they have a chance of not only be part of the 53 man roster but part of the 45 man roster we have some talented young kids on this team and im looking forward to seeing them in game situations
1084806 in june we have a depth chart and they tell us where we are then i guess the depth chart is for the media we pretty much know where we stand on the offense and defense
1084807 i didnt really know much about the incident he is a good kid it has been an unfortunate thing that he has had some run ins with the law he doesnt deserve any of that because he is not a bad guy you hear stuff about what the other guys are doing brandon is a good kid he is out here working hard and he is ready to go if he gets suspended two three or four games it will hurt the team but it will give other guys an opportunity to step up brandon is a big part of what we try and do he is jays cutler guy it would be disappointing to know that he is suspended brandon has come in here with sheer focus that is one of the things i have commented to him on how focused he is now he is a changed guy you want to get better so i applaud him on that hopefully he will be with us this season
1084808 jay has always been cool with me i didnt know that last year he was going through when i came here last year i couldnt tell any difference he still had a strong arm if you gave him a crease he was able to get that ball in there jay coming in this year seems to have this under control he was tested for it diabetes and its under control he is doing a great job he is eating he is taking his medication right now he is having so much fun he is active with the guys the one thing i love about jay after being around quarterbacks during my career he has a quiet confidence and i love that about him hes not going to do a bunch of talking about it he is not going to be jabbering to a lot of people he does his talking with his play and i love that about jay i think he is ready to go this year he is ready to do good things and get this team back at the top of the afc west
1084809 i dont know any veteran that is excited about preseason excited about practicing in games you just want to get in and get a chance to show some of the skills that we have and just get a feel most veterans dont need a lot of preseason like i said whatever is asked of me i am looking forward to getting out there with the rest of the guys and just moving forward last year was a disappointing year from the broncos and it was disappointing for me i was coming in expecting to get back into the playoffs i havent been back to the playoffs since i was in st louis i feel like i wasnt having it after being in detroit for four years but i am excited about this year with coach bob slowik our defensive coordinator everything will be simplified guys understand and know their responsibility and we will benefit from our defense with the addition of dt dewayne robertson that will help our defensive line as a team to play better against the run i am fired up because of jay and the offensive guys that we have drafting wr eddie royal and t ryan clady i really feel like this is going to be our year

1084852 didier will not play in our first game against portsmouth and will probably miss the second against wigan if there are no more problems he should be ready for the game after that

1085010 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states

1085035 repatriation is pretty much a death sentence in some of these cases
1085036 ive seen patients bundled onto the plane and out of the country and once that person is out of sight hes out of mind
1085037 what that does for us it puts a strain on our system where were unable to provide adequate care for our own citizens
1085038 an alternative choice for the care of the unfunded latin american nationals
1085039 weve done flights to lithuania poland honduras guatemala and mexico
1085040 but out of about a dozen cases a year we probably fly only a couple back
1085041 i can think of three different scenarios that would have led to a fatal outcome if they had moved her
1085042 the good outcome today is due to the treatment that the hospital provided reluctantly and sadly enough only in response to legal and public pressure
1085043 he didnt talk he didnt understand anything he stayed curled up in a ball but he was alive
1085044 i said sure what can come of such a case
1085045 then it took on a life of its own they probably regret they ever called me
1085046 the question to be answered is if the patients condition is terminal
1085047 we arrived for a visit and he said to me you are montejo
1085048 the average stay at martin memorial a relatively tranquil hospital which features a palm frond design in its gleaming lobby floor and white coiffed volunteers in its gift shop is 4
1085049 the real problem is if we find an underlying problem and now we have six of them six patients who showed up in one of the six she said voluntarily returned to guatemala after receiving a poor prognosis
1085050 a community hospital is going to give care but is it the right thing we have a lot of american citizens who need our help we only make about 3 percent over our bottom line if were lucky we need to make capital improvements and do things for our community
1085051 or the government should step in and otherwise exercise its authority for deportation or whatever it wants to do
1085052 and if the rehab worked then luis might have become a functional person and nobodys charge
1085053 once you take that step for how long are you going to do that a year 10 years 50 years
1085054 informed us of how expensive it was becoming to care for luis given that there was no insurance and that he is illegal and that the state wont assume responsibility for his charges
1085055 if a hospital in florida asks if we can take care of a guatemalan patient the tendency is to say yes
1085056 this case is not simply a case as some would try and paint it of money this is a case about care for a man in this country illegally who has reached maximum medical improvement at our hospital and is ready to be discharged and whose home government
1085057 your honor this is a case about a hospital that has failed to do its job properly
1085058 why are you sad when you have basically everything that could be offered to you
1085059 as aquinas once stated the good is not the enemy of the perfect
1085060 we went to see him at the hospital and his bed was empty
1085061 that facility could have taken care of me any day
1085062 telling everyone that he was from miami florida and showing them his toy cat
1085063 that he would be staying with his new friends in guatemala and that i was leaving
1085064 its the same as the classic fall on the stairs right
1085065 you go to my home you fall on my stairs and then you sue me i am responsible
1085066 how could i possibly have given him what he needs
1085067 its a letter that says listen dont take action to dump this individual because youll be risking legal action
1085068 should they win we would like them to take those damages and pay his hospital bill
1085069 the first striking thing was his disposition he was very very happy
1085070 then the second thing he was well cared for what i did was i got down over him and hugged him but also smelled and there were no bedsores nothing was malodorous
1085071 i said his quality of life is better than it would be in an american nursing home
1085072 for many years i am caring for him like he is a baby changing his diaper washing him but this is worse i am worried to leave him alone at all
1085073 the day my mother is no longer whats going to happen to me
1085074 i headed north like a peasant with a heavy bundle on his back bent over determined to better himself
1085075 other people had things so i thought why not me but now i regret it maybe god was punishing me for my illusions
1085076 thats the usual story of patients that are released from the national orthopedic hospital
1085077 in cases like that if you cut the medical care youre hurting that person
1085078 youre doing just the opposite of what the medical system should do that goes against every international convention of human rights and health to send him to guatemala was to send him to very poor living and health conditions and probably he will die because of that and thats not fair
1085079 it would be possible to set up a good health care arrangement for him because in private practice we have all types of specialties that he needs
1085080 i am sending you some little things luis i hope that you like them
1085081 that we miss you and love you a lot may god continue to bless you

1085085 i learned from faculty and staff how to juggle my familys needs with my own
1085086 ive also had to mediate difficult situations at empact which is something i learned through the social work program my internship with the miss foundation a non profit organization created by asu assistant professor joanne cacciatore dedicated to providing support to grieving individuals and families helped me learn to deal compassionately with raw emotion such as grief while staying focused on meeting the needs of the person and the family
1085087 what i have learned is that i can do it
1085088 it may be hard but you get there eventually even with my family were not there yet but weve come a long way
1085089 even if i were in the same position now as i was 10 years ago it wouldnt be as overwhelming because i have seen the support and where it comes from and i have grown personally and i see the light there was a time i didnt know if there was a way out
1085090 but the emphasis cant be on me because it isnt fair to those you are serving

1085102 what makes this seminar particularly unique and exciting is the hands on involvement of each participant
1085103 as a result the principals go home with new ideas and real tools with which to initiate school improvement within the context of their unique school culture
1085104 it wasnt just about us as principals it was about us how we could bring these tools to people that we work with it was beautiful it was amazing it was inspiring im still reeling from it

1085172 i went grabbed the sergeant out of the shotgun seat pulled him out
1085173 it doesnt surprise me this has just been the typical behavior of democrat governors for 50 years
1085174 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him freeman from the vehicle he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1085175 black lips are one of the best live bands in america

1085181 but when you see one frame alone the rest doesnt matter
1085182 i hear that girls suffer not just physically but psychologically
1085183 but i am afraid i dont want my daughters to have uncontrollable demands for sex
1085184 i dont care what everyone thinks i was really harmed and i didnt want this for my daughters
1085185 when i talk about my experience many become convinced they also see how my daughters are good and religious
1085186 it is something we have grown up with and our ancestors have done
1085187 maybe i am 70 percent for not doing it part of my change of heart is talking with fatma and others
1085188 however we see a lot of association between asthma and acid reflux in the 15 million americans who have asthma as many as 50 to 80 percent also have acid reflux
1085189 we do know that reflux can cause asthma if the reflux is aspirated into the lungs or the acid in the esophagus can cause chest tightness also if acid gets into the bottom of the esophagus it can reflux up against the bronchial nerve which causes the airways to narrow and a shortness of breath
1085190 my patients will say oh that tightness in the middle of my chest isnt there anymore
1085191 when a patient thinks of reflux they think of heartburn or regurgitation and they arent aware of the other atypical signs
1085192 its not uncommon anymore to get referrals from allergists and pulmonologists
1085193 sometimes surgery is needed to tighten up the esophageal sphincter which prevents the reflux of acid
1085194 this is the first experimental evidence in a controlled laboratory setting linking these two very common conditions in humans
1085195 these data suggest that chronic micro aspiration of gastric fluid can drive the immune system toward an asthmatic response
1085196 this does not mean that everyone with gerd is going to develop asthma by any means
1085197 but it may mean that people with gerd may be more likely to develop asthma if there is an upside to this it is that developing gerd is something we can pretty much treat and control
1085198 i warmly congratulate the united states government on the new legislation that will allow for 48 billion to be spent on the fight against aids tb and malaria over the next five years

1085232 boiler loop piping for those boilers is 4 in copper so thats thick piping and you have a lot of big pumps in there but we bounced ideas off of each other and ended up with a real good looking installation
1085233 fis takes note of the result and reiterates its complete shock at a controversy that involves an athlete that has always been distinguished for his sportsmanship and correctness
1085234 the day i got accepted i was feeling that it wasnt what i wanted to do
1085235 what i learned from eddie was how to get a crowd crazy

1085266 obama stuns nation by revealing himself to be a politician
1085267 and why dont i do this kind of minute fact checking for the rest of the speech or for all of them including mccains because it is difficult and it takes awhile i started looking into this paragraph at noon today but i should do it more and i will
1085268 unfortunately barack obama continues to oppose offshore drilling he continues to oppose the use of nuclear power those misguided policies would result in higher energy costs to american families and business and increased dependence on foreign oil were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating out tires
1085269 my friends my opponent senator barack osama saddam hussein bin laden wants us all to surrender to the islamic terrorists and then he wants to make us all gay marry them while giving mandatory abortions to all pregnant women instead of offering sensible solutions to our energy crisis hes proposed that everybody cut a hole in the bottom of their cars and get a running start everywhere like our prehistoric ancestors used to do with their cars in places like the town of bedrock and his proposed solution to americas economic difficulties is to get some hookers and blow and ride things out for a while well my friends i dont want to gay marry a terrorist and give abortions and i dont want to live in the town of bedrock im too old to start doing coke and my wife is enough of a trollop for me to handle already without getting a bunch of hookers too if youre like me you wont find my opponents plans any more palatable than i do and i hope youll keep them in mind when you enter that voting booth on november 4th thank you and god bless the united states of america
1085270 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating out tires
1085271 so in one breath he said that obama 1 opposes off shore drilling and 2 opposes nuclear power neither of which are true posted by brendanb august 4 2008 1 38 pm

1085292 i called coach heupel thursday we had been talking a couple of times in the previous weeks he told me to call him thursday and i did he told me that they wanted me to be a sooner and that i had a scholarship that is how the conversation started
1085293 i said i really appreciated it it is a great honor to get an offer from a prestigious program like oklahoma this is great and i could not thank him enough
1085294 we talked about maybe coming up there and seeing coach stoops in the immediate future i am trying to sort it out i might or might not go but i still want to make a final decision before school starts
1085295 i went to their camp but i saw a limited amount of things around there i saw their stadium trophy room and their practice field but i have not been in the stadium or anything like that
1085296 not necessarily it is more along the lines that with an offer from oklahoma i can not overlook a great program like oklahoma they are starting the season off at 3 in the nation they are not a program to just take lightly that is for sure
1085297 he emailed me and i called him back it really was not along the lines of him saying anything to me i just told him that i got an offer oklahoma but that nothing had changed between me and ole miss but at the same time it is exciting to get such a prestigious offer i have to look into it but ole miss is still at the top for me with out a doubt it does not change anything it just brings oklahoma back into the picture
1085298 gods redemptive work of change is ongoing in all of our lives when i forget this i become self righteous impatient critical and judgmental i give in to the temptation to play god and try to change you in ways only god can when i fail to worship god as savior i am too casual about my sin and too focused on yours our relationships are often harmed when we try to atone for our own sins while condemning the other person for his when you are sinned against you will be impacted by the weaknesses and failures of that other person when this happens you need to allow god to use you as an instrument in his redemptive hands rather than seeking to make changes in the other person yourself only god can accomplish these things are you trying to do work in someones life that only the savior can do
1085299 f rchte euch nicht heilige des neuen jahrtausends zu sein
1085300 ich bin zu euch gekommen um euch eine wahre geschichte zu erz hlen
1085301 gott war da und gab ihm die hoffnung die er gebraucht hat er begann die bibel zu lesen jeden tag begann er ein paar seiten zu lesen
1085302 das war das erste mal wo er dar ber nachgedacht hat dass er vielleicht selbst priester werden k nnte
1085303 w hrend er durch verschiedene fernsehkan le zappte ist er ber eine dokumentarfilm ber lourdes gesto en er war zuerst skeptisch und dachte dass das nur f r arme kleine omas ist die alles glauben aber nichts f r einen pop rock star der er selbst war

1085336 todos los mecanismos necesarios para evitar movimientos dentro del registro que sean fraude a la ley
1085337 se est n haciendo las evaluaciones para atender cada uno de estos casos y procesar los que correspondan a solicitudes efectuadas por los electores
1085338 es un indicador important simo porque se est logrando inscribir a los m s j venes
1085339 la auditoria ciudadana es la consulta que hacen los electores de sus datos en el registro esto ha tenido una amplia acogida entre la mensajer a de texto y las visitas a la p gina web se ha recibido un mill n 847 mil 943 consultas y en el mes de julio crecieron a 4 millones 63 mil 178 s lo en ese mes lo que suma casi seis millones de consultas

1085342 el cne ha sido muy claro al se alar que las personas que han sentido afectados sus intereses pueden acudir al tribunal supremo de justicia entendemos que as lo han hecho los afectados y el tribunal est todav a dentro de los lapsos para pronunciarse para que estas personas tengan claras sus expectativas antes del 12 de agosto de manera que ah no hay otra cosa que mencionar hemos sido lo suficientemente claros sobre la no competencia del poder electoral en esta materia

1085344 es sumamente serio que el presidente en una madrugada copiando por cierto las pr cticas de los delincuentes de los criminales que act an en la oscuridad en las sombras haya aprobado 26 leyes que afectan a los venezolanos
1085345 pese que la mayor a del pueblo venezolano se pronunci en contra de esas propuestas el presidente ahora pretende imponernos muchos de esos elementos por la v a de la habilitante
1085346 adem s estas leyes no fueron discutidas con la gente con los factores interesados en estos textos se dej de lado la consulta que obliga la consulta con el soberano no hubo parlamentarismo de calle as que nos ha quedado claro que al jefe del estado no le importa el pueblo sino solamente sus intereses que incluyen perpetuarse en el poder
1085347 que es nuestro compromiso y seguiremos haciendo el esfuerzo que hasta ahora hemos demostrado
1085348 estas capacidades formidables de ambos pa ses incorporados tambi n a un mercosur en el cual la energ a es el otro componente central para que esta regi n sea en este siglo xxi protagonista y no mera observadora como en otras etapas
1085349 estamos ante una oportunidad que no nos podemos perder y yo s que no la vamos a perder
1085350 nos dimos cuenta de que necesit bamos unirnos articular inteligente eficaz y modernamente para producir la transformaci n que nuestras sociedades siempre nos demandaron

1085416 one group of stocks that has always intrigued us are those whose symbols have one letter
1085417 these stocks have been beaten down pretty badly and now look particularly appealing
1085418 but the company subsequently suffered along with its customers in the communications and technology sectors
1085419 however giants are not particularly nimble and citicorp has struggled in the new credit environment that began a year ago the new management team will probably divest many businesses but they have a good core on which to rebuild
1085420 management has been quick to react laying off workers and shutting down plants we think the brand is strong enough to survive and so does legendary investor kirk kerkorian who has been buying ford shares as they drop
1085421 but the headwinds of rising costs for corn and wheat have spooked investors leading to a sharp selloff in the shares earlier this year as a result the stock trades near levels reached in 1997 this may be an opportunity to get an iconic brand at a bargain price
1085422 and now fearful of rising inflation and constrained consumer spending investors have sold the stock off to a nearly 5 year low macys has the financial strength to ultimately prevail and at current valuations 0 4x sales and below book value it could be cheap
1085423 after rallying to nearly 46 in its first few weeks the stock declined sharply and has bounced around the 20 level for the last several months while its operating history is short netsuites products look interesting and with 170 million in cash the company has time to prove itself
1085424 qwest provides telephone services in 14 western and midwestern states the company is at a disadvantage to some of its peers because it doesnt have its own wireless business
1085425 but that said the old wireline franchise still has a lot of value as they figure out how to send more data and video over the phone lines
1085426 a new management team is aggressively pursuing new marketing schemes as well new technology such as wimax if results dont improve some or all of the company could be sold
1085427 the company services some 60 million local phone lines 15 million broadband subscribers and 71 million wireless customers
1085428 as merger related charges begin to wane and synergies begin to payoff operating results should begin to improve the companys financials are sound quite capable of supporting a share repurchase program and attractive dividend

1085461 i think the fundamentals behind chinas real estate market are terrific
1085462 for several years chinese real estate has been red hot because of the biggest building boom in mankinds history
1085463 ive seen estimates say as many as 70 of all the construction cranes in the world are on chinese soil every time i go back i see new buildings that werent there six months ago the pace of construction is unbelievable
1085464 compared to the u s market where home sales and prices have been falling the chinese residential market has remained strong
1085465 thats largely because 80 of all home purchases in china were bought with 100 cash last year in other words china simply doesnt have the same sub prime woes and default problems that we do
1085466 paying all cash for a home may sound impossible to you and me but were talking about a country that has a savings rate of 25 and many children living with their moms and dads until theyre ready to buy a home so the forces that are pushing the u s economy down are not evident in china
1085467 according to the national development and reform commission chinas top economic planning agency house prices in 70 large and medium sized chinese cities rose 9

1085470 ya veremos lo que vaya saliendo de las otras leyes que tienen que ver con lo que est sucediendo en la administraci n p blica con los bancos con todo lo que tiene que ver con la econom a del pa s
1085471 el gobierno debe m s bien generar confianza generar reglas del juego claras que permita que se genere empleo en el pa s esto lo que hace es que el pueblo venezolano sufra porque en la medida en la que se siga destruyendo la econom a se sigue destruyendo el empleo y la oportunidad de todos los venezolanos
1085472 lo m s importante ahorita es conocer lo que esta ac en este contrabando que el pa s lo conozca que el pa s sepa que todo lo que esta aqu planteado ya lo rechaz el 2 de diciembre de 2007

1085484 the government took advantage of this situation to use it as a tool to build up a case to go to war in iraq
1085485 and in that context there would be no rush to find the deranged solo killer
1085486 for motive for explanation there are few options and all of them are terrifying including why people like u s senators were saying this in 2001
1085487 if reporting by the los angeles times today is even remotely accurate the questions about the anthrax attacks which terrified this nation late in 2001 would seem tonight to have boiled down to three first was the anthrax sent by just one employee of our own government or more than one employee of our own government second when the fbi missed an easy clue the unreported spilling of anthrax in the federal repository of anthrax that the suspect did not report was it incompetence or a cover up and third how if there was evidence of something askew in our biological warfare lab in maryland as early as december 2001 why did national news organizations in this country receive supposedly reliable leaks from the bush administration that the anthrax had originated in iraq
1085488 but let me switch over to the other half of this the governments reaction to this from the investigation to the bush administration reaction the leaks tying all of this to iraq getting the wrong man hatfill and dogging him for years letting the other guy continue to work at fort detrick he was still there until weeks ago and then close in on him so slowly that he has time to go into the psychiatric ward and then get out and then reportedly kill himself it smells terribly bad is it as bad as conceivably as bad as it smells
1085489 never had a lie leading up to the war in iraq and scaring this country into it that they shied away from and anthrax was one of those that they embraced
1085490 assume for a moment theres no pro activity that this was dr ivinss flipping out that the government simply took advantage of this
1085491 do you see a scenario in which simply this government took advantage of this situation whether or not lets assume for a moment theres no pro activity that this was dr ivinss flipping out to whatever degree it was required to do this that the government simply took advantage of this to use it as a tool to build up a case to go to war in iraq
1085492 there were individuals inside the bush administration and in the government that wanted the war in iraq so badly that they decided that if there was something that they could use to push it forward they would anthrax fell into their lap even if he is the deranged solo killer they used it in order to scare this country and say iraq is somebody we have to go after and we did
1085493 and in that context there would be no rush to find the deranged solo killer
1085494 the fbi owes it to the country to provide some accounting of their investigation and their expectations for a successful conclusion
1085495 there had been significant developments in the investigation but confirming only that substantial progress has been made by bringing to bear new and sophisticated scientific tools
1085496 when people say the show glamorizes teen drinking and sex they arent really watching the episodes

1085505 were not looking in the past we have our eyes looking forward its like a db defensive back if a bad play happens you cant keep focusing on it or it will hurt you down the road that was a speed bump in training camp but the car is in drive were not going backwards
1085506 his issue that happened is going to be an opportunity for the carolina panthers and myself as an individual to show our true colors and be able to show the impact we can have and not have this moment leave the legacy of who i am to my children who i am to my teammates who i am as a man
1085507 i will not put myself in position where i have to defend myself or state my side of the story
1085508 im going to take this opportunity to let god break me humble me and continually let me move forward in being the person i can truly be and thats a god fearing man no matter what people may think or what they may say
1085509 its an opportunity for me to stand tall and take my punishment but take it with god on my side and not me standing up trying to be something that i m not im a fallen man im a man who made a mistake
1085510 i intend to mend the bridges i have burned and help rebuild a bridge if i need to all by myself but not do it in a spiteful way but to do it witih the labor and the sound mind that god gives me which is to do what im supposed to do
1085511 im not going to get into whos right whos wrong im completely wrong it was an asinine decision im going to move forward and move forward better than i probably have had to
1085512 this is the first time in my life that i really havent forgiven myself thats whats im going to work on
1085513 i feel pretty good today its just good to be back out here with my teammates im just trying to get prepared for this season coming up everybody is positive right now and thats a good thing
1085514 probably in two or three weeks depending on the surgery were still waiting on the doctors to tell us the timetable on when ill have the procedure done
1085515 i feel like what happened was a blessing in disguise its something that has brought this team closer together you all may say im crazy for saying that but i really think its bigger than me and steve
1085516 me and steve have talked man to man and one on one we still have some more talking to do as far as the descrepencies of what we feel like are the issues between us but were going to handle it as men
1085517 as far as this incident holding the team back i dont think its going to do so i think its only going to make us better and bring us closer as a team as we work toward the ultimate goal of winning this tropy this year
1085518 thats between me and steve there are a lot of things that have been brewing for four years now i cant possibly tell you what the issues are in this one conversation about what has happened in four years
1085519 sometimes when emotions get involved you do stupid things and unfortunately thats what humans do
1085520 for me to be a christian i have a forgiving heart and im willing to move forward to help this team win this year
1085521 i have to admit its tough as a human but its bigger than me and steve like i said where i get the courage and the grace to do so i know it doesnt come from me it comes from god so i just give all the glory to god for how im handling the situation right now
1085522 when i came over to the stadium i wasnt coming over there to get a warm welcome i was just coming over there to be a part of the team and not separate myself from the team but lo and behold it was very overwhelming for how they responded to me it felt pretty good
1085523 sometimes you can view things as a gift or a curse i look at this as a gift we have the team what it takes to win the super bowl this year this is something i only thing will bring us closer
1085524 for those guys to come and hug me and say man were glad to see you over here that felt so good to me sometimes it takes adversity to really know how much youre appreciated or how much people really care about you
1085525 only two men can do that and think we have what it takes for us to do so
1085526 because hes an ultra competitor and im a ultra competitor and we both hate losing

1085624 to me its not about her ability to spin gazillion times or the perfect posture or her well versedness of the dance but i absolutely yearn for a follower that has the right attitude on the dance floor and more a dance and a dance floor gives you an opportunity to act and explore the extension of your personality a dance expression really how much can you really do how do you really express your emotions body and soul with the music

1085672 it is increasingly evident that the banking sector is dividing into two distinct camps the haves and the have nots
1085673 the haves are bankof america and wells fargo in the big cap area suntrust and bb amp t in the larger regional banking sector and bank of hawaii and southwest bancorp in the smaller cap area
1085674 the impressive rally to date notwithstanding it still remains to be seen whether another retracement will develop should crude oil gold and other commodities reverse course

1085697 me and my mother watched it it didnt really have an affect on me because i know what i can do and what im going through
1085698 it doesnt really change my mind at all i still like penn state and im still with it
1085699 to see all that stuff happening there i really worry at this point i dont really want him to go to that school i know you cant run away because trouble is everywhere but to see that they have a coach and a coaching staff that is not doing what they need to do to keep this stuff from happening really worries me
1085700 i dont want my son to attend a school where theres no guidance when hes away from me i want him to have a role model to keep him in line
1085701 im going to have to have a serious talk with him im definitely not leaving it up to him we all need to sit down and talk about this because i just want the best for my son and i need to see what type of options he wants to have right now because penn state to me is not a good option
1085702 of course if you have a lot of students and players at one school getting into trouble its going to make that school look bad but you cant necessarily say that the school is a bad place it just shows that those people chose to make the wrong decision
1085703 its not really been a big deal to me once youre in college youre an adult youre a grown female or male and youre old enough to make your own decisions if you choose to make the wrong decision thats on you
1085704 my whole take on it was that i stay away from that type of trouble when you go to college you should know the things you shouldnt be doing
1085705 ive been told that about his contract ive been watching espn and they keep talking about it i mean even if this is his last year whether its a successor which id love to have or if its a brand new coaching staff and then i guess im going to have to see
1085706 im going to penn state because thats where i should be it wasnt for any specific coach
1085707 i honestly dont have a problem as far as these allegations that have gone on with penn state
1085708 both my son and i believe in the program and i dont feel as though this is going to be a problem with my sons football career or academic career
1085709 at a lot of schools around the country things are going to happen people make mistakes its not like it really affected me or changed my mind

1086003 from the stories weve heard from the beach a wave crashed over him and thats the last that was seen of him
1086004 i wish on a selfish note that hed not done what he has done but im phenomenally proud of him
1086005 ive always been proud of him as a brother and as a friend too but he wouldnt have had a choice
1086006 one thing we said when we were in st lucia is that if hed not gone in or if hed gone in and got himself out but one of the children hadnt he probably wouldnt have been able to live with himself

1086009 these are the two taxpayer backed government sponsored enterprises that own or guarantee almost half of all mortgages in the country of the many words written about this bailout those in a new york times op ed by william poole former head of the federal reserve bank of saint louis contain one of the most relevant and powerful messages critics of the congressional housing package complain that we are now committing taxpayers to huge new outlays to rescue fannie mae and freddie mac that view is wrong congressional inaction over the past 15 years had already committed taxpayers to the bailout paul gigot of the wall street journal reviewed in his paper the coverage that it had been giving since 2001 to the rot inside these two entities gigot also points out that despite the rationale that we allegedly need these taxpayer backed enterprises in order for those of modest incomes to get mortgages in 2002 fannie mae was able to pay no fewer than 21 of its executives a million dollars and in 2003 its ceo franklin raines who was ousted for financial shenanigans at the firm was paid 20 million and he left with a 25 million retirement package
1086010 consider for starters what all this tells us today about the man who promises to clean up washington sen change we can believe in barack obama raines is reported to be currently serving as an informal adviser to the obama campaign on housing and mortgage issues raines predecessor james johnson also the beneficiary of tens of millions in compensation running this sweet deal where company executives share the risks with taxpayers but not the profits was obamas choice to head his vice president vetting team after howling from the press johnson stepped aside during the time when the wall street journal among others was writing about the improprieties at fannie mae and freddie mac both entities paid out a reported 170 million to lobbyists to keep congress disinterested and they succeeded none of this seems to present a problem for obama the man who campaigned through the primaries about slaying lobbyist dragons in washington appears quite at home with those who benefited from these lobbying efforts now he has given the full monty embrace to bailing out fannie mae and freddie mac and keeping them propped up forever by us taxpayers and even making them more influential by raising the size of the mortgages they can guarantee
1086011 say what you wish about john mccain but hes said and written that fannie and freddie should be sliced diced and privatized this is a position held by many respected economists including poole who writes in a new york times op ed that what they claim to need government guarantees to do the private market can handle quite well thank you beyond the presidential campaign consider why barely 10 percent of americans express confidence in congress congress ignored for years the festering problems at fannie and freddie despite lights shined on these problems now we taxpayers you and me are exposed to some 5 trillion of their debt unfortunately this political irresponsibility is the rule rather than the exception this is the same congress that woke up one night to discover 12 million illegal immigrants in our country and the same congress that continues to ignore the 50 trillion or so whose counting in unfunded liabilities of social security and medicare
1086012 after all is said and done she is no clearer on how or why we are approaching our ivory anniversary than i am how odd that i seem preoccupied with discovering the source of our longevity perhaps i should stop asking questions and thank my maker the less i know the better however i cant help but wonder we hear so often about the divorce rate and marriages the streets of los angeles are littered with marriages that went stale at about the same time as the wedding cake all of us know couples that did not make it this far we are friendly with couples that may not make it much further
1086013 i recently came across a bit of research that may shed some light on at least one road to marriage success bradford wilcox a sociology professor at the university of virginia analyzed three national studies and concluded that couples who attended regular christian church services were 35 less likely to divorce than those couples who did not not only do couples stay together longer it also appears as if they are engaged in happier and healthier marriages in addition men attending regular church services are more active in the lives of their children than are men who are not wilcox does not comment on those jewish couples or muslim couples that attend regular services i suspect however that the results may be similar ultimately marriage must be more than a mere social contract more than a vehicle for the purpose of coupling and more than a simple expression of the natural affection that a man and woman may feel for each other lust is an intoxicating asset but will never be enough to carry a couple through the tough times the couples i know that have long lasting marriages are committed to an idea of the marriage union as representing an institution greater than the sum of its parts for these couples to marry is to dedicate ones life to a higher calling similar viewpoints are far more likely to be held by people of strong religious faith
1086014 the vice presidential gamesmanship is fully underway reports out of the john mccain campaign indicate that the arizona senator will hold off announcing his running mate until after the democratic convention by waiting until that moment mccain should be able to seize headlines immediately following barack obamas nomination a secondary scenario has mccain waiting until the convention actually begins and then announcing his running mate following president bushs speech on the opening night that would help deflect coverage away from the president and onto the mccain campaign both scenarios show what kind of bind mccain is in hes not only competing for attention against the crowd pleasing obama but must also try to deflect the negative attention generated by an unpopular sitting president whether mccain will pick a vice president that can make any difference remains to be seen but at least he should be able to schedule that announcement in a way that benefits his campaign
1086015 the surge was meant to promote political progress as well as quell violence
1086016 last week barack obama did the unthinkable he played the race card in an unusually clumsy attempt to pre empt the onslaught of mccains increasing negative campaign senator obama made a huge mistake reacting to the paris hilton and brittany spears ad and the messiah ad which depicts obama as an anti christ figure he spoke out against the fear tactics he believes mccain and the gop will use against him his mistake was that he made himself sound weak by inferring that attacking his race would be a part of the fear campaign of the right last friday laura ingram guest host for bill oreilly asked me why the senator would resort to such measures my answer was that i believe he was planning to use the race card all along the senator had no doubt braced himself for the return of jeremiah wright sound bites and stinging criticism by his opponents in the last 30 to 45 days of the contest
1086017 unfortunately for him obama miscalculated when to play the card this tactic only works when your opponent is seen as a bully in fact the last thing obama wants to do is to make race the defining aspect of his candidacy throughout his campaign he has presented himself as a post racial candidate but the reality may be that he has used a sophisticated form of political jujitsu jujitsu often uses the strength and force of an opponents attacks against them this is just what he did in his contests against hillary clinton he cried victim when he was attacked by bill and hillary clinton the fairy tale comments by bill were taken out of context blown out of proportion becoming the genesis of criticism that the clintons had stooped to the lowest point in their political history as things progressed it was weeks before hillary could lay a hand on obama in terms of substantive discussion of legitimate policy differences between the two candidates in the case of the clinton debacle obama seemed to rise above the fray but his race may have actually given him an unfair advantage his campaign surrogates and the media pointed the finger of accusation at the clintons as senator obama simply sidestepped their criticism last week the senator was no doubt pressured by the mixed reviews he received from his overseas visit and speaking tour with his lead in the polls slipping he no doubt felt the weight to immediately respond to mccains negative attacks he dared not look vacillating and weak like john kerry in addition he must have felt that he had to maintain a lead in the polls until the democratic national convention
1086018 for the last few weeks obama has been using a sophisticated stalling technique as he waited to throw his best punches closer to the end of the contest the senators refusal to debate the verbally challenged mccain is a sign that he did not want to risk too much conflict i am sure he was weary of the medium given all the debates of the primary season but the american people would love to see mccain and obama engage in a real contest despite his eloquence and his affability perhaps he was afraid that a town hall discussion with mccain could yield disappointing results therefore he stalled believing that he could win the hearts of the american public without the head butting and body blows of close political combat perhaps obamas international trip was designed to give him a rest and offer him an opportunity to coast into the convention
1086019 when jesse jackson was running for the democratic partys presidential nomination the civil rights movement veteran said to his integrated gatherings on the campaign trail that if elected he could not legislate against poor performance in school or irresponsible sexual behavior at the time that was seen as a sober look at some problems that still bedevil black america that might shock the pants off those who recall how much controversy jackson recently engendered when caught on mike angrily saying that barack obama was talking down to black people in a fathers day speech that was largely directed at those black men willing to have the singularly intense human fun of making babies but unwilling to care for them once they arrive in this world how now brown cow jackson expressed the opinion of far far more black americans when he had implied the thing that obama said directly calling for those errant black fathers to stop being boys and start behaving like men by assuming the job of parent
1086020 now it seems that a form of ethnic confusion for which jackson is largely responsible could have an ironically positive influence on another ongoing problem the self destructive lower class idea that black kids who do well in school speak english correctly and do not exhibit the anarchic behavior and stupidity so common in the most popular hip hop are somehow trying to be white that is a childish idea that the black lower class needs to put away as soon as possible because as yet another new study of black americans shows the overwhelming majority of that so called minority group believes that education is one of the best ways to ensure ones chances of success i would add that that is especially true in an increasingly technological world in which backward achievements such as illiteracy are not valued
1086021 an ongoing study at princeton reveals that 40 of black students at ivy league universities are immigrants or the children of immigrants uh oh but maybe not uh oh that these students do not see high quality performance in school and sophisticated behavior as proof of a lack of ethnic pride or self hatred or being overwhelmed by white standards could be very beneficial in ways nothing else has yet been while black americans know little about african religions history politics or anything else they are learning something very important right now employers are said to prefer actual african americans black immigrants because right or wrong they assume two things about black people from outside the united states that they deeply believe in education and the competence that comes with it if this country is absolutely lucky the black lower class will begin to learn with ever greater quickness what black immigrants and everybody else in the world already knows quality skills quality performance and quality products have three obvious things in common they trump color and national origin in this global economy and will only continue to do so
1086022 thinkers of the enlightenment a set of new intellectual attitudes that remade western culture in the 17th and 18th centuries set out to understand the world and themselves through reason rather than religion their ideas led to massive advances in science economics and commerce the arts and human liberty which underpin our present prosperity and social freedoms since the september 11 2001 attacks islam has often been seen as the chief threat to the enlightenments legacy but is there also something internal to western intellectual history that leaves us vulnerable to the enemies of reason the west has cultivated an ethos of individualism reason and tolerance and an elaborate system in which every actor from the individual to the nation state seeks to resolve conflict through words the entire system is built on the idea of self interest this ethos rejects fanaticism
1086023 by dulling its peoples instincts to stand up in defence of their own society and its values the west is committing itself to slow suicide sometimes the response to attacks on western societies is one of rapprochement of softening our insistence on respect for the individual and the primacy of reason in public life at others it is the reverse a suspension of the civil liberties and normal legal processes that exemplify western cultural achievements but the way to rescue western civilisation from its present path of what looks like decline can never be to challenge its tradition of reason and individualism
1086024 i was not born in the west i was raised with the code of islam and from birth i was indoctrinated into a tribal mind set yet i have changed i have adopted the values of the enlightenment and as a result i have to live with the rejection of my native clan as well as the islamic tribe why have i done so because in a tribal society life is cruel and terrible and i am not alone muslims have been migrating to the west in droves for decades now they are in search of a better life yet their tribal and cultural constraints have travelled with them the multiculturalism and moral relativism that reign in the west have accommodated this many western leaders are terribly confused about the islamic world they are woefully uninformed and often unwilling to confront the tribal nature of islam the problem however is not too much reason but too little the enemies of reason within the west are religion and the romantic movement both the romantic movement and organised religion have contributed a great deal to the arts and to the spirituality of the western mind but they share a hostility to modernity it is not reason that accommodates and encourages the persistent segregation and tribalism of immigrant muslim populations in the west it is romanticism and its descendants multiculturalism and moral relativism promote an idealisation of tribal life and have shown themselves to be impervious to empirical criticism
1086025 to argue that children born and bred in superstitious cultures that value fanaticism are doomed to be governed by the law of the jungle is to ignore the lessons of the wests own past there have been periods when the west was less than noble when it engaged in crusades inquisitions witch burnings and genocides many of those now westerners who were born abroad into the law of the jungle with its alpha males and submissive females have since become acquainted with the culture of reason and have adopted it they are even willing to die for it perhaps with the same fanaticism as the jihadists willing to die for their tribe while this conflict between islam and the west is undeniably a deadly struggle between cultures it is individuals who will determine the outcome

1086030 penelope tree has both a name and a face that are hard to forget
1086031 both of the republican congressmen are considered vulnerable for reelection former gubernatorial candidate dina titus is already ahead of her opponent in the nevada 3rd governor gibbons has seen the republican party of nevada has not just been dealt a bad hand they are now actively working to further undermine their support in the state the ongoing fight between ron paul supporters and the party establishment over delegates is only going to continue to drive a wedge between the powers that be and small government activists in a state where aaron russo placed second with 25 9 of the vote in a four way republican primary for governor republicans are on the edge of collapse in nevada and they are only digging their own grave by alienating ron paul supporters
1086032 nevada is on the short list of states where a strong bob barr performance may help flip the state to john mccain but its important to note that john mccain by sitting on the sidelines and watching this delegate fight continue is showing no desire to court the small government voters that helped ron paul finish second ahead of mccain in the nevada caucus barack obama recently announced his support of restoring full voting rights to the florida and michigan delegations at the convention a clear sign that hes working to mend the divides in his own party following the primary john mccain could come out and support seating the ron paul delegates from nevada hes already got the nomination wrapped up but hed rather give one last kick to small government activists in the gop
1086033 the charge that mccain is sacrificing his own cherished and hard won reputation and that he may never recover it if his campaign keeps this up is most certainly correct
1086034 but the assumption that this will also destroy his chances of winning the presidency or even diminish them has less basis in reality
1086035 what can win him the election as sad as it is to say is the kind of campaign he is now resorting to
1086036 mccains aides have privately told the press that they see the fall race as a referendum on obama they are right this campaign is not about hordes of undecided voters weighing the pros and cons of mccain and obama it is about hordes of undecided voters who are inclined both because of his party label and his personality to vote for obama but who still have trouble imagining him as americas commander in chief
1086037 what bush did to mccain in the 2000 s c primary
1086038 even as bush subtly reinforced that message by indicating he wouldnt hire openly gay people for his administration
1086039 a smear campaign of the ugliest sort is now coursing through the contest for the presidency in 2000
1086040 some of george w bushs supporters have questioned republican presidential candidate john mccains fitness for the white house suggesting that his five years as a prisoner of war in north vietnam drove him insane at the time
1086041 are still seething about bush supporters in south carolina spreading word of their dark skinned adopted daughter
1086042 suggestions that mccain had committed treason while a prisoner of war and had fathered a child by a black prostitute
1086043 mccain may be unstable as a result of being tortured while a prisoner of war in north vietnam
1086044 what was interesting then is that everyone on the campaign charter concluded that rove was responsible for rumors about mccain
1086045 sources tell newsweek that rove is in fact in close touch with mcconnell as gop experts study the bill for hidden land mines
1086046 in the case of ted sampley the same guy who did bushs dirty work in going after sen
1086047 sampley accused mccain of being a weak minded coward who had escaped death by collaborating with the enemy sampley claimed that mccain had first been compromised by the vietnamese then recruited by the soviets
1086048 would you be more or less likely to vote for john mccain if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate black child

1086164 tja er kunnen natuurlijk geen echte kinderen geboren worden uit een relatie met een robot

1086193 they fixed the faulty hard drive cable faster than they said they would
1086194 didnt even charge for the cable and got the simm problem right
1086195 when i brought it in with a crying baby for realism
1086196 a tech checked all the settings to make sure it wasnt just a software problem they charged the minimum diagnostic service fee 19 99 and threw the cable in for free
1086197 over the telephone the technician said hed seen my disk controller failure a million times a day and it meant i needed to replace the hard drive i really had to wrestle with him to accept the machine for a hands on diagnosis
1086198 on the plus side they replaced my old motherboard and its 150 mhz pentium cpu with one using a 166 mhz pentium
1086199 the entire process was an exercise in incompetence mixed with what appeared to be good intentions
1086200 i didnt hear the hard drive make any noise you know like it was working so its a goner
1086201 our records indicate that a hard drive was sent to compaq in exchange for the new one

1086268 emerge chiaramente che lopinione pubblica israeliana pi realistica dei politici che agiscono nel suo nome che cercano di giustificare una volgare violazione dei diritti dei palestinesi servendosi di una giustificazione basata su ragioni di sicurezza che la maggior parte degli israeliani considera totalmente infondata
1086269 i politici e la classe dirigente israeliani dovrebbero ascoltare bene le persone che li stanno mettendo in guardia rispetto al fatto che la politica israeliana a gaza sta principalmente danneggiando i civili palestinesi a discapito degli interessi della stessa israele

1086295 well im back yet again a scant few weeks ago i took a look at thermaltakes fairly good prowater 850i kit making just one observation performance could probably see a great improvement if another larger radiator had been added while this concept had in fact been done before on their bigwater 745i it was stunted by mediocre radiators a weaker pump and an older waterblock considering that two of these three factors were corrected in the 850 logic would dictate that throwing the third improvement in would make this kit really shine though its a shame that i dont have the older kits on hand to give a performance review against i feel that this pair of reviews should give users a good idea of the performance they stand to gain provided they have the desire and the space to plumb a second radiator as well as a videocard waterblock into the loop that being said lets crack open the box and see just what a 70 upgrade entails

1086300 well thats really sad i didnt know that barack obama had stooped to dishonesty
1086301 well thats really sad i didnt know that barack obama had stooped to dishonesty you know pointing out weaknesses in other peoples campaigns or positions is also fair game but thats dishonest as you know first of all corporations are not allowed to give contributions to candidates and employees of oil companies give to barack obama as well as to john mccain so thats part number one thats dishonest and number two john mccain doesnt ask for any tax reduction for oil companies theres no special deal going to oil companies hes asking to reduce taxes on all corporations to help build our economy and strengthen jobs as well as reducing taxes on individuals so its simply dishonest as well as below the belt
1086302 just to clarify according to the washington post oil and gas industry executives and employees donated 1 1 million to john mccains campaign last month so i think that is what hes referring to in that ad
1086303 but what you dont point out is the employees and executives of the oil companies also gave money to barack obama and to suggest that they only gave to john mccain is dishonest theres no indication that thats the case in fact individuals can give to candidates of both parties and they regularly do
1086304 right well let me just ask you about this because if john mccain became president he wants to lower the corporate tax rate by 10 so 35 down to 25 and that would include companies like big oil and exxon mobil who took in 12 billion last quarter alone how do you explain that to the everyday joe whos seeing a larger chunk of their paycheck taken up by high gases prices and these oil companies are going to see more money in their pockets while the average guy is seeing less
1086305 well first of all hes lowering taxes for all corporations in america to help make us more competitive with other nations of the world where corporations are going because we have the highest corporate tax rate in the world next to japan so hes trying to build our economy and create more jobs and hes not singling out any one company or another

1086315 faith and science are often considered to be polar opposites requiring people to declare themselves as either skeptics or true believers but in firmament by kathleen l housley the polarity of faith and science creates energy much like a time space force field or a sacred dimension polarity is essential which means that the visionary poet must be both skeptic and true believer reverently letting opposing images collide and combine for example in firmament several poems explore how a natural child could attain such supernatural attributes as omniscience and omnipresence who would be the childs teachers what would be the lessons is quantum mechanics on the syllabus what about fractals in the poem body parts michelangelo abruptly dispenses with painting wings on angels because he has never dissected them but then he begins to playfully ponder gods approach to aerodynamics in another poem an agnostic astronomer yearningly addresses a prayer to the cosmological constant these poems are neither confessional nor personal first person singular is rarely used rather they are revamped metaphysical while judeo christian in perspective firmament encourages readers of all traditions not to choose between faith and science but to be awed by the force fields that exist between them

1086324 they are only allowed to smoke cigarettes that they already have from home while on tour and will be asked to smoke alone and not in groups
1086325 some of the tour participants may have been smoking for two or three years and we understand that they cant give up for a month they are not allowed to smoke in groups so if they want to have a cigarette they will have to do so alone because we dont want to encourage people to smoke
1086326 there will be no smoking at all allowed on our tours we strongly support the new laws if anyone is caught smoking while on tour it will be considered a disciplinary breach
1086327 if the parents buy the cigarettes then it is okay why shouldnt they be allowed i have smoked since i was 14 its fine
1086328 smoking is not particularly good in the first place and it is a positive thing that they have changed the law but a more laid back approach rather than banning it outright on tour would be better
1086329 while i dont think it is good to smoke i think that the kids need to have the freedom to smoke and they should all experience it as it is good to experience things

1086362 impacts on individual species indicate wider changes at the biome level that will potentially change conditions for many plant and animal species in addition to ecosystem services to humans
1086363 the central u s is characterized by an ecotone thats the intersection of forest in the east and grassland in the west
1086364 the border between these ecosystems is largely determined by climate variability and it is likely that climate change will shift the location of this and other ecological boundaries worldwide
1086365 99 percent of the worlds potatoes are related to potatoes of chilean origin
1086366 99 percent are also genetically related to potatoes originating in peru in other words they coexisted potatoes will always carry genes from varieties found in chile and peru
1086367 i hope chauvinistic nationalism will be laid aside as it contributes nothing to scientific development and protection of the potato which is a multicultural and cross border resource
1086368 the state must register the variety to ensure recognition of the benefits and must also reward the communities of small farmer who originally cultivated it and have conserved it for years
1086369 potato growing on chilo is precarious production is mainly for subsistence and the areas planted are tending to shrink due to the high cost of fertiliser
1086370 the importance of native potatoes as a resource is greatly underestimated people generally eat improved varieties
1086371 our greatest need is training and regular technical advice in order to improve production
1086372 we are the worst affected within the potato production chain and also the most vulnerable to soaring food prices
1086373 while our countries waste time arguing about the origin of animal and plant species developed countries are using our germplasms to create new materials and claim property rights
1086374 solving our local production problems avoiding the loss of ancient varieties and widening the genetic base of cultivated potatoes

1086424 i have also spoken with representative deweese and asked him to resign his role as majority leader he has become a lightning rod for controversy and we need to get back to the issues unfortunately this scandal has cast a cloud over our efforts to reform harrisburg and the accomplishments we have already achieved
1086425 we strongly object to this report which merely repeats the prosecutions arguments
1086426 the publication of this report and the way it was released to the press is shocking
1086427 as long as societe generale makes dough everything is fine from the moment where between jan 18 to 23 societe generale thinks it can lose money kerviel becomes in the eyes of the world of societe generale responsible for everything
1086428 we were pretty much expecting those kids to come in kind of late
1086429 we just kind of put that into our time my upperclassmen were ready to go but we just had to sit tight while we got those younger cats their stuff were ready to go now
1086430 we had a guy that started for two years before me
1086431 now ive got to step it up because ill be a junior just kind of follow in his footsteps because he was a good leader
1086432 lots of schools do this but it is something i started when i came here in 2001
1086433 its cool i left the house at 10 p m and it was 98 degrees
1086434 this is my 23rd year in this district and we came out and did a county fair with different types of agility drills for four days and then put them in pads the fifth day
1086435 i figure we can condition them and teach them have them learn offense and defense during individual group and team time just as good as running them to death and discouraging them if we make it interesting theyll keep them coming back
1086436 hopefully our numbers will increase in the next few days
1086437 we used to in college always have oxygen ready for those guys that would get so nervous theyd hyperventilate
1086438 everybody who didnt show up this summer it will probably affect them the first two or three days out here
1086439 the fact that we knew it was going to be hot was why we started at 7 a m
1086440 most of them have worked out all summer in our conditioning program im not worried about those kids im worried about the ones who were sitting on the couch all summer
1086441 first of all we got to stay together as a team last year we were falling apart during the game
1086442 weve just got to stay together and work hard as a team strive for excellence
1086443 it will get me prepared for college to see what i can do by myself
1086444 were going to try and run a two platoon system so we can prepare our guys for an offensive and defensive position we dont want them to play two ways but they may have to at a point in time with injuries
1086445 its going to be tough to make the playoffs but we think we can beat one of the favorites
1086446 we want to make the playoffs and win in the playoffs
1086447 i feel a lot more comfortable at the varsity level and i think were going to surprise some people

1086449 its a fact of modern life that there is disparity and is it fair or unfair is not a valid question its just the way it is and you have to get on with it people say its unfair when they dont do anything to change their circumstances
1086450 quite a lot of people have done well who want to achieve and quite a lot of people havent done well because they dont want to achieve
1086451 some of these are vocational things like nurses its accepted they go into it knowing that thats part of the deal

1086459 obama refers to big oil and the need to reduce our use of oil by 35 over the next twenty years how do we get there keep inflating those tires folks
1086460 it seems to me the only thing obama wants us to do is inflate tires

1086490 look in my opinion flopping is part of the game and should not be penalized in any way shape or form
1086491 we probably had about three weeks to sort of just hang out together and get to know each other and we definitely just got along right away
1086492 like gugino said we have a lot of similarities in our lives and in our families that sort of brought us even closer so we could relate these characters to things that have happened in our lives and sharing those with each other so that we knew when we were doing our scenes where that was coming from
1086493 when zack first said i would love to talk to you about playing this character i thought well this sounds amazing but in the graphic novel especially theres so much more of sally jupiter as an older woman than there is in her youth
1086494 we have the flashback to the rape and a couple of other brief moments but not much else so i thought thats interesting i would think hed want a much older actress and ultimately in a way sort of showing the passage of time and how we come from the 40s to the 80s he ended up adding in a lot more images of her as a young woman i think you need to see sally jupiter shine in her own right so that you can understand why she tries to impose that on laurie

1086498 we need to create positive momentum we need to capture the next wave any time you announce these types of actions there is some internal noise but realignment is the right thing to do
1086499 its not about being third or fourth its about profitability
1086500 we have brought in quite a few new players and they have responded well
1086501 we have still got to put the final pieces together
1086502 overall weve had a good month or so and changed quite a few things around
1086503 we are getting very close to getting stuck into what will be a very difficult campaign for us
1086504 by the end of august we will know the league inside out and hopefully that will be a good thing
1086505 weve got to have a decent august to make it all worthwhile and to get all of our fans on board because we are not complete without our fans on side
1086506 for that to be complete we have to win football matches
1086507 he recibido muchas llamadas del gremio rechazando las duras cr ticas de nicolini y como primera instancia hemos visto la posibilidad de ir a una huelga este domingo lo que pedimos es que nicolini asuma su responsabilidad en la crisis que atraviesa el arbitraje peruano
1086508 lament profundamente esta situaci n y los rbitros se sienten muy dolidos por lo que dice el se or nicolini las consideramos poco ticas y poco leales al arbitraje nacional
1086509 estoy indignado y molesto no sabe de que manera nos afectado moralmente el nico responsable de este principal problema es nicolini y no s porque se autoexcluye nicolini se ha graduado de falta de tica el no me ha regalado nada todo lo que he conseguido es gracias a mi esfuerzo y sacrificio no le debo nada a nadie
1086510 por dos partidos que me he equivocado no puede tirar mi trabajo de a os en el arbitraje adem s no creo que la conmebol haya dicho que solo dos rbitros peruanos sirven me imagino que nicolini mal interpret sus declaraciones

1086521 devout muslims are importing creationist theories into science and are not being challenged because of political correctness one of the countrys most famous scientists said tonight professor dawkins a geneticist and author of the best selling book the god delusion said islam is importing creationism into this country most devout muslims are creationists so when you go to schools there are a large number of children of islamic parents who trot out what they have been taught the government could do more but it doesnt want to because it is fanatical about multiculturalism and the need to respect the different traditions from which these children come its almost impossible to say anything against islam in this country because if you do you are accused of being racist or islamophobic

1086541 i have also been taking in a lot of the climbing that boulder has to offer which takes me up over 6 500 feet 2 000 meters each time
1086542 long solid rides have been on the menu the last couple weeks with a lot of intensity mixed into the rides as well
1086543 i feel truly privileged to be able to call both moises and glen my teammates and it just goes to show what type of program we have
1086544 race results aside both are great guys and truly deserve the opportunity all of us on team type 1 are pulling for them to try and bring home a medal for their country

1086549 tackl es the stereotype about suburbs that of a colorless design free zone
1086550 i grew up in suburbia and escaped as soon as i possibly could and so it required a certain amount of effort to maintain a kind of objective or non judgmental stance
1086551 t he governor of minnesota to me was the archetypal suburbanite he was white he was middle class he was evangelical christian republican and then i was just asking myself some harder questions i dont want anyone to paint all italians in the same way or all gay people in the same way and so thats how this started i just started looking around its so massively uniform and i mean i do feel like im in the twilight zone right now
1086552 the topic or board you are looking for appears to be either missing or off limits to you

1086560 if youre asking me as a betting man i think its between gabe and melissa
1086561 gabe and melissa without a doubt are in my opinion vocally head and shoulders above shawn mayer
1086562 so representative of a lot of our listeners in country music
1086563 you could record some great songs with her that speak to her life and would connect with millions and millions of americans
1086564 hispanic people are the fasting growing sector of our society
1086565 i grew up in that neighborhood some of my childhood friends were mexican kids i grew up with and went to school with everyday and i know we havent had a bridge to that community in the u s in a long long time
1086566 i have no doubt that shawn mayer and i can go into the studio and cut a hit record
1086567 she is a walking dichotomy like a lot of country singers she says im the toughest girl youll ever meet and then cry at the drop of a hat thats something country fans can relate to
1086568 there were artists on the show who shouldve never been on there in my opinion and did not represent the best of what nashville has to offer and would not have a chance at connecting with our audience
1086569 not having real nashville country people involved in the talent picking process
1086570 the fans who have voted throughout the show have voted it down to the final three and all of the final three would have a shot in the real world at connecting with our audience and making great music in nashville
1086571 that tells you that the country music audience is very discerning and you cannot pull the wool over their eyes

1086577 the other two dancers could not rehearse as well and so hopefully everybody is going to be in the same boat hopefully everybody will be refreshed by having a full day off

1086583 the post trade phone call was almost an ah ha moment for them they said see
1086584 to find out and jason varitek although he said he didnt personally witness it he was aware of it that manny wasnt going to get on the bus to take the team to the airport to go to seattle and then comes up with a knee injury in seattle that tells you pretty much what you need to know

1086699 when we first prescribed highly active antiretroviral therapy for hiv in 1995 we were concerned about how these drugs changed lipid levels in patients and whether they would increase atherosclerosis and ultimately lead to serious heart disease
1086700 while some studies have found an association between these antiretroviral treatments and increased risk of cardiovascular disease we believe our findings should reassure clinicians that using antiretroviral therapy over time does not appear to put patients at greater risk for coronary atherosclerosis and may in fact be more beneficial than we had initially thought
1086701 this was not surprising since these are the major risk factors for atherosclerosis in the general population
1086702 the purpose of our study however was to investigate whether long term haart usage was a major risk factor
1086703 these results could be due in part to lower lipid values of hiv infected men prior to beginning antiretroviral therapy and high use of lipid lowering drugs the key is that controlling risk factors for atherosclerosis should be a priority
1086704 at a time when life saving medications are available to treat persons living with hiv there continues to be a population of hiv positive people who have fallen through the cracks
1086705 frequently their only contact with the healthcare system is during a hospitalization
1086706 we know that not being engaged in care and prevention services is not only bad for the individuals but is also bad for society in that a substantial fraction of hiv infected crack users engage in behavior that transmits the virus to others
1086707 dietary intake and nutritional education dine for latino migrant farmworkers
1086708 migrant workers have a low level of food security that is the lack of well balanced food choices readily available at all times to maintain a healthy life

1086711 do all of these patients have the same mechanism for reflux and swallowing disorders if not performing a fundoplication anti reflux surgery may not help in fact it may make things worse like it did in the rett girls
1086712 this issue is of particular interest to pediatricians who refer these patients for their reflux problems
1086713 if we develop a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the problems being experienced by these children we just might be able to find a way to make life a little more comfortable for them
1086714 its hard to tell parents how to interact with their children based on one study but what we see here is that parents who have a propensity for being verbally aggressive have a tendency to try to direct and control their children during a play period
1086715 as a result these children were less cooperative and not only are parents setting up situations that are challenging for them to handle but they also are subtly undermining their childs self esteem
1086716 of course all parents direct their children and people in general are always directing others to close a door or hand them something
1086717 its something we do all the time but there is a qualitative difference in the kinds of directing going on by these verbally aggressive mothers by looking at how and when directives occurred not just how often we found that moms who scored highest on verbal aggression used directives to control the child and ultimately the way the game or activity was played the aggressive action is not overt as in a parent hitting or yelling but these small negative maneuvers can say so much to a child
1086718 we all say things to our children that we regret saying but saying a lot of things that attack a childs self confidence is not healthy
1086719 these parents were in an unstructured low stress environment and if we saw this behavior in such a brief setting how could such negative interactions even so subtle affect a child over the long term for example if the parents always have to control what activity they and their children are going to play as well as for how long and how they are going to play it you wonder if this communicates to the child that what they want to do doesnt matter
1086720 genetically we have been very successful in breeding animals that can grow very quickly but the down side is that comes at the price of eating quality

1086730 if all incompatible donors and recipients were simply listed in one common pool the problems related to incompatible and poorly matched donors and recipients would be a thing of the past
1086731 newyork presbyterian weill cornell introduced the registry to ucla a few months ago prompting ucla to join the innovative program
1086732 this is a rare instance of a living donor kidney being shipped across the country to initiate a chain
1086733 if we can become comfortable shipping living donor kidneys like we do with deceased donor kidneys then thousands of patients will have the opportunity to receive a kidney who otherwise would have been forced to remain on dialysis
1086734 the hope is that this marks the first of many such collaborations among the nations transplant centers
1086735 donor chains have enormous potential to expand the donor pool and to provide better matched organs for the many individuals who are in desperate need of lifesaving transplants
1086736 kidney donor chains could have a significant impact on the countrys organ donor shortage
1086737 whereas the chain involves an extra donor in the beginning so you can initiate a self propagating cascade
1086738 but in this case ucla received a live donor kidney from new york which hasnt been done before
1086739 living donor exchange represents the pinnacle of teamwork and professional and personal trust and good faith that ideally epitomizes the organ transplant endeavor
1086740 the team consists of surgeons physicians nurses coordinators patients and donors all working together toward the same goal
1086741 patients can wait up to eight years for a deceased donor transplant
1086742 this donor chain may enable hundreds of patients to receive a kidney thanks to one generous altruistic donor rather than in the past where only one patient benefited from an altruistic donor this could significantly decrease the waiting list for kidney transplantation
1086743 i have had the incredibly sad experience of having a colleague die while waiting for a kidney transplant
1086744 i have a close friend who donated a kidney to her brother and i have a close friend who received a kidney more than a decade ago and i see the terrific experiences shes had since
1086745 when i started thinking about it i thought im able and healthy at this point in my life to do this to help someone have more years of a better life why not donate the beauty of this partnership between excellent doctors transplant coordinators and staff at newyork presbyterian weill cornell ucla and a group of seven people a partnership connecting both coasts is that a chain of people have better lives and the chain goes on
1086746 if we can get this exchange program going its going to be the answer to lots of peoples situations
1086747 this is going to help so many people down the line
1086748 pam couldnt sit on the transplant wait list for several years something needed to be done im glad i could do my part to help
1086749 everyone would benefit if more donated today its me tomorrow its someone else
1086750 it was like a closed door that is now being opened again
1086751 randy and i talked about it and we said ok hes willing to give to somebody else and i wont have to take as many medications after the surgery
1086752 the epidemic growth of type 2 diabetes has created a race against time to find new approaches to treat and understand the disease diabetes surgery and other novel interventional techniques are not only a promising therapeutic option for selected patients with type 2 diabetes but also an unprecedented opportunity to shed light on the origin of the disease to ensure a timely scientific and safe development of this emerging discipline it is necessary to balance enthusiasm with caution this is possible only with the immediate attention and responsible urgent actions from the global diabetes community
1086753 implementation of widely accepted international recommendations to avoid an inappropriate use of surgery and ensure respect of safety standards has become top priority
1086754 while these procedures may be life saving less than 2 percent of those patients already eligible under current nih recommendations are offered a surgical option in the u s
1086755 this may be because of limited awareness among primary care physicians surgeons and diabetes specialists and insufficient insurance coverage

1086831 listening to records used to be a time to be enjoy with a few friends hang out listen to the music and read the liner notes on the back
1086832 maybe you enjoyed the gatefold sleeves in a personal way maybe you just enjoyed slipping the sealing material off the cover on your pants by rubbing the corner of the record on your knee taking the record out getting that little
1086833 all formats have their points i just like handling vinyl i was a dj for years and used to use records to entertain in the philadelphia and new york area i didnt just play records we made a night of entertainment as for the digital sound i prefer the warmer sounds i get from vinyl
1086834 i do have a music collection and my favorite items are not necessarily rare
1086835 forever vinyl gets more than twenty calls a day for customers looking for appraisals for estates and charity donations
1086836 as far as the elements of an appraisal it depends on the needs of the customer for donations we draw a number of different elements to get the correct market value for your collection we neither under nor over appraise your collection
1086837 what makes a house value location location location when it comes to records demand demand demand age is not a determining factor in record collection demand is
1086838 there really arent any obstacles per say other then finding a non profit entity to accept them the irs is very picky about fair retail market value as they should be we should all pay our fair share of the tax burden its important to understand that the irs considers the value of a collection to be based on the value and use of the entity you are donating the collection to if you donate the collection to a university and they hold on to it for three years possibly put it in their library and make the collection available to the students to learn from the appraisal will normally stand if you donate the collection to a thrift shop the irs will normally look at what the thrift shop sold the collection for and adjust any appraisal value over that amount needless to say we highly recommend finding a charity that would value and use the collection rather then just dump the collection for pennies on the dollar
1086839 as you know many records are now valued in the hundreds and thousands of dollars because of the amount of appraisals that are requested per day weve instituted a reasonable fee to cover our cost time and expertise for these appraisals our current fee is 20 00 for the first item of the appraisal and 5 00 for each additional item for collections with over 200 pieces please call us 732 505 5337 for adjusted rates

1086853 the no 17 ranking was nothing that we hadnt expected
1086854 the real challenge has been to remind our team what has gotten us to this point winning at home and winning a conference championship are it
1086855 another thing i had to remind them about was in 1997 we started out at no 17 and then went 6 5 the preseason doesnt always ensure that you have a great year its nice to be acknowledged for the past two years but it doesnt mean much for this year
1086856 i would like to have a fall camp motto to refer to in order to give us our best chance to succeed early in the year

1086862 if we want to end the year playing in a bcs bowl game then weve got to start somewhere no 17 is a good place to start and hopefully well be able to be one of the top 10 teams by the end of the season

1086886 my brother hosam and i knew that obama will be a big hit even before he became a candidate we knew the guy would be a celebrity in gaza so we decided to invest the amount of 29 000 to buy obama t shirts from his website and sell them in gaza
1086887 i know on the back of this story obama rivals will present our business as a donation and they will try to use this story to let obama fall but im telling you we bought t shirts
1086888 we have nothing to do with the obama campaign we just like obama and believe he will be the best for the palestinians and for the world
1086889 some young men even bought the t shirts for 60 shekel 17 29 which is a lot to spend in gaza on a t shirt but that is how much gazans like obama

1086897 he jesus said bless your enemies each time i read the bible i felt those words were directed at me as though jesus were standing in front of me he knew what to say to me
1086898 of course i realised that when your enemy is awful it is hard to live out those words faithfully and therefore i felt like saying the exact opposite when i said these words however it was like magic i felt a kind of relief the hatred simply vanished i feel that a transformation took place within me and i owe that change to being able to listen to what god wanted for me it was a constant dialogue with the gospels
1086899 at the start of my captivity i said to myself you are going to be here for months and months so you might as well read the bible which i had not done previously
1086900 when i read that i exclaimed my god i know what i want to be free
1086901 later i understood that i had to thank god for taking him because my father would never have been able to endure those six years of suffering
1086902 i was listening to radio maria the international catholic radio station and i discovered that june is the month dedicated to the sacred heart so i said this prayer my jesus i have never asked anything of you because i am so ashamed of your greatness i am simply too ashamed to ask but now i am going to ask you for something very specific i do not know exactly what it means to consecrate oneself to the sacred heart but if you tell me during the month of june i will be all yours
1086903 i thought there we go hes on time the fact of the matter is that jesus kept his word i experienced a miracle

1087113 following the successful adoption of email security in the cloud we are seeing increased interest from large and small organizations to leverage saas security to protect their http https channel
1087114 saas is ideal for large corporations with dozens of internet gateways where deploying traditional point products is very expensive it is a good fit for small businesses which do not have enough it staff zscalers well designed in the cloud service with integrated functionality provides high security and granular control at low tco
1087115 wipro helps its global customers deploy robust risk management and governance solutions based on industry best practices we are seeing growing interest from our customers for the software as a service saas model as it provides a more cost effective alternative solution for enterprises to achieve regulatory compliance rather than implementing traditional packaged applications we are glad to partner with zscaler to provide comprehensive functionality using their saas model to deliver higher value and greater roi
1087116 we are not taking existing web proxies sticking them in a data center and calling it an in the cloud service
1087117 just as salesforce coms multi tenant architecture differentiated it from the current solutions zscalers architecture coupled with a global security network sets a new standard in the saas security space
1087118 the changes in web technologies over the last several years such as user generated content and ajax based applications require a security approach that goes beyond basic url filtering
1087119 purewire has taken a unique approach to address the complete web security problem particularly with the companys focus on script based browser attacks and user reputation which are needed to maintain trust and safety in todays web environment
1087120 todays dynamic and interactive web environment is the new threat vector of choice and the security industry as a whole is a decade late in innovating ways to secure the new web
1087121 the purewire web security service integrates sophisticated technology and analysis to bring the highest levels of security performance and control to web users in the office or on the go and trust back to the web
1087122 as web based attacks become more sophisticated web security solutions will play an increasingly valuable role as an enhancement to traditional url filtering anti virus and firewall deployments
1087123 we built the purewire service from the ground up as saas providing organizations with instant access to innovative technologies without the time and costs associated with hardware or software installs and maintenance for our partners this offers a quick entry into a rapidly growing market and the highest quality of security performance and control available
1087124 our enterprise customers are asking to move more security solutions to the cloud weve already seen a tremendous response on the email security service side and now the demand is growing for web
1087125 weve worked with the team launching purewire for many years in the atlanta security market and are confident purewire will deliver the service support and margins to support its channel partners
1087126 we have around 1500 members at our gym and provide them with kiosk internet access to surf the web while at our facility since they arent employees of our organization we have very little control over end user education on where they go on the web at the same time we need to maintain control over where our pcs are going and what types of threats they might be bringing back to our network
1087127 this makes having a flexible web security solution critical the purewire web security service was an easy decision to make easy to deploy no requirement for hardware easy to manage and has no impact on the user experience in any way
1087128 social networks have come a long way from their days of idle probing they have evolved from networking and prospecting tools to a way for companies to hire employees and build better relationships with their customers but how are companies really using these tools these case studies put it in perspective

1087210 looking at it from the government point of view theres a strong political motivation to understate the cpi by understating it keeps cola adjustments down on entitlements which are at this point the largest part of the governments budget and by understating cpi the government can minimize the inflationary impact on things such as rents which are indexed to cpi or wages pensions and a whole list of ancillary costs to artificially keep inflation rates down bottom line the published cpi understates the real inflation rate

1087212 the fed remains skeptical that high commodity prices will ripple through the economy leading to broad price hikes and big wage increases

1087217 in other words in the contemporary economy inflation benefits the wealthy because they pay their workers in deflated currency while they can take advantage of inflation to further jack up prices and then income thus the upper classes have fortified their economic positions to take account of inflation through their power over prices income and other compensations in a way that wage workers and people on fixed income and other vulnerable sectors cannot bankers protect their loans via adjustable interest rates monopoly resource owners jack up prices to retain profits wholesalers mark up prices to compensate for higher commodity prices large scale retailers squeeze final consumers the great majority at the bottom of the production and distribution chain

1087221 as architects of the global economy the world bank and the imf have enormous power and shape the conditions of peoples lives around the world
1087222 i live now in the united states where people so far are relatively unscathed by the reordering of the global economy for the benefit of the very rich
1087223 the imf and world bank with the structural adjustment programs saps they impose on indebted countries and their pro corporate development projects are the leading edge of oppressive globalization the policies they have imposed in africa latin america and asia have condemned people to stagnation poverty and death for twenty years and those policies are now being adopted in the countries of europe and north america too

1087277 we picked save the coratee because of two real reasons one i try to live my life and everything i do with a healthy sense of the ridiculous two the mac community is a creative and innovative community hand them a fake animal with no description rather than its kinda like a manatee and people love it it builds community and creates a family feeling that is fun

1087294 job growth matters but only if you could get it where jobs are needed the most we found that jobs had a bigger impact on reducing poverty in smaller metropolitan areas because if you live in a small area you can get to where the jobs are but if you live in columbus or cleveland or new york or atlanta it is going to be harder to get to the jobs
1087295 many lower skilled workers are single mothers with children who dont have reliable transportation their kids get sick so they miss a couple of days of work and then they get fired so finding ways of breaking down this kind of barrier so they can work can really make a difference
1087296 you tend to find out about jobs from your friends coworkers and neighbors but if you live in an area that is downtown and the jobs are being created out in the suburbs it will be more difficult to find out what jobs are available
1087297 in some suburbs there are particular kinds of zoning that make it difficult to create affordable housing lot size requirements and zoning that keeps out apartments puts limits on where people can move if they have limited resources all of these three barriers public transportation information about new jobs and housing barriers keep the people from low income households from getting the jobs that are available far from home
1087298 dynamic addition to what promises to be an exciting and monumental day for democrats across the granite state

1087300 the state responds to the want of evidence with the assertion that in person voter impersonation fraud is hard to detect but this is like saying the
1087301 this result is very exciting and it is one of the last stepping stones on the route to possible detection of the elusive higgs boson
1087302 the actual person teaching makes a difference in how students learn when there is a good relationship that really facilitates learning and motivation and we found that in almost every area the regular classroom teachers were more effective they were better
1087303 the relationship between the teacher and the student particularly during adolescence is very important it was easier for the kids to talk about personal stuff with someone they knew it was easier for them to absorb the material and become more interested in what they were talking about with their regular teacher in the classroom
1087304 when you have kids who simply memorize material for the test and two weeks later dont remember any of it youre not getting anywhere but if you can get the kids to care and learn because they think its important thats something that will last a lifetime
1087305 students who had a sexual partner were more likely to say that there was class discussion going on with the regular teacher than those taught by the outside person these kids were more likely to feel like there was discussion of these issues rather than just the teacher lecturing to them
1087306 school is the absolute best way to get information out to adolescents no matter who is teaching the important thing is getting the teacher to make a connection if the teacher can make the right connection with one kid youve saved one person from getting hiv youve saved one persons life

1087309 this issue is of particular interest to pediatricians who refer these patients for their reflux problems

1087322 obamas candidacy while generating high levels of enthusiasm among black voters is not seen by them as evidence of significant improvement in race relations
1087323 i think its bad news for the obama campaign less than a third of whites have a favorable opinion of barack obama and the campaigns efforts at pushback demonstrate that they are aware of the badness of this news obama gets support of 37 of whites vs 89 of blacks that was the polarization which the hillary clinton team first indirectly and then directly harped on and there is good reason why the obama camp is so sensitive after reverend wright trinity united and father pfleger the mystique of a post racial candidate evaporated and they dont want further erosion or the perception to take hold that obama isnt a candidate with wide appeal
1087324 nagourney and thee write that americans are sharply divided by race with more than 80 percent of black voters holding a favorable opinion of obama compared to the 30 percent of white voters who do the obama campaign response points to multiple and significant pieces of data that actually indicate a trend much different from that which the story suggests and suggests that nagourney and thee were duped by a fallacy of inductive reasoning for example although obamas favorability rating is 31 among whites its only a few points off mccains 34
1087325 so many race polls so little insight todays sober ny times poll comes to the very same conclusions that the wacky washington post poll which turned into a game of white people so you think youre not racist found last month blacks really love obama and whites kinda like mccain good work fellas the obama campaign hit back hard this morning saying basically hey a lot of whites other than his grandma actually like him and michelle too white liberals like back them up scher notes that although obama trails mccain by 9 points he is running much better among whites than john kerry did in 2004 especially among working class whites
1087326 regular swampland readers are familiar with the insights of jackson dykman our datameister here at time heres part of what jackson had to say i too was really struck by the nyts characterization of its own poll ive rarely seen a story so wildly off from the actual data on which it is based aside from point c in the obama response which is true and basically negates the story the premise of the story is well utter nonsense are we really supposed to think that because a black man has become the democratic nominee in recent weeks that he somehow should have cured or markedly improved race relations in this country
1087327 the obama campaign is righteously p o ed i must admit that my breath is stopped by the idea of saying anything about black white opinion differences based on a poll with only 300 blacks in it that is bizarre statistical malpractice of a high order nagourney and thee say that 40 of blacks and 20 of whites say that there has been no progress thats not what the question asked the question reads some people say that since the 1960s there has been a lot of real progress in getting rid of racial discrimination against blacks others say that there hasnt been much real progress
1087328 t he fact that the obama campaign is going after the paper for it is a little telling after all the slant of the papers analysis seems to be trying to advance either the notion that whites should feel guilty that they are not supporting obama even more strongly or laying the foundation for blaming his lagging support even a possible loss on white racism accordingly camp obamas whining here is of a piece with their complaint about the satriric new yorker cover the campaigns desire to control obamas image is now overweening extending to attacking its natural allies in the establishment media for publishing things they likely believe will help obama there is a point where the desire to control image and message can become counter productive
1087329 what the poll reveals is not a nation in which race dictates political behavior at least not for whites but the poll does suggest continued racial grievance on the part of blacks with almost 40 saying they think there has been little or no progress in eliminating discrimination since the 1960s and only 29 rating race relations in the u s as generally good yet hispanics have virtually identical views on the progress of race relations as whites with 52 saying race relations are generally good compared to 55 if whites this despite hispanics perception that they are sometimes targets of discrimination maybe the times ought to begin asking why despite obvious and real improvement in race relations and eliminating discrimination over the years blacks remain so pessimistic in their outlook
1087330 sorry but this article is pretty stupid and well critiqued by the obama campaign the older i get the more i think that journalism daily journalism especially is simply incapable of dealing with something as nuanced as the black white relations in this country they just arent capable nor despite their claims of objectivity are they unbias take it from a journalist good journalism needs conflict no conflict no story but while the artisan searches for the natural conflict inherent in life itself the hack has some polling firm call a bunch of people and then writes a headline overstating the results
1087331 as ive mentioned before one of the problems black candidates often have is that white voters assume theyll use their position to help black voters at the expense of whites a perception white opponents sometimes try to subtly reinforce that only 16 percent of whites believe this about obama or at least admit it to pollsters and 79 percent think obama will treat members of both races equally seems like a real achievement
1087332 note that if we restrict our attention to white people views are pretty similar 31 percent like obama 35 percent like mccain the main difference is that black people are really enthusiastic about barack obama a plurality of americans say they plan to vote for him for president and though obamas coalition includes the vast majority of black americans whites outnumber blacks within it i cant think of other examples of a comparable number of white people supporting a black candidate given the countrys history its all pretty impressive if you ask me
1087333 obama despite having an african father a white american mother and a winning smile has failed to bring the country together for some reason black americans are still more likely to see racial problems in everyday life than white americans clearly this is obamas fault in other news men and women as revealed during the democratic primaries sometimes perceive things differently and who is to blame for this persistent divide thats right hillary clinton despite her femaleness and positions sometimes perceived as manly people of different genders still see things differently
1087334 next thing you know someones going to find evidence that obamas candidacy isnt helping to lower divorce rates fight the obesity epidemic or improve the national leagues performance in all star games some messiah ambinder posted a response from nagourney
1087335 w e are comfortable that our story accurately captured the results on the questions that most struck us we make our polls public in the spirit of transparency and so that others can take a look and draw their own conclusions but i do think there is room for discussion about the headline poll finds obama candidacy isnt closing divide on race and i should have included in saying that 20 percent of white voters had a favorable view of michelle obama the fact that 72 percent either have no opinion about mrs obama or hadnt heard enough about her
1087336 on a conference call just now with reporters mccain foreign policy adviser randy scheunemann compared barack obamas insistence on a timetable for withdrawal from iraq to pres bush s insistence that we were winning even as things went badly for years
1087337 i think the american people have had enough of inflexibility and stubbornness in national security policy
1087338 when asked later by the huffington posts sam stein whether the campaign was disparaging president bush scheunemann dug in
1087339 we cannot afford to replace one administration that refused for too long to acknowledge failure in iraq with a candidate that refuses to acknowledge success in iraq
1087340 the mccain campaign is taking their effort to distance their candidate from the unpopular president bush to a whole new level mccains advisers are now openly attacking bush on iraq and not only that theyre also saying that barack obama is the one who is like bush on the war
1087341 mccain campaign finally makes obvious link between obama and bush
1087342 so barack obama is now a flip flopper and a stubborn ideologue at the same time meaning he is twice as bad as george w bush who is actually the same person as barack obama
1087343 the charge of course is not related to policy on which obama and bush drastically differ but rather ideological rigidity but the suggestion that obama is too stubborn to change his position on iraq is a bit ironic coming from a mccain campaign that as recently as one week ago jumped all over the senator for saying he would refine his position
1087344 lets take this one step at a time first its probably safe to assume the mccain campaigns internal polls show mccain getting hammered on the bushs third term line of criticism theyre so desperate mccains aides are now trying to argue that obama is just like bush this is just so pathetic i almost feel sorry for the mccain campaign second its fascinating to hear the mccain team triangulate off of bushs refusal to acknowledge failure in iraq um guys mccain was the one cheering bush on while he was failing telling americans we had to stay the course but perhaps most importantly i cant help but laugh at the notion that mccain is supposed to be the sensible flexible one in this equation is mccain open to a withdrawal timeline no is he open to a phased redeployment no the entire mccain operation is just a joke
1087345 during the primaries when hillary clinton tried to paint herself as the agent of change you knew obama had won at least half the battle it is similarly revealing when mccain tries to argue he not obama is the real agent of change even worse when mccains campaign bizarrely tries to argue that obama is the bush clone
1087346 at first blush it would seem to be a positive for obama that he is hard to mock but on second thought is it another sign that hes trying so hard to be perfect that its stultifying certainly as the potential first black president and as a contender with tender experience obama must feel under strain to be serious but he does not want the take on him to become that hes so tightly wrapped overcalculated and circumspect that he cant even allow anyone to make jokes about him i f the dominant perception of him is that you cant make jokes about him it might infect his campaign with an airless quality his humorlessness could spark humor
1087347 h ell must have turned finally into a skating rink for disadvantaged youth because i thoroughly enjoyed her column
1087348 maureen dowd has nothing to mock this is a really really serious problem i mean if obama is elected she might have to start writing about universal health insurance or alternative energy sources
1087349 she raises points about the problem that arises if people arent comfortable making fun of obama then does her best to fashion a comic leitmotif for him her suggestion obama the buzz killer there may be something to this no question obama and for that matter the entire campaign can be a little self serious at times on the other hand obama actually has a pretty good sense of humor and more importantly he can be amusingly self deprecating if this becomes the frame for him comic or otherwise he shouldnt have trouble subverting it depressingly though i expect itll be the elitist charge rather than the overly earnest charge that carries the day when comics finally get around to mocking him its probably easier to illustrate even if the examples turn out to be bogus and if nothing else its the one the gop has traditionally favored
1087350 dowd tries to make the case that obama is humorless its a short step away from that familiar elitist meta narrative in service of this point dowd warms over quotes from herself the los angeles times andy borowitz and a new york times colleague you wonder if youre reading a column or some sort of mutant clipping service before coming to this
1087351 hes already in danger of seeming too prissy about food a perception heightened when
1087352 i think we can all agree its a cheap shot to attribute the conventions green focused catering decisions to obama especially when the host committee named its greening director in august 2007 back when obama trailed clinton by double digits in national polls but dowd with an assist from the journal leaves a false impression on a matter of fact
1087353 poor maureen dowd doesnt know how to make fun of barack obama jesus stop already obamas a godsend because he lacks easy cliches so everyone has to be more creative with their humor allow us to help you the secret y ou dont need to mock the man you can mock the aura surrounding him baracks messianic tendencies have been greatly exaggerated so when the onion plus obamas strongest supporters are showing themselves to be severely humorless and thats funny the gradual shift from constant outrage over matters that probably justify outrage the mood of the bush years to this new era of outrage for the sake of outrage is a scary omen for the future of liberalism in this country and also a great punchline dont try to cleverly call him effete looking at you maureen the guy dresses nice sometimes but he doesnt actually have those effeminate signifiers that everyone seems to think other male democratic politicians possess do call him elite its funny because he represents an aspirational black middle class and so we have to put him and his wife back in their place haha no seriously its funny because making fun of harvard is funny dont make latte jokes though its not 1997 dont make fun of his funny name its painful when slate does it yes but even the reliable daily show writers fall into the trap baracknophobia is not the level of punmanship weve come to expect from you guys it is funny to call him barry though do make fun of how people are terrified of his funny name and his foreign background when faced with polls that suggest americans do truly believe that barack obama was raised by the iron sheikh and spent his school years snorting the remains of 9 11 victims all you can do is laugh and contemplate a life at sea
1087354 i go to work pay the bills and buy you a car so the least you can do is mow the lawn every week
1087355 via the great sage of journalism seth lipsky i learned a long time ago peter kann s rule concerning the first person pronoun no reporter may start a story with the word i unless hes been shot in the groin the new york times reporter campbell robertson violated the rule yesterday i was late to rent late to the show and late to the city it portrays on the other hand sitting through rent is more painful than a scrotal nick robertson is newly assigned to the baghdad bureau of the times which has its hardships but id take baghdad over rent most days of the week
1087356 vowed to stick to his plan to withdraw combat troops within 16 months of becoming president
1087357 im not sure exactly what the wording was of the joke but something was said some joke involving a rape and ape was said enough women repeated it to me at the time and the mccain campaign had a non denial denial
1087358 did you hear the one about the woman who is attacked on the street by a gorilla beaten senseless raped repeatedly and left to die
1087359 im not sure exactly what the wording was of the joke but something was said some joke involving a rape and ape was said enough women repeated it to me at the time and the mccain campaign had a non denial denial said coile now with the
1087360 i know that this kind of joking is fairly typical of frat houses and locker rooms and other all male enclaves but youd think that a professional politician would understand that its unacceptable to make these sorts of jokes in public even in 1986 that gorilla joke even if it were funny would have been out of line but mccain has always been handled with kid gloves by the press and so even when he calls his wife a cunt in front of reporters bon mots are among the comments the the boys on the straight talk express have from the voters over the years to protect him its all in good fun right but the republicans had better keep their traps shut about civility and decency from now on because their standard bearer is a disgusting pig
1087361 given his track record there seems no reason to doubt mccain made this incredibly awful joke about rape of course the likelihood of this being looked into beyond we dirty effing hippies low yes disenchanted clinton voters this is the guy you want to vote for the guy against abortion rights against non ozzie amp harriet adoptions against equal pay but totally for more of those awesome wars and really awful slanderous jokes
1087362 as many folks know because the msm wouldnt let you not know mn sen candidate al franken told some nasty disgusting and genuinely offensive jokes back in the day worst of all while brainstorming for a skit he threw out the idea of including rape im not going to defend that why would i it was wrong and he should have to repent that kind of garbage and hes taken some political hits because the republicans have gone on the attack and the media has gone along with it which is fair enough but that makes the medias complicity in john mccains hatred of women all the more galling john mccain has said even worse things than al franken has ever dreamed
1087363 hey it was a youthful indiscretion i mean mccain was only 49 years old at the time
1087364 so basically rather than put the kids to sleep mccain would let them be adopted im sorry but the year is 2008 im not going to accept john mccain saying that gays are less fit to be parents or that gay parents dont have as much to offer as straight parents and then have him say in the same breath that as a last resort gays are fit as parents either we are or were not you cant have it both ways
1087365 what mccain said and what mccain communications director jill hazelbaker described as his policy are completely different in reality my suspicion is that mccain simply doesnt know what he thinks the times brought up a topic that he doesnt frequently consider he heard the word gay and reflexively expressed his opposition im glad mccains position on july 15 is better than mccains position on july 13 but id be even happier if he could get the basics right the first time
1087366 this really comes down to the definition of what a parent is and its clear that for john mccain one can only be a parent if one is married to someone of the opposite gender so not only does this rule out gay couples but it also rules out single people whether straight or gay pretty interesting considering he didnt seem to have a problem with his ex wife raising his kids as a single parent when he decided he was to the american psychological assn research shows that children of gay or lesbian parents are just as mentally healthy as children with heterosexual parents and there may even be some positive effects also the sexual orientation of parents has no impact on that of their children whether mccain actually believes homosexuals are incapable of raising successful families or hes just pandering to the gops christian conservative base is irrelevant if this information is to be believed then the net effect of mccains position would be to deprive parent less children of the potential for adoption into a loving supportive home according to the u s department of health and human services there are about two and a half times as many children waiting to be adopted as are adopted every year as an adoptive parent himself you would think mccain would be willing to take a more humanitarian position for the sake of children who dont have parents
1087367 but the facts are a small price to pay for the sake of discriminating against gay and lesbian couples
1087368 mccain said in an interview hes against gay adoption but his campaign muddied the waters afterwards when they tried to clarify and soften his position this is just the beginning of reaction to this gay adoption story you can bet that this type of straddling the fence position by the campaign will be another talking point among social conservative leaders
1087369 its important to ponder how john mccain either doesnt believe in recording equipment or has so much faith in the people doing the recording i e the bbq stained media that he has no problem saying 100 different things to different audiences conservative groups hear i dont support the dream act and hispanic groups hear the opposite thats some straight talk
1087370 its good to be john mccain not only is he one of the very rich and famous with nine homes and counting but mccain can say anything he wants with impunity mccain knows the media will give him a free ride so he makes things up changes position and sometimes just outright lies but its okay hes john mccain but to a kid is still pretty low even for john mccain and if he didnt lie to the kid he lied to the conservative bloggers
1087371 is everybody missing this that mccain is now trying to catch up to obama on afghanistan in fact hes now adopting obamas position obama has been saying for almost a year that more troops are needed in afghanistan mccain has said that wasnt the case that iraq was the central battleground in the war on terror moreover the chairman of the joint chiefs says that we need more troops in afghanistan but we none are available unless we pull substantial numbers out of iraq which mccain is ruling out so lets all say it out loud mccain is now copying obamas position on afghanistan and with troops that he doesnt have since hes against pulling any out of iraq
1087372 riverboat john mccain is gambling that no one in the press will have the backbone to say the obvious that mccains new strategy reduce troop levels in iraq to increase them in afghanistan is borrowed from barack obama
1087373 while obama has been arguing for a year that he wants to send additional troops to afghanistan mccain has always held the opposite position opposing the deployment of more u s troops and arguing that any additional troops come from nato yesterday however mccain reversed course change his position and embraced obamas policy as his own remember the premise of john mccains presidential campaign is a his expertise on foreign policy and national security and b his consistency by any reasonable measure this had to be humiliating for mccain not only did he flip flop on his policy and not only did he borrow obamas policy as his own but he had to keep clarifying what he actually meant
1087374 mccain focuses on afghanistan hes packaging it as a surge according to eli lake im not sure how the tactics of iraq can be transferred that easily to the remote mountains of afghanistan but the new focus is good news and further narrows the gap with obama these two candidates are converging
1087375 i cant see how anyone can say that the mccain and obama positions are converging how fast we get out of iraq is a superficial issue the core issue underlying it is whether to get out of iraq mccain is fully on board with the imperialist program thats the meaning of 100 years bases oil concessions the whole nine yards obama wants us out
1087376 once in a while im reminded that obama gets it todays speech is a reassuring example obama isnt defensive and hes not relying on conservative frames to discuss national security hes taking steps and i hope he takes even more to argue that the nation has been arguing in a fundamentally flawed way
1087377 obamas speech is a refreshing change from the yee haw idiocy of the
1087378 this is a great speech the bush administration lead us down a black hole an unnecessary war waged on false intelligence and questionable motivations it was a big lie mccain backed the lie all the way and now almost cartoonishly stumps around the country to continue the lie no strategy no explanation itll be like post war korea he says where american troops patrol peacefully and free from the threat of casualty no one asks how obama delivers clear contrast with his opponent assigning responsibility for this disaster where it belongs but he also lays out a real comprehensive national security strategy i have doubts that our press is capable of communicating it in a substantive way but i suppose its important to hope
1087379 obamas big iraq speech today was good if a bit listless in delivery he was in professor mode but all in all it laid out a foreign policy liberals can believe in while not flip flopping obama offered the most complete and pragmatic descriptions of the endgame in iraq that ive seen from a politician even if some questions remain just how big will that residual force be its a clear signal to the iraqi government that it had best get its house in order judging by prime minister request for a withdrawal timetable that is a signal theyre ready to receive
1087380 if a majority of democrats disagree the war was worth fighting in the first place you can wager a mega majority of netroots denizens disagree and yet the left is silent regarding obamas belligerence towards the afghanistan theatre its positively puzzling could the explanation be that the left has suddenly developed abc wapo poll an unprecedented enthusiasm for extirpating jihadists i doubt it more likely is that the left is closing ranks around its candidate confident that he doesnt really mean his bluster
1087381 while the post editorial board is more sympathetic to the war than say the ny times it isnt exactly the wall street journal either the fact that they are starting to come down so hard on obama for this is a sign that he isnt wearing well
1087382 the washington post editorial page for several years now has been what the new republic of the early 1990s was the voice of the constructive and thoughtful center left i wish its news pages were as consistently fairminded but its still definitely left of center which is why that editorial see post below was so devastating it is just incontrovertible now that barack justanotherlyingpolitician obama was wrong dead wrong dangerously wrong pathetically wrong about the surge the man has absolutely no business being commander in chief his foreign defense policy experience is narly nil and his foreign defense policy judgment is appalling to see the post point that out is an early indicator of where public opinion is headed which bodes ill for obamas sickeningly messianic campaign
1087383 its really hard to picture the post endorsing mccain this year but obama is making their instinctive endorsement of the democrat much more difficult in the eyes of the post obama has been wrong about the biggest and most pressing foreign policy decision facing the country and continues to double down on a wrong position can they endorse a man who they have concluded is ultimately indifferent to the wars outcome
1087384 the washington post editorial board rips barack obama for what it calls the iron timetable but that doesnt quite capture the willful ignorance obama shows on iraq the post notes as did john mccain the fact that obama wrote his policy on iraq before speaking with the commanders on the ground to determine the facts and concludes that obama is ultimately indifferent to the wars outcome but thats not the real problem obama has to stick with his iraq policy not for the good of the country but because he cant afford to cut his last tie to the left
1087385 scrubbed his presidential web site over the weekend to remove criticism of the u s troop surge in iraq
1087386 the newly pragmatic barack obama the one who promises to listen to u s military commanders in iraq has townhalls
1087387 by now its been widely reported that baracks web masters were busy purging the surge or at least baracks opposition to it over the weekend does this sound familiar to anybody remember when hillary clinton accused barack of scrubbing his web site of all support for the war heres a snippet from a january 08 piece in the huffington post so first barack removed a speech opposing the war at a time 2004 when such opposition might have opened his judgment to question now hes doing the same thing when the surges success makes it clear that his much vaunted judgment in opposing it was nothing if not flawed well removing any record of a strike out is a great way to build a record of batting a thousand
1087388 not only is this a tacit admission that obama was wrong about the surge judgment not experience matters most right but this move also shows a more sinister secretive obama how long before pictures of rev jeremiah wright are photoshopped out of obamas wedding pictures
1087389 nervous people are less adventurous mccains experience makes him a safer pick hope and change are great when everything is going well but when things start to go south i think people are less willing to take risks including political ones and obama is nothing if not an unknown risky commodity but what about fdr you ask first he was much more of a known commodity and i think that after a complete collapse people are willing to roll the dice what do we have to lose they may ask but assuming there is not a complete collapse i would venture that ironically this weak economy may help not hurt mccain
1087390 saying he is sympathetic to late night comedians struggle to find jokes to make about me sen barack obama d ill today issued a list of official campaign approved barack obama jokes the jokes are as follows
1087391 life does not start and stop at your convenience you miserable piece of s t
1087392 a body blow to whats left of the john mccain campaign
1087393 the premise of john mccains campaign is that obamas timetable for withdrawal from iraq shows his naivete and threatens to squander the improvements on the ground in the country but maliki who is constantly presented as the embodiment of what we are trying to foster and build disagrees no amount of from the mccain camp will get around that fact
1087394 u s presidential candidate barack obama talks about 16 months that we think would be the right timeframe for a withdrawal with the possibility of slight changes
1087395 in a stunning diplomatic breakthrough for barack obama iraqs prime minister yesterday endorsed the democratic candidates 16 month timeline for withdrawing combat troops from iraq
1087396 the fact that iraqs prime minister has endorsed by name barack obamas plan to withdraw most u s troops from his country in 16 months is a huge huge deal most commentary has focused on the political repercussions as a gop strategist succinctly put it to marc ambinder were fucked and that certainly seems to be the case how can john mccain paint obamas plan as wildly naive or irresponsible when the iraqi government favors it too
1087397 will mccain accuse maliki of making decisions before visiting iraq and knowing the facts on the ground
1087398 ive spent a couple hours now trying to process the probable impact of prime minister al malikis explicit endorsement of barack obamas 16 month timetable for withdrawal of american troops from iraq my first instinct is always to try not to overstate the impact of momentary developments but i dont think its enough to say this is a huge development its huger than that in a stroke i think al maliki has cut mccain off at the knees in a way im not sure his campaign strategy can recover from
1087399 i would not discount the possibility that the white house will muscle maliki into a retraction of some sort but i think it will be difficult for that to seem to be anything other than what it is what he said pre waterboarding will always appear more genuine than whatever statement came later
1087400 the difference between john mccain and barack obama is that barack obama advocates an unconditional withdrawal that ignores the facts on the ground and the advice of our top military commanders john mccain believes withdrawal must be based on conditions on the ground prime minister maliki has repeatedly affirmed the same view and did so again today timing is not as important as whether we leave with victory and honor which is of no apparent concern to barack obama the fundamental truth remains that senator mccain was right about the surge and senator obama was wrong we would not be in the position to discuss a responsible withdrawal today if senator obamas views had prevailed
1087401 i think the clotted dodging the issue nature of the response communicates very clearly the box this has placed the mccain camp in scheunemann is betting on our believing that maliki himself doesnt know what he means
1087402 what would or should we do if in the post june 30th period a so called sovereign iraqi government asks us to leave even if we are unhappy about the security situation there
1087403 well if that scenario evolves than i think its obvious that we would have to leave because if it was an elected government of iraq and weve been asked to leave other places in the world if it were an extremist government then i think we would have other challenges but i dont see how we could stay when our whole emphasis and policy has been based on turning the iraqi government over to the iraqi people
1087404 the mccain campaign is going to have some trouble worming away from this 2004 council on foreign relations open lefts
1087405 game over in 2004 mccain previously stated that if the iraqi government asked us to leave then we should leave as such he now agrees with obama
1087406 this of course is ridiculous first the statement did not point to a single error in the transcript not one second maliki made three separate comments about the superiority of obamas policy were they all the result of some kind of mistranslation third if malikis comments had been misunderstood why didnt the follow up quote maliki at all and finally the clarification was humorously published by the u s militarys central command press office not the prime ministers office
1087407 its almost a convention of politics that when a politician says he was misquoted but doesnt detail the misquote or offer an alternative hes really saying he wishes he hadnt said what he did or that he needs to issue a pro forma denial to please someone the iraqi prime ministers vague denial seems to fall in that category the fact that it arrived to the american press via centcom seems to support that
1087408 followed a call to the prime ministers office from u s government officials in iraq
1087409 as the next president comes in one of the things we will uncover is just how widespread the systematic perversion of the government into an arm of the republican party is in this instance its the bushies stands by its story as well they should they had an on the record interview in which malikis remarks were not at all ambiguous and during which time he repeatedly returned to the subject of thinking that obamas proposals are the right framework within which to proceed against that theres a non denial denial in another persons name issued by centcom considering that maliki in effect lives and works inside a centcom controlled military installation thats some exceedingly weak tea he served up
1087410 lots and lots of people have noted this but it is worth emphasizing anew that iraqi prime minister nuri al maliki did not say what a lot of people gleefully report him as having said instead of agreeing with the obama plan as was initially reported maliki actually agrees with the bush administration plan one would reasonably imagine that this correction should receive more attention than the initial incorrect spiegel report putting maliki in line with obama people have all the access they need to the actual maliki translation it only remains to see whether they are good enough to report it
1087411 wow what a major mistake by the mainstream media its as if they are rooting for obama or something they mistranslated iraqi prime minister maliki on withdrawing us troops redstates
1087412 a statement from the prime ministers office makes clear that the german magazine der spiegel got it all wrong in their rapture at the thought that their golden boy had conquered sen john mccain on the one issue on which he holds a distinct advantage over sen obama national security many media outlets bloggers commentators and pundits of the left declared the remarks to be the death of the republican presidential campaign we now know that maliki did not endorse obamas withdrawal timeline the headline writer at der spiegel did what maliki did was call for u s troops to be withdrawn from iraq as early as possible thats no surprise announcement from an elected head of state with political considerations and it is certainly no surprise from maliki who has been calling for an end to the occupation almost since he was sworn in
1087413 malikis spokesman explained that the possibility of troop withdrawal was based on the continued improvement of security this is the position of the white house as set forth following a meeting last week between maliki and president bush it is also the position of john mccain obamas position to the extent he has a consistent one is different he favors withdrawal pursuant to a timetable without regard to whether security continues to improve though he might be willing to push back the exit date a bit
1087414 its good to see an iraqi government spokesman explain that prime minister malikis comments to der spiegel in which he seemed to endorse barack obamas 16 month timetable for withdrawal from iraq were misunderstood mistranslated and not conveyed accurately that is in fact the position that senator mccain whose campaign i advise has been pushing all along he has been arguing for a conditions based withdrawal as opposed to the fixed timetable demanded by obama if iraqis are ready to assume all responsibility for security by 2010 then it would be perfectly fine to withdraw most u s troops and no doubt president mccain would do so but its dangerous to commit to such a rigid timetable when its impossible to envision what the situation will look like at that time
1087415 it seems to me undeniable that iraqi prime minister nuri al maliki provided a huge boost to obama when he said u s presidential candidate barack obama is right when he talks about 16 months in recent weeks mccain has been winning the iraq issue by making obama seem like a rigid ideologue who would withdraw troops at a reckless pace regardless of the advice of commanders or facts on the ground just to satisfy the left what the maliki statement does is provide obama something he can point to coming from somebody who speaks with authority on iraq suggesting he isnt so naive by advocating a 16 month timetable
1087416 i respect pm maliki for his courage in doing a difficult and dangerous job but my chief concern when it comes to americas role in iraq and determining what that should be isnt doing what the prime minister wants my chief concern is america and doing whats in americas best interests leaving iraq quickly would be a wonderful thing but most important is leaving iraq in a way that allows us to meet our objectives first and foremost making sure that the country is secure able to defend itself and resistant to al qaedas threats or irans blandishments if we can achieve that in six months then all the better bring the troops home if it takes 24 months or even longer then it strikes me as a foolish squandering of the sacrifices our troops have already made to pull out at 16 months yes even at the behest of pm maliki
1087417 this is sort of a teapot tempest i think its easy to understand why maliki wants to be seen as pressing for the departure of u s troops now that things are going well the even more important point is that obama has been demanding a more or less immediate withdrawal from iraq since at least october 2005 if his counsel had been followed then or at any time up to the present the results would have been disastrous it is only because obamas defeatist position did not prevail and the administration instead implemented the opposite strategy as urged by john mccain that it is now reasonable to talk about withdrawing most or all troops by late 2009
1087418 i think the remarkable part of the first day of coverage wasnt the maliki muddle but the degree to which mccain successfully inserted himself into the debate and even from home kept pushing and counterpunching obama the drumbeat of his surrogates kept him in the news and the dialogue about the surges success going his foreign policy message did break through his surge worked
1087419 the media isnt attempting to bury mccain like it buried george h w bush or bob dole through bad polls theyre trying to bury him on the intangibles chief among them the energy and grassroots enthusiasm gap between the two candidates i believe this shift from hard data to intangibles is a function of the internet driven base mobilization era in which we now live the media has basically conceded that the election will be patterned after 2000 and 2004 in that it will be close in close elections polls cant tell you wholl win as reliably so the emphasis is on derivative factors like the gotv operation or crowd size or enthusiasm which will enable one candidate to outperform the polls the karl rove model which 1 the media buys into and 2 places a heavier emphasis on an energized base over tacking to the center has perversely redounded to the benefit of obama who has the energized base this year
1087420 have been concentrated in what should be his area of expertise foreign affairs
1087421 got under way before president george w bush announced in january 2007 his decision to flood iraq with tens of thousands of additional u s troops
1087422 i dont know how you respond to something that is such a false depiction of what actually happened mccain told cbs evening news adding that col sean macfarland was contacted by a major sunni sheik because of the surge we were able to go out and protect that sheik and others and it began the anbar awakening mccain said referring to the u s backed revolt of sunni sheiks against al qaida in anbar province i mean thats just a matter of history the problem with mccains statement as obamas campaign quickly noted was that the awakening got under way before president bush announced in january 2007 his decision to flood iraq with tens of thousands of additional u s troops to help combat violence
1087423 for mccain to say that the anbar awakening is the product of the surge is either a lie or professional malpractice for a presidential candidate who is staking his election on his allegedly superior iraq judgment
1087424 note to self if i ever run for president and decide to stake everything on my understanding of one thing i should familiarize myself with the basic facts about it
1087425 its simply breathtaking when it comes to his signature issue mccain is little more than a fool hes spouting obvious and demonstrable nonsense with the kind of confidence that only comes with abject stupidity
1087426 john mccain made a mistake this evening which as far as im concerned disqualifies him from being president it is so appalling and so factually wrong that im actually sitting here wondering who mccains advisers are this isnt some gaffe where he talks about the iraq pakistan border its a real misunderstanding of what has happened in iraq over the past year it is even more disturbing because according to john mccain iraq is the central front in the war on terror if we are going to have an iraq centric policy he should at least understand what he is talking about
1087427 this specific timing issue aside we can see here the larger point that mccain doesnt actually seem to know what the surge was but the surge troops were overwhelmingly sent to increase the level of manpower in baghdad i e not where the anbar awakening happened and almost certainly along with a tactical shift to more of a population protection mission deserves credit for reducing the bloodshed in baghdad by stabilizing the borders between now segregated neighborhoods im not sure i would go so far as to say that it had nothing to do what happened in anbar but it wasnt a major factor and certainly didnt make anything happen in september 2006
1087428 especially notable is that mccain himself was not always confused as to the start date of the awakening and whether or not it was caused by the surge fresh off one of his much touted trips to iraq mccain delivered remarks to the conservative american enterprise institute on january 5 2007 alongside fellow senator joe lieberman mccain specifically advocated for the newly proposed surge and cited the already in progress turning of sunni sheiks as a reason to send more troops
1087429 mccain had spent several weeks with the main theme of his campaign being quite literally to criticize barack obama for not having been physically present in iraq recently this of course got obama to go to iraq thus setting up a dilemma either obama would survey the progress in iraq and change his position thus making him a flip flopper or else he would refuse to change his position thus making him obstinate and out of touch with reality but instead of either of those things happening obama went to iraq and iraqi leaders said hed been right all along thats about as close to game set match as you get in terms of real world events influencing your political campaign whats more given the domestic situation and john mccains inability to talk about domestic issues persuasively he cant afford to play for a draw on iraq
1087430 josh marshall and i were discussing a little while ago just how complete the republican collapse on foreign policy has been in the short span of just a few weeks its remarkable and hard to think of any recent historical parallels the implications for john mccain are hard to overstate
1087431 between john mccains adoption of obamas afghanistan policy and now iraqs endorsement of obamas iraq policy theres a subtext that underpins obamas entire trip to the middle east obama was right john mccain was wrong the beauty of this message is that it reinforces one of the central themes of obamas campaign which is that judgment is more important than experience and as obamas slam dunk of a trip coincides with even more mccain stumbles umm what iraq pakistan border exactly mccain is aiding and abetting the destruction of the only thing he had left in this election
1087432 it seems to me that senator obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1087433 yep because nothing says respectful campaign like accusing your rival of hoping america loses a war in order to serve his personal ambition
1087434 mccain accuses the democratic nominee for president of wanting to lose the war not a surrogate not a 527 john mccain said that its a truly classy relentlessly positive issue focused campaign theyre running over there
1087435 john mccain basically just accused barack obama of treason had we done that to mccain just imagine the fireworks will the media report how outrageous and desperate mccain has become or will they do their usual he said she said and present mccains argument as something worthy of honest debate
1087436 whatever you do dont impugn this mans character he did something worthy 40 years ago which allows him to say any nasty thing he pleases and then lead the entire political establishment in a group whine if anyone calls him on it
1087437 does anyone still doubt mccain is any different from the current occupants of the executive branch this was inevitable when he got folks like michael goldfarb and karl rove apparatchiks running his campaign
1087438 this is the ninth presidential campaign ive covered i cant remember a more scurrilous statement by a major party candidate it smacks of desperation it renews questions about whether mccain has the right temperament for the presidency how sad
1087439 well ive finally seen everything john mccain who enjoys more media affection than any political figure in recent memory has taken to complaining that reporters are overly fond of barack obama honestly hearing the mccain campaign whine about someone getting fawning media coverage is a bit like hearing barry bonds accuse someone getting an unfair advantage by abusing steroids
1087440 is there anything more stupid or transparently cynical than john media creation mccain accusing the media of biased coverage
1087441 senator john mccain is running a pair of ads that say get this that the media is in love with barack obama
1087442 as you may know the mccain campaign has just put out a web video called obama love a mash up of clips of various tv commentators gushing over obama but lets remember weve all seen the mccain love video its called watching the last dozen years of political television indeed the political presss reckless and giddy love for mccain is so universally acknowledged that mccain himself has often joked about the press as his base so what do we have here but a candidate who cant brook the idea of not campaigning on a wave of press adulation and now hes framing his whole candidacy around a campaign of strategic whining about the claim that the political press is treating his younger opponent like hes been treated for over a decade hes got the preening and envy of a sore losing runner up for prom queen
1087443 yes obama is getting some great coverage on the trip that mccain pushed and pushed but lest we forget it was mccain who got the from aps liz sidoti and ron fournier that incident alone negates any complaining by mccain ever
1087444 i agree with the message of the videos of course and the vids are but doesnt anyone at mccain central feel the least bit silly mocking the same suck up media that mccain himself basked in so warmly until just very recently and spent his entire career wooing free piece of advice to the lovelorn maverick perhaps mccain should leave the media mockery to others who havent had their lips planted on the msms backside for decades
1087445 throughout obamas middle east and european trip the media has willingly participated in a show and orchestration of propaganda passing out staged and orchestrated images of barack obama attempting to boost his image the media has become the self appointed propaganda master for barack obamas campaign the media has become leni riefenstahl therein lies the danger by becoming obamas propaganda master the media is failing to ask the tough questions in its quest to do their candidate no harm and that is a disservice to the public of course the public already knows it and that is the achilles heel john mccain can exploit
1087446 andrea mitchell is not of course a tool for the vast right wing conspiracy that doesnt prevent her from properly pointing out that barack obamas world tour is the potemkin publicity stunt to end all potemkin publicity stunts the thing that interests me is whether at some point in time other journalists will remember what it is like to be prideful of their profession and skeptical of the latest messianic political campaign to come down the pike it is obvious that the obama campaign is manipulating the media indeed the campaign is being utterly open and notorious about doing so it will perhaps stop doing so and start treating the media and through the media the voting public with more respect and decency once the media calls the obama campaign on its shenanigans i await the moment when people join andrea mitchell in doing just that
1087447 the medias anti substance bias and what john mccain should do about it
1087448 can john mccain ever manage to compete with barack obama in a news media culture which is driven by the standards of commercial entertainment not the gravitas that at important moments such as a presidential race should be the tone
1087449 this is pretty extraordinary a candidate for the american presidency is using flyers printed in german to turn people out for his campaign rally in berlin on thursday this isnt just some sober high minded foreign policy speech part of a foreign trip occurring under the auspices of his official senate office it is a campaign rally occuring on foreign soil they are using the same tactics to turn out germans to an event as they would to any rally right here in america the sea of germans drummed up by the obama campaign will be used as props to tell us americans how to vote and the campaign isnt trying to pretend otherwise thats breathtakingly arrogant and par for the course for barack obama
1087450 team obama insists the berlin speech is not a campaign rally yesterday they had advisers giving background briefings insisting its not going to be a political speech makes one wonder why obama for america is nros
1087451 is obama running for president of the united states or the world
1087452 hes not running for president of the united states hes running for president of earth
1087453 obama requires attendees of all rallies in the us to get tickets and there have obviously been suggestions that that means that people who are not fervent obama supporters are excluded but hes ok with letting anyone literally any random dude off the street into his rally in germany does that suggest hes more concerned with openness and transparency with germans than he is americans
1087454 the obama campaign wants to hold a political rally in berlin apparently to impress upon american voters how popular obama is among europeans their political ear is amazingly tone deaf if they think a massive campaign rally in berlin will convince anyone but the most ardent leftists in america to vote for obama they really need a shake up in their campaign staff
1087455 in truth and while there are other dynamics going on the central issue is just sheer volume theres vastly more public interest in and coverage of obama his rise is a better newer story that means that mccains message has been muted but his missteps are too hes been able in particular to make it this far with a domestic policy agenda whose sheer vagueness wouldnt have made it through the democratic primary the same dynamic holds for obama the interest in him has allowed him to turn this week for instance into an extended television show about his travels but his errors are also magnified and so the stakes were far higher for todays press conference which he aced than for any event of mccains it isnt clear to me that this is a dynamic that entirely favors obama though it is one he has learned to work on one hand these are situations he largely controls and on his turf on the other theres a risk of the election becoming a referendum on the challenger rather than the extremely unpopular incumbent party
1087456 this was supposed to be done hours ago what is taking so long
1087457 i was too busy working on my resume so i can get a better job
1087458 now all but forced to concede to obamas stand on the timing of withdrawal
1087459 al dabbagh said the government did not endorse a fixed date but hoped american combat units could be out of iraq sometime in 2010 that timeframe falls within the 16 month withdrawal plan proposed by obama who arrived in iraq earlier in the day as part of a congressional fact finding team
1087460 so obama and al maliki are indeed on the same page
1087461 if mccain loses the foreign policy debate which is becoming increasingly likely hell have an insurmountable problem on his hands
1087462 theres nowhere left for mccain to go here either he endorses a timetable for withdrawal which he has consistently said would be a disaster and cedes his only big issue to obama and more importantly concedes that obamas judgment is sound or he deliberately ignores the concerted expressed wishes of the iraqi government in order to prolong an unpopular war
1087463 mccain implicitly concedes that he was wrong on getting into the war itself concedes in as much as public opinion is firmly on the side of his being wrong and he realizes that hes also now all but forced to concede to obamas stand on the timing of withdrawal in as much as the iraqis are now being clear that they want us troops out in roughly the same period of time so he goes to the public with obama being right and him wrong on starting the war in the first place and with the timing and approach to getting out but along the way he was right about the surge so he should be president i find mccains claim to being right about the surge dubious but arguable but even if you concede that it leaves mccain talking about the past and conceding the real issue that is before the public
1087464 senator obamas timetable of removing u s troops from iraq within that 16 month period seemed to be getting a thumbs up by the iraqi prime minister if the iraqi government were to say if you were president we want a timetable for troops being removed would you agree with that
1087465 so basically the new mccain position on withdrawal seems to be we shouldnt listen to what the iraqi government says it wants we should listen to what mccain says it wants and oh yeah we should listen to gen david petraeus too i think thats going to be a tough position for mccain to sustain for the next three months
1087466 by simply asserting that he knows what the iraqi government wants better than they do and that we should trust his take on what they think over theirs mccain can avoid the need to respond at all its a pity that this strategy requires that he look like a complete idiot and adopt an insulting attitude towards the iraqi government and its people that would surely not serve him well were he elected president but thems the breaks
1087467 mccain is picking up a tactic from president george w bush claiming that he can now speak for iraqis and know whats best for them
1087468 its the height of arrogance mccain doesnt need the opinions of the iraqi prime minister because hes john mccain
1087469 we can full expect obama and his supporters to argue that malikis words despite the clarification are a vindication of obamas position any such effort would be ludicrous obama was a relentless critic of the surge even after it was clear the surge was not only working but working beyond the expectations of even those who championed it we are now seeing the good fruits of the gen david petraeus led effort and if things continue on their present course we may be able to accelerate the drawdown of troops for obama and his campaign however to believe that malikis words are a vindication of his judgment to lead is misguided obama was wrong consistently and spectacularly wrong on the most important national security decision since the iraq war began what maliki said doesnt change that fact and in some ways it underscores it obamas record on iraq and the surge is intellectually dishonest and reckless we can only be glad that his plan which would have removed all combat troops from iraq in march 2008 was never put in place and the defeat he would have authored has not come to pass
1087470 sure mccain can still argue that obamas judgment particularly on the surge has been wrong but obama will also still be able to argue that mccain was wrong to support the invasion of iraq in the first place and on the forward looking question mccains charge that obamas course would be reckless is looking a lot weaker today i dont see any way to deny that this development helps obama
1087471 obama will likely profit from the fact that iraqs leaders have made certain statements that obama can claim albeit somewhat misleadingly reflect his basic position as a result obama does not come off looking reckless or outside the present mainstream obama also profits from the fact that so much of the discussion is about what iraqs leaders say for one thing it shifts the focus away from obamas own incoherence and inconsistency and onto that of iraqi politicians for another john mccain would almost certainly prefer that the focus be on what our generals are telling obama however the generals feel an obligation not to become involved in american presidential politics iraqs leaders are under any such constraint and the story so far is all about their various rather ambiguous remarks
1087472 now that our american blood and money has seen off most of the enemies of maliki and his iranian pals it is perfectly natural for them to believe they can finish the job themselves without further assistance from us maliki can now afford to start putting distance between himself and the u s a essential for political viability in a region where the u s a is pretty generally hated we should tell maliki loudly and in public that he owes his job to us and that further prosecution of our military operations in his country will be conducted with regard only to u s interests as determined in consensus by our established domestic political processes and if he doesnt like that he can go to hell
1087473 i realize that lots of people particularly those skeptical of the prospects for stable iraqi democracy are worried that maliki is too close to iran but theres a case to be made that an honorable withdrawal frees our hand with iran at least in some ways fewer troops in iraq mean fewer convenient american targets to retaliate against after a bombing run after all
1087474 the candidate with all the reputed serious credentials in national security doesnt know his geography well enough to distinguish between iraq and afghanistan
1087475 these increasingly frequent international senior moments makes one nostalgic for those aw shucks iran and iraq how does he expect people to buy his line that silentpatriot
1087476 even we partisans can get a little tired of pointing out john mccains constant verbal flubs and um moments of confusion but jesus the question was about afghanistan in the first place which was an obvious invitation to talk about its ongoing border problems with the tribal areas of pakistan so what does mccain do he deliberately pivots away to mention the nonexistent iraq pakistan border does he even know what a map of central asia looks like isnt this supposed to be his strong suit
1087477 john mccain has often said that he would run a respectful campaign but he never said anything about running an honest one did he forget that his own campaign said
1087478 is the mccain campaign losing it in an ad today about spiraling gasoline prices the narrator asks portentously who can you thank for rising prices at the pump this is accompanied by obamas picture and background noise of a crowd chanting obama obama are they serious theyre going to try to convince the american public that barack obama is responsible for 4 gasoline or is this one of those pseudo ads that never really gets aired anywhere and is released just to see if it can get some press attention from suckers like me regardless this is really lame
1087479 for mccain it appears the equation is simple if abandoning honor and honesty will give him the presidency then so be it the truth mccain has concluded is for losers to anyone who cares about reality the ad doesnt make a lick of sense mccain has to hope desperately that were all idiots for example the ad says gas prices are high because some in washington are still saying no to drilling in america hows that exactly no one is saying no to drilling in america theres all kinds of drilling in america theres drilling in u s waters and on u s land i dont know of a single u s policy maker who wants drilling in america to stop worse the ad wants americans to believe that prices would be lower if there was more drilling in america mccain knows thats not true but hopes to fool just enough people playing them for suckers its shameful
1087480 john mccains new ad says that barack obamas refusal to open americas coastline to drilling is to blame for high gas prices they say nobody ever went wrong underestimating the intelligence of the voting public but it is staggering that you cant find any credible people anywhere prepared to argue that mccains drilling schemes will bring any short term relief from high gas prices or that the long run price reductions would be anything other than tiny meanwhile its mccain who has no plan to help bolster alternative fuels and no plan to bolster alternatives to driving
1087481 the republicans seem to have settled on the message that the real problem with the concept of dependence on foreign oil is the foreign part not the oil part so the only way to solve the crisis is to drill our way out of it here at home
1087482 i dont think mccains attack will work on obama since it is saying something that americans fundamentally dont believe the ad suggests that prices are rising because of insufficient drilling and that more drilling will lower prices that isnt true and polling suggests people know it isnt true an ad that says something along the lines of this isnt a total solution but its a start would be much more credible as an attack on obama if you drilled everything there is in the us tomorrow and oil started coming out of the ground tomorrow gas prices would drop by about three cents
1087483 the netroots are genuinely frightened about the success of conservative messaging on energy matt stoller is reduced to just making stuff up according to the energy information administration if the bans on energy development were lifted for the ocs and anwr americas current oil reserves would more than double considering that the u s currently produces only 34 of its oil needs doubling that capacity would have to bring down prices by way more than three cents
1087484 mccains latest ad on domestic oil drilling is a very good and effective one i think
1087485 the mccain campaign came out with this terrific ad today blasting obama for his adamant opposition to developing our domestic petroleum resources the ad is running on broadcast tv in eleven swing states and on cable nationwide they cant run it often enough as far as im concerned
1087486 if you had to do it over again knowing what you know now would you support the surge
1087487 well these kind of hypotheticals are very difficult hindsight is 20 20 i think what im absolutely convinced of is that at that time we had to change the political debate because the view of the bush administration at that time was one that i just disagreed with and continue to disagree with which is to look narrowly at iraq and not focus on the broader issues
1087488 so basically even though the surge has been a tremendous success that has actually made withdrawing troops under stable conditions a much better possibility he still wouldnt have supported it because he had a political disagreement with bush obama would rather see failure in iraq than take off his ideological blinders
1087489 obama told abc news that knowing what we know now that the surge in iraq has been a success that it has drastically reduced violence and given iraq a shot at a bright future he would still oppose it this was i think a moment of candor to explain his seemingly shocking response obama immediately referred to political considerations opposing the bush administrations policy on iraq even if that opposition turned out to be wrong was a necessary ingredient in obamas securing the democratic presidential nomination that being the case how can obama a purely political animal regret a decision that advanced his own career
1087490 that obama opposed the surge is bad enough but that opposition was not itself irresponsible or unforgiveable it was understandable if in retrospect quite wrong to believe that iraq caught in an apparent death spiral in the latter half of 2006 was unsalvageable critics of the surge argued that we were sending american troops to die in a lost cause it turned out that iraq was redeemable and that the presidents strategy brilliantly executed by general petraeus and the american military worked faster and better than anyone thought possible to say that he would oppose a military plan that one day may well rank as among the best in our history is stunning whatever would motivate obama to say what he did political cowardice willful denial astonishing blindness to the facts or the mindset of an ideologue it ought to cause americans to rethink in the most fundamental way whether obama is responsible enough to be president
1087491 this of course opens the door for many follow up questions that will no doubt plague obama for days to come already columnists and pundits are weighing in washington post s dan balz said obamas opposition to the troop surge that has helped quell violence and u s casualties and that mccain vociferously supported leaves plenty of room for further questions about his judgment at that moment obama will hold a press conference to explain his statement today will the press let him off the hook again
1087492 a better answer would have been no because iraqi security isnt worth any more american lives
1087493 the developments over the last few days with al maliki suggest that republicans are at some point soon going to have to begin incorporating withdrawal into their lexicon
1087494 hiawatha ia after a failed attempt to surprise his family with a chili dinner friday frank hayden 38 was given 16 points for trying by his wife laura thereby increasing his running total of trying points to 643 457 i told him you have to brown the meat before you put the sauce in or else it doesnt cook right mrs hayden said at least he put in the effort the failed sauce follows a lifetime of attempts that have earned hayden points for trying including failing to climb a rope in fifth grade gym class screwing up a tryout to play guitar for an area band botching his attempt to fix the radio of his 1994 saab 900 incorrectly ordering a meal in spanish and his eldest daughter carmen hayden is currently trying to save up the 750 000 trying points needed to get a beanbag chair
1087495 a counter insurgency strategy made up of a number of components
1087496 theres a difference between verbal flubs which every candidate makes plenty of and gaffes that reveal some kind of serious misunderstanding of the world when john mccain refers to czechoslovakia for example thats just a verbal flub when he tries to convince us that the surge was responsible for the sunni awakening thats a serious gaffe somebody who really understands the past few years of history in iraq just wouldnt make a mistake like that
1087497 to say as mccain does that the awakening followed the surge is to rewrite history and this is the real point it has consequences believing that the surge engendered the awakening is to subscribe to a self deception whereby iraqis have no agency no self interest all they are is impressed by superior force and that in turn implies that the key to success is to provide that awful demonstration effect
1087498 as a matter of history mccain is wrong worse hes wrong in a way that suggests a confused understanding of the relationship between the anbar awakening and the surge the two at best reinforced each other but there is no sense in which the surge was causal for the sunni rebellion against al qaeda mccain who is running a campaign based off his superior understanding of iraqs internal dynamics which supposedly gives him a superior sense of the appropriate strategy has convinced himself otherwise thats a huge deal
1087499 either mccain is lying about the anbar timeline or hes simply confused about what happened and when either way this has to be problematic for a candidate who is running on the sole platform of being better equipped to handle the war
1087500 no sorry its a testament to how the corporate media as david broder already admitted think they already know john mccain they even bring him his favorite donuts so theres nothing mccain can do that will cause the media to criticize him ever when a man keeps getting confused in his area of expertise over and over again and hes rarely made such mistakes before its time to start asking some questions about just whats going on if anything john mccain making repeated misstatements in his area of expertise should raise even more red flags rather than allay fears mccain shouldnt be making these kind of mistakes on this subject matter and he didnt used to so why is he now hes run for president before been under pressure before but hes never routinely confused his facts before so why now thats a story even if you know his favorite donuts
1087501 democrats can debate whether the awakening would have survived without the surge but that is nothing more than a transparent effort to minimize the role of our commanders and our troops in defeating the enemy because to credit them would be to disparage the judgment of barack obama and praise the leadership of john mccain
1087502 got that if you think 2006 came before 2007 youre somehow showing disrespect for the troops
1087503 how fucking insulting to our troops that getting history straight about how and why theyre fighting can undercut their efforts as if theyre infantile hot house flowers that wilt in the bright light of fact ugh
1087504 portraying questions about that statement as a criticism of mccain and the troops is nearly as contemptible as mccains recent claims that obama would rather lose a war than lose a campaign the debate the question is was john mccain unaware that the anbar awakening began in 2006 did he forget or was he lying for political gain
1087505 to be as clear as possible there were american soldiers serving in iraq for years long before the surge began to observe that something or other say the anbar awakening couldnt possibly have happened because of the surge because it happened before the surge is by no means an effort to deny american troops credit for their work the very colonel now general sean macfarland whose work mccain was citing as evidence of the success of the surge really did do good work as did the men under his command its just that their work didnt have anything to do with the surge which is what barack obama was saying and its what john mccain was ignorantly denying now the irony here is that the origins of this whole farce is mccains efforts to hog credit himself for the adoption of improved counterinsurgency tactics he knows how to win wars remember and the evidence for that is supposed to be his embrace of the surge but he cant even get basic facts straight
1087506 mccain began his answer with his definition of surge and then shared his own experience while visiting iraq
1087507 so if i understand this the surge is part of a counterinsurgency strategy this strategy has a number of components since the surge is part of the counterinsurgency strategy youd think it might be one of these components but no while the additional troops were a mere part of the strategy the surge is the counterinsurgency strategy in its entirety this counterinsurgency strategy which we all know of now as the surge obviously did not begin when the additional troops arrived it had been going on for months before president bush announced it
1087508 a surge is really a counterinsurgency that argument isnt going to fly the word surge has always been used to as shorthand referring to president bushs decision to deploy about 30 000 additional u s troops to iraq in early 2007 the first of which did not arrive in iraq until later in the spring by ignoring the fact that a number of important variables combined to help improve the security situation in iraq in 2007 sunni awakening sadrs decision to stand down his militia the movement of sunni and shia in baghdad into defensible enclaves the mccain campaign is ignoring important facts and distorting the historical record
1087509 the main problems here would be that nobody uses surge that way indeed john mccain has a long history of using the term surge the same way as everyone else and also that the short form of counterinsurgency the abbreviation mad military uses is coin but of course maybe mccain will say that he has a private language in which surge means counterin surg ency and its therefore wrong to bother him about this in which case i suppose its hard for anyone to ever prove that hes wrong but on the other hand if thats what he means then its hard to make sense of the claim that mccain was right about the surge whereas obama was wrong since if the surge is just a generic term for the use of counterinsurgency tactics the i dont think mccain and obama ever really disagreed
1087510 maybe mccain is arguing that we can use the surge label on any aspect of the war we want the surge it can be whatever you want it to be
1087511 responding to an israeli reporters question wednesday on his commitment to protect the jewish state barack obama pointed to a bill we passed in the u s senate banking committee that tightens sanctions and authorizes divestment from iran my committee he called it except that he isnt a member of the committee on banking housing and urban affairs an obama spokesman tells cnn it was his bill not his committee referring to the iran sanctions enabling act that the illinois senator sponsored and introduced in may 2007 the measure was then referred to the banking committee and passed a vote of 19 2 on july 17
1087512 if committed by a republican this would be a gaffe of historic proportions even a senator as inattentive to his duties as obama certainly knows what committees he serves on for him to fabricate the claim out of whole cloth that the senate banking committee is his committee strikes me as another sign of obamas megalomania that plus more evidence that he is totally at sea without a teleprompter
1087513 barack obama has proved himself an extraordinarily cynical politician he doesnt believe in much but he certainly believes in his own power to make voters believe whatever he says even when what he says today contradicts what he said yesterday and even when it constitutes a bald fiction such as his claim that the senate banking committee is his committee some day it may begin to dawn on attentive observers that obama represents a type that flourishes on many college campuses the technical term that applies to obama is b s artist
1087514 once again obama wants to claim credit for efforts on which he served no role either that or obama is such a dilettante that he has no idea on which committees he actually belongs it could even be both neither gives any confidence that obama has any grasp at all of his own job let alone the one for which hes campaigning maybe he needed a lot more than three years to get acclimated to national politics
1087515 this guy is going to be harder than bill clinton to keep up with the next whopper whips along before you have time to wrap your brain around the last one
1087516 id really like to know which genius on the obama campaign thought it would be a good idea to have their candidate conduct a major campaign rally in europe with three months to go till the election and their candidate despite an incredibly favorable climate and a fumbling opponent still clinging to a 2 4 point lead in the polls
1087517 how will obamas courtship of germany play in peoria is it redolent of
1087518 there is always the danger that some voters will be turned off by the love fest with european throngs bragging about international popularity didnt get john kerry very far john mccain is obviously trying to play off this with his domestic berlin radio blitz i find it hard to figure out which voters are going to be moved by a massive show of affection by germans for obama voters who think hes not one of us are going to be irked and the folks who are genuinely concerned about foreign policy smarts and credentials arent necessarily going to be wowed by a mass rally
1087519 nothing says character reference like a teeming crowd of thousands of adoring germans chanting your name
1087520 at a location hitler himself set up for aesthetic purposes
1087521 barack obama is set to speak at the victory column in berlin originally the column was in a different location but hitler moved it in 1939 to its present location he too wanted a beautiful stage and backdrop in berlin ill refrain from pointing out the irony here but okay i cant help myself barack obama is using propaganda filmed in germany made possible by the nazis relocating the freaking statute to woo americans to vote for him hes going to have freaking film crews there and the media to make sure the full emotional impact reaches back to the united states and why do this in germany and not the middle east because those rednecks in pennsylvania and michigan will not be so tipped off to see a mass of white folks applauding obama as they would a mass of arabs and the rednecks wont be able to tell the germans from americans so win win for obama but again i find it both ironic and amusing that barack obama is going to germany and is using germans in berlin at a location hitler himself set up for aesthetic purposes in order to woo american voters the man has no shame hell say anything and do anything to get himself elected
1087522 60 of registered voters believe its a good idea for the us to set such a timetable for withdrawal from iraq while 30 say its a bad idea
1087523 barack obama has won the argument on iraq the latest nbc wsj poll released tonight shows that 60 of the voters think a timetable is a good idea and 30 think its a bad idea arguments about the success of the surge are irrelevant
1087524 republicans have slacked on their war on evil messaging it now looks like the american and iraqi people agree on a withdrawal strategy and the democratic nominee is ready to lead it
1087525 as many of us predicted as soon as the public understood that the iraqis wanted us to set a timeline to leave they were supportive of the obama position the public has always supported leaving when things were bad and also when they seemed ok support for staying goes up when things are bad but are promised to be better in the near future say in 6 months that has always been the appeal of the but now that the iraqi government has made their views clear the way is cleared for a majority here to also favor a timeline as obama has proposed checkmate indeed
1087526 i continue to be amazed at how many people seem to believe that barack obama is crushing john mccain kevin drum writes mccain is pretty obviously doomed this year howard fineman you cant make up how bad things are going for mccain pollster coms polling average now i agree that obama has a better chance than mccain to increase his standing but the fact is that chris orr that so far the medias one sided attention to and scrutiny of obama has helped mccain more than its hurt him of course its entirely possible that obamas foreign trip will make his lead spike if it doesnt though i expect the conventional wisdom about obamas lead to change quickly and quite possibly for panic to set in
1087527 robert novak respected conservative journalist commentator and grim spectre of soulless walking death ran over a guy in his black corvette this morning hilariously a got the story by walking by novak hit the guy and then continued merrily speeding along until a bicyclist stopped him and said you hit someone novak allegedly threw his head back and cackled for a moment before shooting him there are no details about the pedestrians condition if recent history is any indication judy miller will get jail time for this
1087528 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
1087529 obamas entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him the
1087530 for hours the press and the gop have been in a frenzy about obamas arrogance because he tried to say something humble about why he was greeted by hundreds of thousands of people when he gave a speech
1087531 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
1087532 any man who believes he is the moment that the world is waiting for and views himself as the symbol of the possibility and best traditions of america is an individual of staggering arrogance that is doubly so when like obama you have achieved nothing so far in your life in terms of scholarship or literature legislation acts of valor self sacrifice or anything else that qualifies you to view yourself in quasi messianic terms
1087533 exult make a joyful noise dance in the streets with garlands of the finest flowers sing glorious hymns of praise to the firmament above behold the son of man comes riding upon a golden ass the weight of his glory is a heavy burden indeed but he will bear it yes for you and for me
1087534 like dr frankenstein the mainstream media is getting nervous about the monster they have created they tingled they gaped they pumped they spun they tore down his primary opponent and they debased themselves by leaving their objectivity home and muting their demands for decent access to the candidate and reasonable disclosure of information so if the creature is now out of control and the subject of ridicule and even mocking then they might examine the coverage they have afforded him these many months once can hardly blame the great one for believing his press clippings
1087535 looks like the media is catching on to obamas arrogance complex no
1087536 his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him the
1087537 what obama said and what the staffer and congressman confirm is that in obamas view the world has selected obama as a repository for its hope and dreams im not sure how this shows less ego than the unsupported straw man argument but there it is anyway being surrounded by adoring sycophants for months on end has apparently warped obamas perspective the candidate obviously believes everyone is as wrapped up in barack obama as he is
1087538 one could dispute obama s theory but its not a particularly remarkable thing to say you have a candidate who was greeted enthusiastically in europe saying that the enthusiasm was about something larger than him about the united states and about the values barack obama and millions of other americans cherish and hope will once again govern the country but dana millbank wanted to write an article about how barack obama has long been his partys presumptive nominee now hes becoming its presumptuous nominee and now for hours the press and the gop have been in a frenzy about obamas arrogance because he tried to say something humble about why he was greeting by hundreds of thousands of people when he gave a speech
1087539 msnbc just informed me that the highly misleading clipped quote might feed the idea that obama is presumptuous despite being you know a highly misleading clipped quote craig crawford even if its not true please kill me
1087540 i personally would want to see our tragic history or the tragic elements of our history acknowledged obama said
1087541 our tragic history a tragic history in my estimation would be one that still exists now as it did then someone anyone tell me would you consider the steps made to remedy those situations of our tragic past an acknowledgment of them that has been done through deeds civil war constitutional amendments laws set asides preferences enforcement cultural change etc yet here again these are deemed insufficient instead reparations and deeds are mentioned in the same breath by a supposedly post racial candidate for president of the united states and what that simply means is another in a long line of redistributionist schemes based in historical wrongs and the premise theyve not been addressed this has got to stop
1087542 obamas understanding of american history his need to deplore trumps any instinct to elevate and celebrate every time frames the choice between mccain and obama a mccain presidency would be grounded on the firm conviction of american greatness and exceptionalism as well as the uniqueness of the american mission in the world obamas would be built on the mature understanding of americas many past sins its enormous greed and grasping its unfair use of vast quantities of resources and its need to respect world opinion and world institutions even when those opinions and institutions are at cross purposes with american national interests
1087543 it may not be november yet but our boy barry isnt wasting any time acting as if here were already our next president and hes out there doing the lords work of healing america after all as a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions it makes perfect sense for obamident barry to start off with to any and all that may have ever suffered at the hands of our sad and tragic past transgressions as a nation
1087544 i am as decidedly unthrilled as i am unfortunately totally unsurprised that the obama campaign is even considering putting a roughly in line with those of george w bush on the ticket
1087545 kaines social views and his stance on iraq are pretty problematic
1087546 kaine would be a piss poor choice to be barack obamas running mate
1087547 kaine is a very bad choice for vp hes done nothing as governor except turn a functional state government into a partisan cesspool of giveaways to the rich and anger everyone in the process and on national positions the only thing he brings to the table is that he can play the joe lieberman as vp role again and sequels usually suck especially if the original was bad
1087548 choosing kaine would signal that obama has no intention to govern as a progressive as such it would be difficult to muster up enthusiasm to work for the ticket by contrast obama sebelius would be fine and obama chris dodd would be exciting if these are the final three choices and i think there are good indications that they are the final three choices i really hope that obama doesnt go with kaine
1087549 signal that obama has no intention to govern as a progressive
1087550 this seems to me to be reading way too much into the vp selection ronald reagan s selection of george h w bush much more presaged bush becoming a conservative than reagan becoming a moderate the best guide to how obama intends to govern isnt who he picks as vp its the stuff hes said about how he intends to govern and what he hopes to accomplish thatd put him to the left of the bill clinton al gore era of the democratic party but to the right of the open left vision of where the party ought to be and thatll still be the case no matter who obama picks
1087551 matthew yglesias thinks were overreaching by imputing intentions to obama based on his vp pick i dont think thats true for three reasons one obama has consistently said hes picking a vp candidate based on how that candidate will help him govern two we have no reason to trust that what obama says in this campaign is what he intends to do as president the fisa example shows that obama thinks nothing of breaking promises to liberals three even if he follows through on the promises he hasnt broken i dont see how his overall policy platform is substantially to the left of the clinton gore administration as a brief but significant example in place of clinton gores peace dividend or a cut in military spending obama has promised to grow the size of the military
1087552 mccains campaign just seems to be off the rails and unable to decide what mccains stance is on various topics for example mccain and mccains spokesman cant agree on whether or not increasing the payroll tax cap should be on the table in terms of changing social security its a point mccain has gone back and forth on many many times over the course of the campaign maybe with the olympics coming up and the expected attendant lull in campaign coverage team mccain can slow down and huddle for a couple of weeks in arizona to just go down the checklist and figure out where they stand on these issues hold some conference calls something
1087553 john mccain has repeatedly attacked obama over taxes and said that he will not raise taxes under any circumstances except to fix social security apparently thats what he said on abcs this week now hes saying he wont raise taxes its hard to keep up
1087554 this is just getting embarrassing is mccain running for president of the united states or is he trying out for a part in some high concept wacky political comedy he needs to make up his mind
1087555 i guess he ultimately decided he could do more good from the ap than inside the campaign
1087556 turns out ron fournier now heading the washington bureau of the ap right into ruin had free dunkin donuts for mccain anyway which i assume would have been part of his job description fournier is clearly a s
1087557 just read fourniers stuff like hes in a senior advisory role to the mccain campaign then it will makes sense
1087558 fournier would fit right in with the rove proteges at the mccain campaign
1087559 it comes as no surprise that the aps coverage of obama has been full of slanted pontificating as fournier pushes not just straight reporting but comments and analysis so much of it amazingly unfair and non analytical about obama
1087560 that fournier would consider a role with the mccain campaign is not especially surprising his political leanings have been increasingly apparent of late but fournier is the dc bureau chief of the associated press hes chiefly responsible for directing the aps coverage of the presidential campaign and yet fourniers objectivity is hardly above reproach he considered an offer to work for one of the two candidates did it not occur to the associated press that this might raise questions about the objectivity of the wire services coverage
1087561 the point is none of this should have mattered having political beliefs or sympathies shouldnt affect the way a journalist does their job and this article wouldnt even have been written if the ap didnt have reporters writing stuff like this some might see this as just another example of why objectivity in journalism is a myth but for some reason thats an argument i find a great deal more compelling with a network or a newspaper theres something disconcerting about bias in wire services since many papers may rely on them entirely for their national affairs or international coverage theres also something bizarre about fourniers brand of accountability journalism which aims to be opinionated but essentially relies on the credibility of the aps past non opinionated work for any sense of authority the reputation of wire reporters as straight shooters in other words the appeal of ap reporters giving their opinions is premised on the myth that wire reporters cant possibly have strong ideological opinions

1087563 we need to recognize that mccain has now abandoned virtually everything hes been campaigning on for the last year
1087564 he and maverick are almost mirror images on iraq now mccain thinks troop levels should depend on conditions but concedes that 16 months is a pretty good timetable whereas obama thinks 16 months is a pretty good timetable but concedes that er troop levels should depend on conditions
1087565 so why do you think maliki said that 16 months is basically a pretty good timetable
1087566 he said its a pretty good timetable based on conditions on the ground i think its a pretty good timetable as we should or horizons for withdrawal but they have to be based on conditions on the ground
1087567 youre probably thinking after all mccain has done to castigate obama for pushing a timetable he couldnt possibly have gone on cnn and supported a timetable himself but yes
1087568 1 maliki likes obamas timeline 2 mccain likes malikis timeline 3 mccain thinks obamas timeline will cause the destruction of america as we know it
1087569 there has been a lot of attention paid to john mccains apparent flip flop yesterday on timetables for withdrawal from iraq and given his on barack obamas call for a 16 month timetable or if you prefer horizon mccains words were rather stunning
1087570 over the span of a few weeks sen mccain has gone from predicting a decades long presence of american troops in iraq and attacking any discussion of timetables for withdrawal to endorsing malikis push for a 16 month timetable and tying himself in knots trying to explain why what malikis endorsing is any different from obamas when confronted with malikis own words saying that he supports what obama supports mccain now falls back on that last redoubt of philanderers asking the american people who you gonna believe me or your lyin eyes for all the seismic shifts that have taken place over the last two weeks we need to recognize that mccain has now abandoned virtually everything hes been campaigning on for the last year theres really no more eloquent confirmation of that reality than the fact that mccain now appears determined to base his campaign on charges that obama is unpatriotic and despises american soldiers
1087571 remember the first two weeks of july when the big story of the presidential campaign was that barack obama moved or was about to move towards john mccains position on iraq policy the story was a fantasy based on literally nothing but it dominated the political discourse for weeks and the irony is the entire story was backwards obama didnt move towards mccain mccain has moved towards obama
1087572 let me make sure i understand the reason to vote for mccain is because he has more foreign policy know how than obama right i mean hes admitted that he doesnt know anything about the economy so foreign affairs is obviously where hes making his case and on the key foreign policy issue of the day hes just changed to supporting obamas plan therefore admitting its better so what exactly is the case for voting for mccain seriously not snarkily what is the case
1087573 obamas overseas trip changed mccains position on iraq thus entirely demolishing the move to the center or flip flop meme on obama now obama looks like a leader and mccain is a pandering flip flopping follower with and mccain flip flops add ing up this overseas trip really is checkmate for obama his trip will have a similar impact on the campaign as the swift boat attacks four years ago this trip has removed the central pillar of mccains argument to be president
1087574 anything is a good timetable that is dictated by conditions on the ground
1087575 i didnt use the word timetable that i did if i did
1087576 oh well look anything is a good timetable that is dictated by conditions on the ground anything is good
1087577 wow one day after mccain said he thought sixteen months was a pretty good timetable for withdrawing from iraq mccain claimed he never said the word timetable seriously mccain said to stephanopoulos i didnt use the word timetable one day later is he for real
1087578 once again john mccain has an unfortunate run in with a straightforward effort to quote his words and protests to george stephanoupolous i didnt use the word
1087579 the mccain campaign has this brutal new against barack obama making the blatantly false charge that he doesnt care about the troops unless there are cameras around as we reported yesterday the pentagon told obama that the issue here was not that he couldnt bring cameras but that he only had campaign staff with him and not senate staffers and since the pentagon didnt tell him this until he had already embarked on his trip it was too late for him to do anything
1087580 mccain knows that obama visited wounded troops while he was in iraq he knows that obama has visited them at walter reed he knows that the obama cancelled the trip honoring pentagon regulations to avoid making a visit that might seem political saying that the last thing that i want to do is have injured soldiers and the staff at these wonderful institutions having to sort through whether this is political or not or getting caught in the crossfire of the campaigns yet knowing all this and despite in april that mccain intentionally did not campaign on military property because of the same pentagon rules that obama cited mccain chose to put those people in the political crossfire and released a blatantly dishonest ad because mccain is willing to do or say anything to win
1087581 really this says it all new mccain ad bashes obama for not visiting troops using footage of obama visiting troops what a pathetic campaign
1087582 its nothing short of breathtaking to watch a once honorable man want the presidency so desperately hes willing to flush his credibility and reputation down the toilet john mccains new tv ad marks a turning point not only in this presidential campaign but as a measurement of mccains increasingly absent character
1087583 mccain really wants to win the election and hes willing to adopt pretty much any policy position and launch pretty much any dishonest attack on his opponent that he thinks will help him get there if that means totally fictitious ads about obama refusing to meet with soldiers then fine
1087584 mccain has often talked about his commitment to running a campaign based on issues yet now he is seizing on a meaningless non event exploiting american troops by casting them as victims in this petty squabble and impugning an opponent who just addressed soldiers international leaders and foreign citizens to outline a new course for america in the world obamas trip clearly made obama look big it took mccains reaction to make mccain look so small
1087585 ive never been a big john mccain fan even in the 2001 2004 era when he was flirting with the left and opposing the most neanderthal elements in his own party i didnt really warm to him to me he mostly seemed like a standard issue conservative who had discovered a good schtick during the 2000 campaign and was milking it for all it was worth pandering to a press and pundit corps that he had learned routinely goes gaga over politicians who supposedly reject the shibboleths of both parties and simply speak their mind but now im watching him in 2008 his desperation for the presidency driving him to conduct a campaign thats carefully but relentlessly testing ever more contemptible depths of squalor in its attacks on barack obama he made time to go to the gym but cancelled a visit with wounded troops is just the latest and i wonder how hes going to feel when its all over not only will he lose the election but hes going to wake up one morning and realize that he abandoned his dignity in the process thats obviously something thats important to him and even for someone who was never much of a fan its kind of sad to watch him give it up so readily
1087586 in recent days john mccain has stepped up the pace of his attacks on barack obama now hes lost no time in going after obama for canceling his visit to wounded soldiers in germany even though he had time to go to the gym and sightsee in berlin the ad is brutal in the end this character revealing blunder may be the only thing voters remember about obamas international excursion
1087587 this seems almost deliberately provocative as if team mccain were daring obama to complain that its unfair at which point theyll turn around and accuse obama of whining this is the townhalls
1087588 clearly this is an issue that puts obama on the defensive there is no excuse for his decision to skip this visit my only question is should mccain be the one making this attack either in person or in campaign ads in short wouldnt this message be better delivered by a surrogate while mccain stays above the fray and if you agree with that statement does the lack of 527 groups such as swift boat veterans for truth this cycle ironically pose a serious problem for a candidate who already has a lot of obstacles to overcome
1087589 this ad is a sequel of sorts to the pump ad from a few days ago suggesting that obama uniquely was somehow to blame for soaring gas prices anyone who believes that will i guess also believe that hed torpedo a visit to see wounded troops because thered be no flashbulbs popping in his face not only does that not fit the facts he left his pool reporters outside when he last night his spokesman says the plan at landstuhl was to keep the press on the plane but even under the worst assumptions it makes no sense if you think and i do not that obamas a sociopath who sees wounded soldiers as nothing but political chips to be played in an election card game surely we can agree that hes nevertheless savvy enough to grasp how horribly bad it would look to have photographers with him on a hospital visit in the middle of a campaign if there were pictures on the wires of him shaking hands with bedridden vets while media vultures crowded around for close ups conservatives would have ripped him for it properly and mercilessly and he knows it why not stick with the he went to the gym but not the hospital point which is at least factually correct why go here
1087590 maliki recognizes that theyre going to need our help for some time to come as our commanders insist but that the help is of the sort that is consistent with the kind of phased withdrawal that i have promoted were going to have to provide them with logistical support intelligence support were going to have to have a very capable counterterrorism strike force were going to have to continue to train their army and police to make them more effective
1087591 youve been talking about those limited missions for a long time having gone there and talked to both diplomatic and military folks do you have a clearer idea of how big a force youd need to leave behind to fulfill all those functions
1087592 i do think thats entirely conditions based its hard to anticipate where we may be six months from now or a year from now or a year and a half from now
1087593 so if the size of the final u s force needed in iraq is conditions based and the timing of their stay in iraq is conditions based and it is hard to anticipate where we may be six months from now why is obamas current withdrawal timetable seemingly set in stone what about it is not conditions based and if its hard to see six months into the future is it easier to see sixteen months ahead
1087594 its entirely conditions based now maybe im wrong but hasnt obama been mocking this position for the last couple of years if obama is attempting to co opt mccains message or triangulate he should realize that though he is a great speaker he is not as talented at stealing his opponents ideas as bill clinton once was this sort of maneuver requires more than just audacity it also requires finesse a quality obama clearly does not possess
1087595 if obamas top priority really is withdrawal his iraq policy should begin by setting the number of troops hes comfortable leaving in the field and then asking for recommendations on which missions are feasible given that number the fact that hes going about it the other way starting with the missions and then building any drawdown around them is a decidedly mccain esque i e conditions based i e responsible approach he tweaked mccain this morning for having lately come around to so many of his own positions but in light of this he and maverick are almost mirror images on iraq now mccain thinks troop levels should depend on conditions but concedes that 16 months is a pretty good timetable whereas obama thinks 16 months is a pretty good timetable but concedes that er troop levels should depend on conditions
1087596 the obama 16 month withdrawal position continues to bounce between an ideological anti war and conditional national security one he wants to have it both ways which we find confounding but he finds expedient in my opinioon mccain has not come closer to obamas position mccains position like bushs has always been a conditional one based on circumstances conditions not ideology if leaving iraq in whole or part in 16 months can be done without harming our national security broadly defined then neither mccain nor bush would hold out for more time why would they
1087597 scottsville ny unfamiliar with the menu at local restaurant scullys and faced with the decision of what to order for lunch diner michael cort 25 made clear his belief monday that one cannot go wrong with a cheeseburger pretty hard to screw up one of those guys said cort adding that he would be hard pressed to remember an occasion on which he had consumed a less than satisfactory cheeseburger its a classic medium rare cheeseburger lettuce tomato some fries cant beat it cort went on to advise those with him to steer clear of the fish fry
1087598 obama is running as an outsider agent of change his best veep pick would be someone who reinforces that message hillary clinton clearly doesnt qualify nor does anyone in the senate that was elected earlier than 2004 any governor fits the bill because theyre all by definition outside of dc and thus outsiders for purposes of messaging of the most recently elected senators mccaskill completely fits the bill a great surrogate for obama and a fresh face in politics of the governors the two names heard most often are kansas kathleen sebelius and virginias tim kaine both would be excellent choices fresh faced reformers with the ability to deliver results while operating in red states with gop controlled legislatures they both complement obamas message perfectly and clearly have a good rapport with barack chemistry is important
1087599 what kos seems to forget is al gore was an experienced washington legislator 8 years in the house and 8 years in the senate with his own presidential run in 1988 under his belt when bill clinton tapped him for vp to compare al gore in 1992 to claire mccaskill a first term senator or tim kaine a first term governor is simply ridiculous sure the chemistry was important sure the new democrat message was reinforced but most importantly no one thought al gore was not qualified to be president
1087600 works well with obama check speaks fluent spanish check but inexperienced on the national stage also a check not a particularly distinguished track record as governor check i think however that both kaines greatest asset and his greatest liability may have been missed the liability as i have argued before is that he may not be of much help to obama in virginia the home state vp bounce is small enough to begin with that for a candidate who has trouble hitting 50 percent favorability in his home state it may be non existent on the other hand the obama campaign is smart enough to know that a vps ability to carry his home state is a relatively minor factor in the grand scheme of things the more important question is what sort of brand space he would come to occupy once introduced to the nation at large to whom kaine is a literal unknown on that front the news is a little better for kaine and obama kaine s not a rock star hes an average looking guy which is to say for a politician he has below average looks obama can come across as aloof and arrogant or messianic in the rights favorite phrasing as ably argues this has the potential to detract significantly from obamas core narrative kaine would bring humility and good humor to the ticket and would go some way toward hedging that risk he would not be a vp designed to win over converts so much as to shore up some of obamas weak and wavering support
1087601 tim kaine is on he signed an estate tax repeal that ex va gov mark warner vetoed and tried to push through a sales tax hike hes also horrible on global warming and coal oh and hes pro life awesome
1087602 given that obamas great weakness is inexperience i have trouble imagining him choosing a first term governor whos only served three years kaine might be this years dick gephardt the guy who gets the rumors but not the nomination
1087603 a source tells me that minnesota governor tim pawlenty is john mccains choice and that the announcement is coming very soon
1087604 please say it aint so pawlentys awful on air joke about his wife not having sex with him earlier this year shows he is not ready for prime time his global warming advocacy was so extreme earlier this year that it turned off fellow gop governors quite seriously his tv appearances have shown him to come across as without substance and without memorability and his statement two years ago that the era of small government is over and that government needs to be more aggressive and proactive is a total deal killer for the limited government people who still remain the heart and soul of the heartland gop and of the conservative movement again please say it aint so
1087605 his working class pedigree is all to the good but between the lack of name recognition and the boring old republican white guy effect im underwhelmed he doesnt even have serious religious cred to reassure antsy evangelicals lets hope the reports wrong although given the general savviness of mccains campaign these days it probably isnt
1087606 well i live in pawlentys state and have met him on a couple of occasions and this pick would not make me too glum at all pawlenty has a good center right track record especially on holding the line on taxes with a hostile legislature he demonstrated real leadership during the bridge collapse and its aftermath keeping the gas tax increase advocates at bay and convincing the rest of the state to ignore them hes also pro life and a humble but telegenic man who will inject a little vigor into the campaign pawlenty has a strong base of personal and political support in minnesota and the upper midwest and he could change the calculus in minnesota and wisconsin he also helps defend the midwest if obama picks sebelius gephardt or hagel plus pawlenty never wavered in his support for mccain even when times got tough mccain values that kind of loyalty its not a bad quality to have on the ticket
1087607 let the mccain folks know how conservatives will likely receive certain picks
1087608 ive just done a lap through the coverage by the big news orgs of the ad john mccain here the stories did dutifully note the obama camps push back against the ad but not a single one of these reports told you that the ad is false
1087609 its fine that the reporters sought out comment from the obama campaign but thats the bare minimum it creates a typical he said he said story that pretends there are no objective truths at issue here mccain launches an attack obama says the attack is false maybe reporters could help cut through the rhetoric and let voters know the truth the mccain campaign is airing an intentionally deceptive ad hoping that a voters wont know the truth and can be easily misled and b the media wont raise a fuss about the campaign lying to the public by refusing to do even the most basic level of fact checking news outlets are encouraging the mccain campaign to engage in its most cynical and dishonorable tactics
1087610 does anyone remember mccains blatant lie in the primary that mitt romney supported a timetable for withdrawal mccain hammered romney incessantly and romney wasnt ready for it but it was nothing short of a lie and now mccain is lying again in his new attack ad against barack obama claiming that the reason barack didnt visit wounded soldiers in germany was that he wasnt allowed to take cameras why is no one calling mccain out for being the liar that he is instead people are expressing great disappointment that hes not fulfilling his promise to run an honorable campaign instead of admitting that his claim to run an issues based campaign in the first place was just another one of mccains blatant lies
1087611 just a quick update on the respectful campaign being run by st
1087612 mitchell was there in afghanistan with obama she personally knows that mccains ad is a lie so what did she do she went public and told us what she knew she didnt play the he said she said garbage that far too many washington journalists enjoy nor did she regurgitate a lie she knew to be untrue she called mccain on his lie because she had personal facts that were relevant this is what we keep asking the media to do be fair tell us what you know dont just repeat the other guys lies when you know them to be false mitchell did a great job here she did her job here and we thank her for it
1087613 i dont often praise andrea mitchell but credit where credit is due
1087614 campaign contributions from oil industry executives to sen john mccain rose dramatically in the last half of june after the senator from arizona made a high profile split with environmentalists and reversed his opposition to the federal ban on offshore drilling oil and gas industry executives and employees donated 1 1 million to mccain last month three quarters of which came after his june 16 speech calling for an end to the ban compared with 116 000 in march 283 000 in april and 208 000 in may
1087615 so much for the mavericky persona first it was the freudian slip of greasing up more than just the straight talk bus so sen mccain how about some real straight talk not just the kind you paint in large letters on your bus but some real honesty about oily to me
1087616 not a single economist in the country said a gas tax holiday would work
1087617 yes and theres no economist in the country that knows very well the low income american who drives the furthest in the oldest automobile that sometimes cant even afford to go to work
1087618 but they all say that the oil companies the gas companies are going to absorb any reduction
1087619 they say that but one it didnt happen before and two we wouldnt let it happen we wouldnt let it americans wouldnt let them absorb that
1087620 we would make them shamed into it we of course know how to american public opinion and we would penalize them if necessary but they wouldnt they would pass it on
1087621 yes thats right mccain will combine a tax cut with a program to shame oil companies into cutting prices mccains total non response to this critique of one of the main elements of his energy policy is really staggering
1087622 so mccains argument here is that the poor in this country need serious help and so were going to subsidize oil companies and try to leverage public opinion to shame them to pass some of those subsidies back to consumers in the form of price cuts at the pump to call this a bank shot insults bank shots everywhere
1087623 john mccain is going to prevent oil companies from pocketing the proceeds of his gas tax holiday by publicly shaming them into passing the savings along to consumers you betcha i guess he came up with that idea because its worked so well with other huge industrial corporations in the past
1087624 kudos to john mccain this is a solid important commitment by him to the principle of e pluribus unum and americans across the political spectrum but especially conservatives should applaud him as for barack obama this is a critical moment in his campaign is he a candidate of change who will transcend race and bring us all together rejecting divisive policies he knows in his heart are outdated and irrelevant or just another democratic pol who lacks the courage to stand up to powerful but aging interests in his own party which remain hopelessly infatuated with identity politics and insist on perpetuating a set of policies that have always been unfair and divisive and are now outmoded to boot
1087625 i suspect this is a fight obama wants no part for it is a losing one and resurrects the issue of just how post racial a candidate he is as for mccain if this is where hes come down as a matter of policy he should make sure voters understand the stark difference between him and his opponent and if not he should clarify his position before opponents of the current system get their hopes up
1087626 mccains decision to support the arizona civil rights initiative on the ballot on election day this fall means that a critical campaign issue is now in play having come out for the arizona initiative mccain cant allow himself to be so intimidated by democratic attacks note obama has already accused mccain of taking a position thats divisive that he fails to argue in its behalf that he quits on it which is of course exactly what obama and his aides would like to see mccain do mccains advisers usefully could carve out some time right now to brief mccain on the ins and outs of this issue and to schedule a major speech in which he could without interruption make the case for colorblind government in arizona and in other states and at the federal level too
1087627 mccain is on the popular side here and its not even close the very blue states of california washington and michigan have all passed this resolution by sizeable majorities mccain though should not over emphasize this issue for one thing its not central to his thinking and to pretend otherwise might undermine his authenticity perhaps his most valuable asset for another stridency on this issue might make mccain seem divisive to use obamas term independent and swing voters overwhelmingly side with mccain over obama on this issue but probably wont appreciate being bludgeoned with it especially given obamas race though president george w bush s squishiness on racial preferences bothered me greatly i think it helped him politically because it softened his edges unlike bush mccains moderate credentials are well established so he doesnt need to be squishy just not overly aggressive but mccain shouldnt let the matter die either
1087628 i was thinking recently that if you really wanted to do something to shore up the sanctity of marriage then rather than ban gay marriages you ought to ban say fourth marriages its one thing to say that people who make a mistake ought to get a second chance but serial nuptuals really do make a mockery of the institutions basic premises in a way that same sex couples dont maybe some people just need to admit to themselves that they have no business making promises of life long commitment initially i wanted to ban third marriages but it seems worth watering the proposal down in order to enhance political feasibility and secure access to the much vaunted three strikes and youre out catchphrase
1087629 in the interests of pushing the envelope i ll take the the anti third marriage position ticking off rush limbaugh yet again no doubt thereby making matts three strikes and youre out approach the moderate bipartisan position on the question now all we need is for david broder to write a column endorsing it
1087630 austin tx whether hes making his approval known during sporting events and rock concerts or simply in a situation that requires him to get the attention of one or more persons 33 year old loud whistler jim burston never misses an occasion to insert his pinkies into his mouth and whistle loudly sources reported monday im not sure it was necessary to whistle like that to gather everyone in the breakroom for cupcakes said coworker robert lindel referring to a recent incident in which burston whistled piercingly for more than 10 seconds until everyone in his office had assembled for a workplace birthday celebration he could have just sent an e mail according to witnesses burston last whistled loudly at the conclusion of a bris but was quickly drowned out by loud air horn guy lucas nesbaum 32 a man known for frequently discharging an ear shattering 345 decibel air horn
1087631 youve been a major force in my life you are the reason i ran for office
1087632 you are the keel on the ship of state you keep america going in the right direction
1087633 weve needed you for so long in politics and we need you desperately right now
1087634 you are the guiding compass for america you are committed to ideas and you spew them forth in great volume
1087635 i dont think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president
1087636 you fought back and im grateful to you from the bottom of my heart
1087637 grown from a tiny insurgent movement into a force to be reckoned with
1087638 the difference between john mccain and barack obama on iraq policy alone is 98 years in iraq and we dont want 98 years in iraq
1087639 when barack obama becomes the next president of the united states he will have become president of all 50 states not just those who agree with him
1087640 i want to thank barack obama because has embraced the 50 state strategy barack obama has done everything that my campaign pioneered and multiplied it by 10
1087641 when your average donation is 68 you are owned by nobody but the american people
1087642 if you want moral authority you cant stoop to the same level as the people who attacked us if you want moral authority you cant have torture and you cant have guantanamo bay barack obama will restore moral authority to the united states of america
1087643 there is common ground among all americans we must focus on that which we have in common and not that which divides us
1087644 a friend described netroots nation as like a giant family reunion with howard dean as the crazy uncle on another reasonable view however dean is more like a patriarchal figure the foundational character from which all else flows ultimately though i think thats wrong dean is not a blogger himself and is at the end of the day a bit besides the point when it comes to the larger movement he and his 2004 candidacy happened to be the point around which a lot of the early netroots energy coalesced over time however its become clear that the real leaders of the movement were include a large number of folks who were early dean supporters or followers but that dean himself plays an essentially peripheral symbolic role in the whole thing and its to his credit i think that hes basically accepted that role and done it well while also focusing diligently on his job as dnc chief
1087645 they want people to do something theyre voting for leadership
1087646 the stunning tidbit from junes totals is that the average donation has decreased from around 100 in february to 68 in june in other words while the average amount donated has decreased the number of donations has increased a lot what was true at the beginning of this race is still true and will likely be true up until election day democratic voters are more engaged in the process more enthusiastic about their candidate and more likely to reach into their pockets even at 5 10 or 20 at a time to put an end to republican governance
1087647 good news for democrats it seems the small dollar donor crowd is intensely focused on winning back the presidency even with the organizing around fisa obama took in a remarkable money haul from small dollar and large dollar donors the whining from dc pundits about how the left was undermining obamas chances at winning was absolutely wrong his small dollar donor army wants him in that white house and they are going to pay to put him there while its often impossible for consultants in dc to keep multiple thoughts in their head it is possible for most of us normal bluggers and blug readers to get that we dont like his vote on fisa but we want him to win the white house desperately anyway
1087648 its interesting to see the press who had previously been fixated on as it turns out erroneous reports that the obama campaign had brought in about 30 million for the month a number they saw as underwhelming try to make the argument that obamas 52 million somehow fails to meet expectations too just a few minutes ago on msnbc chuck todd whose work i usually find to be quite insightful appeared unimpressed by this report no mention of course that obamas haul was more than two and a third times larger than that of mccain or that the dnc more than quadrupled its take from the previous month or that the pace set by obama this month would provide him more than enough resources to justify his wise decision not to opt into the public financing program this actually evokes something that matthew yglesias wrote about yesterday the notion that everything must be good news for john mccain consistently trailing obama in the polls good news taking in less than half the money as the obama campaign in a month good news not connecting with voters good news good news
1087649 i believe that obama could have raised 100m in june if thats what they wanted to do in fact there may have been plans to do just that too but they changed notice that just 2m was raised for the ge by obama they certainly could have raised a ton more money there if they had wanted for the ge at least 20 30m and combined with the 74m that was raised between obama and dnc over 100m so either the obama camp isnt as committed to self funding for the ge and might still go the route of taking the 84m in public financing unlikely or they are holding off their donors to give for the ge later there are accounts of projecting a 100m month in sept or the obama camp will use july and august to raise big numbers for the ge as the decision to opt out was made on june 19th late in the month for fundraising plans it could be either of these last two it seems
1087650 its worth pointing out that despite obamas edge over mccain the rncs enormous edge over the dnc means that its by no means clear that obama will really have a financial advantage in an overall sense the mccain campaign and the rnc recall are working in a sufficiently hand in glove manner that the rnc ran an ad lauding mccains willingness to break with the republicans over climate change
1087651 bo damn you conservatives for taking my wife seriously glamour magazine the print equivalent of oh access hollywood about us meanies who listen to his bitter half on the campaign trail and hold her accountable for her public statements
1087652 i dont see how anyone could argue that michelle obama isnt news was hillary clinton not news in 1992 some candidates wives are higher profile than others and michelle obama is pretty far up there she speaks in public a lot and she says newsworthy things my guess is she would be a pretty involved first lady so it seems to me she should get more coverage not less
1087653 i dont see how barack obama can send out michelle obama as a surrogate have her declare that the country is downright mean or that americans are spending their stimulus checks on earrings or lament her need to spend 10 000 a year on piano and dance and sports supplements for their children or americans inability to afford fruit or that everything thats in a bottle or a package is like poison in a way that most people dont even know or that what she notice s about men all men is that their order is me my family god is in there somewhere but me is first and then expect the rest of the country to stifle its objections
1087654 is anyone else beginning to sniff a sour whiff of victimhood of course the campaign was widely publicized self flagellation about allowing his daughters to be interviewed it does seem as though theres an element of self serving sympathy mongering going on its unbecoming presidential politics is not a pursuit for the sensitive minded or thin skinned as long as michelle obama campaigns and acts as a surrogate on the trail not to mention providing interviews to kissy kissy outlets like access hollywood she is fodder for commentary and yes even criticism properly so
1087655 how is michelle o any more or less of a civilian than legitimate issue per their relationship wrights not delivering campaign speeches on obamas behalf and surely his views while arguably a proxy for some of obamas own arent as reliable a proxy as michelles the point in criticizing her isnt to go after the opponents wife for the sport of doing it its to highlight what may or may not be an insight into the opponent himself its really an attack on him in other words a dumb attack since it lets him appeal to women voters by playing the angry husband but an attack on him all the same
1087656 we cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives weve set weve got to have a civilian national security force thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
1087657 its not quite clear what obama meant by this if he meant that the military had taken over too many functions that normally should be handled by the state department then that echoes what defense secretary said this week it seems to reference the costs associated with reopening consulates and doubling the peace corps but that wouldnt come close to matching what we spend at the pentagon the phrasing of it a civilian national security force sounds much more like a quasi military organization operating within the us under the control of the federal government
1087658 when the democratic nominee calls for a huge new national security force working domestically shouldnt someone in the msm ask him what he means obama represents the most inexperienced risky major party nominee in american political history and he is demonstrating that with at best inscrutable off the cuff rhetoric on a daily basis but the msm bigs are covering for him astonishing
1087659 candidates who can be trusted with the leadership of the free world dont engage in weird little riffs that leave normal people puzzling over what they meant and with no alternative that doesnt seem either disturbingly creepy or frighteningly naive just another sign that barack isnt quite ready for prime time
1087660 deprecat ing the united states on foreign soil for his own self aggrandizing purposes
1087661 realistically its not at all fair to keep expecting barack obama to deliver stirring powerful addresses and yet he keeps managing to exceed expectations obama didnt apologize for america but he did explain his vision of what makes america great in case our friends abroad had forgotten i was also struck by just how much ground obama covered climate change loose nukes counter terrorism aids poverty free speech religious liberty darfur drug trafficking rule of law it was all in there i never know how people are going to react to speeches but obamas speech struck me as a home run
1087662 obamas speech was a terrific reminder that america can lead and be respected in the world if it once again has a president who is a true leader and someone whom the world can respect as one of the msnbc commentators said george bush goes to europe and draws huge crowds of protestors what a treat to see an american leader speak to cheering enthusiastic crowds again and for the home folks over and over obama said how much he loves american and what it has traditionally stood for the promise that drew his father from kenya to the us no one else could have done what he did mccain seems so small at this moment so 20th century
1087663 its a good speech though nothing particularly revolutionary more important than the words is the image what looks like hundreds of thousands of berliners gathered in a historic square looking expectantly at an american politician for inspiration and leadership our candidates frequently assert that a restoration of americas global leadership will be high on their agenda but american leadership cannot be passed by an act of congress or ratified by the electoral college it is the rest of the world that must accept our role and for it to be worth anything they must do so willingly the crowd assembled in berlin today is certainly willing
1087664 the overall reaction that i had to watching barack obamas speech in berlin this afternoon was mainly visceral what he said made much less of an impression on me than the spectacle itself the most remarkable part of it was that barack obama has not yet been elected president and yet over a hundred thousand germans turned out to hear what he had to say and they mobbed him after the speech just trying to get close enough to touch him
1087665 today the word of the day in the corporate press is presumptuous used in a sentence senator obama is being presumptuous during his trip acting all presidential and dignified how dare he be presidential while running for you know president presumptuous during the live cnn web feed of the berlin address an anchor used it to describe the event and candy crowley used it in her post address analysis on cnn the reality is that positive coverage of any democrat is limited and temporary for fear of networks and newspapers either being accused of liberal bias or being tossed out of the very serious barbeque loop regardless of whether the democrat in this case senator obama is having a good day its somehow unethical to report on such good news for too long without deliberately concocting an antidote to appease the far right
1087666 while obamas speech will be treated as a major news event we should expect the dc media to be dismissive further expect them to justify this by claiming that the average voter is so utterly xenophobic that the average voter would rather be hated by the world than embraced by it what they wont say publicly is that they are starting to adjust their coverage in order to accommodate the attacks the mccain campaign that the republican noise machine are making on their objectivity in this campaign let the kowtowing being
1087667 the pre existing narrative of the liberal media is still in very good working order particularly among the media itself and it will be put to use at some point to create hostile press for obama the only question is if it will happen before or after the election this is why its not a good long term policy to have a puerile media that covers politics like its a britney spears stakeout even if on a rare occasion they temporarily swoon over a democrat the longstanding storyline of the liberal media will be deployed and they will eventually overcompensate in the other direction
1087668 barack obama was indeed awesome in his berlin speech tonight but watch out americans might decide he was a little too awesome yeesh they just cant help themselves can they
1087669 thousands and thousands of cheering germans may not play well stateside
1087670 a million screaming germans what is that supposed to mean and while yes americans dont like fur ners telling us how to vote this would be the first time that anyone in the media to my knowledge has suggested that obamas raucous world tour has the chance to hurt him sure its john mccains line though funny mccain didnt mind doing his own world tour in march and then again a few weeks ago maybe the post would be happier if no one showed up for obama that would go over much better with the american people
1087671 after it became clear that obamas trip through the middle east was not only error free but wildly successful because of malikis gambit theres been a third wave of press chatter and fretting to the effect that obamas trip may now be too successful that voters on the home front would rather have him stateside addressing their concerns than being feted by adoring europeans good post on this at swampland yesterday in the short term sense i dont think watching obama walk on water in europe or in whatever lakes or rivers they have available will goose his poll numbers it may even have a bit of the reverse effect the key was banking a solid trip abroad an audition for the head of state commander in chief role that hell be able to refer back to mostly implicitly sometimes explicitly during the tough weeks ahead in the fall fundamentally this election is about hiring obama and overcoming the residual doubts about his newness youth funny name whatever that are allowing john mccain even to stay in contention
1087672 the power of christ compels you sorry a la the exorcist thats all that ran through my head as i listened to the obamessiah give his sermon at a place that once enjoyed a similar spectacle when hitler addressed his own zealots and we all know how well that worked out dont we never before have i witnessed such reverence and grandeur for a kid who has no business being where he is save for the love train he enjoys from the enabling media conglomerates and a lot of interesting personal connections this man makes me ill
1087673 absolutely stunning a major party candidate to be president of the united states just spoke to a crowd of over 100 000 on foreign soil and tried to apologize for america barack obama just couldnt bring himself to make an unqualified defense of america without criticizing the country for not having always lived up to its ideals in order to curry favor with europeans he went after america for not being as tough on businesses in the fight against global warming as germany and in neutral terms said that the two superpowers came too close too often to starting a nuclear war as if america and the soviets were equal threats to world peace a friend of mine emailed during the speech to say i feel sick im sure he isnt the only american who feels that way this afternoon
1087674 is it possible that many americans will not warm to the idea of a candidate presuming to speak as an incumbent and to do so to the world from berlin many conservative analysts praised the speech but opinion elites should check with the independent voters of the industrial midwest where this election will be decided their dads fought and won w w ii and they may not find enough pride in american greatness in obamas speech
1087675 watching news footage of baracks berlin speech last night it wasnt just his reference to being a citizen of the world a term beloved of the left that irked me rather it was the sheer presumptuousness of an american presidential candidate apologizing for his country no doubt if barack is elected well all get to do plenty of bowing and scraping before the likes of germany and france with apologies to everyone simply for existing using energy and as he did yesterday presuming to remove a dictator whom the entire world believed to have weapons of mass destruction and trying to bring a second stable democratic government to the middle east
1087676 i thought the speech was a giant failure obama loaded the speech with banal cliches in the hope that it would be a giant nothing burger and yet he still failed to him referring to oneself as a citizen of the word may sound like the kind of meaningless lofty language that he specializes in but citizen of the world is actually a pretty freighted term given the context that this particular citizen of the world wants to be president of the united states perhaps obamas ego has grown so large that he figures one country even the worlds lone superpower is no longer worthy of his leadership a quick prediction the citizen of the world mess up will be one of the issues that frames the rest of the election
1087677 over the last few years weve heard endless comparisons between george bush and hitler but lets face it obama has a lot more in common with hitler than bush ever did obama is toweringly arrogant uses messianic fascistic rhetoric seems to have ambitions that stretch past his own country to the world and has legions of mind numbed zombielike followers doing his bidding and blaming all their problems on convenient scapegoats so with that in mind meet
1087678 berlin paris kalamazoo he could have given this speech anywhere obama goes to berlin and winds up in bangor but maybe that was the point unlike jfk clinton or reagan obamas purpose in berlin was essentially self serving the great cause at stake was his own campaign not the threat of communism or adapting to a post communist world the great purpose to which obama was asking his berlin audience to rally was his own presidential aspirations pretty thin not the stuff of history books
1087679 this was not a serious speech by a serious person but another attempt by obama to seem important by giving a big speech on a grand stage there is nothing in that speech that is meaningful insightful or useful it is a an amalgamation of liberal idealism and arrogant do goodism it is an attempt to paint the world as in some kind of universal crisis so that obama can claim the leadership role and the mantle of change not just in a presidential election cycle but worldwide
1087680 i didnt think obamas berlin speech was as bad as scott johnson did actually i could have given large chunks of it myself although perhaps not with a straight face it will no doubt contribute to the dawning realization among obamas nutroot fans that he doesnt need them and doesnt much care what they think
1087681 there was not a ton to object to and indeed a lot to like in obamas speech in berlin
1087682 obamas speech struck me as so riddled with clich s that even he was bored it seemed like his speechwriters went through a bunch of old speeches pulled favorite phrases and strung them together between a few poll approved big ideas
1087683 for a supposed rhetorical genius barry never actually delivers any memorable lines does he its the circumstances of his speeches that make them memorable the best he can do by way of takeaways is zen pap like yes we can or we are the ones weve been waiting for or todays latest mindless positive affirmation this is our moment this is our time as petty as mccains attacks lately on obamas popularity have been i sympathize with his predicament on this point its one thing for the media to politely ignore that this crap is cliche and an inch deep but to actually celebrate it as evidence of eloquence
1087684 i would rather speak at a rally or a political gathering any place outside of the country after i am president of the united states mccain told nbcs kelly odonnell but thats a judgment that sen obama and the american people will make however on june 20 mccain himself gave a speech in canada to the economic club of canada in which he applauded naftas successes an implicit message behind that speech was that obama had been critical of the trade accord also mccains trip to canada was paid for by the campaign
1087685 remember one month ago when john mccain traveled to canada as a campaign expense and criticizes obama for taking a trip abroad that includes a stop in iraq daily kos
1087686 yes how dare a presidential candidate speak to the world about his ability to govern as president and as a matter of fact heres john mccain thoughts on this very subject before his trip to latin america earlier this month
1087687 my ability to lead as president to keep up with these major issues
1087688 jeez could he be any more transparent why not just carry a big blinking sign saying barack obama isnt a true american patriot i mean i realize were in the silly season and all but as atrios says this criticism is head scratchingly weird non presidents give speeches outside the country all the time and yeah i realize ive been posting an awful lot about mccain campaign trivia lately but the guys really been on a helluva roll the last few days hasnt he
1087689 by complaining about obama being popular with foreigners mccain is pandering to the most insular xenophobic instincts of the gop base showing that hes more worried about them than trying to appeal to the common sense center then again the prospect of a president whose foreign policy for the first time in eight years isnt based on pandering to that fringe probably is exactly why obama is so popular overseas
1087690 remember when john mccains big criticism of barack obama was that he didnt take enough foreign trips especially to iraq and how he hadnt been adequately tested on this big stage of codeling what happened to that now the critique is that mccain iii would you like some cheese with that whine liberal bloggers are sharply criticizing the mccain camps conduct during the past week every thing obama does reporters must surely realize the one thing theyre not allowed to report sure its tough to follow president 27 but the fact is whatever john mccain once was campaigning against obama has revealed mccain as an angry resentful often befuddled old man every reporter must sense this but none will report it as his team mccain looks petulant hes ignored his own trips to canada with speeches and central and south america to suggest that obama shouldnt be giving speeches abroad this after bitterly complaining that obama hadnt gone to iraq and afghanistan and now complaining that he has mccain has had a terrible week and obama has had a great one
1087691 a counter insurgency strategy made up of a number of components
1087692 mccain submits that the surge is really a counterinsurgency strategy and so any counterinsurgency strategy is a surge and the anbar awakening was part of a counterinsurgency strategy so even though it occurred months before the surge its still a surge and heres where mccain has lost the plot remember that mccain is making an argument that he can prosecute not only a better war than barack obama can but also a better one than president george w bush has key to that has been his dual invocation that he supported the new troop surge of 2007 but also was a fierce critic of a mismanaged war during the years prior by conflating the pre 2007 approach with the post 2007 approach all to save his ass from simply admitting that he doesnt understand what the surge and the awakening actually are mccain completely messes up his own argument for why hes better equipped to prosecute the war unless the july 2008 era mccain wants to argue that we really were succeeding in iraq in 2005
1087693 so to follow john mccains logic everything positive thats ever happened in iraq is part of the surge even those occurences that began well before the actual increase in troops which is you know the surge as defined by the us military and political leaders and pretty much everybody whos ever talked about it and everything negative is part of the failed strategy of which he was the number one critic so bad stuff mccain knew it was bad and spoke out good stuff mccain personally directed it of course this is completely illogical if the surge is merely counterinsurgency strategy then weve been surging since 2005 when coin was implemented with mixed results mind you but since the elite media has very little understanding of iraq themselves and since any attempt to clean up the historical record yields the charge that they are undermining the work of the troops this will probably go unchallenged or maybe challenged by the obama campaign but left for the audience to figure out on their own
1087694 using these rules why dont we just retroactively define anything positive as the surge and credit the mcmaverick got a raise at work thank the surge and john mccain hit the lottery john mccain can tell you how it is related to the surge
1087695 to paraphrase a certain presidential candidate looks like mccain would rather lie to the american people in order to avoid political embarrassment than admit a mistake and offer a truthful account of the past few years in iraq
1087696 john mccain confused now with an added dose of desperate
1087697 strictly speaking the awakening began prior to the surge and the counterinsurgency strategy it would be a good and illuminating deal if the following exchange could take place mccain could admit that he misstated the strict chronology of the surge and the counterinsurgency strategy in return obama could admit that he was completely and entirely wrong about how effective the introduction of the surge and the implementation of the counterinsurgency strategy would be
1087698 the terrain of the 08 election has issue wise wildly shifted gone are the days when iraq was the number one issue with half the voters and healthcare was a strong second here are the days when economic security is the dominant issue and gas prices and job security are at the top iraq is last elections issue neither obama or mccain has fully adjusted to the new terrain mccain has been more out front and aggressive in defining himself with it obama has been holding back to date that mirrors the congress where democrats are content with the current dynamics and want to holdout for 09 to address the issue and republicans are looking for an issue to move the polls with for 08 if these remain the economic security positions of the parties going into the 08 election dems are not going to win some races we should have and the ge is going to be very close
1087699 ill tell you back when i was in prison at first i couldnt sleep because of all the noise but i got so used to it that now i cant sleep when its quiet
1087700 i note with interest today john mccains new tactic of associating barack obama with oversexed and or promiscuous young white women see todays this from yesterday presumably a la harold ford 2006 this will be one of those strategies that will be a matter of deep dispute during the campaign and later treated as transparent and obvious once the campaign is concluded
1087701 hes an uppity negro who wants to fuck your sister mccain camp has chosen theyre allowed but if the word presumptuous comes out of the mouth of a journalist one more time im gonna go elvis on the teevee
1087702 i seem to remember that midway through the democratic primary there was a lot of chatter about how obamas promise of a new politics meant he couldnt really go on the attack as that would generate terrible media coverage and sink his campaign
1087703 wow this is just transparent theres no reason to include britney spears and paris hilton in this ad none it hangs on the word celebrity being included which means it could have just as well been brad pitt and george clooney anyway all the footage is from obamas berlin speech not the red carpet this is absolutely meant to juxtapose images of white women with images of a black man they even dissolve into one another right now we have a press narrative entirely focused on obama whether or not hes ready whether or not hes presumptuous whether or not hes equipped to lead its high time there was a bit of focus on mccain and the truly nasty racially coded campaign he is now running
1087704 lets do a quick rundown of the identity politics at work obama is a girly man the ad only compares obama to female celebrities which is a direct shot at obamas manliness obama will sleep with your white daughters paris hilton and britney spears are known for their sexuality as much as anything else that must go for barack obama too and the history of attacking african americans in association with white women is such a positive one obama is too young for a campaign that is hyper sensitive to attacks on mccains age they certainly have no problem attacking obamas age which is what comparing obama to spears and hilton is obama is a hollywood liberal this is also a run of the mill attack on obama as a hollywood liberal elite in line with decades of conservative backlash narratives this is really atrocious stuff and trying to bring out all of the worst aspects of america in order to win an election at this point the mccain campaign is just hitting obama with whatever it can think of and seeing if obama will respond it works too as they get tons of free press out of it given that political attacks take on their own life the best response for obama is probably to start making attacks of his own
1087705 associat e barack obama with oversexed and or promiscuous young white women
1087706 oh josh tell me that you had to drink half a bottle of whiskey to numb the pain of writing that the message of the ad is fairly clear barack obama doesnt want to be with paris hilton what sane man who values his health would he is paris hilton i can understand why people dont want to hear that but thats hardly our fault seriously if the democrats dont want us to compare their candidates to fairly vacuous celebrities with no history of accomplishments then they can start nominating better candidates but full points for doing your part in bringing the word uppity back into the bounds of political discourse marshall although i think that your magic racist detector whistle is broken i for one cant hear a damned thing
1087707 look i understand that liberals are frustrated at barack obamas inability to pull away in the polls despite all the favorable tailwinds hes enjoying and the fact that john mccain is running a staggeringly inept campaign id be frustrated too but that isnt a reason to make yourself sound like a paranoid idiot
1087708 the recent mccain ad where he makes fun of obamas celebrity status happens to feature a picture of britney spears to illustrate its point about the vacuousness of fame for fames sake marshall is usually above this sort of thing so i note with interest his new tactic of baselessly crying racism where none can be found
1087709 republicans know that youre not real happy with them and so the only way they figure theyre going to win this election is if they make you scared of me
1087710 its clear obama s going to play the race card all the way to november and maybe beyond if you criticize him youre a racist to one degree or another obama is the uncriticizable unopposable candidate if you breathe a word against him you must don the scarlet r for you know what
1087711 this isnt the first time either that the left has gotten impatient with the lack of racial attacks from mccain and demagogued him anyway just to defibrillate the narrative as they also did with hillary but its unusual to see the messiah himself stoop to making the charge instead of outsourcing it to an aide or waiting around for one of his for him
1087712 mcsames promise to run an honorable campaign is holding up about as well as his wedding vows to his first wife but its hard for me to get riled up about this spot because its just so lame it feels like someone in the mcsame campaign is trying ever so desperately to imitate big bad lee atwater and they just cant quite get it right
1087713 weve been saying for weeks that the mccain campaign had nowhere to go but negative but even in your wildest imagination could you have envisioned that hed be using paris hilton and britney spears seriously its a fricking presidential election in the middle of a war and a recession and thats what the gop nominee is throwing out its an embarrassment to this country
1087714 i have no idea how voters will respond to stupidity like this ad maybe theyll find it compelling who knows but it seems to me the ad tells us very little about obama and a whole lot about the shell of a man mccain has become
1087715 theres a fine line between smart and clever and a similar border between clever and stupid and john mccains campaign ads keep on standing on all the wrong sides
1087716 did the mccain camp really think it was a good idea to air an ad that emphasizes how popular obama is
1087717 maybe what really bothers mccain about obamas ability to pack em in no matter where he goes is the fact that hes pretty much a frustrated celebrity himself after all how many senators trade in on their media love affairs by appearing in
1087718 with the release today of a mccain television ad blasting obama for celebrity preening while gas prices rise and a memo that accuses obama of putting his own aggrandizement before the country weaver said hes had enough the ads premise he said is childish
1087719 over the last few years mccain gave up nearly every substantive position that undergirded his maverick image but he did retain the basic image that made him so popular among moderates the jocular yet dignified bipartisan figure who had a core sense of decency i acknowledged as much in a recent column now i think mccain is in danger of losing that as well and thats why you see people like weaver taking the extraordinary step of complaining in public
1087720 it sounds like longtime mccain advisor john weaver agrees that mccains campaign is in benen
1087721 im guessing that mccain will now begin questioning weavers loyalty since that would be much easier than questioning his own decision to embrace rovian tactics in his respectful run for the presidency
1087722 the past two weeks have finally seen something like a spark of life in the john mccain campaign for which steve schmidt deserves credit so now that team maverick has seized the initiative and started scoring points against obama whos complaining townhalls
1087723 for the first time this general election cycle john mccain is driving the message the reason there has finally been i believe a tacit admission that john mccain cannot win a beauty contest against barack obama but that he can win ugly as they say in football no doubt this strategy is the result of the promotion of rovian adviser steve schmidt it will be decried as negative but as they say politics aint beanbag rove managed to win two elections doing exactly what schmidt is now attempting and at the end of the day its merely a smart political strategy sadly some republican talking heads and former mccain advisers are criticizing this strategy in my estimation these folks should shut up one piece of advice the mccain folks ought to adhere to is to simply not allow these naysayers to influence his teams message and strategy if mccain gives into the criticism in my estimation he has lost
1087724 the ad has very well focused message more evidence of the improved effectiveness of mavericks campaign since steve schmidt came aboard making the election all about obama a referendum on the democrats character and qualifications with john mccain running as the not obama candidate is really the only hope for the gop this year
1087725 the mccain camp and i on the same page for once yes its true they released an ad called celeb mocking obama as the biggest emptiest celebrity in the world and taking on obamas opposition to offshore drilling good stuff
1087726 critics who deride the celebrity ad as puerile are majoring in the minors they should realize this one ad is merely part of a larger strategy you cant make everyone happy with every message of the day but the larger narrative is what matters this is not going to be pretty but the election is going to be a referendum on barack obama like it or not the real question is whether or not mccain himself has the stomach to allow his team to run this sort of campaign winning will probably mean that he is viewed by the media as having changed and gone negative mccain has often said he would rather lose an election than lose a war my question is whether he would rather lose an election than lose his popularity with the media elites to beat barack obama he cant have both
1087727 like britney and paris barack obama hasnt earned the status that he like they so enjoys this ad has annoyed many people most presidential campaign ads this cycle especially the drearily self righteous ones excreted by the spendthrift obama campaign have come and gone with no one either noticing them or caring about them why are people talking about this one because it hits close to home
1087728 the ad leads off with a great first half and the more foreign oil line is killer where it trails off is that the portrait doesnt match the frame after framing up obamas celebrity perfectly the ad transitions into a standard republican litany on taxes and gas prices what exactly this has to do with obama being like paris hilton isnt clear the ad would have been more thematically seamless if it honed in on the one or two best examples of obamas naivite or selling american interests down the river to please the adoring berlin crowds obamas without preconditions quote on iran would be a perfect example the theme obamas celebrity naivite isnt just misguided its dangerous
1087729 for four days sen john mccain and his allies have accused sen barack obama of snubbing wounded soldiers by canceling a visit to a military hospital because he could not take reporters with him despite no evidence that the charge is true
1087730 progress todays washington post good for the post this is what the press should do no ones asking the media to pick sides were just asking them to call bs to 1 create incentives to tell the truth and 2 inform a busy public who doesnt always have time to investigate the truth if the obama campaign does something similar the argued the other day that news outlets were repeating the mccain campaigns demonstrably false smear about barack obama and wounded u s troops in germany but neglecting to point out reality as far as the public was concerned mccain was making an attack obama said the attack is false whos right its apparently the medias job to pass along press releases not report the news but im pleased to note that some outlets have been responsible about this nbcs andrea mitchell told viewers this week that the mccain campaign attack literally is not true the in a front page story in todays washington post the paper comes as close as they can to saying that john mccain is outright lying about barack obama in an attempt to smear him as unpatriotic mccains strong suit is his maverick status now hes become just another dirty lying republican politician and the media his base as he calls them has suddenly abandoned him for the first time that i can recall these kind of attacks can work but only when the media agrees to play along see the medias quiescence to the swift boat attacks against john kerry in this case the media starting with nbcs andrea mitchell refused to play along and insisted instead on reporting the facts thats when this kind of negative campaigning can go horribly wrong for a candidate essentially blowing up in their face and in mccains case it just has
1087731 mccains camp accused in the new york times and the washington post this morning of distorting obamas canceled trip to a military hospital in german seems to have backed off the core of the charge that he canceled the trip because the pentagon wouldnt allow him to bring cameras it does now seem that barack obama snubbed the troops for reasons other than a lack of photo op potential writes mccain blogger michael goldfarb this morning contradicting his campaigns televised ads and his candidates statements
1087732 it didnt take them long to back down front page stories in the washington post and the new york times today apparently did the trick mccain cant afford to lose his base over this
1087733 mccains blogger our attack ad and message for the past 4 days has been false with bloggers like that who needs the liberal blogosphere of course that was before mccains blogger michael goldfarb said that barack obama snubbed the troops so apparently the mccain campaign has decided its not time to stop the lies
1087734 so john mccain is being bashed for his dirty politics works and mccain has now shown who will go as far down in the gutter as it takes and why not dirty politics works the gallup tracker now has a once 9 point gap obama held down to 4 rassmussen has its obama 7 point gap down to 2 three guesses how that happened keep waiting for the new politics and see where it gets you here is where obama has lost his way not in the positive side of his campaign thats worked well it is in his negative branding or lack there of when is the last time you have heard the obama campaign use the words bush and mccain together this aint rocket science if the obama campaign is not saying bushs third term half the day it is not doing its job thats politics folks wishing wont make it not so
1087735 just a little reminder it was precisely this time of year in 2004 the lull before the olympics and the conventions when they rolled out the swiftboat smear its when the media are hungry for something juicy and mean and the republicans are ready to feed it to them and dont think because they have been somewhat sympathetic to obama up to now that they wont run with this stuff remember it doesnt matter if they agree with it if they stage a hissy fit if they write long denuncuations of mccain or run fact chacks all that matters is that they get it out there for the mccain campaign the swift boat liars never did a big ad buy they got almost all their play through pimping the controversy and having the media show their ads for free
1087736 this summer john mccain is traveling in style he has worn a pair of 520 black leather ferragamo shoes on every recent campaign stop from a news conference with the dalai lama to a supermarket visit in bethlehem pa the calfskin loafers with silver tone gancini buckles are imported from italy in response to barack obamas foreign tour mccain spent much of his energy last week emphasizing his focus on domestic issues what better way to show his american pride than to tour the country in italian leather
1087737 if i were a right wing blogger and i found out that barack obama was wearing ferragamo loafers that cost 520 i would spend about 50 of my waking hours making sure everyone knew this i would mock him for being an out of touch elitist and make jokes like if you think thats a lot you should see how much his purse costs i would send the link to drudge and wait for instapundit to pick it up and then watch gleefully as fox news ran segments about how barack obamas 500 loafers vitiate his entire economic platform but of course im not a right wing blogger and the 520 shoes belong to john mccain and frankly i dont think how much his shoes cost matters one whit for how hed govern the country
1087738 if barack obama paid 520 for a pair of italian loafers every voter in america would know about it every media outlet would report it and every republican would talk about it im reminded of course of 400 haircuts last year that story was everywhere with the articles about it how could edwards relate to regular folks if he has that kind of lifestyle the media asked over and over again indeed the media seems to go to great lengths to look for evidence to bolster the far right meme that obama is some kind of outsider from bowling to orange juice to arugula reporters love to characterize obama as something less than a real american well mccain has a half dozen homes and spends on shoes what some families spend on rent all the while he advocates more tax cuts for millionaires opposes increases to the minimum wage and tells americans their economic problems are in their heads which candidate is outside the american mainstream
1087739 the big challenge facing barack obama is whether or not ordinary people can relate to him after all hes a big time elitist he thinks that its better all things considered to speak two languages rather than one meanwhile john mccain continues to flaunt his regular guy attributes showing off his 520 salvatore ferragamo pregiato moccasins in a variety of settings in much the same spirit that the legendary straight talker once traveled like a man of the people in the first class car on the acela to philadelphia
1087740 some time ago it seemed clear from emerging trends in press coverage that the meme of egobamania presented a potential threat to baracks campaign as i noted here more recently well dana milbank has picked up the theme in a column titled president obama continues hectic victory tour and run with it like an olympic track star whats truly remarkable is how quickly the press can turn on a candidate that it has lionized perhaps the reason for the increasingly hostile coverage lies in a sentence at the end of a paragraph deep in milbanks piece t here are signs that the obama campaigns arrogance has begun to anger reporters what kind of ineptitude does it take to turn a press contingent once panting with adoration into a vicious pack of attack dogs could it be one more sign that the obama campaign isnt quite ready for prime time
1087741 the crude way to look at the last few years of presidential elections is that in general republicans win when foreign threats are most salient and democrats win when the focus is on domestic issues of the last four presidential elections republicans have won the popular vote exactly one time the election that came three years after 9 11 one year after the invasion of iraq and a few days after bin laden released another taped threat democrats won the other three all of which is to say flip flopping may have helped explain why kerry lost but its just not that powerful a charge people give too much credit to the campaigns politicians run and not enough credit to the conditions in which they run if bush had called kerry a flip flopper exactly as many times but there was no bin laden tape or economic growth was a half point worse kerry would have won and the charges he levied that bush was out of touch and dim wouldve been considered brilliantly effective political attacks
1087742 this will remain a dreadful year for republicans and the mccain campaign will have the unhappy task of running into a stiff headwind all season but this campaign at its heart remains obama vs not obama and not obama is developing momentum
1087743 im amused to hear the mccain camps deep sense of grievance over any suggestion that mccain is running a xenophobic and often race tinged campaign against barack obama its amazing how you can be pushing a message that your opponent is in league with foreign terrorists and comparing him to twenty something white women best known for their behind the music episodes and so many people can get the wrong idea
1087744 i think the britney ad worked on a number of levels the racial aspect being the most subtle and easily dismissed i can understand why most people didnt see it as racist that is after all the whole point of dogwhistles i have no doubt that the campaign has learned the proper lesson from all this mccain and his nasty surrogates can dogwhistle themselves hoarse all the way to november and nobody can call them on it if the liberal media does they will be portrayed as in the tank for obama and part of the problem its a brilliant inoculation indeed it may be such a thorough inoculation that it means that obama is now in a bit of a straitjacket having to second guess all criticism of mccain to ensure that it cant be taken as racist so obama is going to have to be a modern day jackie robinson and stoically endure the more subtle forms of racial ugliness that the right throws at him without ever fighting back or even mentioning that it is happening
1087745 the republicans are playing on something visceral and subconscious just as the the makers of guess whos coming to dinner intentionally chose a liberal white family to demonstrate that racism lingers longest and deepest on the subject of sexuality ill work with them live with them drink with them play with them but i dont want my daughter dating let alone marrying them but just because we cant change peoples hearts and make them race blind doesnt mean we have any right to exploit those feelings for political gain and that is what the republicans do and have done ever since they adopted the southern strategy and betrayed their legacy as the party of lincoln mention any of this and race card comes flying back in your face
1087746 one reason the mccain campaign is so excited to accuse obama of playing the race card is that one of obamas strengths is that he is not perceived by the wider american public as the aggrieved black man he is no jesse jackson or al sharpton by claiming obama is playing the race card however absurd the charge they can turn him into the angry black man it really is shameless and disgusting and while i had seen no racial component to the britney ad earlier i can understand where bob herbert is coming from now i just didnt see it before
1087747 i am convinced that the genius of the infamous harold ford call me ad wasnt the subliminal white women black man stuff but that it got such a negative reaction from civil rights leaders and white liberals to an ad that just seemed to working class tn voters as just a funny ad the initial run of the ad for a few days did nothing bad to fords poll numbers but the reactions to the ad in the week following the initial run did this is what makes the strategy for mccain so good and the reaction from our side so tricky i dont think the answer is the response from obama manager david plouffe which was just to say no were not when mccain and his adviser rick davis accused obama of playing the race card i think the reaction has to be both less defensive and more aggressive
1087748 the race card stuff consciously feeds white resentment when tireless civil rights hero rick davis says how outraged he is about the race card its intended to reinforce the view among some white people that they are punished because some evil minority will claim racism when they shouldnt if it werent for this frightening monster ready to cry racism at the drop of a hat then their children would get into harvard or theyd already be promoted or their kids would get better financial aid or theyd pay less taxes or whatever rather than try to overcome this division the honorable john mccain is stoking the fires and i think that gives you a pretty decent indication of what a mccain presidency will look like
1087749 obama has to extricate himself from an ongoing racial competition between blacks and whites where the prosperity of one is seen as detrimental to the other in a dispute about race the mccain campaign knows it will end up with the larger half for the most part most white peoples experience with race isnt one of racial discrimination what white people can relate to is the fear of being unjustly accused of racism this is why the campaign needs to avoid dealing with race in the context of his rivalry with mccain whenever possible
1087750 i think the mccain campaigns celebrity ad and the whole line about barack obama being too arrogant or something are pretty ridiculous but its a bit puzzling to me to see liberals expressing the view that these are some kind of crypto racist lines of attack given that obamas black and americas history i think its always going to be possible to read some kind of racial subtext into attacks on him but both of these are lines of argument you could easily imagine being deployed against a white candidate and indeed theyre fundamentally similar to arguments republicans regularly make against democrats beyond that trying to sniff out racial subtexts in these kind of things strikes me as overwhelmingly likely to prove problematic people the overtones in the paris hilton britney spears ad from mccain was about race i think some on my side of the aisle are reading too much into this the mccain people just arent smart enough to be that subtle
1087751 i emphatically do not buy that the ad has racial undertones
1087752 has annointed himself ready to carry the burdens of the world
1087753 the mccain campaign has apparently decided to spread the notion among evangelicals that barack obama is the antichrist
1087754 this is typical for the mccain campaign dog whistle politics is a common tactic by karl rove and lee atwater its in play now right before your eyes and this time its targeted at evangelicals
1087755 remember the attack line conservatives used bush derangement syndrome can we start an obama derangement syndrome meme mccains ads have not focused one iota on what mccain will do as president except prolong a war and make tax cuts permanent which i am totally for in peacetime theyre completely focused on barack obama and how popular he is its quite funny when you think about it mccain is grasping big time
1087756 i am absolutely no judge of these things but i think this new mccain video truly jumps the shark it has been reported for a while though alas i cant find it now that the mccain campaign refers to obama as the one with contempt i dont think that putting your most contemptuous peevish impulses out there for all the world to see is a winning strategy myself
1087757 john mccain is a bitter old man there i said it really it is getting difficult to think of mccain is any other way mccain complains about he is sensitive about his age the dude is just bitter im not sure what happened to john mccain to make him so bitter given that he is a u s senator and worth several hundred million dollars but he is bitter nonetheless electing him would be a demonstration that we as a nation are bitter toward the world toward the civil rights movement and toward youth culture in other words it would be pretty much the same stuff that conservatives have run on for decades this time lets put that out in the open and stop beating around the bush on it
1087758 who would have thought it the mccain campaign is now running more effectively viral ads than the obama campaign the landstuhl ad which i didnt like because of the factual problem stoked a weeks worth of debate that was harmful to obama the celeb ad has dominated cable chat and had 1 2 million youtube hits the last time i looked now theres this brilliant the one ad which will im sure be a youtube sensation because its so fun to watch none of these ads need to have nor have they had as far as i can tell a big broadcast run to be effective
1087759 overall even though i share a lot of ex mccain strategist anonymous strategist outlines ive been heartened by mccains new strategy the campaigns recent moves have shown a willingness to take some risks and have successfully injected the campaigns message back into the press thats a critical change from the last few months and if they start taking some risky plays to build up mccain himself well have a real chance to win this thing
1087760 the bottom line for mccain is this either he will have to endure being called a racist by journalists like bob herbert or he will need to resign himself to sitting back and politely allowing barack obama to win the election
1087761 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices obama said in an interview with
1087762 obama said he might support more drilling if it were paired with comprehensive energy conservation measures and alternative energy development so whats the headline obama shifts says he may back offshore drilling im sure the republicans are going to praise obama for his flexible stance now that hes decided to push a compromise with their oh so practical agenda theres no way they will use this to push the idea that hes unprincipled they wouldnt dare set up a web site called awesome and awesome position that hes put house speaker nancy pelosi in who has refused to allow a vote on drilling in the house
1087763 if obamas poll numbers dont drop next week and if the actual legislation that passes into law does so despite significant conservative republican opposition then i guess this wont be a terrible move until that time however it smacks to me of a major political mistake that will result in destructive legislation while adding credence to the attacks that obama isnt leading and is too easily persuaded by the political winds we get bad legislation and obamas chances of winning the election are damaged that does indeed strike me as a major error
1087764 its a good move by obama its not great that hes been on the record opposing it for the last couple of months and thats why he dumped this now but i think theres momentum enough for just the type of comprehensive plan that obama is talking about to take shape in congress in september or at least for electioning on better he flip now and be on the right side of the issue going forward than continue being in the wrong with a losing message its been clear for nearly a month that drilling was providing an opening for the republicans and whats become obvious to me in the last few days is that they were framing it as a patriotic issue with obama advocating foreign oil for the us that was the real kicker in the celeb ad republicans are fired up about this issue i watched a mccain crowd jump to its feet in a standing ovation at his town hall in support for it today theyve framed it as a patriotic duty and it has serious legs pelosi can suck it up and actually do something to save the planet instead of just talking about it democrats can now take the opening by saying yea well compromise and then make the bill a real long term energy solution
1087765 i think this is a smart move by obama more off short drilling is environmentally risky as a supply policy its delusional and if done alone only locks us into an untenable future but conditioning it in the framework of strict environmental protection rather than immediate price supply relief and as part of a transition to something else is where the debate needed to be
1087766 now that barack obama has said that he is open to offshore drilling one wonders what will be the next policy issue on which he will flip flop for the judges
1087767 obama once again reveals himself as a traditional politician one that will swing like a weathervane in order to get elected the only quality remarkable about obama is his shamelessness in policy reversals expecting everyone to ignore his obvious change in stance as obama pretends that he has always supported what he used to oppose
1087768 barack obamas flip flop on offshore oil drilling is a major strategic victory for house and senate republicans the democratic plan was to reup the congressional ban on offshore oil drilling as part of a long term continuing resolution sen maj leader harry reid had originally promised a vote on offshore drilling but has backed off that promise now that it has become a potent issue now it is time to drive this issue home as a clearly branded republican issue the longer the fight goes on the more it paints democrats into a terrible corner and there is a synergy between high energy costs and broader economic insecurity that will likely be the driving issue in november
1087769 obama invokes the politics of an overall energy package in order gain room to maneuver drilling for oil offshore is either a good idea or bad idea if its a good idea then there is no reason why lifting the ban needs to be part of an overaching really thoughtful energy package if its a bad idea then obama should not consent to it and certainly should not signal his willingness to do so but to obama in all likelihood off shore drilling is neither a good idea nor a bad idea its just a suddenly thorny political issue
1087770 although the shift leaves him open to charges of flip flopping obama is probably trying to take one of the republicans best issues off the table the way bill clinton did in the 1996 campaign by finally signing welfare reform but after signing the reform bill clinton didnt leave much room for bob dole to get to his right on welfare obamas tepid position on drilling still leaves plenty of room for john mccain to get to his right and in 1996 the new welfare reform law was a reality this is just a campaign promise that differs from past promises
1087771 this news will surprise no one that has followed the number of gaffes obama makes when speaking off the cuff when the press finally got embarrassed by their fawning attitude and asked him tough questions in the pennsylvania debate obama folded like a cheap suit against hillary and immediately stopped appearing in debates he has provided an almost endless series of gaffes when speaking extemporaneously and obviously wants no part of mccain in this format
1087772 supporters of senator obama have to be deeply disturbed by obamas decision to duck senator mccains invitation to change american political debate via a series of one on one townhall meetings across the u s here was a chance to genuinely reinvent how presidential elections are conducted to raise the conversation and empower voters and obama ran away so much for the obama rhetoric of change and a new era obamas a machine pol afraid to get too far from adviser david axelrod s script the big duck is an admission by obama that the scars from his late primary season debate battles with hillary still smart
1087773 gee i thought that the old enfeebled elderly and methuselah resembling john mccain wouldnt stand a sand castles chance in an earthquake again the young vigorous rhetorically masterful barack obama front runners dont like debating of course but again it was my understanding that barack obama would clean john mccains rhetorical clock in any debate between the two strange then that obama doesnt take advantage of an opportunity to engage in a little clock cleaning
1087774 before the idiot dc villagers threw a hissy fit about clark he was on the short list for vp is it realistic to see him back on that list well really its up to obama choosing clark would be a clear demonstration that obama intends to significantly shift the political debate in the country and that he refuses to allow old school bitchy sniping from dc insiders to dominate our national political discourse what clark said that mccain has no experience in national security decision making is absolutely true and its a point that needs emphasis repeatedly and effectively by someone who can deliver it clark has a 34 year service record has won a war commanded troops all over the world and nearly died of his injuries in vietnam he has run for president and been a surrogate for hundreds of democrats all over the country including ned lamont he was against the war in iraq and knows the military bureaucracy inside and out this is someone who would make an insanely good vice president and someone who has deep connections to the newly formed progressive communities that emerged from 2002 2006 senator obama would do well to choose clark as his running mate
1087775 i think now would be the perfect moment to reject the faux outrage culture of the village and pick somebody who isnt afraid to call mccain out on foreign policy and military affairs steve schmidt will send everyone in dc a case of smelling salts and a personal fainting couch but unless obama figures out a way to signal that hes getting off the hissy fit express this campaign is going to be torturous and we know one thing capitulating to it doesnt work they just up the ante
1087776 obviously the choice of running mate is highly personal and not something in which any outside organization can have much sway
1087777 wes clark was my guy in 2004 but after what i perceived to be a lackluster campaign although i still voted for him in ca after he had dropped out i was actually glad he didnt run in 2008 but now that its clear that neither hillary clinton nor va sen jim webb will be vp and after clarks refreshing display of backbone when dealing with the face the nation flap not to mention the lackluster supposed remaining shortlist im enthusiastically on board with clark as obamas vp
1087778 new york twenty three year old louis deenan undeniably the most detestable loathsome individual ever to walk the earth willfully decided monday to devote his miserable life and all of its awful ambitions to the field of marketing i think its the career path that will best utilize my networking skills and my ability to think outside the box said deenan whose smug gloating tone and shit eating smile just make you want to punch his goddamn teeth in so im definitely thinking marketing either that or pr deenans mother refused to comment on why she didnt abort the despicable pile of human excrement when she had the chance
1087779 there was an exchange of vulgarities and hand gestures before the malay teenager got off the bus
1087780 scrubbed his presidential web site over the weekend to remove criticism of the u s troop surge in iraq
1087781 have not reached the political accommodation that was the stated purpose of the surge
1087782 even by obamas standards the piece is breathtakingly dishonest obama bet the farm on his prediction that general
1087783 obama can and has conned the msm but our enemies know retreat when they see it obama disingenuously cites the iraqi demand for a timetable as proof that he is following the same path as the iraqis but of course an unknown timetable negotiated with us by the iraqis over an unknown number of years to an unknown number of troops and subject to their revision if they see the need to slow or halt it is completely different from the defeat on a schedule penned by obama today it is a testament to the dishonesty that obama asserts that it is good news that iraqs leaders want to take responsibility for their country by negotiating a timetable for the removal of american troops as though that somehow supports his proposed jam down of defeat
1087784 obama still cannot bring himself to say that the mission in iraq is success even when success is clearly within our grasp for obama the mission is and since his presidential announcement in february 2007 has been to end the war even if it means an american loss of epic proportions and if obama had had his way that is exactly what would have come to pass
1087785 obamas predictions were totally and completely wrong regarding the impact of the surge and the counterinsurgency strategy a fact that few people have called obama on of course the reality based community likes to put forth the shibboleth that it cares about facts and evidence while its opponents ignore the data when they make their policy decisions obamas intellectual outlook on the issue of iraq helps him live up to the very portrayal that the reality based community likes to put out concerning its opponents
1087786 we never know what the future holds and those who supported the invasion of iraq made their own erroneous predictions about wmds etc but less forgivable to deny progress as its occurring right in front of you that suggests the candidate is wedded to ideology and oblivious to the consequences of policy changes and a candidate who has the well audacity to claim that he always said the surge would result in an improvement in the security situation and a reduction of violence when he said the opposite many times thinks that a voters are gullible and b the media have the attention span of an over caffeinated ferret
1087787 scrubbed his presidential web site over the weekend to remove criticism of the u s troop surge in iraq
1087788 obamas down the memory hole approach to his critique of the surge is the perfect accompaniment to redstates
1087789 when the situation in iraq was going badly barack obama wanted us to retreat when the surge took hold and the situation in iraq improved barack obama wanted us to retreat no turn in iraq went unstoned in obamas commitment to retreat and surrender not any more obama has thrown his old positions under the bus and for a guy whose campaign claims to get the net hes done an extremely dumb thing he purged his website of his former positions apparently hes never heard of a cache is there no position this man will not take that he will later repudiate is there nothing this man will not say or do to get elected
1087790 the scrubbing took place this weekend and it may signal more changes or it may just be a way to prep for his upcoming trip to iraq if obama appeared before the troops who defeated the terrorists in western iraq he may not get the reception he wants if his website kept discounting their hard work in the face of a despicable enemy while the sunni sheikhs have been a critical part of the success in iraq it was american tenacity which convinced them to switch sides what changes will we see on the obama site when he returns from iraq and will we have to compare caches in order to discover them as the daily news apparently did
1087791 i hope the tightening we are seeing nationally is real so barack obama might learn the lesson he should learn from the last two weeks a democrat sounding like a republican especially in 2008 is a losing strategy lets set aside the question of whether or not he is actually shifting his positions to the center as most voters now think he is but just on its face obama is sounding more and more like a republican whether it be on the dc handgun ban on late term abortion certainly on fisa and even on iraq his rhetorical shift is clear and if obamas loss in support nationally is real it should be seen as a direct result of this
1087792 in a week in which mccain should have dropped like a stone and his main economic advisor called americans a bunch of whiners obama is also having trouble the race continuing to tighten the reaction from obama partisans is to blame progressives harvard sociologist larry lessig both accuse progressives of engaging in childish behavior dont expect great things from obama dont expect anything really except blame when he screws up its our fault since we didnt clap hard enough still theres the supreme court so ill probably end up giving and volunteering at some point later not now though i dont like being lectured by ivy league wankers who tell me its my fault when obama lies to me thatll have to blow over
1087793 got the message and the american people want the borders controlled first
1087794 the man is just shamelessly dishonest mccain co sponsored the dream act then refused to vote for it then promised to oppose it then promised to support it now under normal circumstances one might wonder whether mccain will be pressed to explain himself today maybe with a clarifying press conference but thats almost certainly not going to happen part of this i suspect is because the media just prefers to go easy on mccain but the other part of the problem is i have a hunch reporters arent following the race as closely as we are that may sound silly they are paid media professionals on the campaign beat but i genuinely believe theyre not especially well informed when i heard mccain vow to support the dream act i immediately knew he was abandoning a pledge hed made during the primaries when the reporters who travel with mccain heard it did they notice the same problem do they even know what the dream act is
1087795 i imagine senator mccains conservative blogger friends might have a few words for him if in fact his statement today was sincere though i commend senator mccain for his support of the dream act but call me crazy something tells me a press conference is in the offing wherein john mccain will tell us he actually does not support the dream act and that his yes yes was taken out of context or some other variation on his tendency to tell us he did not say what he actually said how long do you give him
1087796 john mccain just cant help himself especially when it comes to immigration today he flopped again or was that a flip guess we can just get used to calling him ole two face mccain
1087797 for a stark illustration of mccains double talk at la raza the race yesterday telling an audience member that hell support the dream act after telling because he
1087798 john mccain was one of the senates biggest advocates of comprehensive immigration reform the american people rejected that plan and conservatives were on track to reject john mccains candidacy when he flip flopped on the issue and started supporting a security first position but then after winning the primaries mccain broke his promise and started advocating comprehensive immigration reform again after he was attacked by conservatives who were angry that he had broken such a huge campaign promise he started weaving back and forth in one appearance hed promise comprehensive immigration reform in another hed promise security first well now mccain seems to have settled on a new lie he has started promising both security first and comprehensive immigration reform which is what he did yesterday when he talked to the vile racist group la raza this is sort of like promising to be keep people dry and wet at the same time and it makes no sense
1087799 now some people will say that conservatives should turn a blind eye to john mccains outrageous lies on this subject but thats the wrong approach this is a guy who has made the words straight talk central to his campaign and meanwhile hes breaking a pledge as big as george bush s read my lips no new taxes promise before the election thats not to say that obama isnt a shameless liar too because he is but what should be kept in mind is that if john mccain catches any political hell for being a dishonest man thats a situation he created by being dishonest not a situation created by those of us who are pointing it out
1087800 i know most hot air commenters hotly oppose mccain on immigration and have demanded that he commit to border security he did so in perhaps the most unfriendly confines for such an announcement and even fired back at an activist enrique morones who demanded open borders in a forceful and direct manner opposite mccain we have a candidate who cheers the same activist for his work in promoting open borders that seems like a rather significant difference to me
1087801 from its signature neutral and detached tone to an aggressive plain spoken style of writing that fournier often describes as cutting through the clutter
1087802 as you know weve been keeping tabs on the associated presss atrocious campaign coverage this year and now potential answer to the question of why the premier wire services coverage this year sucks so bad ron fournier the new head of the aps washington bureau
1087803 in principle i couldnt be more pleased with fourniers approach ive long believed one of the reasons more news consumers turn to blogs is that traditional news outlets refuse to cut through the clutter dems said a republicans said b whos right thats not the medias job if the ap wants to change the game id be thrilled but ive seen the results of fourniers work lately and while the idea may have merit theres a problem in the execution i suppose the first time i noticed this new ap came in march when fournier wrote an item whether it was a news article or an opinion piece was unclear that said barack obama is bordering on arrogance a bit too cocky and that the senator and his wife ooze a sense of entitlement to substantiate the criticism fournier pointed to not a whole lot it was basically the republicans uppity talking point in the form of an ap article but the aps coverage has deteriorated since and it goes beyond just the ap giving john mccain donuts and mccain giving the ap barbecue there was the slam job on obama that read like an rnc oppo dump followed by a scathing 900 word reprimand of obamas decision to bypass the public financing system in the general election filled with got the story backwards when obama talked about his iraq policy on july 3 the ap said hed he hadnt at this point the ap isnt cutting through the clutter its adding to it this isnt accountability journalism its weak journalism
1087804 karl rove exchanged e mails about pat tillman with associated press reporter ron fournier under the subject line h e r o
1087805 i was an ap political reporter at the time of the 2004 e mail exchange and was interacting with a source a top aide to the president in the course of following an important and compelling story i regret the breezy nature of the correspondence
1087806 keep up the fight with who ron certainly not with the republicans thanks for not even buying in there ron you just went and gave it away the lord apparently saw fit to make pat tillman an atheist who opposed the iraq invasion too ron fournier encourage not just the facts reporting for the ap but opinion and instant analysis a news bureau of fred barnes level non thinking or as it is known in the trade now reporting awesome ron just awesome enjoy the barbecue with sprinkles
1087807 the donuts are starting to make more sense last month at the associated press meeting with the presidential candidates obama was referred to as osama mccain got a box of donuts from ap reporter
1087808 new york according to a report released monday by the american tourism society going to the tops of things is still the preferred activity among the nations tourists although driving past things and swimming in things have both grown in popularity over the last decade going to the tops of things still surpasses both by nearly 30 percent said ats president kimberly davis in 2008 tourists remained committed to standing in long lines at the bottoms of things paying upwards of 20 to gain access to the tops of those things and then staring at other smaller more distant things for a few minutes before descending often to have funny pictures of themselves drawn incorporating the things in the background davis added that perhaps as a consequence of the declining economy the purchasing of miniature representations of the things that tourists enjoy going to the tops of has dropped by 14 percent

1087841 was strained in the late 1970s by mccains decision to divorce his first wife carol shepp mccain who was particularly close to the reagans and within weeks marry cindy hensley the young heiress to a lucrative arizona beer distributorship
1087842 normally youd think that angering saint ronnie and saint nancy by divorcing your first wife committing adultery and being less than honest in your autobiography about the events which transpired would at least cause a warm feeling to crawl up chris matthews leg but only the personal lives and pasts of democrats will ever matter
1087843 we have the presumptive republican presidential nominee caught lying in his memoir about his sordid behavior and past dishonesty predictably the abroad because voters dont need to know about evidence regarding mccains integrity reporters have already presented the mcmyth what more could the public want
1087844 when mccain was tossing aside the wife who waited out his time in vietnam for the beauty queen many years his junior he neglected to divorce the first wife when he got the marriage certificate for the second if this were a democrat the msm wouldnt be able to stop talking about it but its a republican especially john mccain so expect heads to remain firmly buried in the sand
1087845 imagine if barack obama had two marriages at the same time imagine had barack obama lied about living with his first wife while having a mistress on the side imagine that all this happened while obama had promised to speak out vocally about how gay people are a threat to marriage wed never hear the end of it from the republicans and the media
1087846 john mccain has told and written about this story for 35 years but two days ago he forgot the details because of what happened 35 years ago my response to the mccain campaign would be bloggers arent making fun we just want to know whether that was the most sickening exploitive pandering in the history of presidential campaigns or if he really did forget then we can decide which would be worse
1087847 mccain is pandering on the one issue that one would hope be beyond the realm of campaign exploitation and that deserves more scrutiny not less
1087848 in wisconsin the only thing more important than god country and the right to hunt deer is packers football whether mccain was honestly mistaken in this version of an oft told story whether he was pandering to steelers fans or whether the story has always been a fiction a possibility that would never be considered had mccain not changed a key fact he has messed with the packers in wisconsin thats unforgivable tally ten evs for obama
1087849 will this story come back to hurt mccain as we move forward in the general election i think it gets at the truthiness of his character im not sure what we can call this its not flip flopping is it and is he starting to use his war record just a little to much to promote himself
1087850 they go on for me mccain said i am learning to get online myself and i will have that down fairly soon getting on myself i dont expect to be a great communicator i dont expect to set up my own blog but i am becoming computer literate to the point where i can get the information that i need asked which blogs he read he said press secretary brooke buchanan and senior adviser mark salter show me drudge obviously everybody watches for better or for worse drudge sometimes i look at politico sometimes realpolitics at that point mrs mccain who had been intensely engaged with her blackberry looked up and chastised her husband meghans blog she said reminding him of their daughters blog on his campaign web site meghans blog he said sheepishly
1087851 getting online requires a double click on the browser application i dont necessarily need a president to be able to install the dsl system or a universal broadband card but the double click seems to me like a pre requisite
1087852 my parents are the same age as mccain but they didnt seem to have the same steep learning curve when it came getting online this guy wants to run america and hes stumped by his computer thats a little scary
1087853 ladies and gentlemen the candidate of so much experience that he has no experience with the modern world not to get too pedantic here but neither drudge nor politico are blogs and realpolitics doesnt even exist the thing i assume hes talking about isnt a blog either not that i necessarily expect a presidential candidate to spend a ton of time reading blogs but maybe he should know what one is and if he doesnt read any and is asked about it could say that
1087854 this isnt just about physical age its about a candidate who seems more comfortable in the past and lacks a vision for the future
1087855 it would be pretty staggering to elect a president in 2008 who barely knows what the internet is
1087856 are there any significant economic differences between what the bush administration has put forward over these many years as opposed to now what john mccain supports
1087857 um yeah for instance take you know take for instance the issue of im drawing a blank and i hate it when i do that particularly on television take for instance the contrast on nafta i mean i think that the bigger issue is credibility in where one is coming from are they consistent where they come from
1087858 sanford of course cant come up with any significant difference because mccain has systematically wiped those differences out where he once opposed the presidents tax cuts hes flipped and now swears hell make them permanent his health care plan is pretty close to what bush proposed in his 2006 state of the union hes stopped sponsoring cap and trade legislation but even if there are no substantive differences between mccain and bush on economic policy youd think the mccain campaign would have prepared its major surrogates to argue otherwise their candidates great weakness is his proximity to the most broadly disliked president in history you might imagine the campaign would have come up with a few ways to try and talk to the electorate out of drawing that connection youd apparently be wrong
1087859 this is destined to be a classic in the annals of blowing ones chances to be v p not that its really mark sanfords fault it was really a trick question there are no differences between bush and mccain
1087860 i dont understand why there isnt more outrage over the cover on the right the cartoon is intended to make fun of conservatives as ignorant racists and essentially marginalize any criticism of obama as moronic
1087861 having this on the cover shouldnt just offend the obamas but also conservatives who have a number of substantial issues with barack obama this makes the third bigoted attack from the left on obama two weeks ago it was ralph nader acting as the arbiter of black authenticity and last week it was jesse jackson wanting to castrate obama one side in this cycle certainly seems obsessed by identity politics but so far it isnt the republicans
1087862 what i find interesting about the new yorker cover is that its almost exactly the sort of cover you could expect to find on the front of national review of course if we ran the exact same art the consensus from the liberal establishment could be summarized in words like swiftboating and duh racist its a trite point but nonetheless true that who says something often matters more than what is said and obviously that satire is in the eye of the beholder
1087863 while the new yorker may think this portrayal isnt accurate obamas critics on the right think the picture is spot on i mean this thing has copy and paste written all over it expect to see this jpeg picture popping up in conservative emails everywhere
1087864 if obama loses the editors of the new yorker would prefer to be able to blame it on paranoid fearmongering rather than the public actually rejecting obama on the basis of his positions or lack of experience
1087865 obama isnt a muslim and his wife doesnt carry an ak 47 but obamas long time associations with anti americans like bill ayers bernadine dohrn and jeremiah wright are not rumors or misinformation nor is it crazy ignorance to note that obamas candidacy was endorsed by hamas although hamas later withdrew its endorsement when obama tacked toward the center or that his wife says america is just downright mean obama doesnt want to deal with these very real issues and prefers to respond to the straw man that hes a muslim the new yorker tried to help him in that effort apparently but i doubt that it did him any good that image of a flag burning in the fireplace hits uncomfortably close to the mark
1087866 some people are saying this cover is a parody of the image right wingers have created of barack obama apparently its a political poster for conservatives to reinforce their messages who knew the new yorker was carrying water for us too bad this is both ridiculous and untrue if michelle was willing to tote a gun into the white house i can guarantee shed have a lot more support from us lol
1087867 never mind the cover this new yorker column on barack obama should cause concern among the obama campaign as it further undermines the bogus notion that he is in fact a new brand of politician as you will see what it exposes is an man fueled by ambition and opportunism
1087868 read the whole thing and you will find that there are plenty of former obama supporters who are now
1087869 the article paints a picture of a political dilettante someone whose ambition outstripped his impulse to work he got bored quickly of the state legislature and launched a disastrous run for congress he complained about politics but did nothing to change it he ran for the senate and once there did almost nothing except prepare his run for the presidency the cover is hardly the worst of the article for obama they had better pray that people buy this issue of the new yorker strictly for the pictures
1087870 it obviously was an attempt at satire but it fails it represents the basic stuff that you get from the right about obama but it neither mocks nor exaggerates them its a sad state of affairs that conservatives are hard to satirize or parody because theyre so insane but thats where we are the only context is that its on the cover of the new yorker and everybody knows that theyre good liberals so its satire but look whatever the merits of the new yorker its more elite chattering classes of new york than good liberal not quite the same thing even if theres some overlap the new yorker cover could have worked if had made more clear who it was satirizing fox news the republican party rush limbaugh whatever or by being clever enough to provide the actual funny as it is its just a reflection of the rights view of obama but theres nothing clever or funny about it the cartoon could run as is on the cover of the national review also meaning to be funny but with a different target
1087871 smear artists running a scurrilous right wing magazine would presumably run the exact same image of the obamas on their cover too that we know the new yorker is poking fun hardly makes matters better
1087872 to be honest my first reaction was that it was kinda funny a clever way of mocking all the conservative bs thats been circulating about the obamas but at the risk of seeming humorless that reaction didnt last too long maybe its because this kind of satire just doesnt work no matter how well its done but mostly its because a few minutes thought convinced me it was gutless if artist barry blitt had some real cojones he would have drawn the same cover but shown it as a gigantic word bubble coming out of john mccains mouth implying you see that this is how mccain wants the world to view obama but he didnt because that would have been unfair and mccain would have complained about it and for some reason the risk that a failed satire would unfairly defame mccain is somehow seen as worse than the risk that a failed satire would unfairly defame obama so gutless and whatever else you can say about it good satire is never gutless
1087873 before this announcement it was a pretty safe bet that the mccain campaign would hijack the medias coverage of obamas visit with a lot of press releases about how many days its been since obama visited iraq and how much beachfront property mccain owns in basra and all the rest rather than being a political boost for obama it would almost certainly play into a media narrative about his weakness on iraq now the story will be that obama is in iraq accompanied by a respected republican senator who happened to serve as co chair of mccains 2000 presidential run thats a very very different story and a major coup for the obama campaign
1087874 hagels a great choice like mccain hagel served in vietnam but as a decorated sergeant in the army infantry he likely came away with a much different perspective on the war than john mccain obama and hagels trip to iraq will present a tremendous opportunity not just for obamas campaign specifically but for the larger narrative about the reality in iraq as mccain stumps with lieberman to perpetuate the original iraq lie two different senators with a much firmer grasp on reality will see the conditions first hand and return to the states to a hungry audience what they say and how they say it could bring us closer to finally ending this war
1087875 the image is satirical only because it appears on the cover of the new yorker which we all know is a right thinking magazine read by right thinking people who couldnt possibly be among the new yorker assumes everyone knows its being ironic with its cover sort of the way the white hipster in a gentrifying neighborhood assumes everyone knows hes being ironic when he wears a t shirt but put that image on the cover of national review or that t shirt on a black person in a crime infested neighborhood and the message takes on a very different meaning

1087922 they will see what kind of plan they can put together as to how they will fix it and how long it will take
1087923 its hard to say because most of the damage is road damage
1087924 they live in the saint fran ois area so they were brought in to the arena and registered to make sure that we had everybody and then they went home
1087925 it was unbelievable i was able to see it and its just beyond comprehension

1087940 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy

1087966 i came around to the opinion that i did not like paying for a service that i might use for years only to find when i discontinue it i have nothing
1087967 this is an utterly ridiculous statement when applied to a service like netflix so why when the product is music instead of movies does this argument hold water
1087968 as much as i dislike the free site at least a person can check that for themselves to see if false information is included or if a person with the same name is in the database a pain but far better than having someone secretly access the data and give a bogus reason for denying you the job apartment or whatever

1087979 writing an app in a different language or framework is a great way of learning the frustrating bit is that you know exactly what you want to do and how youd do it in your environment of choice and then we have to translate these ideas into a completely new system with a new set of tools everythings in different places the setup is always different and youre writing in a foreign language so you have to re learn even the most basic syntax and bits of code the best way to get around this is to keep messing around with bits of code and using examples and tutorials from the web then you start to get a feel for the way things work and youre not stumbling around in the dark its kind of like writing an essay in french before learning french

1088137 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy

1088288 revealed no information that was posted about the homicide prior to june 25 2007
1088289 i have not read anything which makes me question the integrity and thoroughness of the investigation and the quality of work done by the detectives their role was to determine who committed the crimes and to ensure that no third party was involved in the murders their role was not to determine if wwe may have acted or not acted in a manner to control the publicity of the heinous crimes committed by one of its stars

1088314 when a man stands between two choices to be killed by his people or to be arrested by his enemy and he reaches a conclusion that it is better to be arrested by his enemy it shows you how cruel the situation is in gaza
1088315 theres still around 30 to 40 percent of gazans who support fatah

1088337 as long as ive got my grandson back with me hes much better now but is not back to normal it will take him years to fully recover

1088341 i think four years on from athens looking at the whole team new zealand sport is in really good shape
1088342 the potential for us across a huge variety of sports is really exciting obviously putting that on the court or pitch or track on the day is what athletes are up against now which is the exciting part
1088343 but as a sporting nation weve never had more potential than we have this year
1088344 you know when you come to an olympics youve got to be in some form youve got to know youre in the bubble to perform
1088345 the number of athletes in that bubble is by far more than weve ever had
1088346 all those who have performed well are in the frame
1088347 does that mean theyll all medal no it probably doesnt but if you look prior to athens the number in that frame is significantly higher than for athens now weve got to wait and see what the conversion rate might look like
1088348 i think thats a more sensible approach what theyve done is focused on those athletes whove put themselves in the frame
1088349 the olympics are all about realising your potential and performing to that on the day that it matters
1088350 its all about pressure and thats the beauty of it

1088378 shortly thereafter investigation results revealed that after being cautioned you continued spending an inordinate amount of time on personal matters on your uab computer and doing other activities related to work on may 19th your employment was terminated for insubordination and neglect of duty
1088379 the committee after reviewing the documents and interviewing all relevant parties unanimously agreed that your behavior on april 15 was inappropriate and unprofessional but not hostile and threatening
1088380 the committee also unanimously agreed that you abused uab time by doing non work related activity on your computer although the committee agreed that your conduct in both instances was improper it did not agree with the decision to terminate your employment it believed that a second warning was more appropriate
1088381 accordingly the committee recommended that the original written warning remain with modified language and that in lieu of termination you be reinstated to employment with a second written warning for excessive internet usage for non work related purposes
1088382 in a meeting on july 1 2008 i advised you of the committees recommendation and my intent to return you to work with the two written warnings in your personnel file i also informed you that you would return to work in a yet to be determined comparable position at the same rate of pay in a different department i told you that my staff and i would work to make your return successful and encouraged you to give thought to areas that might interest you we agreed you would take some time to consider these terms

1088405 hi jim thanks for the nice example ive been reading your blog for awhile now for your custom node library i think it would be a great idea to look to the flex component library to get ideas about what gaps there are in fx base library just my 2 cents after working a little with both something simple like their tilelist may be a good thing to try to duplicate with fx
1088406 nice article one question though why is it preferred to use nodes rather than components is it because they are lighter weight could you please give me a link with more info on this topic
1088407 does making it a node make it easier to skin than a component if youre considering blog posts may i suggest skinning it is a major part of the other ria platforms but i havent seen much on it for javafx yet maybe because most controls are components and not nodes so far

1088521 there are evangelicals who are so earnest in calling for decisions for jesus that they seem to forget to tell people why they should decide for jesus i remember listening to a speaker at an evangelistic meeting whose only mention of the death of jesus was a passing reference in his closing prayer i was acting as an advisor to follow up on the after meeting counseling i spoke to a young couple who had heard the talk gone out to the front been counseled and then brought to me they obviously had not heard any gospel in either the address or the counseling they had no idea about being justified by faith in the doing and dying of christ it seems the decision can become everything people are exhorted to turn to christ to receive christ to ask jesus into their hearts and the like even when they have been given no substantial idea at all of who jesus was and what he has done to save us

1088524 it is important to keep the gospel itself clearly distinct from our response to it or from the results of it in our lives and in the world we should not make faith part of the gospel itself it would be absurd to call people to have faith in faith while the new birth bears a close relationshiop to faith in christ it is a mistake to speak of the new birth as if it were itself the gospel faith in the new birth as such will not save us

1088567 weve just repackaged it in a new way that makes this kind of communication very easy and inexpensive we designed the software and hardware components of the system to just do what theyre supposed to do
1088568 we think this is a path digital signage is primed to take the digital equivalent of anybody who can draw up an ink and poster board sign and stick it on bulletin boards around town we want grandma to be able to do it for her church social as well as the corporate officer for the companys headquarters museums campuses hospitals retirement villages there is an endless list of institutions and businesses as well as neighborhood locales that can make great use of this but the key is keeping it simple and affordable

1088616 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
1088617 richard haass the current president of the council on foreign relations stated in his article
1088618 moreover states must be prepared to cede some sovereignty to world bodies if the international system is to function
1088619 globalization thus implies that sovereignty is not only becoming weaker in reality but that it needs to become weaker states would be wise to weaken sovereignty in order to protect themselves

1088627 i have never before considered with due attention the profit from that animal
1088628 the first step in the recovery of our lands is to find substitutes for corn and bacon
1088629 died after leaving me a pair of half breeds of which we are taking care at monticello in order to know their merit
1088630 always desirous of trying the merits of new races of animals and of adding them if worthy to our national stock
1088631 i am now possessed of individuals of four of the most remarkable varieties of the race of the sheep i mean to pay great attention to them pro bono publico
1088632 in passing through the presidents square i was attacked and severely wounded and bruised by your excellencys ram of which i lay ill for five or six weeks
1088633 a fine little boy killed by the ram that the president has
1088634 the famous shetland stockings are made which i believe sell for a guinea a pair being soft as fur
1088635 there will be any particular utility in raising this kind of wool if encouraging i can probably extend its produce to any requisite degree in my neighbourhood
1088636 make trial of them on quite a small scale until i shall see whether they possess any other qualities which may countervail the low value of their wool
1088637 was so dangerous generally that i was obliged to have him destroyed
1088638 our embargo which has been a very trying measure has produced one very happy and permanent effect it has set us all on domestic manufacture and will i verily believe reduce our future demands on england fully one half we are all eager to get into the merino race of sheep
1088639 two parcels of merino sheep from france which they have procured there
1088640 is almost human and qualifies them to be taught any thing you please
1088641 have the benefit of fine pastures in which they could not run but for the facility she gives of keeping them from the grain in the same fields
1088642 anxious wish to be supplied with sufficient cloth for a coat to wear on the approaching new years day even if it should not be of the finest quality
1088643 i think it an useful one and therefore that it is a duty to encourage it by example
1088644 the determination we have formed of emancipating ourselves from a dependence on foreign countries for manufactures which may be advantageously established among ourselves has produced a very general desire to improve the quality of our wool by the introduction of the merino race of sheep
1088645 i have been so disgusted with the scandalous extortions lately practised in the sale of these animals and with the ascription of patriotism and praise to the sellers that i am disposed to consider as right whatever is the reverse of what they have done
1088646 that kind of patriotism the strongest feature of which is to enrich the patriot himself
1088647 ever attentive to the interests and welfare of my country
1088648 deemed the finest race in spain for size and wool taken together
1088649 we were greatly disappointed the sheep were little bits of things and madisons overseer said he would not give his riding whip for the whole lot
1088650 they are the smallest things i have ever seen in the form of sheep
1088651 that our country people will not even accept of them preferring those breeds giving most wool to what gives the finest
1088652 the finest race of sheep ever known in this country
1088653 scattered the inestimable flocks of spain over the face of the earth and i think it must be peculiarly gratifying to the american farmer to see raised in his own fields and fashioned under his own happy roof that coat by his former mode of obtaining which he used to enrich and abet

1088655 gee those are great parlor tricks but why should i care about brace expansion
1088656 nigeria at the moment cannot meet opec quota because production has gone down below 1 million barrels per day
1088657 how can we meet the opec quota when we now produce less than 1 million barrels per day this is the lowest level so far recorded there is serious problem and it does not look like the end is near
1088658 the npdc is not producing because of niger delta crisis where are we going from here
1088659 our production levels currently are about the same and because of the issues in the niger delta it fluctuates
1088660 there are security challenges in the niger delta but there is no doubt that we are facing those challenges through the process of enhancing security in the area we recognise the issue as very important and have to confront it for us to grow production
1088661 in keeping with our pledge to resume pipeline attacks within the next 30 days
1088662 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
1088663 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
1088664 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
1088665 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
1088666 until very recently the perception among concacaf countries was that mexico has the best domestic league in the region
1088667 players in mls and american players in general want to show that we have the best league in concacaf that is why it is so important to the players that is why it is so important to the coaches and that is why its very important to the organization as well
1088668 as our league continues to get better and grow our players get better and we want to be the best in order to get there we have to regularly beat the best club teams from mexico which we havent consistently done
1088669 this year we have done that and are one of the teams in the final
1088670 im very thrilled and happy for our guys that there are two mls teams playing for the superliga final
1088671 this is our first time in this competition and its the first time weve gone into a final of an international competition its an honor for the team
1088672 to be in a position to win this superliga tournament is huge and there is no question that its important to the organization there is a prestige that goes along with it pachuca won last year and it carried over not only in superliga but also to the concacaf champions league and all the other competitions that they were involved with
1088673 we want to be one of the premier if not the premier organizations in all of concacaf
1088674 we want to earn respect not only in the region but also around the world and i think this is the first way to do it

1088681 do you receive funding from george soros or any other liberal donors or interest groups
1088682 no weve never received any funding from anyone not that we wouldnt like to get a big fat check for what we do here but its never happened
1088683 sure well ask our bank for copies of all the huge checks that we never received and well get those over to you right away
1088684 no that was a joke how would we get copies of checks that dont exist
1088685 so basically youre saying that you cant prove that you dont receive funding from progressive donors and interest groups
1088686 uh yes thats exactly what were saying we cant produce a paper trail for something that doesnt exist when we balance our checkbook we try not to include
1088687 so how do you respond to charges that you are funded by liberal interest groups
1088688 we always respond in the same manner we have never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever received funding from a liberal interest group a conservative interest group a communist think tank the girl scouts the shriners or the lupus foundation
1088689 do you actually have any tangible reason to believe that colorado pols has massive piles of cash from wealthy donors or are you just repeating what somebody told you in a bar
1088690 well you have an ad for colorado media matters on your website
1088691 but colorado media matters is funded by george soros and liberal interest groups
1088692 how does media matters funding have anything to do with colorado pols
1088693 well colorado media matters is funded by liberal interest groups and if they advertise on colorado pols then it seems pretty obvious that your website is also funded by liberal interest groups
1088694 are you serious youre really grasping here dont you think
1088695 we used to have an ad for a lasik clinic does that mean that the doctor who owns the clinic is also a funder of colorado pols

1088726 the discovery of liquid water on mars combined with earlier discoveries of organic substances in a meteorite that came from mars and also of methane in the martian atmosphere all point to the existence of life contemporary life on the
1088727 i am not speaking of fossilized life but contemporary life
1088728 our research proposes that the two sisters earth and venus may be biologically interconnected as well
1088729 even as early as 1976 when the two nasa space probes viking 1 and viking 2 landed on mars experiments carried out in situ pointed strongly to the existence of active microbial life in one experiment nutrient broth was poured onto a sample of martian soil and it frothed up so vigorously exuding carbon dioxide that a positive detection of life might have been inferred but when the nasa scientists looked for organic material the detritus of living organisms around the landing site their experiments yielded negative or ambiguous results so nasa cautiously concluded no organics means no life detected but 32 years on my friend gil levin who was principal investigator on this project maintains that life on mars was indeed detected in 1976 the experiments of 1976 to detect the dead bodies and decomposition products of bacteria were simply not sensitive enough
1088730 so why the reluctance to admit unequivocally the presence of contemporary life on mars i think there could be political and sociological considerations at work firstly if life was already detected then there is no need to spend vast sums of money to continue the search secondly there is a lot of scientific interest nowadays in bringing back samples of martian soil to earth at the cost of 10s of billions of dollars and there is a lobby that says if microbes exist on mars we should not be doing this it could pose a biohazard planetary protection and consequent litigation lf infective organisms are brought back could constitute major concerns to the authorities
1088731 my thanks are also due to all sections of the media for the extensive coverage they gave to the preparations for the summit and its proceedings

1088749 the practical effect of the courts decision is to allow zuffa to continue its prosecution of claims against mr couture in the arbitration presently underway here in nevada without any regard to the flaccid claims of hdnet and its management
1088750 based upon evidence uncovered during the interrogation of mr couture during his deposition we have every confidence that mr couture will be held accountable for the serious and ongoing breaches of his contractual obligations to zuffa
1088751 i guess this is my opportunity to tell my side of things
1088752 there were several amazing concerts during that time but salt lake city sticks out in my mind
1088753 since 9 11 ive had a special connection with salt lake city
1088754 i dont think melvins earned the right to fight him yet i think spencer should be fighting somebody where hes got something to gain
1088755 melvins a dangerous kid but i dont think melvins a polished fighter at spencers level
1088756 last month alone 11 people under 17 years were arrested at the suva market police post including wheelbarrow loading boys
1088757 glue is classified as an inhalant and because of its effect it is classified a depressant and makes a person high
1088758 they also have hallucinations as it distorts the senses and the brain fails to process incoming information
1088759 the act will make glue a controlled substance so there are certain provision so some people like shoe makers will be allowed to buy it the legislation will vet who the substance is sold to and what will be required to have access to it
1088760 we counsel the students and we have formulated a powerpoint presentation which is done by police officers who are trained by the drug unit
1088761 we have yet to confirm these reports it is worrying because these are harmful implications and some kids are not aware of
1088762 we drill into the students that their parents work hard to send them to school and realistic checks often discourage students from glue sniffing
1088763 we first found out about his case when we went to visit some of the rural islands to meet cancer patients and we found josaia with his grandmother
1088764 we are thankful to project heaven who were able to relocate josaia during their trips to the island his grandmother had brought him to the project for his eye infection
1088765 he was released from hospital one week ago and since we do not have any hospice we were very glad when alumita cokanavula agreed to provide one bedroom in her house for josaia and his grandmother to stay in she said
1088766 josaia is like any other nine year old boy and when he is not in pain he will sing and talk to us the only time he is in pain is when his bandages are changed and his sores are cleaned and it is very heart wrenching to see him that way she said
1088767 many new zealanders see fiji as a coup country so i hope to change this perception through the pageant

1088773 o campeonato brasileiro uma das competi es mais dif ceis do mundo e dois fatores que me fazem acreditar nisso s o a s rie de jogos seguidos e o clima que varia muito
1088774 o rafael tem timo potencial nas finaliza es e no cabeceio mas um jogador r pido isso muito raro e faz dele um atacante de muito potencial ele tem tudo para se destacar ainda mais mas precisa ter os p s no ch o e trabalhar com afinco
1088775 ele me chamou aten o desde que eu cheguei ao figueirense mas ainda um menino e precisamos trat lo assim n o podemos exagerar nas cobran as ou nos elogios porque ainda um atleta em evolu o
1088776 espero ainda o aval do departamento m dico para saber a condi o do moradei para a partida temos treinado forte alguns fundamentos e o grupo est confiante para fazer um bom trabalho em casa
1088777 se quiser eu falo de nossa cultura e religi o mas sobre pol tica n o gosto de comentar
1088778 aqui o melhor local para estudar o cor o na china
1088779 por favor n o vamos conversar sobre pol tica terrorismo ou separatismo
1088780 nossa equipe sufocou o crb desde o in cio do jogo e criou in meras chances de gol com muito respeito ao brasiliense que tem atletas muito experientes se n s entrarmos em campo com o mesmo esp rito sem pensarmos em nos defender porque jogaremos fora de casa as chances de sairmos com um resultado positivo s o muito grandes
1088781 o brasiliense uma equipe muito boa e venceu a ponte preta em casa por exemplo eles passam por um momento ruim e precisam vencer jogos como perderam no s bado devem vir com tudo o que dificultar nosso trabalho

1088785 this is the first time for me to take part in such a contest and i want to encourage myself to succeed at it
1088786 i love to socialise and meet new people and the reason i joined the contest was to boost my confidence
1088787 i just finished my mid year exams and we know our rehearsals are coming up
1088788 at the moment due to the ncbbf proposal for an electoral reform we have been getting briefings from father david arms and need to look at preparation in a two fold way with the proposals and the existing system for our operations
1088789 the actions taken and the commitment expressed by the government to comply with icao requirements resolve its safety oversight deficiencies and secure flight safety
1088790 president koroma recognized the need for sierra leone to develop its aviation sector not only to facilitate trade and tourism but also meet the growing challenge posed by international terrorism drug trafficking
1088791 it is against this background that government took the bold step of creating his ministry as the vehicle through which we will be able to realize the twin aim of opening up the country for international trade and commerce and facilitate the development for our tourist industry said the minister
1088792 under our agreement with tate and lyle they would pay us the current sugar price of about 490 euro 1166 per tonne if the shipment reaches there before september 20
1088793 if the shipment reaches after september 20 then we will be paid under the new sugar prices that would be a further reduction of 9 1 per cent even though the new prices come into effect on october 1 tate and lyle had asked us to make sure the shipment received at least ten days before the deadline to remain entitled for the old sugar price
1088794 even though we will incur some costs for having the ship wait at the port for longer than expected the huge economic benefits that we will receive from this decision far outweighs the costs
1088795 when students study these vocational subjects their skills in the respective areas is improved and therefore when they go out in the labour market their employers do not have to spend more money on training them
1088796 the stigma with tvet is very much part of the colonial days and the old education system where curriculum was forced down on students and they were asked to cram lessons
1088797 we can see some degree of stability in the country now and hope there will be no external shocks in the near future so that we raise investor confidence
1088798 exports are not rising because of existing supply side bottlenecks almost all developing countries have a deficit balance in the trade account
1088799 however what they wish to have is exports growing at a rate faster than imports
1088800 only in this case will the deficit be sustainable the other approach is look at the overall current account balance which will include invisible trade as well such as tourism receipts
1088801 if we can grow our tourism sector rapidly then we dont have to worry too much if imports rise very high
1088802 the signal then would be that the rising tourism sector is raising demand for imported product so worsening trade balance may not be bad if we have rising receipts from invisible trade as during the same period
1088803 we have already warned them not to delay things or we will seek compensation for damages
1088804 after initial delays to their upgrading work we had given them a revised program
1088805 we are assessing the program on a weekly basis to ensure that they are on track and if they are not than we have something to be concerned about
1088806 as highlighted by lorrine tevi there were a lot of recommendations made
1088807 one of it was a need for a common name which the council has agreed to and that will be included in the draft charter to be taken to the people
1088808 after coffee break afternoon they will receive the state of the nation and economy report
1088809 tomorrow today they will discuss it but before they break today they will get a copy of the draft charter and that will be discussed today
1088810 if you look at all the recommendations that came through the national task teams we went through a process of getting people to say out of all of these recommendations what were the most important so we then grouped them by topics
1088811 there were a series of consultations that have been going on for some time where people in different focus were going through this like a multi voting exercise through a process where there was a broad base conversion on what are the 12 most important things the draft was written with that as a basis
1088812 those who were not involved in these retreats and focus groups who will be seeing it for the first time may have some comments to make so that will be discussed
1088813 the secretariat has to be prepared for whatever comes through and so by the end of tomorrow today it will remain a draft when it is taken to the people of fiji
1088814 we are finding our international customers are resisting any price increases due to the declining global economy
1088815 in addition to these recent increases the wages council have begun discussions on raising wages
1088816 as a human rights organisation we are deeply concerned that actions which almost cost this man his life is not being accorded proper attention by the law enforcement agency
1088817 there seems to be a general acceptability of such behaviour by the police themselves and we believe that they have a duty to uphold the law as that is what they have taken an oath to do
1088818 we believe that the lack of respect for law and order at a national level only leads to the breeding of this type of violence by our institutions and once we start to justify actions that do not uphold the rule of law we make way for a whole lot of other criminal activity by the state
1088819 it will employ in excess of 200 people these investments include the increase in capacity and product range for biscuit factory and also state of the art biscuit equipments and additional biscuit lines amongst other things
1088820 they were supposed to have been patrolling the streets that day but when one of them didnt show up for duty the other two decided to go and pick him up from his home at vuniika and on returning they had the accident
1088821 i cannot comment all i am doing is praying for my husband
1088822 we are working what more can we say if road works are not happening at a fast enough rate for the impatient public than it is not our fault
1088823 there are more machines to hire so we are awaiting word on the awarding of the tender for a supplementary contract which was advertised nationally but other than that all we can do it wait
1088824 we still have a balance of about 2m for our storm damage works but it is clear that we have upgraded about 90 percent of the total network
1088825 it is only a matter of time before an accident results in death because the roads are riddled with potholes especially the labasa seaqaqa highway
1088826 until the country has a representative government in place interim ministers of a military junta should not be attending any overseas engagements where representation of the country is required because they do not directly represent the people
1088827 a top civil servant should be dispatched to officiate on behalf of the government instead
1088828 however participating in these engagements when you know full well that you hold the position as a result of an act of treason and you do not represent the interest of the people of the country on whose behalf you are attending the engagement is for me questionable
1088829 he has no regard whatsoever for the welfare of the people of this country who have lost their jobs suffered pay cuts and are struggling
1088830 him having the audacity to do those six trips in the last seven months goes to show that the actions he took coup was to benefit himself he promoted his men and allowed himself to be paid leave for the last 30 years
1088831 negative emotions and tensions between the new eu immigrants and local communities
1088832 the complaint is to be resolved the paper has amended some online articles and removed others
1088833 the newspaper wishes to make clear that it wasnt in any way anti polish
1088834 we are pleased that the daily mail could see that some of the wording they had in their headlines was harmful and they have taken far more care
1088835 if you take the balance of articles published by us the polish migrant has not been identified as a hate figure and we have often and continuously drawn attention to the benefits britain has and does derive from the skills that immigrants bring us
1088836 we ran an in depth series the new britons by fiona barton which had a very balanced and fair assessment of the virtues of polish immigrants
1088837 the headline on a major feature by one of our top writers read poles apart hard working reliable honest meet the polish builders plumbers and decorators putting work shy britons to shame

1088850 a lot of people think about privacy but dont really care until something happens to them personally its like freedom you dont appreciate it until its gone
1088851 our data reveal a disturbingly high rate of exposure among 10 14 year olds nationally to extremely violent movies
1088852 in britain no adolescent would be admitted to these movies unless they were 18 the r rating in this country is clearly not preventing our young people from seeing them
1088853 we know so much about the harmful effects of exposure to violent media content but how much exposure children actually get has been largely ignored now were learning more about the large numbers of kids seeing this material and who they are
1088854 no expert in child development would advocate for subjecting children as young as 10 to this level of violence yet the study shows that such exposure is commonplace in this country
1088855 we should re think the current movie rating system which has been in place for 40 years and was designed when kids could only see movies in theaters ratings need to be more prominent on all movies whether they are seen in theaters or purchased in the store and we need clearer messages to parents pediatricians and child advocates should instruct parents to strictly abide by the movie age guidelines and to closely monitor movie viewing
1088856 today the utility industry views the meter as an end point of the electric distribution system

1088864 but through its inaction the state is rendering it impossible for local governments to deliver the public safety economic support and quality of life our residents and businesses expect
1088865 good riddance and dont let the door hit you on your way out
1088866 one of the biggest problems voters face in trying to control transportation policy is finding the right official to hold accountable throughout the nation there are always a large number of overlapping government transportation bodies at the local state and federal levels that spend transportation funds with so many actors in the arena it is next to impossible for voters to hold these public entities accountable for failures in northern virginia alone transportation bureaucracies include the national capital region transportation planning board the national park service the federal transit administration the federal highway administration the metropolitan washington airports authority the northern virginia transportation authority the northern virginia transportation commission the potomac and rappahannock transportation commission the virginia department of rail and public transportation and the washington metropolitan area transit authority talk about a need for less government
1088867 it just looks like to me that without referenda you just turn over control of transportation from state level boosters of highways for economic development to nova regional boosters of highways and transit for economic development

1088928 they had to use the jaws of life hydraulic cutters to extract him from the vehicle
1088929 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1088930 both occupants had some injuries to what extent i do not know
1088931 theres no indication that either alcohol or drugs were involved
1088932 when in the fresh mornings i go into my garden before anyone is awake i go for the time being into perfect happiness
1088933 if you have a garden and a library you have everything you need
1088934 he who owns a garden however small it be whose hands have planted in it flower or bush or tree he who watches patiently the growth from nurtured sod who thrills at newly opened bloom is very close to god
1088935 like a big mountain a small garden stimulates restores and delights us just as it poses challenges promotes mastery provides exercise and relieves monotony
1088936 though an old man i am but a young gardener
1088937 a garden is never so good as it will be next year
1088938 gardening is the art that uses flowers and plants as paint and the soil and sky as canvas
1088939 this university will be firm and punish people who do bad things
1088940 but we will not throw any student under the bus for instant restoration of our image or our reputation
1088941 i will not hang them in a public square i will not eliminate their participation at the university i will not take away their scholarships
1088942 last week he suggested we put air in our tires to save on gas my friends lets do that but do you think thats enough to break our dependence on middle eastern oil i dont think so
1088943 senator obama says that he wants energy independence but hes opposed to new drilling at home
1088944 yesterday he suggested we put air in our tires to save on gas my friends lets do that but do you think thats enough to break our dependence on middle eastern oil i dont think so so i believe that every energy source needs to be part of the solution we need to develop new alternative energies like wind solar tide biofuels but we also need to develop more existing energies like nuclear power and clean coal
1088945 there are things that you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
1088946 a tendency to see something work and try to reciprocate that with another artist thinking thats what makes success to me what makes success is letting people be truly who they are
1088947 there is an increasing capability of the iraqi security forces
1088948 they have grown tremendously even in the 11 months weve been here the capability of the iraqi security force has certainly contributed both the army and the police the sons of iraq are part of the security elements in the northern provinces and they have helped in some areas like hawijah samarra and some other places like that
1088949 are starting to get their act together and providing jobs for people
1088950 so there are good things going on across the board
1088951 and you also have to understand that the people of iraq are just tired of the fighting and it doesnt matter if youre sunni kurd shiia christian or syrians youre just sick of this unbelievably bad organization called al qaida which continues to do dastardly things throughout the northern areas and through the rest of the iraq so the people have stood up to these organizations as well
1088952 were starting to transition those elements into other organizations such as a civil service corps to help rebuild roads pipelines projects things like that
1088953 but were also seeing microgrants and microloans take charge and people actually getting normal work
1088954 the government is starting to work a little bit more
1088955 this fight were having right now is not over yet
1088956 theres still a lot of al qaida in our area they have all come to the northern provinces from baghdad and the west and we continue to have to drive them and pursue them so that they quit fighting give up or we kill or capture them
1088957 the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased
1088958 she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me
1088959 sixty five lakh trees will be planted on a single day on the independence day to preserve the environment it is planned that each farmer of the dairy cooperative would plant three trees
1088960 he was also too attached to his parents especially his mother and could not bear separation from his home this was another reason of his desperation to go back home
1088961 this inspired him to kill the children in his school so that it would also be closed and he will be able to go home
1088962 the accused boys teeth impressions were taken along with those of some other children and his impressions matched the one found on the body of the deceased child later on being interrogated he broke down and confessed to having killed both children
1088963 the idea of quitting cropped up during a 17 hour flight
1088964 so if i can do without smoking in flight i am sure i can do without it on land too
1088965 it was with great sadness that i learned of the major accident at the naina devi shrine which claimed so many innocent lives

1088967 i convey the uks as well as my own personal deep felt condolences to the family members of all those killed or injured in the tragedy
1088968 bjp is the king of stings it is on the receiving end of stings as the tehelka episode has shown its president receiving money bjp has full knowledge about corruption and dirty tricks
1088969 we totally reject with contempt the new allegation of the bjp as a desperate attempt of bad losers
1088970 how did the mps bypass the security cameras in parliament
1088971 if these mps smuggle money in parliament with the approval of its bjp leadership we feel that the security of parliament has been compromised by these mps
1088972 our officials are helping the search and rescue team with directions three helicopters have been deployed to track the missing chopper however due to low visibility in the area we could not make any headway
1088973 we have also alerted all the ground forces to look for the missing copter in the bordering areas of andhra and chhattisgarh principal secretary home n k aswal said

1088991 the us and its partners have invested 100 billion in the iss
1088992 so it does seem short sighted to not spend the 3 billion a year to maintain the shuttle
1088993 im copying a bunch of folks on this note because it concerns the nucleus of a strategic problem for us in going forward with the vse bottom line were going to have to answer the specific issues in this report were going to have to define the program of activity for iss that obtains from it the utility that it can provide we may not be able to fund that activity at present i consider that almost a fact on the ground but we can put in place the kind of peer reviewed science that we would do given the money and that we will do when we can afford it
1088994 q in retrospect was the shuttle program a mistake griffin my opinion is that it was q was the space station a mistake griffin i would not have built the space station we are now trying to change the path while doing as little damage as we can

1089024 this wasnt really a new position what im saying is that we cant drill our way out of the problem
1089025 its still being reported that we were talking about delaying some aspects of the constellation program to pay for our early education program
1089026 i mentioned this earlier i want to tell you that you know i know its still being reported that we were talking about delaying some aspects of the constellation program to pay for our early education program i told my staff were going to find an entirely different offset because weve got to make sure that the money thats going into nasa for basic research and development continues to go there that has been a top priority for us
1089027 the early education plan will be paid for by delaying the nasa constellation program for five years using purchase cards and the negotiating power of the government to reduce costs of standardized procurement auctioning surplus federal property and reducing the erroneous payments identified by the government accountability office and closing the ceo pay deductibility loophole the rest of the plan will be funded using a small portion of the savings associated with fighting the war in iraq
1089028 to pay for his education program obama would eliminate tax deductibility of ceo pay by corporations and delay nasas program to return to the moon and then journey to mars
1089029 houston is home to the johnson space center obama has said he wants to postpone nasas constellation program for five years should that happen the gap between the end of the shuttle program and flight testing of a new spacecraft would exceed 10 years years with no u s ability to fly humans in space would obama really force such a gap deterring americans from pursuing careers in space science and crippling the u s space program for a generation
1089030 how would barack obamas positions affect houston and its residents
1089031 i think the constellation project is a bold vision but we havent thought through all the steps to get there and what the funding sources are

1089040 e aconteceu depois disto que absal o fez aparelhar carros e cavalos e cinq enta homens que corressem adiante dele
1089041 tamb m absal o se levantou pela manh e parava a um lado do caminho da porta
1089042 ent o absal o lhe dizia olha os teus neg cios s o bons e retos por m n o tens quem te ou a da parte do rei
1089043 dizia mais absal o ah quem me dera ser juiz na terra para que viesse a mim todo o homem que tivesse demanda ou quest o para que lhe fizesse justi a
1089044 sucedia tamb m que quando algu m se chegava a ele para se inclinar diante dele ele estendia a sua m o e pegava dele e o beijava
1089045 e desta maneira fazia absal o a todo o israel que vinha ao rei para ju zo assim furtava absal o o cora o dos homens de israel

1089252 my compliments on a superb and extremely helpful web site to the best of my knowledge its only one of its kind that provides so much detailed information in one place for the clean air conscious traveler as a business editor for a florida daily newspaper i know quality of life and particularly air quality are critical factors for many high tech companies when they are scouting for locations to expand or start a new enterprise your site and links provide an outstanding portal into this expanding field of clean air consciousness keep up the excellent work

1089256 voting for democratic presidential hopeful sen barack obama would be tantamount to inviting unions in
1089257 this is a much broader issue that wal mart but i think the battle to engage wal mart and for them to examine their own corporate values and what their policies and approaches are to their workers and how they are going to be good corporate citizens i think is absolutely vital
1089258 if costco can do that it means wal mart can do it and if wal mart does it then what were going to see is other companies recognizing that they have some obligations not only to their shareholders but also to their stakeholders and thats workers and communities in which theyre located
1089259 wal mart whose first quarter profits in 2008 rose 6 9 to a total of 3 02 billion has not exactly shown the greatest of concern for its employees well being a veritable blizzard of lawsuits have been filed against the company regarding labor relations

1089308 addiction to oil is one of the most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced
1089309 you wont hear me say this too often but i couldnt agree more with the explanation that sen
1089310 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1089311 to do this we will invest 150 billion over the next decade and leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy that harnesses american energy and creates 5 million new american jobs
1089312 so there is a real choice in this election a choice about what kind of future we want for this country and this planet
1089313 misguided policies would result in higher energy costs to american families and businesses and increase dependence on foreign oil
1089314 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
1089315 we can either choose a new direction for our economy or we can keep doing what weve been doing

1089335 you learn how bo thinks schemes and studies and you appreciate his philosophy he demands excellence and effort and holds everyone accountable
1089336 bo wants his athletes to prepare themselves socially academically and then athletically
1089337 just like coach osborne bo made a point to say that without trust you dont have anything his top priority is to build trust among players parents and coaches
1089338 if the players think youre in it for you and not for them youre going to lose them
1089339 you have to love them up but at the same time you cant compromise what youre going to ask them to do the next four or five years its a fine line
1089340 hes promising that we will do things the right way and hes reaching out to every corner of this state i like the way hes inviting everyone back in to the program theyve supported so loyally for decades
1089341 we might lose several games this year but if we do it wont be from lack of effort
1089342 you could feel the confidence of the players and the coaches it was unreal it felt like 97 again you could see it in the way everyone carried himself
1089343 we got here before 7 90 minutes before registration just so we could see the weight room and the first thing we saw was bo stretching outside and getting ready to run
1089344 what we wanted to do was show them what we had to do to prepare and how prepared we have to be as teachers and how much we put into our planning so that we make sure we always put our players in the best position possible we took a simple thing in a compressed time frame to give them a taste of what our kids go through it wasnt even close to the scope of what those kids have to do but we got after them we wanted them to have the full 202 experience
1089345 we talked to people in there just like we do our players its the exact presentation we give our players in an overview setting and then we broke it up into small groups and had some people take a position
1089346 they got a flavor of exactly what we do with our players
1089347 they got to see the first installs of what well probably do with our players next week they kept saying boy when i played it wasnt anything like this you try to explain to them the teaching progression which allows you to get people up to speed as quickly as possible so i imagine there was some respect garnered for what players have to do to learn and get on the field
1089348 i was impressed when bo talked about kids making mistakes
1089349 when that happens coach pelinis first thoughts are i want to teach him not to make that mistake again its obvious to me that bos in coaching for all the right reasons hes not in it for the wins and the money hes in it to teach kids and help them become young men
1089350 theres never been a young man walk on the football field whos wanted to make a mistake
1089351 weve all seen it a million times a corner or safety gets beat deep and you know youre going to be on espn
1089352 everybody in the country sees it and that kid is emotionally drained ive seen a coach out on the hash and hes chewing him out now is that for the kid or is that for the coach
1089353 i had a kid jessie daniels who got beat in great coverage on a wheel route against notre dame in the sugar bowl two years ago
1089354 the kid from notre dame made a phenomenal catch jessie was a senior it was his last game at lsu he came off the field and needed to understand he didnt do anything wrong he went on and played a great game in a 41 14 lsu win
1089355 we want to teach them not only what to do but more importantly why if you play 70 plays in a game you have an enormous amount of decisions to make our job is to give them enough knowledge and teach them to make the right decision more often than not to do that you have to explain to them why theyre doing something
1089356 but if i take one of my ideas and a player cant execute it its not in its out
1089357 at the end of the day our job is to make sure there is no indecision out there
1089358 there is no way theres not enough time you couldnt orchestrate it
1089359 so when i design a work week for the players i design cards for what plays to run against what defenses if you play a number of different defenses the way we do youd do a great job of coaching that week if you show your team half of the plays theyre going to see the best thing is having the ability to go back to a concept thats why we try to keep it simple
1089360 theres a good lesson in there for all of us who experienced 202
1089361 we need to have the same perspective about 18 19 and 20 year old kids that coaches have like bo pointed out theres never been a young man who makes a mistake deliberately they carry the weight of the world on their shoulders there are 85 000 people in the stadium every saturday and lot more watching on tv and listening on radio who expect these kids to be gods the minute they step on the field
1089362 theyre kids who are trying to get better everyday just like the rest of us
1089363 theyre trying to become better football players and trying to become better men and bo and his entire staff certainly have them going in the right direction
1089364 you dont have to worry about these kids playing their hearts out for their coaches
1089365 they will thats what nebraskas always been about and this is what nebraska will be again what else do you expect when tom osbornes the ad and bo pelinis the head football coach
1089366 after spending the day here its beyond anything i could have expected
1089367 pelinis down to earth and i support him 200 percent he knows his stuff hes dedicated
1089368 im a longtime husker fan and i had real problems when we made the change from frank solich
1089369 i withdrew from the whole situation when nebraska chancellor harvey perlman came to the front and said okay were going to make a change i came back on board the minute he named coach osborne ad i think pelinis the real deal and osbornes the real deal i support this whole thing to the hilt i thought today was great stuff real stuff very meaningful and it just lights the fire for the support for these guys that i now want to give to the program
1089370 marsha and i dont have children but we like to help young people every way we can
1089371 weve decided to donate to the new academic center student life complex because we believe in what tom osborne is doing after today we can say we also believe in what bo pelini is doing
1089372 it was really fun to get to work with the coaches and have them teach us the same way they teach the team
1089373 we could actually see on the screen where we were supposed to go on offense where we were going to slide over to and where the holes were going to be it was great you got it you felt like you knew what you were supposed to do and where you were supposed to be
1089374 i bleed husker red and i cant even describe how much 202 psyched me up for this season
1089375 not that i understood every single thing that went on in there about the offense and the defense
1089376 i dont think bo pelini could be in coaching for any better reasons than he showed us today theres no doubt in my mind that hes going to get the best out of these kids and teach them lessons that are lessons for life
1089377 actually i want to go home and write a check to the athletic department after today i think im ready to do that
1089378 christian schools will have to decide teach from a christian worldview and eliminate your students ability to attend a uc school or teach from a secular worldview so that the kids can enter the uc school system
1089379 essentially whats happening is the uc has to pre approve courses taught in high school
1089380 its pretty shocking because in depositions uc reps made it clear whether it be english history or science the addition of a religious viewpoint makes it unacceptable
1089381 its very discriminating they dont rule against muslim or hindu or jewish themes or so forth only those with a definite christian theme
1089382 is not whether they have religious content but whether they provide a comprehensive view of the relevant subject matter
1089383 the publishers themselves acknowledge that the primary goal is to teach religious doctrine rather than the scholarship that is generally accepted in the relevant fields of study
1089384 the people who have prepared this book have tried consistently to put the word of god first and science second

1089437 we will present a detailed plan of how we foresee autonomy in tibet if the chinese side reacts positively one could propose specific preliminary steps for example a pilgrimage of the dalai lama to china
1089438 such a development could lead to a meeting between his holiness and the chinese president and provide decisive momentum
1089439 we are hearing that leading chinese military officers are calling for a detente on the tibet question
1089440 the most critical moment of the special period considerable adjustments were made leading to the reduction and merging of institutions as well as to the redistribution of the tasks previously entrusted to some of them however these changes were undertaken with the rush imposed by the necessity to quickly adapt to a radically different very hostile and extremely dangerous scenario

1089444 industries would fail banks would collapse government revenues would dry up universities would have to close health care even as limited as it now is for roughly 75 million americans would virtually cease in short something like what the south suffered at the end of the civil war would plague the country
1089445 even at todays price as you know 14 airlines have gone out of business while others are hovering on the brink of bankruptcy and most have curtailed service and laid off personnel
1089446 at double or triple todays price none could fly unless nationalized a whole range of other industries would be quickly drawn into the quicksand ironically war would push america into a form of socialist economy
1089447 so the lights are on late in washingtons federal reserve sec and treasury department trying to figure out how socialism your tax dollars and credits can once again bail out these big time gamblers with our money reckless self enriching capitalists get on your knees and thank the rescuing washington socialists for without them you would surely be in chains
1089448 bryant welch was born to write this vitally important and highly readable investigation of how a cadre of ethically challenged political operatives and their religious and journalistic allies have gradually distorted and disabled the minds of ordinary americans and have all but crippled the once extraordinary mind of america it is not too late for us to reclaim our identity but we will succeed only if we take to heart the lessons so lucidly laid bare by the remarkable work of this insightful psychologist and experienced political activist
1089449 the term gaslighting comes from the 1944 film in which a psychopathic husband coveting his wifes property tries to drive his dependent young bride insane by covertly manipulating her environment making her increasingly perplexed and uncertain
1089450 in the mental health profession gaslighting refers to a series of mind games that prey on our limited ability to tolerate much ambiguity or uncertainty about what is happening in our important areas of our lives it is a highly destructive form of psychological manipulation that undercuts trust in our sense of reality and results in confusion and perplexity if the victims of gaslighting do not come up with a resolution for the perplexity they will act in an increasingly primitive and irrational fashion this is what has been done to large segments of america

1089491 do you need to take it a few days before the irritability starts or would it be like taking an aspirin take it the same day when the symptoms first surface
1089492 this means that you can almost take an sri as needed for premenstrual dysphoria
1089493 you dont have to schedule two weeks every month you can wait until you experience your symptoms and start medication
1089494 there has certainly been a lot of critique about the way its taken something that is part of the normal hormonal changes involved in womens reproductive cycles and pathologizing them making them into a medical condition that needs drug treatment
1089495 its extra prescribing of an antidepressant for an inappropriate use to women of childbearing age
1089496 there are many different ways of experiencing menstruation and occasionally there might be an unusual set of symptoms but by and large i think its best to dispute the existence of a pms condition and certainly not prescribe an sri
1089497 these visits were likely accompanied by a drug recommendation in the form of a new prescription a drug sample being provided or a direction to the patient to continue taking a current medication
1089498 but you do get side effects nausea agitation difficulty sleeping you do see a bit of that
1089499 say stuff like im a jekyll and hyde you dont want to know me the week before my period i hide in my room im just like a raging tyrant my husband just looks at me wrong and i snap his head off
1089500 i think sometimes men are inclined to attribute to a womans cycling stuff that doesnt belong there
1089501 typically shell be sounding off about something thats wrong in the relationship or she wants him to do something more around the house and they can both say ah well its just that youre pms ing
1089502 and of course shes expressing it now during the premenstrual phase but shes feeling cross about it and wants it to change all the time the danger is if she only mentions it at a time when shes got premenstrual symptoms they can both dismiss it as not based in reality and not a valid complaint
1089503 we dump everything on a womans cycle anything that troubles a woman can be blamed on her being a reproductive animal
1089504 we found that the symptoms started to get better after four hours and we found significant results at bedtime the first day
1089505 i think were in very good shape on latency unlike what you saw from us a couple of years ago were in a good place
1089506 i see push to talk as just another part of our very broad product line
1089507 so this is one product we think we have some upside but again it is just one product
1089508 i know in general that theres a misconception that prepaid is only for those who dont talk a lot but if that was the case we wouldnt have 5 million customers
1089509 its really for anybody out there who wants unlimited talk
1089510 we certainly know that a lot of our customer base is profiled as those who are very budget conscious
1089511 by what we offer you can gauge who our customers are
1089512 when we came out we were one of the most compelling offers
1089513 we have no roaming charges no activation fees the whole package not everybody needs the data services and not everybody uses the web browsing we hope that people look at our offers holistically
1089514 theres always things that were looking at from that perspective
1089515 while i am always troubled by additional concentration in the wireless marketplace these divestitures will improve competition in the affected areas as compared to an unconditioned merger and i am glad we require them
1089516 the licenses won in our auction earlier this year will not even be available for use until february 2009 and it may be several years before it is ever used commercially by a majority of licensees
1089517 as i have explained in earlier statements we have already been cavalier in applying this altered spectrum screen to prior transactions and we ought not put the cart before the horse yet again in an effort to encourage still more consolidation in the wireless industry
1089518 youll see me make some strategic hires in areas where i dont have experience
1089519 what a great asset thank you for all your hard work and diligence
1089520 i like the fact that you show all races keep up the good work
1089521 in a medium that is usually muddled with lazy arguments and poor grammar your writing breaks through with a clarity that makes us all say
1089522 i read your site every day keeps me focused and honest
1089523 youre blog has inspired me to start my own thank you
1089524 wow great blog you have here keep up the good work
1089525 if youre looking for ethnic meat then youve come to the right place
1089526 i cant begin to describe how much i love your blog youre so fucking hillarious i could kiss you
1089527 i love your blog one of the few very few i will read all the way
1089528 our compliments for your blog we like it a lot
1089529 on the fast track toward modernization in its reform and opening up process
1089530 i said at the outset that i believe these games will be historic they are already a landmark event for the olympic movement
1089531 the mere fact that the olympic games are coming to china home to nearly 20 per cent of the worlds population is significant a billion television viewers are expected to watch live coverage of the opening ceremonies on friday
1089532 as far as the olympic games are concerned the ioc is confident the chinese authorities have done everything possible to ensure the security and safety of everyone at the games
1089533 i would say that the threat assessment outside of beijing would be higher than it is here
1089534 i think most of these security plans are in place already i mean i think in terms of an olympic city security is pretty good
1089535 i think you get concerned no matter where terrorism takes place but not to the sense of being brought to your knees
1089536 i mean even in munich as bad as it was you dont cancel the games you dont do what the terrorists precisely want you to do
1089537 i think the issue in kashgar has been around for many many years
1089538 so far i dont think security in beijing is an issue
1089539 we have already seen the courage and determination of the chinese people in another context
1089540 the world mourned the staggering loss of life from the earthquake in sichuan province and marvelled at the courageous response by the chinese people
1089541 23 yrs old i am a victim of identity theft i lost my car my house i am 182 000 in debt
1089542 its always frustrating to lose any player you think you are close to getting but we are not the only club its happened to
1089543 i think people think weve got a bad squad here
1089544 but weve got a good squad of players and weve added six new players some youth and some experience
1089545 there are only five teams in the championship that have not played in the premier league and we are one of them
1089546 and there are six clubs that are still getting parachute payments after coming down
1089547 we are trying to build to get out of it and the players have got to produce what they did near the end of last season
1089548 it will be a sad day when we move across the road but it will be a fantastic achievement for the football club with everything thats gone on
1089549 its no mean feat by this football club to actually deliver what i dont think a lot of fans thought was every going to happen
1089550 noveras technology will be indispensable for our carrier customers because it will simplify delivery of carrier class ethernet fibre to the premises services to their own customers
1089551 novera optics technology will help carriers deliver new services that carry voice video and broadband data from the network core to the end user at high speeds
1089552 due to conditions in the credit markets and changes in the companys retail strategy
1089553 the liquidity provided by these facilities will enable us to support our dealers and their retail customers

1089560 thank you for bestowing your acting award on me it is a further indication of the homage to the work of the actors studio and i am very honoured to receive it
1089561 what has happened with those images is obviously completely illegal and there are lawyers getting involved
1089562 its just such an upsetting situation and both jess and lisa deserve more support especially from their australian fans
1089563 from the whole situation with the pictures to lisas break up with dean i cant even imagine how they are coping with it all
1089564 sometimes theres someone you may be trying to become friends with or you may even be thinking about going out with the person but because of all that it can never get off the ground thats just a nuisance
1089565 i hate checks and i cant balance a checkbook well
1089566 even if japan has fallen into a recession the cabinet office would need at least a year or so to collect enough data to officially determine when the economy peaked
1089567 these are things that are very important to us and it means a lot to have conferences support some people say that young people are the future of the church but we are part of it and have lot to offer right now
1089568 in the long run we shape our lives and we shape ourselves the process never ends until we die and the choices we make are ultimately our own responsibility
1089569 i am delighted to be part of the new women in wealth brand particularly as my life mission is to inspire positive wealth acquisition and management in others wealth is one of those rare subjects that intrigues everyone to some degree most people want it but very few can define it exactly
1089570 whilst socio economic factors clearly contribute to an increased number of working successful women in the uk we shouldnt ignore the fact that in the future more and more young women will find the confidence and inspiration to start up and drive new businesses achieving business leader and kof status at every level
1089571 and for those who may question the relevance of a women only driven brand we are not alienating men far from it throughout whitney uks eight years of teaching experience here in the uk the managing director iain edwards and his enterprising team have simply recognised the different ways men and women communicate and learn away from the sexist debate or burning bras the women in wealth brand has evolved as a result of student demand designed to help women better define a wealth building strategy that can over time lead to financial freedom via property investment and other methods even if women have never owned a single piece of property before we will support students at every stage of the process

1089798 what senator mccain neglected to mention was that during those thirty years he was in washington for twenty six of them
1089799 and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil he voted against increased fuel efficiency standards and opposed legislation that included tax credits for more efficient cars he voted against renewable sources of energy against clean biofuels against solar power against wind power against an energy bill that while far from perfect represented the largest investment in renewable sources of energy in the history of this country so when senator mccain talks about the failure of politicians in washington to do anything about our energy crisis its important to remember that hes been a part of that failure

1089810 we will be able to use the first data set for the trajectory correction manoeuvre planned for mid august
1089811 for the first three weeks of the campaign however only the powerful eyes of osiris will actually be able to spot the asteroid which will look only like a dot in the sky
1089812 starting 11 days before closest approach as the distance with steins decreases the two rosetta navigation cameras will finally be able to see and track the asteroid too
1089813 we will already be able to use the first data set for the trajectory correction manoeuvre planned for mid august
1089814 as rosettas distance from steins decreases the precision of the measurements for steins orbit will increase even further allowing us the best possible trajectory corrections later on before closest approach especially in early september
1089815 but osiris will also take this opportunity to obtain light curves of steins light curves tell us how the asteroid brightness varies with time providing us with additional preparatory information about the asteroid such as better knowledge of its shape and rotation characteristics

1089917 doesnt want to see these cuts come from schools because schools are not the ones that got the credit card out and started charging up
1089918 it is an incredibly irresponsible piece of legislation and i dont believe that the democrats even have all their members willing to support it i hope to ultimately support the budget this year but not this budget
1089919 it will actually restore 2 4 billion to the budget for education
1089920 the school district has passed a budget because we had to but the state budget hasnt been passed so its kind of unnerving
1089921 weve made a commitment to public education and yet the state hasnt passed the budget to assure us that we can accomplish what we need to accomplish
1089922 we have schools that are already in session and they have no idea what the funding for the school year is going to be
1089923 the overwhelming majority of the people arent upset that theyre losing the badge
1089924 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
1089925 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
1089926 would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices

1089928 dire nature of the crisis and how it will affect some state employees
1089929 some people question whether it is good public policy to make these kinds of promises

1089932 as the fight against aids nears the end of its third decade we are still facing a huge shortfall in resources
1089933 the responses to hiv and aids require long term and sustained financing as more people go on treatment and live longer budgets will have to increase considerably over the next few decades in the most affected countries donors will have to provide the majority of the funding
1089934 we dare not let down our guard this is an unforgiving epidemic
1089935 we are going to be in this for the long haul
1089936 every day almost three times as many people become newly infected with hiv as those who start taking antiretroviral therapy
1089937 i think money has a lot to do with it
1089938 in my life i have never been afraid of anything

1089941 i dont believe that the doha round is yet a failure
1089942 i think there were difficulties and in that difficulty it was better to stop to reflect how to continue
1089943 i was very clear with bush that it is not possible that two countries as important as the united states and india which are negotiating a nuclear agreement cant find the conditions to make a deal on the issue of food because there is very little remaining differences between them
1089944 it seems practically impossible to conclude negotiations before the end of the year
1089945 the talks will not be able to resume until after the american elections
1089946 i am equally confident that the games will leave a great legacy for china
1089947 china is a nation in transition with a great future tremendous potential and some challenges i believe history will view the 2008 olympics as a significant milestone in chinas remarkable transformation
1089948 some of the changes are easy to see the birds nest the main stadium and the water cube the swimming complex are already architectural landmarks
1089949 long after the games end these and other olympic venues will encourage the youth of china to participate in sport spectators will be inspired to become athletes and athletes will be inspired to achieve their best in world class venues
1089950 the venues are just a small part of the construction legacy that will benefit china after the games
1089951 new airport terminals new roads and highways new parks and a host of other projects that were initiated or accelerated because of the games will improve the quality of life and contribute to chinas economic development over the long term
1089952 many of the infrastructure investments and other steps taken as a result of the olympics will help china deal with environmental challenges
1089953 chinas role as our olympic host has opened a window to the worlds most populous nation
1089954 we have already seen the courage and determination of the chinese people in another context
1089955 the world mourned the staggering loss of life from the earthquake in sichuan province and marveled at the courageous response by the chinese people
1089956 starting this weekend and over the next 16 days the world will have another reason to come together to share common emotions
1089957 all of us in the olympic family hope that the beijing games will help the healing process in china and deepen the worlds knowledge of this remarkable country
1089958 i said at the outset that i believe these games will be historic
1089959 they are already a landmark event for the olympic movement
1089960 the mere fact that the olympic games are coming to china home to nearly 20 percent of the worlds population is significant
1089961 a billion television viewers are expected to watch live coverage of the opening ceremony on friday
1089962 the beijing games will significantly advance our goals of universality and fair play in several ways
1089963 we will see a record number of participating national teams 205 and a record number of women athletes about 45 percent of all the competitors
1089964 an unprecedented effort against doping with more stringent testing then ever before and new steps to combat irregular betting including closer co operation with law enforcement
1089965 the changes that are occurring in china are a microcosm of the changes in the rest of the world
1089966 the olympic movement has overcome countless obstacles since pierre de coubertin founded the international olympic committee in 1894 and we will have to continue to keep the olympic dream alive for future generations
1089967 there are so many worries over the economy oil prices the banking industry yes theres a lot of concern
1089968 theres very little being done by those people less gift giving less parties
1089969 you know why greed people are more greedy they dont give instead of corporate gifts they do the opposite squeeze more and more from people while giving less and less
1089970 wall street is the source of the problem you see across the country it rose out of the financial sector which spread into the housing sector
1089971 the thing to keep in mind is that wall street is extraordinarily resilient it will come back the only question is when there will be extraordinary opportunities for some
