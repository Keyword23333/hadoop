2790000 q would obama tax my profits if i sell my home would he tax my ira would he tax my water
2790001 i think the most reasonable take is that obama is probably doing just fine
2790002 like you said that left us no choice but to intervene destroy the training camps and remove the taleban from power since it was fairly clearly that they were in cahoots with al qaeda
2790003 all of that schoolgirl frenzy is frightening because there is no place for logic or thought
2790004 not that i am denying the possibility of it being a great conspiracy either
2790005 you sound like the republican version of a yellow dog democrat you spout nothing but republican cant
2790006 for bin laddin to keep getting volunteers something has to be causing them to join what do you suppose it could be
2790007 perhaps you use the self promotional material of a candidate to make decisions about their policies i preefer not to
2790008 some of his stated policies my emphasis are potentially extremely destructive and foolish
2790009 in the islamic world by their standards people who are called moderates are indistinguishable from terrorists by ours
2790010 the mere presence of an iraq run by friendly to the us and containing us troops is anathema to iranian fundamentalism and its desires for the iraqi south and the holiest shrines of the shia imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2790011 it may be ifficult for you to understand iran and islamic facism is the nazi threat of this century
2790012 among the most disturbing political phenomena of our time is the emergence in the newly created state of israel of the freedom party herut a political party closely akin in its organization method political philosophy and social appeal to the nazi and fascist parties
2790013 hitlers legal power was based upon the enabling act which was passed quite legally by the reichstag and which allowed the fuehrer and his representatives in plain language to be what they wanted or in legal language to issue regulations having the force of law exactly the same type of act was passed by the knesset israelis parliament immediately after the 1967 conquest granting the israeli governor and his representatives the power of hitler which they use in hitlerian manner
2790014 but go ahead ed subscribe to the neville chamberlen nelson mandela jimmy carter theory of appeasement
2790015 jewish villages were built in the place of arab villages you do not even know the names of these arab villages and i do not blame you because geography books no longer exist not only do the books not exist the arab villages are not there either nahlal arose in the place of mahlul kibbutz gvat in the place of jibta kibbutz sarid in the place of huneifis and kefar yehushua in the place of tal al shuman there is not a single place built in this country that did not have a former arab population
2790016 we will have to face the reality that israel is neither innocent nor redemptive and that in its creation and expansion we as jews have caused what we historically have suffered a refugee population in diaspora
2790017 when we followers of the prophetic judaism returned to palestine the majority of jewish people preferred to learn from hitler rather than from us
2790018 imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2790019 you conviently forget israel won the land when they were attacked in 48 67
2790020 spirit the penniless population across the frontier by denying it employment both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly
2790021 between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal if the arabs are in this small country there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to neighboring countries all of them not one village not one tribe should be left
2790022 the police of the world as well as judge jury and executioner
2790023 i think a two by four will work just fine i just need to apply it a little less sparingly
2790024 question on my part as in israel and palistine i am ill informed is the current thinking in israel the same as in 1895 and 1940 respectfully
2790025 the zionist movement arose in late nineteenth century europe influenced by the nationalist ferment sweeping that continent zionism acquired its particular focus from the ancient jewish longing for the return to zion and received a strong impetus from the increasingly intolerable conditions facing the large jewish community in tsarist russia the movement also developed at the time of major european territorial acquisitions in asia and africa and benefited from the european powers competition for influence in the shrinking ottoman empire one result of this involvement with european expansionism however was that the leaders of the nascent nationalist movements in the middle east viewed zionism as an adjunct of european colonialism moreover zionist assertions of the contemporary relevance of the jews historical ties to palestine coupled with their land purchases and immigration alarmed the indigenous population of the ottoman districts that comprised palestine the jewish community yishuv rose from 6 percent of palestines population in 1880 to 10 percent by 1914 although the numbers were insignificant the settlers were outspoken enough to arouse the opposition of arab leaders and induce them to exert counter pressure on the ottoman regime to prohibit jewish immigration and land buying
2790026 an independent individual who does not go along with a group or party
2790027 how about compensation for jews kicked out all over the world
2790028 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
2790029 for mainstream american blacks the vast majority of churches have hebrew names
2790030 infered black muslim bho fit with this jew hatred or kinda love maybe here
2790031 the majority of black americans are unaware of the complexity of the meaning of israel to american jews but ironically afro zionists have as an intense an emotional identification with africa and with the third world as american jews have with israel doubly ironic this same intensity of identification with a motherland seems rooted in the mythologies common to both groups in this special sense in the spiritual sense implied by zion and diaspora and promised land maybe black americans are americas jews but given the isolation of black americans from any meaningful association with africa extensions of the mythology would be futile we have no distant homeland preparing an ingathering
2790032 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
2790033 considering the circumstances the best thing the palestinians could do is accept their fate and negotiate an agreement leading to the creation of a sovereign nation encompassing th gaza strip and west bank
2790034 why should any citizens be carrying guns and why one group but not the other are the arabs more of a threat to the jews than the jews are to the arabs
2790035 the real point as noticed here by one of americas most prominent one man bloggers is that the brits are actually leading the way in pointing out to the world that american faults are generally over reported and american strengths under reported
2790036 this article on zionism and its impact by ann m lesch
2790037 even if evidence does not link iraq directly to the attack any strategy aiming at the eradication of terrorism and its sponsors must include a determined effort to remove saddam hussein from power in iraq failure to undertake such an effort will constitute an early and perhaps decisive surrender in the war on international terrorism

2790041 there is no such thing as internatioal law or any law when it is applied selectively
2790042 suicide bombers who explode bombs in restraurnts shopping malls and wherever else they can kill non combatants in as large a number as possible
2790043 they were forced to strike no matter what the collateral damage to civilians was because their primary responsibiltiy was to protect their own civilians

2790046 the fact that so many of the hedgies are doing the same thing and indeed conceivably not infrequently are on either side of a trade combined with the heavy use of leverage and their hyperactive trading add up to a potentially explosive investment mix
2790047 could trigger a rapid liquidation the great unwind across many asset classes with unpleasant consequences for investment banks hedge fund investors and possibly a systemic impact for securities markets
2790048 that last paragraph by ma2 275 was snotty and uncalled for in my opinion
2790049 the only thing in the way is the difficulty of uniting so many different nations with different languages to a common purpose
2790050 if they show an increasing indifference to the value of palestinian lives even shooting innocent civilians deliberately and criminally it is to be expected not that it is excusable but it is understandable
2790051 it is to be expected not that it is excusable but it is understandable
2790052 personally i like the older appliances with electromagnetic controls better than the new ones with electronic controls they are easier to troubleshoot and repair
2790053 so what did you think of it i was lucky enough to get into the olympic stadium to watch the
2790054 the city watchdog the financial services authority has told the uks banks to make sure they are strong enough to
2790055 since june the uk top 40 has featured a hidden advertisement for chewing gum it turns out that chris browns
2790056 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2790057 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2790058 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2790059 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2790060 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2790061 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2790062 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2790063 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2790064 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2790065 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2790066 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2790067 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2790068 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2790069 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2790070 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2790071 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2790072 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2790073 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2790074 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2790075 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2790076 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2790077 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2790078 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2790079 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2790080 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2790081 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2790082 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2790083 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2790084 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2790085 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2790086 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2790087 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2790088 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2790089 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2790090 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2790091 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2790092 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2790093 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2790094 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2790095 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
2790096 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative

2790100 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2790101 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2790102 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2790103 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2790104 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2790105 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2790106 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2790107 there are circumstances in which a person experiences a sense of loss but does not have a socially recognized right role or capacity to grieve in these cases the grief is disenfranchised
2790108 has been fatally imbued with the idea that solitude is a particularly desirable and noble condition that solitude brings people closer to their innermost selves
2790109 give sorrow words the grief that does not speak whispers the heart and bids it break
2790110 tis all mens office to speak patience to those that wring under the load of sorrow but no mans virtue nor sufficiency to be so moral when he shall endure the like himself
2790111 measurements have confirmed that even a brisk ten minute walk can help to lift mood and dispel gloom for a few hours more vigorous and regular exercise produces bigger and longer lasting improvements in mood and vitality there is good evidence that exercise reduces anxiety and helps to cope with stress it even provides relief in some cases of mild depression

2790115 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2790116 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2790117 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2790118 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2790119 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2790120 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2790121 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2790122 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2790132 getting them back was like making a big deal without losing anybody
2790133 in the past id have said a lot of guys would be gone but with them signing hanley to a long term deal it shows theyre willing to make an effort but i dont know who else theyd do that with nothing is for certain nobody knows who if anybody will be gone

2790136 we knew six months ago the market was starting to ease in a lot of places so it is a confirmation of that anecdotal evidence
2790137 dated properties leaky homes and properties with overgrown sections are noticeably affected
2790138 the question has now changed from when will prices stop rising to when can we expect to see them stabilise
2790139 it has had a doubling in the past five years so it might sit quietly for five years and away well go again
2790140 were as confident as any team youve got to have a little bit of luck on your side but the guys have walked the course a couple of times they have a game plan
2790141 im going to have a go and try and keep up with the minute markers but its a question of feeling the horse
2790142 theres no point going flat out and having no horse at the end theres still big jumps near the finish
2790143 it might be shorter than four star events badminton and burghley but theres the same number of jumps
2790144 the fences arent as big but when you put them close together and add a bit of pace to it it makes life difficult

2790149 everything to calm down feelings and bring mauritanians closer together
2790150 i telephoned him mr abdallahi personally to explain to him the gravity of his decree and suggest he postpone it to avoid the worst
2790151 the solution to the problem rests solely with the mauritanians we are going to help them to reach an agreement
2790152 we want to prevent mauritania from falling into a vicious cycle where the crisis deepens and the international community is led to take measures that would be unfortunate for the lives and the future of the mauritanian people
2790153 joins other institutions in calling for the return of constitutional order

2790182 now youre just waiting for me to come by with the parachute
2790183 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2790184 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2790185 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2790186 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2790187 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2790188 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2790189 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2790190 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2790191 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2790192 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2790193 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud

2790199 thats evolution i thought evolution meant i couldnt love god anymore
2790200 the idea was that there are religious moderates out there who are driven over to the darkside because of strong atheistic rhetoric
2790201 how do you know it is because of religion how can you tell whether religion causes anti scientific attitudes or whether anti scientific attitudes cause people to turn to religion
2790202 i think that religion is only incompatible with science when you are talking about fundamentalist religions which take the bible literally
2790203 i get this wonderful feeling of peace as i gaze at the mountains stars sea ethical i believe in following jesus of nazareths mevlanas teachings ritual i love singing the old hymns lighting the menorah traditional i love the ancient texts for their connection with our ancestors social i see my friends at the church mosque synagogue
2790204 so why fight religion when a lot of people take religion to mean something innocuous
2790205 religions are the drivers behind these problems religions are the source of these problems even if those religions arent your religion does that make sense
2790206 asking us to only argue against religious faith incompletely to accommodate your religious faith because your religious faith is not anti evolution is sort of like asking us not be atheists or telling us to be closet atheists
2790207 when some people realize the fact claims of religion are unjustified they sometimes then feel lost mother theresas emotional turmoil struggling with her disbelief is a product of religious indoctrination the blame here belongs squarely with the religious beliefs that foster the emotional ethical dependency not with atheists arguing against the religious beliefs
2790208 you seem to think the problem is atheists arguing against the religious beliefs that people are emotionally ethically dependent on
2790209 encourage people to question the literal truth of the bible without telling them therefore there is no god and you have to give up your faith and eventually a lot of them will decide its all bogus i dont need this superstition in my life and isnt that what youre aiming for
2790210 the more reasonable and tolerant atheists are by which i dont mean waffling but firmly taking the attitude i respect you even though our opinions differ the more likely the secret non believers are to feel they can relax and drop the front theyre keeping up
2790211 your attitude that atheism should not be openly expressed or advocated
2790212 hoary puccoon wants to have it both ways he wants atheists to avoid antagonizing people by not arguing for atheism
2790213 i explained to a religious person not long ago why
2790214 he certainly argued that can be better to give people the tools to get themselves to conclude that there is no god such as knowledge of biblical errors rather than to press the conclusion itself there is a certain wisdom in this though sometime people just have to figure things out on their own
2790215 religionists are indoctrinated into their theism they dont figure out the god jesus holy ghost etc
2790216 the reality is the exact opposite it is only when atheists get out of the closet and argue directly and openly that the prejudice will be defeated
2790217 showing the bible as a book of ancient writings with no claim to inerrancy
2790218 um t tulo simb lico mas nos enche de orgulho
2790219 o segredo que um ajuda o outro nossa uni o que est fazendo a diferen a
2790220 a segunda parte ser mais rdua vai aparecer o desespero de alguns e outros vir o mais refor ados
2790221 a base do governo muito ampla e n o tira as caracter sticas dos partidos agora o pt molon e molon 13
2790222 die jungen spieler k nnen von uns noch einiges lernen wichtig ist dass wir spa haben und den haben wir derzeit auch
2790223 o mercosul e o sul obviamente al m de aprofundar as boas rela es com v rios pa ses do mundo
2790224 rumo a outras latitudes que at o momento foram descuidadas
2790225 n o vai haver dois resultados esta noite o resultado eleitoral depende da corte nacional eleitoral e das cortes departamentais
2790226 it cant scale i wont do ad far policy today
2790227 it cant scale ill think about zoning some other day
2790228 while ambrose has more tech knowledge than the average suit in his position his primary competencies seem to be negotiations coordination contracts and costs which all marries up nicely with linden lab making a push into corporate government and military sales and hiring additional staff to do just that
2790229 who wouldnt be concerned when google comes after their business as a kind of confident acknowledgment of a reality anyone in silicon valley faces but one that can even be talked about because the speaker really does think lively isnt a challenge
2790230 its a game our girls are into games lets get it
2790231 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2790232 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2790233 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2790234 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2790235 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2790236 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2790237 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2790238 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2790239 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2790240 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2790241 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2790242 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2790243 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2790244 its something akin to martial law in that particular area
2790245 it got to the point where somebody was going to get seriously hurt or killed if we didnt do something
2790246 in a way i like it because they shot up my house too
2790247 and in a way i dont like it because a few minutes ago i had to walk to the store and the police stopped me and asked me what i was doing and where i was going
2790248 first such curfews have never been allowed under the laws of the united states barring riot insurrection or natural disaster
2790249 not one case has ever allowed for the imposition of searches seizures and house arrest against innocent citizens because of the high crime rate in a particular city
2790250 notwithstanding the city code and curfew order the residents of helena west helenahave the right to sit under shade trees in their front yard to ride their bicycles along the streets protest this policy and drive around the city with the full protections of the first fourth and fourteenth amendments
2790251 i invite them to move in on second street and be up all nightwith people shooting at them
2790252 since this began its more quiet and peaceful around here
2790253 i think theyre doing a wonderful job prior to this the kids were dealing drugs right in the middle of the street stopping cars saying hey hey what you got
2790254 you couldnt walk down the streets your little kids couldnt either we were just that scared
2790255 youre not free and youre supposed to be free you cant go outside and walk the streets look the entire area is empty theres nobody out here
2790256 were grown and the mayors trying to give us a curfew
2790257 ronald scott the citys assistant police chief said police are using common sense whendealing with pedestrians in the lockdown area
2790258 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2790259 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2790260 georgian forces have temporarily left tskhinvali as part of a tactical manoeuvre they are in positions on the outskirts of tskhinvali
2790261 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2790262 we left our town because the situation there is worse than anything ive seen in 18 years of conflict houses are being hit by rockets and heavy artillery aircraft are bombing the roads
2790263 over 1 000 civilians have been killed as the result of an attack by georgia on the capital of its breakaway republic of south ossetia the north ossetian nationalities minister said friday according to the south ossetian information and press committee the number of fatalities is estimated according to preliminary information at over 1 000
2790264 incidentally just so that this point isnt lost in the deliberately confusing reportage
2790265 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2790266 a russian humanitarian convoy has come under fire panic is growing among the local population and the number of refugees is increasing there are reports of ethnic cleansing in some villages the situation is ripe for a humanitarian catastrophe
2790267 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2790268 this is a clear intrusion on another countrys territory we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight
2790269 the russian military presence in south ossetia complies with international law and is aimed at enforcing peace as it has been throughout history russia continues to guarantee peace and security in the caucasus the action by georgia contravenes russias mandate for peacekeeping and amounts to blatant aggression russian peacekeeping forces and unarmed women children and elderly have been the victims
2790270 georgias actions are criminal whereas russias actions are absolutely legitimate
2790271 georgian missile patrol boats today made two attempts to attack russian military ships the russian ships opened fire in response and as a result one of the georgian ships carrying out the attack was sunk
2790272 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2790273 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a cease fire and termination of hostilities
2790274 not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armor and increased attacks on tskhinvali
2790275 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on unprecedented scale
2790276 the conflict has caused civilian casualties and more are at risk
2790277 it is essential that humanitarian agencies be able to reach the affected and the displaced and that those trapped in conflict areas be granted passage to safer areas as soon as possible
2790278 the georgians have said that 2 400 people have fled into georgia proper but our representative there believes this figure is substantially higher

2790293 someone in japan heard it at a japanese record company and he said
2790294 justice minister rob nicholson is promising legislation before the end of the year to further toughen sentences for youths convicted of serious crimes
2790295 its part of the governments overall crime fighting strategy were absolutely committed to this its one of the focal points of this government
2790296 youth criminal justice act reforms are necessary to battle youth crime
2790297 right now people can commit crimes in anonymity the community deserves to know an offenders name it holds people accountable and shame is a deterrent
2790298 parents have a right to know if the person their child is hanging out with at school has been charged with a drug offence or a violent offence
2790299 not only is she accused of a horrible crime but the person who actually committed it was protected nobody will know who actually committed the crime
2790300 naming the offender goes a long way to providing some sense of justice for the victim
2790301 como n o possu mos simulador a nica maneira que tenho de aprender algo sobre o circuito assistindo v deos tenho um amigo que corre na f 3 e ele fez um v deo para que eu conhecesse um pouco da pista
2790302 today stopped firing in the south ossetian conflict zone and is ready to begin talks with russia on a ceasefire and cessation of hostilities
2790303 there are indications that exchanges of fire are continuing and the georgian forces have not been fully withdrawn from the conflict zone
2790304 lets show the continent and the world about the ways to hold elections
2790305 lets frustrate those who without any reason believe that these elections are doomed
2790306 we just got a call that he was taken from the scene vital signs absent
2790307 our windows blew everything blew out doors were blown open our door handles actually came off light fixtures had fallen we had glass all over our staircase
2790308 i thought it was an earthquake with the noise and the way my building shook
2790309 windows were flopping in and out like they were rubber stuff was falling from the ceiling like snow things were falling from the shelves a couple of us fell it was the most intense thing ive ever experienced
2790310 it was a very difficult fire to fight because of the heat and the amount of fire was spread over a very large area
2790311 when the initial explosion went off or one of the explosions went off it obviously spread fire all over the general area
2790312 we had an unknown number of tanks i had various reports of two or four tanks that had flames impinging on them that were venting and burning
2790313 we have that down to one large tanker of liquified petroleum gas and one of them that was burning and venting is no longer venting or venting only sporadically now
2790314 he was filling up his truck and he saw some either smoke or some type of gas and went to report that and left the area as he was leaving the area there was an explosion
2790315 its not venting at all and it may very well be empty as well so the situation is better than before
2790316 highway 401 remains closed across the top of the city there is 16 kilometres of 401 closed from highway 400 over to highway 404 and thats really the main part of toronto its the busiest part of the 401 which is the busiest highway in north america
2790317 traffic is being re routed but the alternate routes are quite busy but its going quite well considering the size of the closure
2790318 they can stay with us until we can determine whether they can return home or if they need to find other places of accommodation
2790319 were trying to get to all the residents in the area trying to get them out
2790320 its probably propane because its a propane facility but who knows it could be methane it could be anything
2790321 but they may have been away for the weekend they probably wouldnt have been there at that hour anyway
2790322 theres a possibility there were people in the building but nothing is confirmed
2790323 we wont know until the situation has calmed down until the fire is out we wont be able to get in there to investigate
2790324 other than this one individual we have not transported anyone else its people we have treated for minor cuts and bruises we have notified all the area hospitals so they are on standby they are aware that they could be having an influx of patients and many people will choose to go to the hospital on their own
2790325 my friend and i will be in thailand just after chistmas until mid january
2790326 i think right now im at a point where i dont think i can hurt it any further
2790327 obviously i have to try to be conservative at times im still going to go as hard as i can but i want to be here for the rest of the year
2790328 i wont be stealing any bases aside form that im good
2790329 i hit a few ground balls got on with a walk in my last at bat and was able to shuffle off and get to second
2790330 i didnt really have any balls in the outfield except for a ground ball
2790331 you dont really have control over where balls are hit and things like that so i think baserunning is a little more of a controlled environment
2790332 hopefully i just continue to go in the right direction and just continue to get stronger
2790333 if you erase the last couple of days theres been signs of guys swinging the bat really well
2790334 obviously were still not to the point where we need to be but things have changed drastically over the last few weeks
2790335 we wont be on this turf for what a week now
2790336 if he feels like he can go out and play centre field then hell do it i will certainly be the first one to tell him to be careful thats about all you can do is be careful or maybe dont play him
2790337 ascribing human emotions to something non human god in this case
2790338 lets not irritate the physicians or else theyre going to take their patients to another hospital
2790339 the number one issue in the errors that occur is bad communication
2790340 the scissors didnt cut to his liking he was trying to cut suture material he said they were dull he tossed them across the room one of the nurses had to dodge the scissors
2790341 these incidents happen because the or environment is so high stress
2790342 surgeons hold patients lives in their hands yet theyre dependent on equipment and people who are outside their control this incident was over a year ago and there has not been another incident with this physician
2790343 you have an industry in crisis where people are having to do much more with limited resources that combination can be a potent one
2790344 weve decided to do a five part mini series one big story that will run during one week
2790345 i wanted to make a really big noise about the show
2790346 torchwood really represents the essence of the channel its sexy action packed and a little bit subversive
2790347 so rumor has it that the bbc was unhappy and russell had to rush to write her out of series 3
2790348 personally id be very happy if they didnt add any more principle characters between jack ianto and gwen there are plenty of possible stories to tell for a season thats only having a five episode run
2790349 i am proud to say that i am a g double e k
2790350 i just learned how to speak like american kids because they made fun of my scottish accent and i didnt want to be bullied when im back in the u k with scottish people i actually go back to my scottish accent
2790351 im of the star wars generation i love science fiction star trek the next generation battlestar galactica love em
2790352 i love every morning getting up to go to work because that little boy inside of me jumps with excitement every time i know im going to fight an alien or shoot a rocket gun or be on a spaceship or be with the doctor or get onto the tardis
2790353 so every time im working on it im really really happy
2790354 i always describe it as in season 1 we were learning how to walk and in season 2 were running
2790355 he is a lot more comfortable with his immortality you learn about how the team around him became a part of torchwood and you also learn about his feelings and relationships with each of them which i think is really important
2790356 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
2790357 there are always hazardous materials just like in an automobile wreck or truck wreck
2790358 its the liquids that tend to be hazardous because they soak into the ground
2790359 we usually turn that back over to the owner of the land or the airline
2790360 tend to be harmful if someone is exposed to them or if they are absorbed into the crops
2790361 the longer it has to leach down they would have to dig a bit deeper but youre going to be talking about a small quantity of liquids
2790362 also the chemicals got spread over a large area so its not all that concentrated
2790363 go away and have a sexual intercourse into the anus
2790364 real bad joses an unbelievable guy his injury is not an easy one
2790365 if you have five dollars and chuck norris has five dollars chuck norris has more money than you
2790366 there is no ctrl button on chuck norriss computer chuck norris is always in control
2790367 there was a lot of talk of weddings and kate told everyone that her and jamie had made a deal to do it this year
2790368 she said keep december free then she said she had already thought of a venue
2790369 she said her hairdresser james brown had a farm in ireland and hed told her she could have it there
2790370 the prospect that the press might publish background stories about the jurors is not a legally sufficient reason to withhold the jurors names from the public
2790371 although such stories might make some jurors less willing to serve or more distracted from the case this is a necessary cost of the openness of the judicial process

2790376 russia appears to have targeted the ge domain for specific government websites and are pounding the georgian military networks but other websites in georgia in org net and other domains are still up sporadically
2790377 the caucasus network tbilisi key georgian commercial internet servers remain under sustained attack from thousands of compromised pcs aimed at
2790378 yep youre totally screwed i told you so things never work out well mr down on his luck optimist whos the bitch now huh huh huh welcome to the dark side we actually do have cookies but the ones that arent poisoned are burnt and have maggots in them well on the upside the likelihood of this getting worse is nil to none and even if it does get worse you have the personality to overcome it and if you dont have the personality to overcome it you can always kill yourself its the best way to prevent all your future problems plus it erases all your past mistakes sure everyone will call you a coward but you wont care youll be dead you can overcome this though and in like two weeks youll have a whole different set of problems to add onto to this one but those problems will be new problems theyll be bright and shiny and so much better than this one youll completely forget about this problem while you focus on your bright and shiny new problems and if you decide to kill yourself just know when youre burning in hell or texas that i told you so

2790431 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
2790432 this was a heinous attack by al qaida in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers

2790439 bob has turned a blind eye to drilling off american shores but this is one piece among many that needs to be on the table
2790440 that is not what tennesseans want in a senator and its not what will beat senator alexander in november
2790441 i say why not use drilling as a bargaining chip support a bill to allow responsible drilling off the coast of states that want to do so with a caveat the bill also must eliminate the tax subsidies currently going to the gas and oil industry lets see how serious the republicans are about finding solutions

2790456 2nd lt girdano spc mulvihill pfc badie and pvt garcias actions are an inspiration to us all and their names will forever be etched in the history of the big red one
2790457 there comes a time in our lives when we transition from childhood to adulthood and once we make that transition we are faced with two paths one path is a path in which freedom and security are provided by the blood sweat and tears of others the second is a world in which we make a stand and say follow me for i will protect you from those who mean you harm it takes a special person to choose the second path and most shy away lt girdano spc mulvihill pfc badie and pvt garcia not only accepted a challenge but they embraced it
2790458 these men without hesitation completed the most dangerous of missions their daily endeavours to save lives provided the blue spaders with freedom of movement through the most volatile province of afghanistan
2790459 i asked him how he felt about going to afghanistan and he said to me that even though he was a little nervous that he was ready and willing to go do his job wherever he was needed he also explained to me that his siblings were in the military and he was proud to be doing what he was doing
2790460 he showed genuine care and concern for those around him
2790461 you will be missed we will cherish the friendship you have put a special mark in our hearts all those who knew him will never forget him the platoon will never be the same without him
2790462 he was a very caring and loving son father and husband
2790463 he was the kind of person who knew how to brighten your bad day if you knew jair garcia like his close friends did you knew his pride and joy was his 9 year old son garcia instilled in his friends that when things go wrong you shouldnt go wrong with them he was an older guy who had a lot of wisdom about things and became a role model for many of us jair garcia is now in a place where the grass is greener and at rest he will be missed by many and missed by all

2790467 if anyone does not provide for his relatives and especially for his immediate family he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever
2790468 we took him out a little early the other night
2790469 he was getting stiffer and stiffer as the game progressed it was getting hard to get loose he was still throwing great
2790470 were trying to not have this thing get to the point where it did last year

2790476 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
2790477 they tried to resuscitate him two times one time he came back for about an hour then he went into cardiac arrest the second time
2790478 he told his wife non verbally that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out he motioned that he wanted it out
2790479 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from
2790480 he was critically ill when he was in the hospital
2790481 girl you better come on board this train because im going to be rich
2790482 not only was she his wife but she was his best friend shes going to miss him dearly
2790483 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2790484 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
2790485 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2790486 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
2790487 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2790488 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being when i use the word original i really mean it he was like no other person i knew he lived his life to the fullest even when we were on the set of oceans he had his own little apartment and he cooked and invited people to lunch every day and he had food that was for everybody he made very exotic things his conversations were always different than any conversations i had with anyone else they were very family oriented he talked about his wife and children with such love and its very hard to believe that hes not with us anymore
2790489 his passing is such a major loss to the acting and comedy communities bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all the time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2790490 bernies style of comedy was bold courageous and revolutionary i never knew anyone who loved to be funny as much as bernie he will most definitely be very missed
2790491 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally costarred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
2790492 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2790493 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2790494 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2790495 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2790496 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2790497 the streets of the georgian capital are plastered with posters of george w bush alongside his georgian protege george w bush avenue leads to tbilisi airport
2790498 attacks by seperatists claimed the lives of at least ten georgian soldiers
2790499 despite our call for peace and a unilateral ceasefire separatists continued the shelling of georgian villages
2790500 clearly there have been incidents on both sides but this is obviously a planned georgian operation a contingency plan they have had for some time to retake south ossetias capital tskhinvali
2790501 possibly the georgians calculated that with putin in beijing they could recapture the capital in two days and then defend it over the next two months
2790502 so after a couple of days of skirmishing along the unofficial border between his forces and those of the separatists the georgian leader launched a full blown invasion whose aim his government said was to restore constitutional order that is control by the central government in south ossetia plainly the offensive was a gamble because saakashvili should have had little doubt about moscows readiness to defend the separatists moreover nato officials had repeatedly warned the georgian government against launching any attempt to resolve the dispute through military means still he pressed forward

2790507 possibly the georgians calculated that with putin in beijing they could recapture the capital in two days and then defend it over the next two months

2790511 this is an issue that is complicated we should not rush to judgment without an understanding of the situation
2790512 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2790513 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2790514 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2790563 i think this is something that at least on a temporary basis we can look at using as a model for those hard core cases where colonias lack basic utilities
2790564 even now after his death i would say his handiwork is still there
2790565 by the time there is an official local action or state legislation is enacted the colonia will likely be completely sold
2790566 there are places out there that have meter loops theyre empty there are transformers within 15 feet of the house but they cant connect
2790567 the longest it takes in mexico for them to get basic services in new colonias is two years even on properties that the people have appropriated without paying for them
2790568 here where everything is done legally so much time passes
2790569 the intent was to stop the growth of the colonias and we tried to come up with quote unquote a compromise the problem is you still have some people i dont want to say in limbo but who are still caught in a difficult situation

2790577 for me really green energy would be much better than established types of energy for a simple reason
2790578 green energy is something that can be obtained naturally from natural resources
2790579 the u s government federal and state still see the colonias as a residual problem a dysfunctional problem rather than a development that requires much more positive thinking and creative thinking
2790580 that is can we make electricity efficient enough to be worth it for the residents down in the valley and at the same time provide a return on investment for someone who chooses to invest in these machines

2790626 ken hamlin is the pseudonym of a well known writer of hard cover and paperback books a graduate of dartmouth he saw extensive service with the marines during world war ii
2790627 after the war he worked as an investigator for a detective agency then spent three years as a copywriter with an advertising agency before joining the advertising department of warner brothers subsequently he left warners to become a full time writer

2790629 the invitation to write the first book came through my former representatives at the scott meredith agency
2790630 scott meredith explained to me that his ards estate wanted to continue the largo novels and would i have a go at the project since i was writing private eye stories and novels of my own
2790631 its possible that the agreement called for payment of royalties but of course in the old paperback days this was standard no laborer that i knew ever earned a dime beyond the advance
2790632 i expect the series ended because publishers were no longer interested and from my standpoint because i really wasnt interested in this kind of ghosting as a long term arrangement
2790633 other than that he seemed to be on the rise as a writer of private eye novels when he died
2790634 you expect me to stay in this air conditioned nightmare
2790635 started a series of his own and didnt have time to do any more buchanan books
2790636 the truth is as i know tom buchanan hes not quite so worthless as lew agry painted him and not nearly the man the del cuervo family would like to imagine buchanan is a bum hes a restless rootless drifter who knows a little bit about everybody elses business but not one damn thing about his own
2790637 the mens voices sounded all around buchanans head like so many droning flies and held about as much interest to him he was not geared for town life had no feeling for it and as he stood here now looking down into a half empty whiskey glass the big man was asking himself unhappily just what the hell kind of living he was meant for from the top of the mountains the lights down here had looked warm and inviting promising a night of companionship with other men but when fargo asked him what kind of good time did he have all he could answer was that he had killed a man hed never even seen before
2790638 buchanan hit him on the point of the jaw and the man went down soundlessly two others were attracted by the brief encounter and bore down on him diagonally buchanan bent over the fallen man and very deliberately lifted the 45 the gun in his hand began swinging in a slow arc exploding six times with a kind of staccato rhythm until it was empty he tossed it away from him negligently took another from the limp fingers of his nearest victim and started walking down the middle of trail street twenty one times he was fired at six times he answered and when there was nothing left in that gun he borrowed a third
2790639 we have left practically all of south ossetia as an expression of good will and our willingness to stop military confrontation
2790640 according to verified and reliable information at our disposal during the next few hours russian armed forces plan to launch an attack in the direction of the city of zugdidi
2790641 we are not taking any territory which would be laying outside of south ossetia we have not done that
2790642 and the second thing of course we are not targeting any civilians if there are civilian casualties which you cannot rule out this is of course deeply regrettable there is no fighting there have been some reports of bombings outside of territory of south ossetia and if there were some they were in the context of support of the peacemaking operation and because there is some georgian military activity which is supported from outside of south ossetia

2790691 one of the most noticeable consequences of climate change in the uk is the frequency of mild winters as a direct result of this aphids seeking new sources of food are appearing significantly earlier in the year and in significantly higher numbers
2790692 we have been studying the seasonal biology of aphids for a long time now and we know that populations can continue to grow over the winter and spring provided that conditions are warm enough
2790693 after a warm winter there are much larger numbers flying and they are hence detected much earlier this means there are more aphids flying in spring and early summer when crops are particularly vulnerable to damage
2790694 why should we sacrifice storm boy country so that big business can grow crops in the driest continent on earth
2790695 why have we abandoned our international obligations to the lower lakes so that managed investment schemes can fatten the wallets of well heeled city investors who couldnt find the coorong on a map
2790696 changing the nature of those wetlands from the point of nomination as is happening to the coorong and the lakes contravenes that piece of legislation

2790755 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2790756 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2790757 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2790758 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2790759 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2790760 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2790761 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2790762 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2790763 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2790764 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2790765 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2790766 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2790767 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway

2790787 i think i found my own little piece of heaven
2790788 berea is the kind of place where you quickly feel comfortable and part of the community
2790789 i love the fact that its such a progressive yet simple place
2790790 even though i once said i would never tell anyone about berea so it would remain relatively unspoiled i couldnt be so selfish i just had to share this wonderful place with others so they could enjoy it too
2790791 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2790792 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2790793 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2790794 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2790795 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2790796 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2790797 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities in balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2790798 was able to rest in a manner suitable to a minister of god
2790799 they did not need to resort to being vulgar and violent to alcohol and drugs
2790800 does not find rest in this way the heart does not feel joy nor find peace but ends up feeling more tired and sad than before
2790801 i referred to young people because they are often the most eager for life and new experiences and therefore also the most at risk
2790802 the human person is truly renewed only in a relationship with god

2790819 since our bodies are not of brass and our strength is not the strength of stone but instead we are weak and subject to corporal infirmities i implore you vehemently in the lord to refrain from the exceeding rigor of abstinence which i know you practice so that living and hoping in the lord you may offer him a reasonable service and a sacrifice seasoned with the salt of prudence

2790821 he who feeds the birds of the air and gives raiment and nourishment to the lilies of the field will not leave you in want of clothing or of food until he come himself to minister to you for eternity
2790822 i am yours since i have given my will to god it is no longer my own
2790823 does it please thee o god to deliver into the hands of these beasts the defenseless children whom i have nourished with thy love i beseech thee good lord protect these whom now i am not able to protect
2790824 god in his mercy so made issue with temptation that the besiegers melted away and their proud leader with them for all he had sworn an oath to take the city

2790828 go forth without fear christian soul for you have a good guide for your journey go forth without fear for he that created you has sanctified you has always protected you and loves you as a mother
2790829 we were walking in the jewish quarter and suddenly we saw this our first thought was that we were back in 1934
2790830 it seems no one here is making a big deal out of it the guard at the center said he hadnt seen a thing and that it must have happened during the night they dont have a clue who did it but i myself saw a gang of skinheads lurking nearby maybe it has something to do with them
2790831 i think that the fact that it happened on tisha bav is symbolic
2790832 they knew exactly when and where to do it in any case the community has no plans of taking it off so that everyone can see whats happening
2790833 according to my knowledge there is not much anti semitism here except for the annual nazi parade on march 16 but its coordinated with the police
2790834 words and symbols some of which have anti semitic meaning

2790837 narrative games are barely past the infant stage and critical commentary and analysis about them are even less developed
2790838 everyone is still trying to figure out who everyone else is and in this process communities form themselves we are on the ground floor of this effort to try to figure out how to talk intelligently about video games how to analyze them and develop a critical language to discuss them were not like other disciplines im not even sure i would call us a discipline yet because were all figuring this out together we dont even have the terms yet
2790839 part of our trepidation about what to call it is that there is already a field called game studies and some of us arent comfortable with where thats going or dont feel we quite fit in there
2790840 are you going to wiggle like that all night cause im going to lose my mind
2790841 i say i know this girl shes looking for this kind of a guy and then we look through our files and we say it looks like ive got a match
2790842 many years ago if it was a nice boy a nice girl a good home they looked nice done deal
2790843 now theres a lot of separation between boys and girls not like 30 years ago when we were just friendly now youre sort of not allowed to do that things are very separate so weve actually had to start becoming matchmakers putting couples together because its more official now lets put it that way
2790844 esistevano ormai reali prospettive per raggiungere rapidamente ad unuscita di crisi
2790845 ristabilimento della situazione che prevaleva anteriormente sul terreno che implica il ritiro delle forze russe e georgiane sulle loro posizioni precedenti con formule daccompagnamento internazionale
2790846 i received the report and will have to make a number of inquiries in order to ascertain whether israir imposed the right restrictions
2790847 we are treating this incident seriously as we do every air safety issue and we shall draw conclusions
2790848 whether it happened in the air or on the ground it should not have occurred
2790849 the hole was in an area that could sustain outside damage next to the door where the structure is stronger
2790850 heathers agent came back and asked if it was a firm offer and he let me know they were not going to take the offer it wasnt on letterhead
2790851 im up to my eyes in the heather business i dont think her people want anything to do with us
2790852 100 percent not true never got an offer and she would never even consider it
2790853 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
2790854 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
2790855 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
2790856 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
2790857 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health
2790858 theyre using them to drive from residence halls to class which is a two or three block commute
2790859 we thought how can we provide an incentive to get them out of that behavior
2790860 i think a big draw is the just the environmental aspect
2790861 and honestly i think that anything free when youre in college is good especially something like a bike that is worth something
2790862 ive had two bikes stolen so i stopped buying bikes because they kept stealing them

2790867 if you are not willing to risk there are no rewards
2790868 i am deeply sorry for the losses of lives in the accident
2790869 i want to thank the two fire fighters for what they had done for the society
2790870 were saddened by the passing away of our brave colleagues
2790871 smoke is everywhere and it was as dark as night
2790872 we would have to achieve a truce and we would have to deal with the same parties as before
2790873 stay there two years and destroy the hamas regime down to the last office and the last operative
2790874 you israel control another people against their will and the palestinian people when they compare the two will choose hamas and not those who talk
2790875 they were doing everything by the book they checked his pulse and blood pressure everything looked all right
2790876 i would say sean had something to do with teaching three quarters of the firemen in the area at one time or another
2790877 the fire service in general has suffered a great loss
2790878 we look on tv and see the russians bombing our country and we know what we have to do
2790879 in the near term their departure will have some impact as we adjust operations
2790880 theyve always wanted south ossetia and abkhazia another separatist region in georgia
2790881 our bilateral relations are strong and we enjoy one of the most complementary trade relationships in the world
2790882 my big dream is to have unity among the bolivian people
2790883 i am feeling good happy because this is going to let us accelerate even more our process for autonomy
2790884 win or lose evo seems to have settled in as the revered leader of half the country and the devil in disguise for the other half that presents a real problem for governing
2790885 i believe that the international community is not looking to destabilise mauritania
2790886 when it has all the information it will turn in a positive direction
2790887 are under house arrest for their security and the security of the country justice exists in mauritania and there is also a parliament which could be called on to judge them if necessary
2790888 everything to calm down feelings and bring mauritanians closer together
2790889 i telephoned him mr abdallahi personally to explain to him the gravity of his decree and suggest he postpone it to avoid the worst
2790890 the solution to the problem rests solely with the mauritanians we are going to help them to reach an agreement
2790891 we want to prevent mauritania from falling into a vicious cycle where the crisis deepens and the international community is led to take measures that would be unfortunate for the lives and the future of the mauritanian people
2790892 joins other institutions in calling for the return of constitutional order
2790893 i believe that the international community is not looking to destabilise mauritania
2790894 when it has all the information it will turn in a positive direction
2790895 we decided there was something we needed to do to counteract all of the negative influences that our youth are surrounded by
2790896 we invited children from the community to come out to be shown love and appreciation a party with a purpose
2790897 were giving out book bags for kids as theyve going back to school we just want residents to know whats available to them in the community
2790898 as you can see by all the kids it has grown phenomenally over the last three years
2790899 he was arrested again yesterday evening and was supposed to be kept in custody at the valelevu police station but it was full
2790900 he was then transferred to the nasinu police station in makoi where he escaped from one police officer
2790901 an overall concern of the chamber is that the authorization of public indebtedness of this sort will open a pandoras box we are facing a utilities crisis couldnt the issuance of additional bonds help solve that problem as well
2790902 is run by lobbyists that represent georgia and other countries
2790903 he takes huge amounts of money from oil companies that are profiting in the former soviet union and many parts of the world
2790904 this has been one of the failures of the bush administration failing to build a strong relationship a mutually beneficial relationship with russia so wed have the kind of influence to persuade them to stop some of these very very dangerous efforts within their territory
2790905 experience is only positive insofar as it creates good judgment
2790906 and i think senator obamas strong case to the american people is that he will have the right judgment about how to balance americas military force with strong diplomacy to protect our interests abroad
2790907 john mccains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government
2790908 mr scheunemann proudly represented a small democracy that is one of our closest allies in a very dangerous region
2790909 the reaction of the obama campaign to this crisis so at odds with our democratic allies and yet so bizarrely in sync with moscow doesnt merely raise questions about senator obamas judgment it answers them
2790910 theyre an example of senator mccains push to spread democracy in that part of the world as a very important advance of americas interest as well as being good for international stability
2790911 so instead of trying to detract from the central issue i wish senator obama had actually confronted the issue not trying to detract our attention by focusing on a mccain adviser
2790912 i believe what senator mccain is proposing is totally totally wrong
2790913 is run by lobbyists that represent georgia and other countries

2790917 als hij valt en hij breekt in twee dan zouden we terug een andere moeten gaan halen de leuvenaars zeggen dat ze onze boom hebben afgepakt maar dat is onnozel want we hebben er drie of vier bomen
2790918 maar dat is niet genoeg hij moet ook op regelmatige hoogte verschillende takken hebben want als hij geplant is moet iemand in die boom kruipen om er een belgische vlag te hangen
2790919 the original vision at the heart of shared worlds has always been the desire to provide a place where oddball kids like me could get together and play with ideas

2790922 for the language that said im guessing he wants to see her suck on things because she doesnt give head just a thought
2790923 is that like reading the book great expectations and being let down
2790924 rules are us trying to control our lives and making rules is a response to feeling not in control
2790925 just walked in and hes wearing cargo shorts and sandals without socks so im hoping he has someone join him
2790926 when i first talked to the bravo people about it they were nervous and they said this is a comedy show and were afraid its going to be depressing and i said you know youre wrong after going to afghanistan and iraq what it really is is a story of how people use humor to get through an incredibly difficult time in their life as well as out and out trauma
2790927 it was the toughest show id ever done bravo said we kind of want to edit it so you have this triumphant show at the end
2790928 if the objectives of metaphysics are spurious then they cannot be fulfilled by science any more than they can be by metaphysics

2790931 the political calculus is edwards hopes that his admission of having an affair will allow the incident to blow over allowing him to proceed with his political career
2790932 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly but that misconduct took place for a short period in 2006 it ended then
2790933 being in love with a still somewhat dysfunctional married man
2790934 in the context of admitting to an affair it may seem innocent for edwards to have misled abc about the starting point but the precise date is important over the course of nine months edwards would spend more than 114 000 of the one america committees budget on hunters films whether he did that in an effort to have hunter around or as a legitimate documentary project would likely make a difference to those who thought they were contributing to a poverty eradication effort
2790935 which political candidate enjoys visiting new york because he has a girlfriend who lives downtown the pol tells her hell marry her when his current wife is out of the picture
2790936 top democrats have been assiduously following the edwards scandal and dont believe his denial which was issued last year before he was caught visiting rielle hunter in a beverly hills hotel
2790937 i have given a complete interview on this matter and having done so will have nothing more to say
2790938 fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want

2790973 different chinese philosophers writing probably in 5 4 centuries b c presented some major ideas and a way of life that are nowadays known under the name of taoism the way of correspondence between man and the tendency or the course of natural world
2790974 we believe in the formless and eternal tao and we recognize all personified deities as being mere human constructs we reject hatred intolerance and unnecessary violence and embrace harmony love and learning as we are taught by nature we place our trust and our lives in the tao that we may live in peace and balance with the universe both in this mortal life and beyond

2790994 but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
2790995 theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption
2790996 efficiency experts say that keeping tires inflated can improve gas mileage 3 percent and regular maintenance can add another 4 percent many drivers already follow their advice but if everyone did we could immediately reduce demand several percentage points in other words obama is right

2791003 piero ciampi scrive le sue canzoni sulle tovaglie di carta alcune ne sono sicuro si perdono insieme alle molliche e ai cerchi rossi lasciati dal bicchiere altre invece quelle che si salvano te le racconta a tavola o quando ti capita di dargli un passaggio altre ancora infine le registra su disco e queste non sono necessariamente le migliori n lo rappresentano meglio di quanto non faccia un suo gesto o una sua risata eppure bastano questi frammenti cos ingenerosi questa scelta arbitraria e capricciosa questi graffi di vita a restituirci piero ciampi intero e solitario nella sua voglia di essere e nella sua capacit di parlare nella noiosa foresta della gente muta le sue canzoni sono i sassolini che ci portano alla spianata da cui con un po di fortuna si pu vedere un pezzetto di luna e facile sbarazzarsi di piero ciampi dandogli del poeta ma non vero ciampi non ha tempo per questo troppo occupato a vivere
2791004 dunque molto tempo fa io ho conosciuto una persona molto speciale un uomo meraviglioso lui era un poeta e si bevuto tutta la vita se l bevuta tutta e poi se n tornato nel suo pianeta io canto le sue storie le parole che lui ha scritto per me il suo nome piero ciampi
2791005 io sono il pi grande perch mi posso permettere di prendere 300 000 lire a sera e mandare un altro a cantare al mio posto

2791008 the bowlers still havent really been where we know they can be and it will be a good time tomorrow to hit their straps
2791009 if we can pick up a couple of early ones i dont see why we cant push through
2791010 it was a pretty good wicket to bat on today
2791011 the ovals a quick scoring ground and if we get our heads down and bat well 197 is something we should certainly knock off its been a good week for kev so far and weve got the chance to make it a very good week for him
2791012 i just tried to keep scoring because we had andre nel at the other end who is a real tailender
2791013 pulling the team out of trouble is all i want to do this 97 is as good as 150 for me today im very happy to have given the boys a chance to pull through
2791014 the restrictions inhibit the plaintiffs ability to engage in some forms of expressive conduct but the plaintiffs have a wide variety of alternative means of expression that will allow them to effectively communicate their messages
2791015 on every question of construction let us carry ourselves back to the time when the constitution was adopted recollect the spirit manifested in the debates and instead of trying what meaning may be squeezed out of the text or invented against it conform to the probable one in which it was passed
2791016 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
2791017 pervez has insulted and compromised pakistans sovereignty by allowing the cia and fbi to operate freely in pakistan and arrest interrogate torture deport and detain any person whether pakistani or not for as long as they like thus turning the pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade

2791021 it was just nice to have both sides of the ball operating efficiently to start the game
2791022 you can say something was wrong with him but he hasnt missed a beat this year
2791023 i think this year we will be able to see for certain what deangelo williams can do
2791024 coach fox and general manager marty hurney did a great job of bringing in guys who are big we talked about beefing up the offensive line
2791025 the offensive line did a great job in protection the quarterback went through his progressions and i was wide open
2791026 i just made the play it felt great but were still trying to get better
2791027 fuck placetownville united again thats it im going to fucking ban them this time
2791028 there are critics though and i am one of them that think perhaps investors are not quite getting what they expect for a start the holdings in the index funds are market capitalisation weighted this sounds sensible of course except when you consider just how much the biggest companies dominate the portfolio the top one hundred stocks in america representing just 3 of the number of stocks in the index funds actually account for over 60 of the funds invested in vanguards fund
2791029 when you get down to the genuinely small capitalisation stocks there is actually very little money invested in each stock which is why it probably isnt surprising that over long periods of time the wilshire 5000 index performs pretty much the same as the big capitalisation growth stock dominated s amp p500 index
2791030 the art of creating a good portfolio is not about owning everything in market weighted proportions as the total market index does but in having significant exposure to every asset class and rebalancing the portfolio at an appropriate frequency
2791031 so if you want to take advantage of the rebalancing effect you are going to need to have a much larger small cap value exposure in your portfolio than just a couple of percent
2791032 while s amp p 500 index and total market funds make for effective pieces on an investment pie they should only be slices not the whole pie they just dont provide sufficient diversification as stand alone vehicles
2791033 the notion that compared with their large and mid cap counterparts small cap active equity managers are more likely to outperform their market segment
2791034 you need faith for the reasons its so hard to find
2791035 its hell to believe there aint a hell of a chance
2791036 bigots at them hardly does it for me i think there are severe ethical problems with an argument only based upon womens rights that does also not recognise the fact that a soon to be born child is effectively the same as an already born child
2791037 the rise in pending home sales was broad based with all four regions showing gains this is welcome news because a rise in contract activity is necessary for an overall housing recovery with a tax credit now available to first time home buyers increases in home sales could be sustained with the momentum carrying into 2009
2791038 we conclude that declines in house prices are highly likely to remain small our analysis reveals unsurprisingly that foreclosures and home prices have negative effects on each other over time but this does not imply a vicious cycle of collapsing prices our models predict that as foreclosures continue to climb in many states house prices will remain flat or decline in those states but will not collapse
2791039 california led the u s into the worst housing recession since the 1930s now the most populous state may be the first to find the bottom

2791042 two years ago i had decided to add a ccf fund pcrix to my asset allocation but i was not able to add it then with required minimum without affecting the overall desired allocation in the portfolio
2791043 1 you have waited two years whats the hurry wait another year and go without the insurance really ccf being so high now its likely not providing much insurance anyway
2791044 by singing in harmony from the same page of the same investing hymnal the diehards drown out market noise
2791045 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
2791046 i strongly believe that the answers to the current problems facing cuban society which has as an average a twelfth grade of education almost a million university graduates and a real possibility for all its citizens to become educated without their being in any way discriminated against require more variables for each concrete problem than those contained in a chess game
2791047 my elemental duty is not to cling to positions much less to stand in the way of younger persons but rather to contribute my own experience and ideas whose modest value comes from the exceptional era that i had the privilege of living in
2791048 like niemeyer i believe that one has to be consistent right up to the end
2791049 i am a firm supporter of the united vote a principle that preserves the unknown merits which allowed us to avoid the tendency to copy what came to us from countries of the former socialist bloc including the portrait of the one candidate as singular as his solidarity towards cuba i deeply respect that first attempt at building socialism thanks to which we were able to continue along the path we had chosen
2791050 i never forget that all of the worlds glory fits in a kernel of corn
2791051 darling belinda i know i only saw you last night and will see you again in a few days but there is something i wanted to put in writing i want to tell you how much i love and admire you
2791052 belinda that is a great dog he spent part of the winter with me
2791053 belinda i dont know what you were talking about goofy wolfed his supper as soon as i arrived and has dragged me round the entire neighbourhood
2791054 im afraid i was misled in my first diagnosis because goofy is trying to pretend hes all right in order to come home to you its bravado he is much sicker than i originally thought you asked if it was time i think now or in the next few days it is
2791055 dont push me ill pull you instead and if you push too hard ill pull away

2791057 it was the first score in our olympic campaign here at home and ill always remember it it represents that we can keep our heads up in the face of really tough odds
2791058 yao played a great game we were just trying to wear him down a little bit
2791059 he did a great job defensively at the beginning of the game eventually we wore down on him
2791060 for yao ming it was really a historical match so its really very significant for all of us
2791061 it would have been different without him not as special
2791062 this is a gently paced elegantly composed book and it will bring its readers much pleasure maor has written an excellent book that should be in every public and school library
2791063 maor wonderfully tells the story of ie n the chronological history allows excursions into the lives of people involved with the development of this fascinating number maor hangs his story on a string of people stretching from archimedes to david hilbert and by presenting mathematics in terms of the humans who produced it he places the subject where it belongs squarely in the centre of the humanities
2791064 maor has succeeded in writing a short readable mathematical story he has interspersed a variety of anecdotes excursions and essays to lighten the flow the book is like the voyages of columbus as told by the first mate
2791065 the imaginary part of each of the complex numbers is always 0 5
2791066 overall i feel like we obviously didnt play well as a team
2791067 i was disappointed that some of them nonstarters didnt do better
2791068 weve been having a good training camp were excited to come out and play with the confidence weve had so far we have so many veterans when we step on the field we feel confident we should score
2791069 making it worse at least for this particular die hard fan of pantera was the uninspired tributes to dimebag darrell shot on stage during a concert in 2004 darrell has become a martyr for metal as the universally loved and unbelievably talented guitarist was taken way before his time his tributes however were disappointing other than a standout performance by the cavalera conspiracy as well as some great footage of dimebag scrolled over the big screens the attempt was not a good one an acoustic performance of pink floyd s wish you were here that sounded slightly out of tune was the topper
2791070 i either have to destroy it or wall it off

2791077 its the start of something that can be great weve been waiting for years for this moment
2791078 i dont know how many people were watching the game but it was an honor to play in it
2791079 we were all excited and anxious this game was over the top
2791080 but we have a saying back home that when youre good you play for the name on the front of your jersey instead of the name on the back our guys all play for the name on the front of their jersey
2791081 its close but not exactly what we want so well keep looking
2791082 they were always the hometown airline they were in the downtown parades they invested in the community
2791083 we have a number of businesses that depend on good air service
2791084 its going to be much harder for us to convince a high tech company that they should come here it hurts
2791085 we have a few airports out there that i think are spending more than they should quite frankly and so there are some real total airport cost increases that we are very vocal about
2791086 the more you raise fees the more you drive airlines and customers away
2791087 its rhetoric ive heard for 41 years but i understand
2791088 these folks arent sure if theyre going to be in business in six months

2791092 la importancia del tiempo no es tanto la medici n en meses sino el tiempo que el esp ritu necesitaba para darse cuenta de una cantidad de cosas de la vida por ejemplo el tiempo que necesitaba para reconocerse inmortal en un cuerpo mortal y superar el concepto de la muerte
2791093 la m dula de la exposici n son los laberintos unos s mbolos universales espacios creados por el hombre dise ados para perderse

2791095 se pierde la sensaci n del tiempo las relaciones con el mundo y con los dem s y hay un tiempo de encuentro con la divinidad
2791096 as a matter of psychology i think most of us value investors think we have plenty enough bargains already and may not be able to handle that many more
2791097 until the values can be defined i think youre somewhat taking your life into your hands
2791098 a lot of value investors went into financials in the spring and theyre now getting killed
2791099 a small portion of our losses will not be recovered we underestimated the speed and severity of credit deterioration and overestimated some companies ability to cope with credit and liquidity problems
2791100 treat it with profound disrespect and heinous cracker abuse all photographed and presented here on the web
2791101 it is hard to think of anything more vile than to intentionally desecrate the body of christ
2791102 um i can think of a couple how about catholic priests intentionally violating trusting young children for one
2791103 in an era of celebrity worship instant gratification and express delivery the arrival of a new player is often accompanied by the nearly simultaneous appearance of his jersey on the racks of sporting goods stores and the backs of local fans
2791104 aside from market conditions which did not offer barcelona a clear opportunity to sing one of the few strikers with the capacity to compete with etoo his performance in the pre season cannot be underestimated
2791105 ive never felt ive been valued by anyone im just a waste of space that everyone ignores like a ghost without a home
2791106 ive never felt ive been valued by anyone im just a waste of space that everyone ignores like a ghost without a home
2791107 a hundred million years and things havent changed a bit
2791108 darn its moving too fast for me to catch it
2791109 ive never felt ive been valued by anyone im just a waste of space that everyone ignores like a ghost without a home
2791110 we gonna fight we gon fight fight for our rights
2791111 god kissed her on the cheek and there she was
2791112 we gonna fight we gon fight fight for our rights
2791113 uh uh hold on a minute i just want to listen to this
2791114 then he is a sadist he certainly does odd things and he is a lousy engineer
2791115 my response is that when creationists talk about god creating every individual species as a separate act they always instance hummingbirds or orchids sunflowers and beautiful things but i tend to think instead of a parasitic worm that is boring through the eye of a boy sitting on the bank of a river in west africa a worm thats going to make him blind and i ask them are you telling me that the god you believe in who you also say is an all merciful god who cares for each one of us individually are you saying that god created this worm that can live in no other way than in an innocent childs eyeball because that doesnt seem to me to coincide with a god whos full of mercy
2791116 well i believe that there was an angel that fell from grace or some such twaddle and he is responsible for things like this
2791117 we dont teach alchemy along with chemistry we dont teach witchcraft along with medicine we dont teach astrology with astronomy
2791118 ive never felt ive been valued by anyone im just a waste of space that everyone ignores like a ghost without a home
2791119 we have said that this is a condition driven process
2791120 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2791121 i really dig this spot because it reminds me of that little market i used to go to as a kid run by a family small enough to have really
2791122 awe amanda jones i would never ever use any other agent than this woman
2791123 you want me to call you turkey put your name down

2791127 i almost dont want to write this review because im loving the small class sizes

2791136 oh yes the french toast thats a good item a very good item
2791137 a filthy grease pit in an undeserved prime corner location on clement st
2791138 service was ok i guess nothing too bad or too good the restaurant wasnt very clean and the atmosphere was quite depressing
2791139 if you see this place and think its some high end gourmet burger joint think again
2791140 this a place i have been visting for the better part of 20 years or so
2791141 im headed down to miette confiserie to see if i can find some last minute gifts
2791142 we want to make you remember exactly why you threw fits when your parents wouldnt buy you candy and then wed like to gently remind you that youre perfectly able to buy your own candy now

2791144 i stopped by this cute store today hoping that i could find some last minute xmas gifts
2791145 ignoring when i needed help navigating their not very wheelchair accessible store
2791146 gosh ill have to talk to my husband blink blink do you have a brochure
2791147 im so sorry about that maam ill be sure to take some corrective action here
2791148 we have a 90 day trial period just buy one and try it
2791149 i would hate to see our teachers and classrooms lose out on money because the state doesnt have enough revenue
2791150 i understand why legislators want to give people a break because the economy is down and people are hurting and cant afford the things they want to buy
2791151 but they arent taking into account what that revenue could later buy for the states
2791152 weve given them the benefit of the doubt for a long time
2791153 a sales tax free weekend will be welcomed more than ever in this tough economy especially with the high prices of food and fuel
2791154 it is certainly worth it when you consider the positive impact on retail sales and consumer confidence
2791155 theres just something about a sales tax holiday thats different from a regular sale
2791156 there are a lot of families out there struggling to make ends meet and theyre having to stretch their dollars
2791157 while the 5 percent or so savings doesnt sound like a lot that could be a make or break
2791158 its the same sort of family that collects coupons for the grocery store that waits for tax holidays to shop
2791159 you have been disconnected from the internet do you want to reconnect did someone hacking me and doing that its happened a few other times
2791160 let it be a korean bbq let it be a korean bbq korean bbq
2791161 what a treat to have found the only bar in an unmarked town locals tear down the signs trying to keep tourists out
2791162 well known concert venue in soma looking for motivated joyless hateful individuals with a real vendetta against any kind of fun must be willing to work weekends

2791170 self i think i am curious about this place lets check it out
2791171 am i going to make decisions on players this week yes i always have to look at ways to improve the team
2791172 as john wooden said you might be the best player but with you this might not be the best team
2791173 hes not accountable to me when it comes to that
2791174 hes accountable to himself and his teammates i dont focus on the players who arent playing i focus on the 42 that are
2791175 if durability is an issue we use lyle green rolly lumbala or ian smart on other things
2791176 that which is hateful to you do not do to another the rest of the torah is all commentary now go study
2791177 audio panton cogito singularis listen to everything think for yourself
2791178 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2791179 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2791180 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2791181 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2791182 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2791183 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2791184 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2791185 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2791186 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2791187 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2791188 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2791189 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2791190 who are open to doing something on the production side
2791191 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2791192 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2791193 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2791194 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2791195 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2791196 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2791197 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2791198 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2791199 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2791200 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2791201 the switching costs for people to leave a league to come over to another site is a significant hurdle
2791202 brings fantasy football to the player instead of having the player come to you
2791203 do you look at what yahoo has been able to do and say its just not worth taking a chance
2791204 its just us with a slingshot going against the big guys
2791205 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2791206 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2791207 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2791208 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2791209 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2791210 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2791211 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2791212 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2791213 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2791214 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2791215 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2791216 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2791217 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2791218 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2791219 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2791220 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2791221 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2791222 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2791223 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2791224 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2791225 los desenga os son normales en la vida son los privilegios de la edad
2791226 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2791227 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2791228 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2791229 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2791230 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2791231 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2791232 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2791233 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2791234 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2791235 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2791236 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2791237 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2791238 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2791239 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2791240 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2791241 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2791242 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2791243 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2791244 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2791245 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2791246 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2791247 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2791248 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2791249 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2791250 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2791251 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2791252 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2791253 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2791254 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2791255 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2791256 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2791257 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2791258 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2791259 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2791260 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2791261 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2791262 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2791263 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2791264 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2791265 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2791266 the hottest mms ever if you dont like it pass it on

2791269 a copy is attached for your information as you will see it holds no information on peer reviews
2791270 we have had so much information about the stadium and so many briefings but i do remember going through the reports not long before the vote
2791271 i would need to know what peer reviews stop the stadium is referring to because there have been a number we have not withheld any information from either the city council or the regional council they are totally familiar with all the information we have
2791272 they said no but we have been briefed and i thought they need to read those for themselves
2791273 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2791274 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2791275 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2791276 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2791277 on monday younes kaboul will be at the club for a medical
2791278 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2791279 i spoke with kaka yesterday saturday we know that the clubs are talking about the transfer although they have not reached a conclusion yet
2791280 i think an august transfer is still a possibility though kaka will only talk about that when they do a deal
2791281 he is waiting for a deal and then he will start to negotiate with chelsea
2791282 normally milan do not sell their best players we think they like the proposal but it is not so easy for them to accept it

2791381 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2791382 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2791383 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2791384 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that

2791408 over the years and listening to women friends if one listens just shuts up and listens to their stories their faith journey and in some cases their call by god to ordination to the priesthood in the catholic church there is a problem for us guys in the church what are we saying god is calling us but not you this is heresy were tampering with the sacred here

2791539 not only will the customer legally own 100 per cent of the property from the outset they will not have to pay rent on the deferred element
2791540 and theres more good news in that the outstanding cost will reduce on a sliding scale if they repay it within the first three years
2791541 while some first time buyers perceptions of affordability may be unrealistic competitive prices are still achievable and the recent cooling of prices has increased accessibility
2791542 a range of excellent developer incentives and schemes are also currently available which in some cases have allowed buyers to bypass financial constraints and secure a more competitive homebuyers surveyed were looking to purchase a property single handedly while a third said they intended to buy with a partner
2791543 we are determined to continue to do everything possible to promote long term stability and fairness in the housing market
2791544 we have a growing and ageing population and will only see worsening affordability unless we increase housing supply
2791545 as well as having to find cash to pay stamp duty legal fees and removal costs
2791546 we have always tried to help homebuyers and the summertime sale is just one of a variety of ways in which we make homebuying more affordable
2791547 in addition the average cost of borrowing has risen steadily since december despite three base rate reductions
2791548 this in turn directly affects first time buyers who are the absolute lifeblood of the housing industry
2791549 it is encouraging to see that the slowdown in house prices that nationwide has reported for june has fallen to 0 9 per cent
2791550 however the market appears to be stabilising which should help begin to restore confidence in the market place
2791551 we have called for measures such as a stamp duty holiday for first time buyers and temporary tax relief on the mortgage interest of peoples primary residence
2791552 it is clear that the positive outlook that has characterised the market for the last few years is now a thing of the past and people expect prices to fall over the next year
2791553 however borrowers on tight budgets will have to plan ahead to manage higher mortgage payments than they have been used to
2791554 estate agents and homeowners believe that despite current movements in house prices we are unlikely to experience a really prolonged period of house price falls
2791555 most think the period of decline will be over within a year and a very small minority think it will last longer than two to three years
2791556 while this is light at the end of the tunnel it implies that estate agents and homeowners are bracing themselves for further falls in the very near future
2791557 snapping up a are properties in your area more expensive than they were a year ago
2791558 big brother is a reminder to potential homebuyers that friends can easily become enemies when you move in together
2791559 shared ownership is a great alternative allowing individuals a helping hand to get on the property ladder in a gradual way and still benefit from any increase in the value of the property with the option of purchasing a larger proportion of the property in the future
2791560 ministers and officials are very exercised about it and they are looking at a lot of different measures
2791561 lending levels continue to be lower than last year and any recovery is still some way away with little sign of the special liquidity scheme increasing the flow of funds to the industry or lowering the cost of funds as hoped
2791562 the growing popularity of fixed rate mortgages despite the relatively high rates suggests that many borrowers are prioritising certainty in their monthly payments
2791563 ultimately the concern in the current marketplace is for the small number of borrowers who put down a very small deposit who may now be feeling overstretched
2791564 the accommodation comprises a spacious open plan kitchen and living dining room and two double bedrooms a bonus for first time buyers
2791565 i think the thing that worries the uk market is the fact that global investors to the extent that they still exist have been spooked and sentiment has become negative around mortgage securities anywhere even good quality mortgage securities like those in the uk
2791566 that has led to us having a problem in terms of a shortfall in the aggregate amount of funding into the mortgage market and investment into the mortgage market which hasnt really been logically based
2791567 the decision to hold the rate at five per cent will not provide any solace for those struggling to enter the market
2791568 redrows easi buy scheme is making home ownership more accessible to first time buyers in the rochdale area allowing them to own 100 per cent of their home today whilst deferring 25 per cent of the cost to a time when they have more funds available
2791569 not only will the customer legally own 100 per cent of the property from the outset they will not have to pay rent on the deferred element
2791570 in the present economic climate buyers are naturally more wary of parting with their money and the exchange bond is an effective tool for removing their concern
2791571 particularly with a new build property it delays the need to liquidate existing assets for investors and allows time for deposit
2791572 we can help low income families that are going to be frozen out or young people looking to have their first home
2791573 we think we will be able to help a lot of people who want to own their own homes
2791574 now is the time to rethink how we fund affordable housing and also now is the time to look at how we can help house builders to continue to deliver affordable homes at a very difficult time for the industry
2791575 when the market actually corrects and house prices start to go up again the environment becomes easier for private sector builders to deliver homes so they need to be in a position to start building again quickly
2791576 our research was surprising considering how high mortgage rates are in the current market
2791577 for 25 per cent of our respondents to say they would choose a short term fixed rate despite the fact they are unlikely to find a rate under seven per cent suggests that people do not have much confidence in the chances of the mortgage market recovering within the next five years
2791578 this was reflected by the research which showed that eight per cent of those questioned cannot afford to buy a house at all
2791579 there has probably never been a better time to buy for a very long time
2791580 peoples expectations are now coming into line with reality i certainly think they buyers have got a lot of pulling power and a lot of influence on the market
2791581 even allowing for recent reductions in house values historic house price inflation combined with lenders current abandonment of 100 per cent plus mortgages means that it is all but impossible for first time buyers to get a foot on the property ladder without a substantial deposit
2791582 parents of younger children might look to the lessons of the present when preparing for the future and should consider saving for their children now
2791583 access to the housing market has deteriorated as the credit crunch has taken hold of the mortgage lender sector
2791584 those who are able to access the housing market will find that a bigger deposit will mean that mortgage repayments are reduced
2791585 but with real incomes stagnating this will seem like light relief only homeowners finances will continue to struggle with rising food and fuel costs making the burden of mortgage repayments even more difficult
2791586 in the present economic climate affordability is a key factor particularly for first time buyers in high cost areas
2791587 by suspending stamp duty on lower cost homes many would find that they could now afford to move or in the case of first time buyers meet lenders criteria
2791588 are properties in your area more expensive than they were a year ago
2791589 in addition the average cost of borrowing has risen steadily since december despite three base rate reductions
2791590 this in turn directly affects first time buyers who are the absolute lifeblood of the housing industry
2791591 we believe that this is exactly the kind of scheme that will help first time buyers get their foot on the property ladder
2791592 the processes for regulation and redress do not go far enough to protect the consumer and we agree that participation in regulatory and redress schemes needs to be both consistent and universal
2791593 they should include all estate agents letting agents managing agents and landlords
2791594 we believe that this is exactly the kind of scheme that will help first time buyers get their foot on the property ladder
2791595 while some first time buyers perceptions of affordability may be unrealistic competitive prices are still achievable and the recent cooling of prices has increased accessibility
2791596 however what we need to see now is lenders relaxing their lending criteria across the board to assist buyers back into the market
2791597 these days there seems to be less pressure on first time buyers to get on the housing ladder at all costs although they have by no means given up on the market if anything they are just cannier about the many options available to them increasingly well informed on price fluctuations and willing to hold out for the best deals to come along
2791598 co op customers with equity or a sizeable deposit will be laughing as they are eligible for the 5 99 per cent mortgage rate
2791599 but borrowers without these will pay much higher rates further widening the gap between the haves and have nots
2791600 if offsetting doesnt suit you you should compare current account interest rates before opting for the co op
2791601 to date the gateway has been a resounding success with buyers coming from london docklands ilford
2791602 the 10 offer reflects our commitment to helping first time buyers to get onto the property ladder and will enable them to use the money they have saved for furnishings a summer holiday a new car or towards their first mortgage payments the offer is only available until the end of june so interested purchasers should visit as soon as possible in order to avoid disappointment
2791603 monthly house purchase lending volumes continue to be lower than last years levels and there will be a further weakening in coming months as recent approvals data has shown
2791604 during this difficult period consumers need advice more than ever
2791605 in the first quarter of this year over 80 per cent of first time buyers used an intermediary a ten per cent increase on the previous year
2791606 for some people a falling house price environment is not necessarily bad news
2791607 while the majority of homeowners are planning to stay put and wait for the current volatility to end two million think that house price falls are a good reason to move
2791608 mortgage interest rates in general are cheaper now than they have been for more than a year
2791609 but its all but impossible for many potential buyers to find a lender because of the size of deposit theyre being asked to provide
2791610 while people are still moving the increase in the number of people choosing to move between rented accommodation is a reflection of consumers lack of confidence in the property market and current affordability constraints
2791611 potential first time buyers who previously would have been the largest group moving from renting to buying are now delaying a purchase as an uncertain market and tougher lending criteria is making it harder for this group to step onto the property ladder a trend that is likely to continue for the rest of 2008
2791612 the fact that those already on the property ladder are choosing to remain so is good news for the property market it demonstrates that overall the majority of home owners still view property as a good investment and are confident that the market will improve over the long term
2791613 i dont think the bank of england will allow mortgage rates at eight per cent and a base rate at four and a half per cent
2791614 the rates are higher but theyll be able to find the ten per cent deposit that is needed at the moment to get a mortgage
2791615 at the bottom end where people are getting onto the ladder for the first time they are as keen to do so as those at the top end who may be moving up down or sideways
2791616 the lending landscape has changed dramatically over the past 12 months
2791617 we lead the way in giving lenders unique distribution opportunities and the lenders we work with are the best in the business
2791618 the naea is calling on the chancellor and prime minister to consider other options to give people a break such as a stamp duty holiday for first time buyers and temporary tax relief on the mortgage interest of peoples primary residence
2791619 at least ease the difficulty that people in this country are facing
2791620 but what is clear is that interest rates are dislocated from the situation and that the banks are not if anything the mortgage rates are getting tighter
2791621 however the reluctance of mortgage lenders to lend first timers as much as they used to means that many will only achieve their home ownership goals if working with their parents either for help with the deposit or some sort of co financing
2791622 obviously there are various problems at the moment in terms of a lot of lenders pulling rates quite quickly and a lot of banks and building societies have said theyll only be lending to certain types of customers
2791623 borrowers have been less affected by the tightening in lending criteria
2791624 the scottish government could help to underpin confidence at this uncertain time by increasing their investment in both the new build and open market homestake schemes
2791625 the whole concept of buy to let is much more embedded in the uk and of course if mortgage rates are higher then one of the effects is that more people will want to rent
2791626 so there is reason to believe that buy to let is quite a good place to be
2791627 people still want to buy despite the current negativity in the market and there is still a range of good mortgage products and competitive rates out there
2791628 our customer charter highlights lindens commitment to offering all of our customers the best possible service by providing our customers with access to free legal and mortgage advice in addition to our recently launched mortgage protection scheme we are able to provide our buyers peace of mind and a helping hand in todays market
2791629 webnovate innovating amp renovating the web one site at a time
2791630 there will be an imbalance of supply and demand and that will be reflected in comparatively high price levels
2791631 people are going to struggle to live where they would like to live in places near to their jobs in some cases
2791632 consumers for their part have benefited greatly from the myriad of products available to them and from the expert and independent advice provided by intermediaries who guide them through this bewildering market place
2791633 its a perfect addition to our programming because our audience is very interested in aspirational programming and we understand that many who watch real estate tv also want to find a way in to the british housing market
2791634 the presenter is not only highly skilled she is very witty and sharp and you can expect to meet some real characters on
2791635 britain has experienced a growing demand for more housing at a time when there has been an undersupply of new homes for many years
2791636 now the credit crunch has made lending much more difficult with the result that the recent upturn in house building has stopped as house buyers find it much more difficult to obtain a mortgage
2791637 a lot should ride on the likely rental yields from a property and one should expect maybe 30 per cent higher rental yield than only a year ago so yields on average would drop to about five and a half per cent
2791638 but there will be many opportunities to acquire cheap property over the next year or so or maybe longer
2791639 for the last few years we have been breaking even on the rent we were not worried as our property has been rising in value now with zero income and declining property prices we are looking at ways to cut our costs and our focus immediately fell on the 13 we pay annually to the letting agent who found our tenant they seemed to be making more money from this than us
2791640 what people need to remember is that the market is stable and we are not seeing massive price drops
2791641 there are still strong economic factors at play such as high employment and low interest rates and sales are still taking place
2791642 it is clear that the tightening of criteria by mortgage lenders has had an impact on the property market as it has become harder for first time buyers to enter the market this has resulted in little movement at the bottom of the property ladder therefore those further up looking to sell before they can buy are becoming stuck or having to look at alternative ways of buying their next home this is why we brought together a range of organisations who are working together to support first time buyers who want their own home there are properties on the market for them and through proper financial planning that focuses on responsible lending and affordability it is possible for a first time buyer to become a homeowner there is potential for first time buyers to over extend their budget to secure their home and create problems further down the line if interest rates change or there is an unexpected bill the strong link this arrangement has to financial advice and affordability aims to prevent any nasty surprises later on
2791643 first time buyers are key to the future of the mortgage and home ownership market in
2791644 lenders in these kinds of times tend to view self build as a fairly safe bet
2791645 self builders tend to be building houses that have an inbuilt equity from scratch they tend to benefit up to 25 to 30 per cent in terms of the equity the cost of the mortgage compared to the end value of the house
2791646 purchasers can benefit from george wimpeys easymover secure scheme which offers five per cent deposit legal fees and stamp duty paid for first time buyers
2791647 building a more prosperous britain and a fairer britain is the purpose of the draft legislation
2791648 advisers know their clients and use this insight and their knowledge of the market to identify the most suitable and most price competitive products
2791649 in these difficult times it is more important than ever for consumers to access good financial advice they should not miss out on the benefits of using a mortgage adviser
2791650 the credit crunch has resulted in a gap in the availability of mortgage credit relative to demand lenders have changed their product ranges tightened lending criteria and reviewed their pricing in order to maintain their individual ability to manage demand
2791651 for borrowers who do want to fix for five years there are some very competitive deals out there at the moment including abbeys 5 75 per cent product available up to 75 per cent loan to value
2791652 mortgages have hit the main news agenda in recent months and this has perhaps led to more people questioning brokers about the different aspects involved in taking on a mortgage
2791653 borrowers are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of making the right mortgage choice and that they can take advantage of brokers wealth of knowledge to ensure this
2791654 remember that a mortgage is a massive investment and a massive decision for someone to make so if youre going to remortgage or take on a new mortgage such perks might not be high on your priority list
2791655 there is a huge risk in taking out unsecured borrowings to raise a deposit as a first time buyer a small shift in prices and a change in circumstances can see someone losing their house and financial security very quickly
2791656 although on the face of it taking away 100 per cent mortgages is a responsible thing for the lenders to do it appears first time buyers will take even greater risks to get on the property ladder
2791657 using savings gives an important buffer against negative equity using unsecured loans and 100 per cent mortgages does not in these cases the borrower needs to be very confident on their income and job security
2791658 were sorry you will not have access to live olympic video or long form replays online because the tv service provider you selected is not a partner of nbcolympics com please contact your local cable satellite or telecommunications operator for more details
2791659 the affordability difficulties faced by first time buyers are still an ongoing issue and barratts head start scheme is tailored exclusively to help these people get on the property ladder
2791660 that is why it is vital that the government working with the industry offers as much support as possible both directly to those people and to the consumer advice groups who can help them in their day to day lives
2791661 no one wants to see repossessions rise but risk is a part of life and for some households circumstances change and they cannot get back on their feet
2791662 however most people who suffer payment difficulties can get out of trouble by taking good advice prioritising their debts and communicating with their lender early
2791663 there is a huge risk in taking out unsecured borrowings to raise a deposit as a first time buyer a small shift in prices and a change in circumstances can see someone losing their house and financial security very quickly
2791664 we need cancer drugs nice the national institute for health and clinical excellence must go
2791665 these peaks normally occur when bank of england rate rises are expected but as the bank rate is widely expected to fall over the next year most of the high take up was because fixed rates were a quarter to a half a per cent cheaper than trackers
2791666 when we first launched g2 redcar it wasnt only potential buyers who came and talked to us
2791667 there was also a lot of interest from parents who saw g2 redcar as a chance in a lifetime for their sons and daughters to get a foot on the property ladder
2791668 our new scheme will enable parents to offer tangible financial support to their children even if they are not in a position to help out with an initial deposit
2791669 while it may be getting tougher to get a mortgage now it would appear that those first time buyers who are in a position to buy are driving much harder bargains with sellers
2791670 with the current levels of uncertainty and volatility surrounding the mortgage industry and the housing market maybe its worth sitting on the sidelines and saving that ten per cent deposit until the stormy clouds blow over
2791671 there is no denying that the credit crunch has affected confidence in the market especially first time buyers who are finding it hard to find financing to get on the ladder
2791672 but it is still important to remember that the underlying factors that support the property market remain low unemployment historically low interest rates and a pent up demand for houses
2791673 our creative team of interior designers have given the show apartment a light and airy feel with a colour scheme of chalky white mint green and touches of slate grey and cinnamon
2791674 bold patterns and textures compliment the subtle tones and the modern furniture ensures design savvy buyers will feel right at home
2791675 the open plan living and dining area has been stylishly furnished with a chic slate grey sofa and round glass dining table with white dining chairs
2791676 the master bedroom which has an en suite bathroom features a sumptuous grey upholstered double bed with simple white bed linen
2791677 the second double bedroom which also has a tranquil white and green colour scheme is illuminated by a dramatic crystal gloss light fitting the whole property has a calm and relaxing feel making it the perfect place to unwind after a hard day at work
2791678 a brand new home can suit a first time buyer or downsizer well as there are no repairs or renovations to worry about and theyre easy to maintain leaving the customer with more time to enjoy their home plus new homes are inherently more energy efficient than older draughty properties so bills can be lower too
2791679 homeowners looking for competitive mortgage deals in the new tougher mortgage marketplace might be attracted by the prospect of taking a payment holiday to ease the financial burden if things get tough
2791680 as a building society it is important to us to support first time buyers who may be struggling to get onto the housing ladder
2791681 the 300 discount will bring the reservation fee down to just 299 easing access for first time buyers to fair and transparent mortgages

2791691 the ttd has been earning income only through the offerings made by millions of devotees across the world the construction of guest houses and mutts in tirumala was possible only because of donations
2791692 why should we pay tax to the tuda in fact none of the government bodies has taken up development activities in the past two decades in tirupati
2791693 all these years we kept mum as it is a sensitive issue related to the sentiments of the people but it is affecting our revenues all the dharmic institutes in huda and vuda regions pay tax even the state government has asked the ttd to pay it when the latter approached for an exemption
2791694 but they have allotted a good number of rooms to the tourism department the aptdc in turn let out the rooms charging double the rates from the pilgrims on what basis should the ttd evade property tax to the tmc
2791695 minus ttd there is no tirupati any government body or any sort of business in the temple town of tirupati is earning income in various forms only because of the presence of temple of lord venkateswara so there should be some exemption for ttd

2791730 because of my travel schedule i havent had a chance to talk to cooper about where we are in the next couple of days well have a chance to have that dialogue
2791731 in the meantime getting reggie abercrombie up there gives us depth off the bench and its great to have a guy like darin erstad with our club that can play left field for us

2791742 they team officials said more than likely i wouldnt beat it so theres kind of no point to go through with it and that more than likely it would be a waste of time
2791743 even if youre not guilty the evidence is too strong against you to have a chance
2791744 so that the worst that could happen is what happens instead of 10 days it probably wont set me back too much

2791782 they were big circular and even but i couldnt see any detail as they were quite far away they kept appearing on the horizon and travelling in the same direction from east to west until they vanished
2791783 they were coming towards us there were about 20 of them it was difficult to tell how high or how fast they were going but it was a steady pace id seen nothing like it before i thought what is it a ufo and then common sense kicked in there must be a rational explanation for it all
2791784 i was so interested to read the other reports of people seeing what must have been the same thing
2791785 wow i still feel shaky i seem to have a real sense of urgency and interest to understand what these were

2791852 that is what learning is you suddenly understand something youve understood all your life but in a new way
2791853 it is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it
2791854 most teachers waste their time by asking questions which are intended to discover what a pupil does not know whereas the true art of questioning has for its purpose to discover what the pupil knows or is capable of knowing

2791860 its my determination to get us out of this place i dont enjoy being in this place

2791877 he takes huge amounts of money from oil companies that are profiting in the former soviet union and many parts of the world
2791878 this has been one of the failures of the bush administration failing to build a strong relationship a mutually beneficial relationship with russia so wed have the kind of influence to persuade them to stop some of these very very dangerous efforts within their territory
2791879 experience is only positive insofar as it creates good judgment
2791880 and i think senator obamas strong case to the american people is that he will have the right judgment about how to balance americas military force with strong diplomacy to protect our interests abroad
2791881 john mccains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government
2791882 mr scheunemann proudly represented a small democracy that is one of our closest allies in a very dangerous region
2791883 the reaction of the obama campaign to this crisis so at odds with our democratic allies and yet so bizarrely in sync with moscow doesnt merely raise questions about senator obamas judgment it answers them
2791884 theyre an example of senator mccains push to spread democracy in that part of the world as a very important advance of americas interest as well as being good for international stability
2791885 so instead of trying to detract from the central issue i wish senator obama had actually confronted the issue not trying to detract our attention by focusing on a mccain adviser
2791886 i believe what senator mccain is proposing is totally totally wrong

2791903 thou shall have balance the ten commandments of teaching creative writing
2791904 these new learning environments are unified by their improvisational nature they place students in loosely structured environments where they work together in a relatively unstructured improvisational fashion
2791905 however effectively one prepares for a class the realities of learning alter the original orientation in a number of creative and unpredictable ways if the structure is too tight or the scenario is too predictable then we move towards a tightly organized outcomes based approach to learning we end up confusing the relationship between clear goals set by the teacher and an anticipation that the student will meet the expectations of the course because they have replicated the core meaning of the content this is to some degree summarized by the assumption that teachers need to envision what students should know at the end of a course yet knowledge cannot be packaged in such a simplistic way we gain an understanding of an idea for example through dialogue the dialogue can lead in an untold number of different directions the fundamental unpredictability of dialogue is that both interacting parties may have no sense of where they are headed and may indeed learn in ways that they had not anticipated this should be a source of excitement but it is often a source of anxiety i believe the anxiety is partially situated in how we define teachers and students
2791906 oh youll learn all about that when you get your masters
2791907 half my job is asking questions of those who cant generate questions in order to model the will to curiosity
2791908 students at your beck and call get a ta to grade all your papers and youre set

2791911 to become comfortable reading academic criticism and applying critical methods in your writing
2791912 to apply critical methodology in response to criticism through writing presentation and discussion
2791913 so how do your teachers evaluate you how should i grade your writing
2791914 normally we are forbidden to see status transactions except when theres a conflict
2791915 in reality status transactions continue all the time in the park well notice the ducks squabbling but not how carefully they keep their distances when they are not
2791916 the pleasure attached to misbehaving comes partly from the status changes you make in your teacher all those jokes on teacher are to make him drop in status the status expert teacher could cope easily with any situation by changing his status first
2791917 you are your own instructor and can learn from one another
2791918 began to think of children not as immature adults but of adults as atrophied children
2791919 imagine a clown on a one wheeled bicycle who pedals through the black paint and on to our sheets of paper dont paint the clown he says paint the mark he leaves on your paper
2791920 the art was in the child and that it wasnt something to be imposed by the adult
2791921 the student should never experience failure the teachers skill lay in presenting experience in such a way that the student was bound to succeed
2791922 they just do what theyre asked to and see what happens its this decision not to try and control the future which allows students to be spontaneous
2791923 grossing out teacher a horror writer in the writing classroom
2791924 what if i were to collect your papers without names on them and then after grading them all individually averaged the grades and gave everyone the same class average grade how would things change
2791925 would our grades be higher than the grades of a high school class
2791926 how do you think my grading of your papers would change
2791927 i still dont understand how that grading system could work
2791928 a c means average right so if i were averaging the class grade every time i collected a paper youd all get a c heck i wouldnt even have to read them
2791929 it may be useful to reflect on the ways that our institutional and pedagogical practices continue to reinforce and reward aggressive competitiveness and an individualistic me first climate to the exclusion of recognizing those who have contributed to the integrity of a campus or local community
2791930 simply by removing the second hoop that is the goal of promotion to full professor many universities and colleges would become more capacious workplaces accommodating the diverse strengths talents and goals of their faculties with greater ease
2791931 why high powered people fail working memory and choking under pressure in math
2791932 we dont know our students well enough to make the kinds of judgments about their self confidence and circumstances that would enable us to calibrate their grades to achieve the desired level of motivation we want
2791933 man is nothing more than a machine that responds to conditioning
2791934 philosophy consists of offering reassurance to children that is if one prefers of taking them out of childhood of forgetting about the child or inversely but by the same token of speaking first and foremost for that little boy within us of teaching him to speak to dialogue by displacing his fear or his desire
2791935 if learning something has been difficult uncomfortable or even humiliating enough people are not likely to admit that the content of what has been learned is not valuable
2791936 consistently disguise s in our introductory courses what is problematic about our work
2791937 that have low test scores and large numbers of poor children
2791938 one in which students gain broad knowledge and the groundwork for becoming scientists and another in which children will in some ways be left behind
2791939 turn stuff like syllabi course papers analytical studies etc from a class case study into a succinct appealing and engaging format
2791940 effective teaching must be planned and conducted from the learners point of view
2791941 long term hard persistent effort to achieve comes from the heart not the head
2791942 its like you know that two plus two equals four not because youre working through the solution youre recovering the answer from memory these findings suggest that the brain is set up to circumvent the algorithmic or deliberative processes of decision making wherever possible

2791959 tend to pick up stories from the national enquirer with tongs
2791960 they have been very right about some things but theres been some misses too so its a little scary to follow on those stories
2791961 its also a little scary for big outfits to step up on a story like this sex may sell but it can really hurt your relationship with readers
2791962 we at abc were working on this story and if we had had any proof and any verifiable facts we certainly would have gone with the story
2791963 it was just a matter of were not going to put something on the air until we know that its true
2791964 we were able to prove i think with satisfaction to our bosses that there was money being paid to rielle hunter
2791965 this began to be for us an aspect of something we could report some hard facts
2791966 until he called and its on the record that he called us on friday and said i want to talk you know thats what broke the story he was willing to admit that he had been lying
2791967 but it became a ludicrous situation almost became a conspiracy of silence by the media and edwards meanwhile would not give interviews was not acting like a man who didnt have something to hide
2791968 i think at that point we should have earlier than we did told readers and viewers what we knew and we didnt know
2791969 i was taught when i was a young reporter that its news when we say it is i think thats still true its news when we say it is its just who we is has changed
2791970 members of the public people with modems people with cell phones are now producers editors they can push and push and push on a story until it ends up being acknowledged by everyone
2791971 last night in the mess hall two georgian officers sat down at the table opposite me the one facing me was a bit disheveled his uniform top was misbuttoned it was the kind of mistake you could make if you were in a hurry both ate quickly and silently i wanted to say something but what do you say at a time like this

2791991 lets say charlie is on a dinner date with jane
2791992 i see you but we dont have time for it
2791993 is it the things the character does or the type of person the character is
2791994 it was nice to learn how others felt about a point you made
2791995 it helped the writers get a broad sense of their audiences response and it enabled everyone to feel more actively engaged
2791996 the bursting of voices adds to a relaxed atmosphere and lessens tension
2791997 my husband and i have already implimented this technique into our everyday speech and its provided good comic relief

2792004 people who sit by the window are daydreamers like the freedom of having wide open space next to them but often pay the price of being far from the door
2792005 so how do your teachers evaluate you how should i grade your writing
2792006 i see all those things that the freshman dont realize youre doing
2792007 har har no its when you get inside of an idea and start asking questions about it
2792008 yes perhaps it is but explain that a little more why would we want to do that
2792009 i mean why not just look things up why bother writing
2792010 i know im like the little kid who keeps asking why why is it bright out daddy but why does the sun rise daddy but why does it do that blah blah blah listen i love what youre saying but if we just want to know things we can look them up the world is more complicated than any dictionary or encyclopedia suggests and you really shouldnt just ask why because a teacher told you including me you should want to know for yourself writing gives us a way to submerge into a concept and explore the reasons why on our own
2792011 you all probably agree that the media is bad for you everyone knows that a lot of people say so but ironically most of those people are on tv
2792012 its when you make a point and knock down your opponents ideas or anyone else who disagrees
2792013 well im going to argue that youre wrong but dont hurt me can i try to persuade you that youre wrong
2792014 okay by point i think you mean a viewpoint but theres never just one point of view agreed
2792015 of course why argue in the first place go on
2792016 okay so there are multiple viewpoints if there werent we wouldnt need lawyers and courtrooms thered just be the law and that would be that a police state but we need lawyers on both sides of a case to interpret the language of the law but even beyond that there are multiple truths one mans truth is another mans lie thats why theres religious disputes i guess all we have really if we want to get along is persuasion in persuasion youre simply trying to convince an audience that your position is the most reasonable one am i right
2792017 wait oh shoot no i dont win i lose because i just knocked down your ideas thereby proving your point not mine
2792018 you can win an argument by being most reasonable and yet still lose it hmm maybe persuasion isnt about winning anything at all
2792019 a political scientist with surveillance equipment now youre really starting to scare me
2792020 not enough practice and feedback loops to help students absorb retain and apply information

2792025 tells a superintendent that you are naive inexperienced and provincial if you want to see your name in print write a book
2792026 i did that on purpose just to see if you guys were paying attention
2792027 im sorry jimmy im great with faces but bad with names im working on this so be sure to correct me if i get it wrong again in the mean time let me make sure i have your name correctly written in my grade book
2792028 group six why dont you guys come up with a question for the rest of the class that isnt on this list of discussion questions
2792029 our primary feedback on our work comes from children 18 year olds who dont understand what your job really is
2792030 a major part of the reason we all feel so alienated and anxious is because we dont get feedback or praise from people who count on any kind of regular basis
2792031 last years students who took this class influenced what i taught you this year
2792032 how are we supposed to take notes in the dark
2792033 how many of you want to leave one light on for note taking
2792034 welles is known for his extreme camera angles look for any out of the ordinary shots in the movie and consider what they tell us about the relationship between the characters
2792035 poetry for sure is the best way weve got of banishing euphemism and the world of words without meaning
2792036 it seems to me that we have become unsure about what not to put on syllabi because we have become unsure what a course is it is no longer self contained
2792037 it may be useful to reflect on the ways that our institutional and pedagogical practices continue to reinforce and reward aggressive competitiveness and an individualistic me first climate to the exclusion of recognizing those who have contributed to the integrity of a campus or local community
2792038 buried deep within the laws 670 pages is a provision requiring public secondary schools to provide military recruiters not only with access to facilities but also with contact information for every student or face a cutoff of all federal aid
2792039 the department of defense has developed a national high school data base to document recruiter access presently 95 percent of the nations 22 000 secondary schools provide a degree of access to military recruiters that is consistent with current law
2792040 the number of jrotc units and cadets has doubled there are now nearly 500 000 students enrolled in the program at some 3 000 schools nationwide and the defense department plans to spend 234 million on jrotc this year nearly quadruple what it spent a decade ago

2792042 so how much reading do you guys have to do in your other courses
2792043 you know read a chapter for homework and then discuss it in class if so raise your hand

2792047 journal about that topic and let me read your thoughts when i grade it later on
2792048 next time we talk bring your textbook with specific questions about the reading
2792049 i write in the morning before the day to come steals it all away from me
2792050 have you ever thought about seriously killing someone who is it and how would you do it
2792051 whats the worst thing that ever happened to you on a date
2792052 it probably wont make much sense if you werent there in the class as we were constructing it which only shows just how much effort goes into preparing an instructional resource for the internet
2792053 protest that if they had known what i wanted in advance they would have given it to me in the first place and then they wouldnt need to revise it so much
2792054 i tell myself that its ok for me once in a great while to create a handout thats just for the students of one class and that is ok for me to use the internet like a photocopier simply to distribute that handout without turning it into a respectable online document

2792061 ask students about every three weeks to e mail you comments about how the course is going its strengths and weaknesses and how it can be improved
2792062 the very act of having to decide and make a sign of the commitment draws students into the discussion
2792063 the sure mark of an a paper is that you will find yourself telling someone else about it
2792064 an a paper is written with verve and clarity it displays a curiosity a control of knowledge beyond what was covered in class an original insight or an extrapolation beyond class work
2792065 some students would put guns on their desk to take the test
2792066 once one was cheating and when i told him to stop he said leave me alone or i will take this pen and draw on your face
2792067 it made us so upset we would cry we are phd professors and our students humiliate us we could do nothing
2792068 when you put someone in touch with their creativity the cheap thrill of destructive behavior becomes less appealing theres no competition between reaching new heights of creative expression versus breaking a window with a baseball or spraying graffiti
2792069 in about 30 percent of the papers more than one quarter of the text was copied verbatim
2792070 educators cheating students rely on web more schools use plagiarism tracking software
2792071 given the expectations of students who have grown up with dvd players in their own rooms any campus without say a nightclub and a food court is as obsolete as an eight track cassette
2792072 do we know that commenting works what kinds of comments work best are there tactics that should be used in addition to or in place of comments
2792073 ive been teaching the ninth graders how to write its been going well and its a lot of fun i find myself trying to think creative ways to help them ive seen improvements already its great they beg to do one of the exercises all the time i give them an opening line then every 30 seconds i call out a random word does this sound familiar
2792074 30 as the example but it can be anything even 71 for a baby t or onesie
2792075 if i put in three or four 18 hour 20 hour days in a row im not sharp its just a fact im more sharp if i get a little rest

2792081 a computer without windows is like chocolate cake without mustard
2792082 is run by lobbyists that represent georgia and other countries
2792083 he takes huge amounts of money from oil companies that are profiting in the former soviet union and many parts of the world
2792084 this has been one of the failures of the bush administration failing to build a strong relationship a mutually beneficial relationship with russia so wed have the kind of influence to persuade them to stop some of these very very dangerous efforts within their territory
2792085 experience is only positive insofar as it creates good judgment
2792086 and i think senator obamas strong case to the american people is that he will have the right judgment about how to balance americas military force with strong diplomacy to protect our interests abroad
2792087 john mccains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government
2792088 mr scheunemann proudly represented a small democracy that is one of our closest allies in a very dangerous region
2792089 the reaction of the obama campaign to this crisis so at odds with our democratic allies and yet so bizarrely in sync with moscow doesnt merely raise questions about senator obamas judgment it answers them
2792090 theyre an example of senator mccains push to spread democracy in that part of the world as a very important advance of americas interest as well as being good for international stability
2792091 so instead of trying to detract from the central issue i wish senator obama had actually confronted the issue not trying to detract our attention by focusing on a mccain adviser
2792092 i believe what senator mccain is proposing is totally totally wrong

2792098 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2792099 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2792100 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2792101 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2792102 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2792103 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2792104 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2792105 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2792106 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2792107 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2792108 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2792109 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2792110 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2792111 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2792112 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2792113 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2792114 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2792115 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2792116 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2792117 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2792118 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2792119 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2792120 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2792121 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2792122 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2792123 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2792124 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2792125 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2792126 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2792127 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2792128 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2792129 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2792130 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2792131 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2792132 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2792133 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2792134 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2792135 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2792136 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2792137 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2792138 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2792139 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2792140 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2792141 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2792142 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2792143 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2792144 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2792145 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2792146 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2792147 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2792148 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2792149 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2792150 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2792151 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2792152 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2792153 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2792154 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2792155 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2792156 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2792157 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2792158 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2792159 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2792160 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

2792185 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
2792186 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2792187 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2792188 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
2792189 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally costarred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
2792190 we are heartbroken he will be deeply missed he was a wonderful kind and gentle man
2792191 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2792192 its not fair that some peoples last memory will be stories of him being scolded by barack obama he was better and smarter than that

2792214 one of the most noticeable consequences of climate change in the uk is the frequency of mild winters as a direct result of this aphids seeking new sources of food are appearing significantly earlier in the year and in significantly higher numbers
2792215 we have been studying the seasonal biology of aphids for a long time now and we know that populations can continue to grow over the winter and spring provided that conditions are warm enough
2792216 after a warm winter there are much larger numbers flying and they are hence detected much earlier this means there are more aphids flying in spring and early summer when crops are particularly vulnerable to damage
2792217 they had no effect whatsoever on the power station it genuinely was business as usual
2792218 if the government gives permission to build this power station we will be back to stop it and not just here but all over the country we will disrupt the building of the site and as materials will have to be sourced from other places we will be taking action all over the country to stop them getting here as well
2792219 we know that wind energy can and must play a critical role in securing our future needs
2792220 but our review of wind energy in the country finds that there is an urgent need to reassess the current policies and incentive structures so that the business of wind gets serious about generating power and not just installing wind farms and reaping benefits from fiscal incentives
2792221 in the current scheme which gives an accelerated depreciation benefit of 80 per cent and other tax incentives for installation of the plants wind energy has become the business of cash rich investors who take advantage of tax benefits and are not serious about generation of power
2792222 the current business is not geared to generation of power and increasing efficiencies and reducing costs this is clearly not good if we want wind energy to play an important role in our future energy security
2792223 the indian wind energy sector needs to be re energised and for that to happen policy needs to change and get real
2792224 but this step is too little too inadequate and too hesitant to change the business as it operates currently
2792225 using the rps to build an india wide market for green energy
2792226 there is much to be said for starting with very low effective prices for carbon until major global emitters also take action but to signal to business that future prices are likely to climb steeply
2792227 why should we sacrifice storm boy country so that big business can grow crops in the driest continent on earth
2792228 why have we abandoned our international obligations to the lower lakes so that managed investment schemes can fatten the wallets of well heeled city investors who couldnt find the coorong on a map
2792229 changing the nature of those wetlands from the point of nomination as is happening to the coorong and the lakes contravenes that piece of legislation
2792230 there is enough water in the system we know that he must find enough water and send it down to save our precious lakes

2792245 the participants demonstrated a perception that not having to attach receipts to the return creates a temptation for electronic filers to overstate their claims for deductions and credits
2792246 they believed they would not be caught as long as the overstatements were relatively small

2792254 fencing dozens of sites for the facilitation of energy development is not what we had in mind when we supported the designation of the monument
2792255 they are part of the eyes and ears on the ground
2792256 we need help either from volunteer groups or law enforcement

2792265 i couldnt get that things like this could happen like this all these families were involved with their kids i couldnt understand what was going on
2792266 it was a change in attitude knowing i had more to do with my life
2792267 i realized that if i dont do something i could end up doing this for the rest of my life

2792273 georgian missile patrol boats today made two attempts to attack russian military ships the russian ships opened fire in response and as a result one of the georgian ships carrying out the attack was sunk
2792274 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2792275 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a cease fire and termination of hostilities
2792276 not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armor and increased attacks on tskhinvali
2792277 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on unprecedented scale
2792278 the russian side brought in facts about the presence of georgian forces in certain neighborhoods of tskhinvali
2792279 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on cease fire and termination of hostilities
2792280 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2792281 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2792282 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2792283 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia

2792296 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

2792328 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
2792329 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
2792330 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
2792331 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him
2792332 im sad that my daughter will never know or be able to feel how much he loved her
2792333 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
2792334 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
2792335 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2792336 there is no question about it wall street got drunk

2792345 one of the mistakes the u s government makes with respect to the united nations is to treat it as an ally it is not in todays world and give the offensive the un has mounted to increase its authority the organization must be treated as an adversary one that is persistent not passive
2792346 i think this is a serious poison in the national discourse
2792347 the georgians have offered a cease fire the response by the russians has been to step up the attacks continue bombing civilians with strategic air assets and then to reject the notion of any international mediation at all its very difficult for us to understand that

2792403 reveals several extraordinary though unsurprising facts regarding americas torture regime
2792404 america has never had a question about its moral integrity until now

2792420 we have a number of businesses that depend on good air service
2792421 its going to be much harder for us to convince a high tech company that they should come here it hurts
2792422 we have a few airports out there that i think are spending more than they should quite frankly and so there are some real total airport cost increases that we are very vocal about
2792423 the more you raise fees the more you drive airlines and customers away
2792424 its rhetoric ive heard for 41 years but i understand
2792425 these folks arent sure if theyre going to be in business in six months

2792433 at the end of the day indiana jones and the city of the gods is 100 a better script than the one that was shot for the film this would have been the right way to close out the series and it would have been a return to form that no one could have expected instead of a movie that everyone places just above the abysmal temple of doom in the indy canon

2792460 body weight maintenance is made up of three basic stages
2792461 in the first stage the brain receives sensory input from the body including information provided by circulating hormones such as leptin and ghrelin and from fuels such as glucose and fatty acids
2792462 it is well known that agrp agouti related protein neurons play a critical role in feeding and energy balance regulation
2792463 however the deletion of agrp and npy two neuropeptides released from the agrp neurons produces little metabolic effect
2792464 the mice with agrp neuron specific disruption of gaba release were lean had higher energy expenditure and showed resistance to diet induced obesity
2792465 we also found that these animals showed reduced food intake response to the hormone ghrelin this suggests to us that the neurocircuit engaging gaba release from the agrp neurons mediates at least part of ghrelins appetite stimulating action
2792466 as these new findings demonstrate gaba release is an important component that mediates the function of agrp neurons
2792467 discoveries such as this will ultimately help us to design an efficient strategy to tackle the current epidemic of obesity and metabolic disease

2792502 its been nice to see what jeff has done for us

2792504 this is a fresh beginning thats the way im looking at it
2792505 i think everything is behind me the broken leg the groin problem everything i feel really good right now and its something that i needed its all about opportunity now i just have to keep up what ive been doing
2792506 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2792507 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2792508 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2792509 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2792510 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2792511 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2792512 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2792513 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2792514 initially when he was hospitalized we expected him to come back home but as the weeks went on i kind of knew
2792515 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
2792516 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
2792517 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
2792518 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him
2792519 im sad that my daughter will never know or be able to feel how much he loved her
2792520 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
2792521 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
2792522 we get a lot of questions about whether all inclusive deals are cheaper

2792524 i was never employed by the tat not in 2004 or at any other time
2792525 anyone who says i was tat governor is a liar and will be sued for libel and slander
2792526 never mind what it says on our party website or our posters or on our election campaign flyers referring to her as former tat governor those are typos
2792527 i was involved in a project to develop data recovery software solutions but it got shelved as the company was not able to import it so i decided along with my two partners to start a business with that project and were successful in getting a client
2792528 initially we were saddled with finances and banks refused to give loans in the first year of operation we made losses and couldnt get clients as we lacked marketing and distribution expertise to take forward our business to the trade so in the second year we hired a distributor however in the subsequent 3 4 years we couldnt make any profit
2792529 it rocked a lot of business in the domestic and international market severely and so we offered solutions to recover lost data and serviced companies globally in dubai singapore russia usa and europe
2792530 initially online payment was slow but the revenue grew rapidly in the next five years now 60 of our business comes from online sales
2792531 it is supported by a inventory of 15 000 replaceable hard drives and does 24 transplants a day
2792532 we have invested 100 000 to open a laboratory in new jersey and we will invest 250 000 more in the next two quarters we want to expand majorly throughout the us as it is our largest market besides we are looking to acquire a small data recovery company in europe to expand our market there through both organic and inorganic operations
2792533 logistics as we understand is an extension of the word logic that needs to be applied in any venture that we wish to undertake we have simply applied it to the optimum in our endeavor to think out of the box and be a leader in providing logistics solutions
2792534 our sole mission is to offer single window supply chain solutions on the strength of well synchronized teamwork as we believe that though individuality counts but team work dynamites
2792535 we are always receptive to innovative ideas to improve our services further

2792542 the streets of the georgian capital are plastered with posters of george w bush alongside his georgian protege george w bush avenue leads to tbilisi airport
2792543 attacks by seperatists claimed the lives of at least ten georgian soldiers
2792544 despite our call for peace and a unilateral ceasefire separatists continued the shelling of georgian villages
2792545 clearly there have been incidents on both sides but this is obviously a planned georgian operation a contingency plan they have had for some time to retake south ossetias capital tskhinvali
2792546 possibly the georgians calculated that with putin in beijing they could recapture the capital in two days and then defend it over the next two months
2792547 so after a couple of days of skirmishing along the unofficial border between his forces and those of the separatists the georgian leader launched a full blown invasion whose aim his government said was to restore constitutional order that is control by the central government in south ossetia plainly the offensive was a gamble because saakashvili should have had little doubt about moscows readiness to defend the separatists moreover nato officials had repeatedly warned the georgian government against launching any attempt to resolve the dispute through military means still he pressed forward

2792584 queda de manifiesto que se ha atentado a uno de los rewe correspondiente al territorio lafkenche lago budi por la carretera de la costa en la comuna de saavedra
2792585 por tanto se denuncia al estado y al gobierno de chile por no escuchar y hacer caso omiso a nuestras peticiones para evitar la construcci n de la carretera en nuestros espacios sagrados y la incapacidad de solucionar los graves problemas existentes en los diferentes territorios de nuestro pueblo
2792586 dejamos claro que no es tozudez de parte nuestra sino de los que provocan por cuanto anteriormente hab amos invitado a la autoridad comunal y gobierno regional a conversar en el espacio ceremonial rewe weicha el d a s bado 2 de agosto a las 13 00 horas no acudiendo ninguna de las autoridades mencionadas

2792590 defenderemos hasta las ltimas consecuencias nuestras tierras y espacios sagrados
2792591 comenzando por el se or alcalde de puerto saavedra sr ricardo tripainao calfulaf por cuanto l fue quien autoriz y propici la construcci n de dicha carretera usando a las personas con enga o diciendo mejoramiento de camino pasando por encima de los estudios de impactos ambiental sociocultural llevado a cabo por la universidad de la frontera adem s el ministerio de obras p blicas y la intendencia estaban en conocimiento de los hechos y acontecimientos acaecidos en dicho territorio

2792598 he takes huge amounts of money from oil companies that are profiting in the former soviet union and many parts of the world
2792599 this has been one of the failures of the bush administration failing to build a strong relationship a mutually beneficial relationship with russia so wed have the kind of influence to persuade them to stop some of these very very dangerous efforts within their territory
2792600 experience is only positive insofar as it creates good judgment
2792601 and i think senator obamas strong case to the american people is that he will have the right judgment about how to balance americas military force with strong diplomacy to protect our interests abroad
2792602 john mccains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government
2792603 mr scheunemann proudly represented a small democracy that is one of our closest allies in a very dangerous region
2792604 the reaction of the obama campaign to this crisis so at odds with our democratic allies and yet so bizarrely in sync with moscow doesnt merely raise questions about senator obamas judgment it answers them
2792605 theyre an example of senator mccains push to spread democracy in that part of the world as a very important advance of americas interest as well as being good for international stability
2792606 so instead of trying to detract from the central issue i wish senator obama had actually confronted the issue not trying to detract our attention by focusing on a mccain adviser
2792607 my big dream is to have unity among the bolivian people

2792672 georgias actions are criminal whereas russias actions are absolutely legitimate
2792673 the actions of the georgian authorities in south ossetia are obviously a crime it is a crime against its own people first and foremost
2792674 a deadly blow has been struck on the territorial integrity of georgia itself which implies huge damage to its state structure
2792675 the aggression has resulted in numerous victims including those among civilians and has virtually led to a humanitarian catastrophe
2792676 time will pass and the people of georgia will give their objective estimations to the actions of the incumbent administration
2792677 it is based on an attempt of the georgian administration to get other countries involved in its bloody affairs
2792678 in accordance with international agreements including the agreement of 1999 russia does not only execute peacemaking functions but is obliged in case one party breaks the cease fire agreement to defend the other party which is exactly what we are doing in case with south ossetia
2792679 we perfectly realize what world we live in today we will strive for fair and peaceful solutions of all conflicting situations which we inherited from the past

2792692 i think what bernie mac did that few if any have been able to do was become a success here in chicago
2792693 most of our homegrown talent has to go to l a or new york to become famous but bernie he was selling out the chicago theater before he went out to new york thats next to impossible
2792694 whats interesting about bernies career is that he wasnt a mainstream comic at first his act was very edgy and very raw
2792695 bernie would talk about things that other black comics wouldnt talk about like skin color and how being a very dark skinned black man like him made his life very different from other peoples
2792696 he didnt so much cross over as people crossed over to him
2792697 you got to come with a little extra to satisfy them
2792698 when i started in comedy in the clubs in 1977 blacks couldnt do certain clubs not because they were segregated they just didnt want to put the black comics out there
2792699 if you let people put tags on you youll never be able to remove them
2792700 youve got to make people respect you respect is bigger than dollars and cents
2792701 i love you in a really really big pretend to like your taste in music let you eat the last piece of cheesecake hold a radio over my head outside your window unfortunate kind of way that makes me hate you love you
2792702 its a real honor for me to be with these young men who are the real heroes
2792703 but for a man or woman returning from combat who has nothing else its a lot
2792704 we just love the whole idea of this tournament it makes us feel that our sacrifices are being recognized
2792705 bushs basic conception of a global war on terror to take but the most obvious example has been poorly thought through badly implemented and has produced many unintended costs that will linger for years if not decades but blanket criticism of bush misses an important reality
2792706 whatever reasons and through whichever path the foreign policies in place now are more sensible moderate and mainstream in many cases the next president should follow rather than reverse them
2792707 in the last few years many of these policies have been modified abandoned or reversed this has happened without acknowledgment which is partly what drives critics crazy and its often been done surreptitiously it doesnt reflect a change of heart so much as an admission of failure the old way simply wasnt working
2792708 and were not going to let everyone else take the best
2792709 already weve begun to experiment with franchise operations setting up programs in the middle east china and elsewhere more broadly we should remember that increased competition is a good thing the list of the worlds top 20 universities is likely change in the years ahead americas great universities should welcome the newcomers and recognize that the whole world will benefit from their success
2792710 is where the russian push into latin america could work and the consequences for the military equilibrium in south america and in the caribbean would be severe forcing others into an arms race no one wants or can afford
2792711 similarly it would be wise for washington to refrain from any tough talk or humiliating language directed at havana
2792712 certain kinds of important stories that simply cannot be covered except by deep pocketed traditional media organizations employing professional journalists
2792713 unfortunately weve seen enough already from the iranian regime to suggest that it is very capable of this kind of action it boggles the mind that any regime on the face of the earth would want to do anything that could remind people of nazi germany
2792714 recognize this song with the first bar whether related to the theme of the song or not i have a relative veto in the project of music making
2792715 can i look at that for the rest of my life
2792716 un hombre que orden cometer cr menes de guerra que terminaron con miles de pac ficos civiles muertos no puede ser visto por rusia como un socio
2792717 cuando las tropas georgianas se retiren de osetia del sur y se firme un acuerdo de no uso de fuerza la paz ser reestablecida sin importar el destino futuro de saakashvili
2792718 es necesario combatir el problema de ra z evitar que este tipo de conductas sigan lacerando a nuestra sociedad y eso solo se conseguir con la purga de las corporaciones y con una inversi n fuerte que permita hacerle frente a estos delincuentes
2792719 aamir on the other hand knows his limitations and tries to select better scripts rather than the ones which allow
2792720 they will have to elect a new president and a new squabble will begin
2792721 the government has not done well in the first four months
2792722 to remove musharraf would make it look as if they are doing something it would be a huge political plus but that doesnt replace good governance
2792723 but pakistan has so many problems and the government does nothing to solve them
2792724 it shows that we are capable of great things we have a great young team who can compete with the guys who play for real madrid valencia wherever
2792725 i think in the beginning of the game we gave them too much respect
2792726 me personally i got mad i was like we can play with these guys i had seen our guys day in and day out these guys from holland arent gods
2792727 just blasted it on goal and see where it ends
2792728 if the wall doesnt jump and sibon bends it over the wall you say the wall should have jumped
2792729 its hard to predict that in that situation and when youre on the field you try to make the best decision at that time
2792730 as i told the guys in the locker room thats the way the game goes sometimes we have unfinished business and we should have taken care of this business tonight
2792731 this has no relationship to nor does it involve john edwards in any way andrew young is the father of my child
2792732 the core name is and will be our flagship pc processor brand going forward
2792733 expect intel to focus even more marketing resources around that name and the core i7 products starting now
2792734 the modifier is simply a means of separating the new and improved high end desktop processor brand from other existing processor brands and from future brands which will be announced later it represents a collection of factors and highlights unique features including performance and other features

2792740 there are four things i want to talk about today
2792741 the iphone is not standing still we keep making it better and better and better that was the second thing i wanted to talk about today no 3 is about itunes
2792742 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities
2792743 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
2792744 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty
2792745 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2792746 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple
2792747 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2792748 it shows people are getting proficient at analyzing apple software
2792749 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised
2792750 is the goal of the russian federation to change the leadership of georgia
2792751 sometimes those leaders need to contemplate how useful they have become to their people
2792752 it is uncommon for a healthy middle aged man to die from pneumonia
2792753 usually there is an underlying factor damage to the immune system of some sort
2792754 local search is a vertical strategy with the rewards of lower leads cost with higher sales conversation
2792755 reaching your customers on a local level is a multi step process with great rewards
2792756 most major advertisers dont know how to think about local online today and most arent taking advantage of current capabilities let alone all the emerging layers of targeting
2792757 the internet is fundamentally a research tool that helps people decide what to do and where to spend money
2792758 the dots need to be connected up and down the line to help lead me from offline prompt or stimulus to online research consideration to a pos offline once that becomes more transparent for advertisers then the internets full potential as an advertising medium can be realized

2792761 thanks to the concern of olympic organizers the chinese government and the cooperation of the korean government we have a huge and unprecedented opportunity to observe a large reduction in everyday emissions from a region thats very industrially active
2792762 capmex will be the very first uav campaign in east asia for air pollution and cloud interaction studies
2792763 this will be a very interesting experiment that can never happen again
2792764 ramanathans earlier research on atmospheric brown clouds demonstrated their importance in the polluted regions of the atmosphere
2792765 capmex takes this work an important step forward with new micro and nano sensor technologies these technologies will provide new estimates of solar irradiance aerosol cloud interactions climate forcing and important components of the biogeochemical cycles of the east asian and western pacific ocean region
2792766 black carbon in soot is a major contributor to global warming
2792767 by determining the effects of soot reductions during the olympics on atmospheric heating we can gain much needed insights into the magnitude of future global warming
2792768 the switching costs for people to leave a league to come over to another site is a significant hurdle

2792770 do you look at what yahoo has been able to do and say its just not worth taking a chance
2792771 21 last year ma though wasnt named in either one his character was named kevin lewis in the book and ben campbell in the movie in which he made a cameo as a blackjack dealer
2792772 its just us with a slingshot going against the big guys
2792773 youre right c thank you robbie for putting yourself out there and asking for input you didnt have to but you did and i admire you for it i find that to be exception al i know 1 corinth 5 isnt exactly going to bring revival but i wish you the best in however you choose to apply it
2792774 putting the team out of trouble is all i wanted to do because im a team player and i always will be my target was a lead of 250 for the boys so i came up short by about 50 runs which was very disappointing but my hundred wasnt really an issue to score 97 is as good as 150 today and im very happy to have given the boys a chance to pull through
2792775 i knew after harry got to 20 odd he was looking pretty comfortable at the wicket so i gave him a bit of freedom to express himself and back his ability
2792776 he proved me right because he batted well he can definitely stick around so i just waited for him to get to 10 or 15 and get comfortable thats when i started to focus on my own batting and get the runs where we could get them
2792777 but its a tough one because the new ball goes pretty quickly off the bat and you can score 50 in no time if the fielders are in the wrong spaces then again i saw just one or two slips so i had a go outside off and it worked in my favour as soon as they put a slip in there it would have obviously have changed my gameplan
2792778 it was disappointing to get out at that stage but i wanted just to try and keep scoring
2792779 we had andre nel at the other end whos a real tailender so id have liked to take most of the strike and keep the scoreboard ticking over
2792780 its given us a good chance tomorrow our bowlers havent really been where we know they can be in this series and tomorrow would be a good time to hit their straps and bowl like we know they can if we can get a couple of early ones i dont see why we cant push through
2792781 there was a bit in it for the seamers and monty panesar but doesnt deteriorate massively its also a quick scoring ground so if we get our heads down we should knock it off
2792782 you get more of a role in a four man attack but right now im being used as the fourth seamer in a five man attack and thats about creating pressure to get my wickets
2792783 im thoroughly enjoying it and though id love to become a strike bowler and a new ball bowler for england youve got to earn that right theres always a starting place so hopefully ill start to nip out a few wickets and move up the pecking order a bit
2792784 im pleased to have picked up five wickets in the game and i hope thatll get me on a bit of a role
2792785 im due a haul at some stage so hopefully thatll come next year what has stood me in good stead though is that after 10 odis i had about five wickets and i was thinking how am i going to get international wickets but after 30 ive got 40 odd now im used to not taking wickets at the start of my international career so im not panicking today is a start

2792788 i think this is an incredibly efficient actually a scarily efficient way of organizing society thats actually being celebrated here which is a hybrid of some of the worst elements of authoritarian communism mass surveillance of the population total lack of civil liberties lack of a free press lack of democratic rights authoritarian central planning all harnessed not to advance the goals of social justice even in name although there may be some lip service still paid to that but to advance the goals of global capitalism so it is stalinism meets global capitalism there are 100 000 security officers just on olympic duty and to put that into perspective the stadium itself the birds nest stadium holds 90 000 so theres 90 000 spectators and 100 000 secret police keeping control of things in beijing so this is an incredible operation but when you hear people like lou dobbs and other commentators talking about the problems in china its always red china communist china or the chi coms and its really this blast from the past of you know its almost as if the cold war never ended
2792789 it was a familiar scene the past couple of months barack obama out on the campaign trail during the

2792793 we thought how can we provide an incentive to get them out of that behavior
2792794 i think a big draw is the just the environmental aspect
2792795 and honestly i think that anything free when youre in college is good especially something like a bike that is worth something

2792799 so if there is mr weisenheimer a rich young widow making gooey eyes at you why should you not fuck her i ask you why should you not marry her when i come to think of it why didnt you mention how she looked when you were speaking of her
2792800 you know mom one day im going to totally break your fingers off and itll be your own fault
2792801 well have to be careful there are no easy games in europe away from home they will not be easy to face we will go there to play a good match and get a positive result but well have to be very concentrated
2792802 napoli can give me great satisfactions im happy but i have to keep my feet on the ground i know that i can do better than ive ever done at napoli and if i manage to play well for my club important things can follow

2792810 se haya colgado un cartelito en la puerta que dice aqu no hay cr dito
2792811 hay que reconocer que el ambiente financiero internacional no es el mejor de la historia y si bien no se va a agravar tampoco parece terminar all la cantidad de cr ditos para los pa ses emergentes se contrae y para la argentina que ni siquiera ten a acceso peor
2792812 una serie de factores locales que perjudicaron la imagen argentina y en ese contexto caus la ca da importante de bonos y en general cre un mal ambiente
2792813 hay expectativas que luego del conflicto del campo se tomen medidas de racionalizaci n dentro de la econom a y estas no se ven por ello ha vuelto el mal humor aunque hay que verlo en perspectiva ya que analizando las variables argentinas es imposible predecir una crisis a la nuestra una hiperinflaci n
2792814 hay una percepci n dentro y fuera de la argentina que hay variables tales como la inflaci n que se deben controlar y no se controlan
2792815 los bonos cayeron muy fuerte en la ltima semana a partir del episodio venezuela la venta de 400 millones de bonos pero es la continuidad de una ca da sistem tica que presentan los t tulos argentinos en los ltimos ocho meses
2792816 lo que se mira con lupa sostuvo en di logo con fm milenium son las cuentas p blicas argentinas que en el 2007 estuvieron bajo presi n con aumento del gasto p blico del 50 por ciento y una p rdida importante en el super vit

2792821 owning your first property used to be a rite of passage but nowadays the challenge is to save enough to cover the stamp duty and fees not to mention the worry of affording the mortgage
2792822 it is no wonder owning your own home seems to be a fading dream
2792823 several lenders such as halifax c and g nationwide bs and hsbc have trimmed their mortgage rates over the past two weeks which has resulted in the average two year fixed rate dropping to the current 6 95 per cent
2792824 it is encouraging that at long last lenders are responding to the easing in wholesale borrowing costs and passing a discount on to the consumer
2792825 the market wont recover until the credit crisis has worked itself out and we are back to being able to get hold of lending on more reasonable terms
2792826 conveyancers leverage homebuyers ignorance of the process to charge extortionate fees
2792827 perhaps the introduction of key facts illustration like in the mortgage industry might make buyers realise what they are paying for and where the money goes
2792828 we had originally been looking at one bedroom flats but we ended up being able to buy a two bedroom house with a garden which were both really happy with

2792830 crosby will publish his interim report analysing the functioning of the secondary mortgage market on tuesday with his final recommendations to the chancellor due in time for the pre budget report
2792831 its clear that even with house prices falling affordability hasnt improved one iota
2792832 in recent months we have seen mortgage arrears increase the number of repossessions grow and new mortgages become more difficult to acquire
2792833 the credit crunch has prompted a flight to safety by borrowers who have been stung by dramatic rises in the rates on short term deals
2792834 at the same time lenders are increasingly keen on signing customers up to long term deals which offer them certainty
2792835 the first thing the government could do is introduce a tax break such as abolishing first time buyers and moving the thresholds up to ease pressure throughout the whole housing market
2792836 in addition the bank of england needs to pump more liquidity into the mortgage markets to ensure people are able to find funding for mortgages
2792837 whereas it used to be very much the retiring couple who were looking for somewhere nice to retire now with the first time buyers and younger couples are moving to france purely because its cheaper and the quality of life is better
2792838 theyre looking at the metropolitan areas the centre of france near paris and around that area rather than looking at the typical south of france areas
2792839 for first time buyers who have the adequate funds in place and can secure mortgages now is a time they can operate as opportunists and take advantage of the market and the properties and prices currently available
2792840 we are continuing to call on the government to cut stamp duty for first time buyers and move the threshold to give people a break
2792841 endless bland housing estates crammed on to the edge of towns are often unattractive they fail to deliver local services shops or open spaces
2792842 the residents end up driving into town for everything they need clogging up the roads no wonder local people so often oppose them
2792843 according to the annual halifax first time buyer review people taking their first step onto the property ladder cannot even afford to purchase a terraced property traditionally the least expensive property type in 71 per cent of towns across the uk
2792844 redrows easi buy scheme is making home ownership more accessible to first time buyers allowing them to own 100 per cent of their home today whilst deferring 25 per cent of the cost to a time when they have more funds available
2792845 i got him in the ribs and hell probably see that when he gets up off the floor
2792846 i did start slow and i let the occasion get to me but i hurt him with the same punch earlier and he was wide open ive definitely got the power and i proved it tonight
2792847 its going to be hard and im going to have to put everything into it to get a result but ive already beaten the cuban before
2792848 today ive beaten the world bronze medallist by 10 points so im feeling great ive got to deal with this sort of pressure and if i do it then hopefully ill get a medal for great britain
2792849 ive overcome this big step of getting into the ring for the first time and hopefully ill continue to improve im in a tough draw but ive got to stick to it and hopefully get through
2792850 everybody who goes into that ring is going to be nervous because of the venue and having the olympic tag on the end of it
2792851 it was a mature performance from the youngest member of our team its billys first big tournament and they dont get any bigger than this he showed so much maturity

2792859 converted maori land to perpetual leases and maori to an entitlement of peppercorn rentals
2792860 there are no claims or legal suits about it at the moment but they have been warned about it terribly theyve probably done this work to assess the risk of maori basically suing them
2792861 it wouldnt be a bad idea to flush them out so this report can see the light of day
2792862 ba and aa will argue that their alliance is now acceptable because the competitive environment has changed with the open skies accord on uk us routes
2792863 this is a complete red herring open skies which is only a temporary accord as it may be unwound in 2010 has not significantly increased competition on uk london us routes
2792864 some of the japanese and european brands will be able to capitalize on this and offer leases to customers who may have otherwise tried to lease a domestic vehicle
2792865 obviously im going to pay less in gas but im going to have to shell out some money to make that purchase
2792866 why not give it a go id have you can even eat meat and milk products throughout the day and not have any breath

2792868 it will be one of the toughest races for michael to win the world record will be in danger
2792869 if somebody 10 or 15 years ago would have said the 400 im will be won in 2008 in 4 03 8 id have bet everything i had or would ever get that it wouldnt happen
2792870 that was one of the most amazing swims ive ever seen in my life

2792872 the four of us set out to do something that not a lot of people thought we could do
2792873 going into the last 50 and looking to my right and seeing that i was ahead of ryan and laszlo i sort of started smiling
2792874 i just think he was caught up in the moment
2792875 there are a lot of middle aged men and women who i know that tell me that im an inspiration to them and theyre now doing things they thought they couldnt do
2792876 im hoping that my age paves the way for other athletes who maybe think theyre too old to do something
2792877 but getting bronze does still leave me a little bit hungry for things that are a little higher it will just drive me all week
2792878 would you take a financially satisfying 9 5 job over dancing if dancing meant struggling for money for a while
2792879 what am i supposed to get out of that old testament reading
2792880 what do i get out of this whats in it for me
2792881 real madrid did make a bid for cristiano i think it was by fax but the decision on what we would do was taken at the end of last season when they first started with their nonsense
2792882 we had dialogue with our owners but when cristiano stated at the end of last season that he would decide his future in the next few days the club decided he would not be sold there has never been any change we havent had any other dialogue with real madrid will there be a chance for things to heal no chance
2792883 a knighthood is an honour only given during someones lifetime
2792884 unlike bravery awards and medals they have never been granted posthumously in practical terms it would also be impossible to decide which of thousands of figures in our countrys history who were not knighted during their lifetimes should retrospectively deserve such recognition
2792885 the facts are that bob should have been knighted when he was alive
2792886 he was the greatest manager this country has ever produced and maybe if he had managed a club further down the east lancashire road he would have got the knighthood he deserved
2792887 it was a lovely touch the letter was very personal and a great deal of thought had gone into its contents he included my wife sandra young frank and the family in general whats more he meant every word of it and that means a great deal to me but thats sir alex for you its probably a side you dont see too much but one everyone in football knows about
2792888 publicly you see the ruthlessly driven side of a man that wants to win at all costs and thats what makes him such a successful manager probably one of the best in the history of the game
2792889 he hates losing but as i have always said show me a good loser and ill show you a loser but in truth you couldnt meet a more caring and compassionate man he has time for everyone let me tell you if a lower league manager calls him he will always call them back if someone is in trouble he is the first on the phone trying to help and if someone passes away in the football community he will think nothing of getting in his car and driving to the other side of the country to attend the funeral
2792890 he did have the right hump with me when i was at west ham and they failed to beat us and lost the title to blackburn in 95
2792891 sadly it isnt only limbaugh who has been making these kinds of comparisons
2792892 step away from the food or well blow your fucking heads off

2792895 now everytime your wrestling trunks get grabbed danny itll be even more humiliating as the bikini tan will be so obvious
2792896 listen punk i know that everyone has a price for the million dollar man and i think youre no different im going to offer you three hundred dollars to simply lay down before the match even starts and ill put a boot on you for a three count you wont get hurt you wont get embarrassed and youll make more money than you probably do in a week
2792897 see thats it boy take the money put it into your trunks for safekeeping and lay down
2792898 look at dibiase cinch the suplex in hes really got ahold of the youngsters tights
2792899 virgil get that piece of garbage and throw him back in here
2792900 before every match i put you jobber pussies through some paces to get warmed up for the match it helps me understand how much you weigh and gives me an idea of what ill have to do once were in the ring
2792901 listen you little punk how dare you think you can handle sid justice no one can handle me no one no one in the wwf

2792904 but mr watson its the traffic its terrible ill do my best
2792905 if youre late there will be consequences danny just remember that
2792906 danny watson is pissed he had to push our match back and rearrange the schedule get to the locker room and get dressed
2792907 i told you thered be consequences if you were late
2792908 after your match i want you and walsh back in my office
2792909 this is whats going to happen to you at superclash
2792910 yeah dusty rhodes will be there arn youre not going to beat him like you are this poor youngster stop the choke hold ref
2792911 might as well leave those pink panties up your ass boy because theyre going to be there all night long
2792912 this is about me being late right do you think were in trouble
2792913 all right danny you were 30 minutes late thats completely unacceptable in this organization you let down brian here me and everyone else in that locker room you have to accept responsibility for your actions
2792914 but im afraid we do have to address what did happen and you have to be disciplined for it
2792915 well i do danny i think it reminds you of what you did and will maybe keep you from doing it again
2792916 youll stand like that for 30 minutes the same amount of time you were late think about what you did
2792917 im going to make you into a jobber who will no nothing in life but humiliation
2792918 danny youre not going to be flying danny youre going to be a jobber dont worry its just for this match so you can prove yourself but if you want to be flying danny youll do this and youll wear these
2792919 you will if you want any career in this sport boy your match is in 20 minutes youre going against cowboy bob orton get ready
2792920 look at how orton is holding the rookies trunks in a military press the higher the trunks are above the mans buttocks the more leverage you have and those trunks are way above danny and orton has all the leverage
2792921 danny listen youre a great guy but i dont think this is going to work out
2792922 danny do you know what i just saw out there i just watched as my boyfriend got the crap beat out of him in front of 5 000 people and god knows how many on television and not only did he get the crap beat out of him he was wearing a pair of trunks that looked like a large pair of pink panties do you know how humiliating it was for me to have to sit there and hear the crowd taunting you do you know how embarrassed i was to be sitting by jessica and julie as they watached my boyfriend get treated like a sissy what the hell are my brothers going to say about this im sorry i cant go out with someone i dont respect
2792923 i did what you wanted now i want my old uniform back and flying danny to premiere
2792924 whatever wrestling career you thought you were going to have ended the moment you stepped into that ring in those pink trunks and proceeded to be humiliated in front of a tv audience no one will ever see you and take you seriously again from now on you are a jobber you will be my jobber boy youll usually wear these pink trunks but sometimes ill switch it maybe give you a yellow pair perhaps a floral pattern that will add to your humiliation you can be sure of one thing every match you wrestle you will be decked out in humiliating trunks and those trunks will be grabbed yanked and pulled up your ass and you will get the crap beaten out of you in every match ive got a whole horde of heels lined up to take you down guys like kevin sullivan barry windham arn anderson the barbarian terry funk nikolai volkoff i might even whore you out to some other promoter friends who are always looking for new jobber boys to get destroyed and get their talent over ill probably send you to some independent promotions as well you think its humiliating being destroyed in front of a large audience well its just as bad when theres only 50 people in some rinky dink high school gymnasium and every man woman and child in that place can see you being embarrassed and prancing around in your trunks this will be your life danny until im done with you
2792925 danny you have to read your contract better it says that i have complete power over your career and your character i can do whatever i want with you and you have to do it i know you sunk your life savings into going to our wrestling school you have nothing left and the contract also says that if you quit before your five year stint is up or if you dont follow my ideas for your character you will owe me the money on your contract think about that you quit youll be paying me off for the next 25 years youre a jobber now danny thats it
2792926 i thought you looked kind of cute in your pink trunks
2792927 shh be nice well listen danny all i can say is that i cant wait to see you in some more matches just be careful of those wedgies pantyboy
2792928 got a good match for you today boy kevin sullivan
2792929 something about seeing a hot well built young jobber in small trunks gets his ire up and he cant wait to make an example of you but ill give you a little chance to show something other than your ability to take humiliation the match is going to start with you on the offensive i want you to put together about two or three minutes of offensive wrestling show the crowd those skills you thought you were going to use your whole career theyll love it they hate sullivan theyll even be cheering for the kid in pink but then its going to go downhill for you and im afraid itll be pretty painful but heres the best part im not going to tell sullivan youre going to take the initiative at the start of the match your offense is going to take him completely by surprise oh boy is he going to be pissed and you will pay for it and kevins got a new manager not sure if you know jacqueline a gorgeous strong black former bodybuilder and she likes destroying jobbers nearly as much as kevin
2792930 we cant have you sprouting hardons on national tv every time youre out there getting your ass kicked
2792931 and your life is going to have a lot more humiliation and ass kickings and trunk pullings and exposed asses in the very near future and it obviusly gets you going
2792932 now danny this is a part of wrestling you probably havent heard about but a lot of guys do it they dont wanna get hardons during the match so theyll jerk off before the match but youre lucky im going to be the one to drain you
2792933 these trunks are going to get quite the workout tonight
2792934 the referee has to stop this sullivan is maiming this young rookie
2792935 look at yourself you little fairy look at the little sissy you really are
2792936 oh there wont be any draining today danny so you dont have to come back to the office
2792937 jim tony i want to make an announcement to everyone

2792951 well ladies whats the moral of this story never trust a man dressed in pink to do a mans job
2792952 you arre so disappointing danny rogers i should have known you were just a little wimp look at you tied up and nowhere to go as far as im concerned you deserve this
2792953 but were going to do a show at lakeland high school in ohio we like to go to the smaller towns and do cards to keep the wrestlers in the eyes of our true fans the people really appreciate it
2792954 thats right boy your hometown and former high school what you dont sound excited
2792955 me and my friends cant wait for your match tonight
2792956 yeah we cant wait its going to be fun watching you kick some ass danny a lot of people in town cant wait to see you
2792957 buzz its going to be a tough night danny just be prepared
2792958 he doesnt care at all about his own body and even less about his opponents he especially likes high impact moves suplexes slams throwing himself off ropes throwing opponents off turnbuckles action outside the ring that sort of thing and he likes to grab the trunks
2792959 danny have you ever thought of wearing the athletic briefs that a lot of guys wear under trunks they can help with the rideup issues i know you have with yours
2792960 and his opponent from lakeland ladies and gentlemen your very own danny rogers
2792961 creo que la otan y la onu tienen un deber moral hablar con una misma voz y detener la agresi n rusa

2792964 the mpaa is staring right in the face of a paradox and they must make a choice
2792965 they can continue to invest in the war on digital piracy as opposed to physical piracy which can be monitored and slowed by confiscating actual dvds and duplication equipment or they can invest in promoting the fun of going to the movies
2792966 invest in a positive message that can get people more excited about their member products and the unique experience offered in theaters
2792967 i get a daily report of all the torrents and other files available online
2792968 you know what i think about that so what thats what i think its collateral damage
2792969 could you please please please use the money you are going to spend fighting the unfightable and instead spend it on promoting the fun of going to the movies more people going to the movies is more people getting excited about movies more people getting excited about movies means more people watching movies on tv which is good for revenues and more people buying dvds or legal downloads of the movies again good for revenues

2792977 it was so thrilling that we actually got away with it
2792978 im glad it ended when it did it would have been a mess
2792979 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is
2792980 at some point in our lives you have to have some sort of accountability i cant see how people in my situation deny that
2792981 to know how truly sorry i am and i am willing to pay
2792982 i need to pay back i cant pay back monetarily this is the way
2792983 it was an experience its real strange to think on that and how i got here
2792984 i just heard shots pop pop pop i thought it was the police but no it was us
2792985 my wife was a wonderful person and didnt deserve this i fell for a coed it was stupid i sit in my cell and think how the heck did i get here
2792986 but i was a willing participant you can call it lust i really thought i would get off like a lot of people who are deluded
2792987 its hard to imagine someone knowing my ins and outs and still hanging in there thats scary because then its them choosing to love i can so much more easily think of loving someone that way than them loving me that way
2792988 in a way thats funny but also mean i dont do that anymore
2792989 no what you see is that he might do it behind someones back but you do the same thing you just do it to their face
2792990 and its usually clear that you mean it affectionately and goodness knows i do the same thing but you are really mean sometimes
2792991 whenever i find myself growing grim about the mouth whenever it is a damp drizzly november in my soul whenever i find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses and bringing up the rear of every funeral i meet and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street and methodically knocking peoples hats off then i account it high time to get to sea as soon as i can if they but knew it almost all men in their degree some time or other cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me
2792992 so lets go how do you take to the sea

2792996 drive safe tell scott hi and in ten years if all that doesnt work out call me and well buy a house somewhere rural but close to the city so that you can advocate for immigrant rights and i can still breathe
2792997 i might call you a lot sooner than ten years

2793145 we want to give our visitors an experience thats on par with what they expect of las vegas
2793146 a night out in vegas should be dazzling exciting and one of a kind and the real action stunt stage definitely plays a big part in that
2793147 we are honored to have jenny mccarthy as our first celebrity bunny dealer she is an icon and great representative of the playboy brand and i couldnt think of a more perfect fit
2793148 lax is going to blow people away with its sheer beauty and design
2793149 when guests come to lax they are going to be treated to a nightclub experience unlike any other and one that leaves a lasting impression
2793150 lax will have that extra wow factor that other clubs are missing
2793151 we are excited for our guests to experience this one of a kind venue
2793152 i love all the people at harrahs the theater is beautiful and the audiences have been fantastic when they say ive been extended does that mean im taller
2793153 rita has been an absolute home run for us from her very first performance

2793160 dover not sure about evolution here in new jersey were countin on it
2793161 ive spent 15 years creating and evolving a concept that the world of entertainment has never seen
2793162 now im thrilled to be working with cirque du soleil and felix rappaport and his amazing team here at the to create an experience that goes beyond even my wildest expectations
2793163 this production represents a new distinctive type of creation for
2793164 while the unloading of the division may help ge begin its process of moving slow growing divisions out of its portfolio it is likely to be seen on wall street as a minor deal and part of a process that is taking much to long
2793165 i think it is going to be a problem in the current climate especially for parents with children who all want the latest strip but i think this is the way clubs are going now i would rather they went back to the old system of changing the strip every two years but i cant see it happening
2793166 i think new kits every 12 months does put pressure on people to buy the new shirts because they want to have the latest design that the players are wearing
2793167 since umbro took over supplying everton in 2004 we have had three new strips every year
2793168 it has been our policy for a number of years to change both the home and away strip each season
2793169 a survey of fans suggested they want new shirts each season
2793170 most clubs are now changing their strips every 12 months we arent any different
2793171 argentina use a lot of line out drives but with the sacking rule coming in with the elvs experimental law variations it made it very difficult for them
2793172 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2793173 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2793174 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2793175 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2793176 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2793177 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2793178 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2793179 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2793180 i got a really good start and knew that i needed to get away as early as possible i was feeling really comfortable on the airwaves ducati but saw from my pit board that the gap to the guys behind was up and down all the time
2793181 i came into turn one and as soon as i touched the brake i was down it was a really strange crash because everything felt normal right up until that point im feeling sore but ill be back training in a couple of days preparing for cadwell park

2793186 hell get it off and that guy is a freight train
2793187 we dont have any hesitation with playing no 14 at quarterback
2793188 i thought he stepped up in the pocket and made a couple of nice plays brad starks is a natural and im hoping that he can be the starting slot wide out guy be a little bit of both and then be the third quarterback thats the plan it was good for him to play and now he knows that hell be thrown into that situation
2793189 that has been the biggest thing and im still working on that as a safety you have to concentrate on open field tackling because youre the last line
2793190 i told them we play the half next week were going to get up to where we can play the second half
2793191 after that our scrimmage on the 16th and once school begins on the 18th what well do then is start getting ready for villanova
2793192 honestly speaking there is some resentment among the parliament members about the new change
2793193 this new location will expose us to assassination by ieds or gunfire

2793213 it would cost 6 819 per gallon yikes have a great day and keeptexting chacha chacha told me how to get paint off the carpet what my horoscope was for the month of july
2793214 we at chacha think youre the best too our customers are very important so let us know if you need anything 24 7
2793215 we need a commander in chief who will end the war in iraq but will win it the right way and thats by winning it
2793216 nunca pens en musicales como franquicias pero funcion con high school musical y la idea de volver a trabajar con ese elenco y crear nuevo material y m sica es un sue o hecho realidad
2793217 this reminds me of the story of the kiwakw marching in the shadows of caves and old woods to prey on the lonely
2793218 i dont know what i do and dont believe in anymore
2793219 then believe in odzihozo the self created titan with no legs whose dragged body lends the world its contours
2793220 so what happens to him in the end of the story
2793221 they cant notice only one of us can they they need a group
2793222 i believe so monsieur corbeau the moos bas are indeed interested in us but not if we are too few or spread too thin the object of their design seeks a mass gathering of human beings a crowd
2793223 once it has expended its supply of defensive effluvium it must spend a week to generate a fresh supply as a matter of biological economics a skunk is obliged to be selective in whom it targets
2793224 youre saying these things are going to start spraying people
2793225 i think im following you detective you think theyll get the best bang for their buck if theyre attracted to crowds right you think theyre somehow rigged up that way
2793226 then theyre not really moos bas are they not really
2793227 theyre something else entirely this isnt about the ghost world at all this is about a weapon
2793228 we should go back and call the cops right or maybe animal control or the army i dont know but we gotta call somebody
2793229 what the hell are we going to do a bunch of dumb indians sweating in the dark
2793230 close your mouth gerard you whine like a white man and doubt like one too
2793231 if i hear you speak against our kind again ill thrash you as if you was still a kid right
2793232 being indians isnt our weakness today its our strength remember that were hunting animals in the dark we are in our element you will not spit on the memories of our ancestors by being a coward
2793233 we will track them with our feelings when i was young i could smell a deers walk after the rain
2793234 we must have penetrated through to the old catacombs eh
2793235 four hundred years ago the iroquoians built them to hide their people from champlain they moved underground rather than die at the feet of france
2793236 the hochelaga iroquoians disappeared over two thousand of them in a single season they left no descendants no words no graves
2793237 some say they moved to the centre of the earth and that theyre still there living in peace where europe can never touch them
2793238 its air moving right you hear it in caves its nothing
2793239 you know what it almost sounds like i swear i could almost hear a train down there
2793240 this could be important i hear it too its receding now quiet can you hear
2793241 it is a train could it be the lost iroquoians
2793242 in my experience monsieur corbeau people who wonder too freely about inexplicable subterranean railways tend to meet unpleasant ends
2793243 but theyre not leaving me alone here help ger detective help me
2793244 come to me raccoon spirit ive never needed you more
2793245 lighter than air fragile to have a significant effect it may need to be released in an enclosed space
2793246 it seemed to have a pretty fucking significant effect on etienne
2793247 lets keep moving its what he wouldve wanted right you with me
2793248 its its incredible how could this its practically a whole city be sitting here underground under montreal for four hundred years with nobody knowing about it
2793249 the mink tracks go off this way come on any idea which direction that is
2793250 you got a compass built into that trick leg of yours guy
2793251 what the hell is that its just hanging in the air too big to be a firefly
2793252 observe carefully that is the underside of the head the apparent eyes are false like the eyes on a butterflys wing watch as it turns there much tinier eyes on either side of the antennae those are the real ones
2793253 its kind of like a stick insect or maybe a praying mantis its just a bug eh but why does it look like it has a freaking face
2793254 i cant be sure without taking a nap can i use your lap for a pillow
2793255 there are any number of reasons why one species might grow to simulate the appearance of another but i do not think the usual forces of natural selection are in play here this is like the mottling on the awa hon do carapaces or the white patches around the eyes of the moos bas an external agency has acted upon their lines to artificially select for human resemblance
2793256 like i said i cant be sure without testing it in sleep but one possibility does suggest itself
2793257 the same reasons people have ever had for rendering human likenesses to aid in the formation of a relationship with a non human object it is totem sir
2793258 this is why the megaliths of easter island have faces this is why our architecture is designed according to the proportions of the body it is an age old way of subverting the social emotions and repurposing them to stimulate a bond and thereby sensitize perceptions
2793259 a large part of the brain sir is devoted to navigating the subtleties of a bio social existence this powerful subsystem can be harnessed for other purposes people have done so for at least a hundred thousand years anthropomorphizing aspects of their environment in order to engage with them using social tools
2793260 the brain is a highly flexible organ but its emotions leave their mark i believe these animals may have been bred by someone alienated from society as servants and substitutes
2793261 it is possible we have no way of knowing but their current function seems clear enough they are signposts lighting the way
2793262 observe in the distance there is another and another after that
2793263 i used to work for public works when i was teenager right this gives us the direction and distance to the pump a hundred and six meters north by northwest
2793264 unless im totally lost though i cant figure out why wed be near a substation i mean the water pressure is managed centrally on the island itself except
2793265 except for the big o guy except for the freaking stade right oh no
2793266 were heading right underneath the olympic stadium detective and its a summer weekend night there could be sixty thousand people up there
2793267 i mean that my artificial limb has run out of power it may have been drained when i caught etienne at the chasm
2793268 once we get out of here you can turn the key to wind up the auxiliary motor ill only be able to move my digits and wrist and not with much strength but it will have to do until i can get to an electrical outlet
2793269 yeah but how are we going to climb out of here if you cant climb
2793270 i will be forced to presume upon your strength sir
2793271 oh great this is going to be fun i can just tell
2793272 come up beneath me i will i will sit on your shoulders
2793273 this one is for you the other is so you can save someone
2793274 seems like a lot of trouble to save just one person doesnt it
2793275 certainty not this is a private function for the monsanto company ill thank you to leave immediately
2793276 i dont know what sort of tomfoolery this is but you will leave this instant and i advise you to collect your personal effects because within an hour youll be without jobs
2793277 but i do know that is a question that is only ever asked by people i dont care for
2793278 i resent that just because im an indian and im disrupting your shit doesnt mean im drunk thats racism eh
2793279 you would rather squirm and scamper to save your pathetically small life
2793280 im not surprised i never am anymore flee mrs gillis but dont bother coming to the office tomorrow or ever again
2793281 silence for sport and victory i will clear this up personally
2793282 taking control of a situation is simply a matter of preparation and decisiveness you brave on the floor
2793283 were working to avert a tragedy sir your actions imperil thousands
2793284 first youre going to lie on your front with your hands laced behind your head second youre going to tell me why you have gas masques
2793285 i will shoot you both i own too many judges to bother thinking twice about it
2793286 do you know who that is guy thats freaking cherry nuk nuk the worlds most kick ass inuit pop singer
2793287 okay montreal this is a new one called lick my laurels ready one two three four
2793288 ladies and gentlemen we have a fire situation please exit the stadium in a calm and orderly manner attention attention this is not a drill please exit the stadium at this time
2793289 i think i broke my leg but ill live eh
2793290 no they just sort of died all of em look even the ones on the stage
2793291 can i ask something at this point does anyone know what the devil is going on
2793292 its all gone just like that like it never happened
2793293 that happened it wont be long before they develop the compulsion
2793294 its a long story dont trouble yourself aglakti that way youll have an easier time being honest when they come to ask you about the gas line rupture
2793295 a lot of things that happen to me get written up as gas line ruptures the authorities seem fond of it as a catch all cover for destruction to be honest i dont know why the gas companies put up with it
2793296 but it was purposeful and planned enormous resources were expended and a certain mr yohann in the monsanto skybox seemed aware and possibly involved
2793297 well that makes sense if theres one man with big ass resources itd be yohann hes a billionaire hes one of those guys trying to get a private spaceship thing going
2793298 and so now hes like king of the killer fart gophers
2793299 this is just the sort of thing my rider specifies i shouldnt have to tolerate even in australia
2793300 you were awesome in that maze movie you know with the muppets and jennifer connolly
2793301 mr odanak and i have some actions to account for
2793302 anything you did you only did to save people mr miss well tell them right david
2793303 why are you standing all the way over there gerard i think you should let me give you a hug
2793304 uh the detective and me sort of slogged through some raw sewage earlier we we kind of smell right

2793306 bring me a wheelchair three pillow cases a towel and two meter sticks
2793307 and then were going to bust out of the hospital
2793308 youre not getting rid of me so easily this time mr miss cherry nuk nuk is on the case
2793309 shut up this is where were supposed to put our hands together and then throw them off and cheer right but you know
2793310 im sidekicking you mr miss and there isnt a damned thing you can do about it
2793311 officer that man the one with no arms and legs
2793312 hes very special to me can you please see that he doesnt have any trouble
2793313 this number is my assistant let her take care of any details this down here is my number in case there are any problems you know or whatever
2793314 is there anything else you need right now miss nuk nuk

2793321 america is much stronger but the competition is getting much stronger between our two countries
2793322 no one thought wed be within 30 points of the u s team tonight but we have played very well we are getting much closer to the u s
2793323 im emotional excited its a really good way to start
2793324 everyone is proud it felt great all the flags and people cheering
2793325 of course i saw the gap between them and us but it was a good test of our skills
2793326 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2793328 does anyone believe that it is possible to win the nomination without over these next two months raising all these issues on him wont a single tape of the reverend jeremiah wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
2793329 clinton began to grow angry according to a participants notes
2793330 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself she snapped and hung up
2793331 the backstabbing and conflicting strategies that produced an epic meltdown
2793332 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
2793333 the anger and toxic obsessions overwhelmed even the most reserved beltway wise men
2793334 h er advisers couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution s he never behaved like a chief executive and her own staff proved to be her achilles heel
2793335 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from any specific decision she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make
2793336 i dont mean to be an asshole but changes to important statements and other critical campaign communications simply have to go through howard
2793337 howard is the person who is ultimately responsibility for making sure that we deliver our messages the right way and i hope everyone will support and respect him in that role
2793338 this circular firing squad that is occurring is unattractive unprofessional unconscionable and unacceptable after this campaign is over there will be plenty of time to access blame or claim credit
2793339 i would be impressed if obama called on nancy pelosi to bring our do nothing congress back into session to hammer out an energy bill that is designed to strip oil of its strategic value and burst the oil speculation bubble
2793340 ik moet er mn eigen muziek op kunnen opnemen zonder gezeur en voor de rest moet het gewoon een asociaal snelle ragbak zijn
2793341 de enige reden waarom die zo duur is is omdat er een blu ray brander in zit en die dingen zijn ontzettend duur

2793609 it was obvious during our visit to nandigram that state authorities had not acted in an impartial manner
2793610 the political nature of this violence involving the ruling party of means there must be an independent inquiry to prevent impunity for the perpetrators
2793611 the tragedy of the reported rapes at nandigram has been compounded by the failure of the police to seriously investigate these cases keeping the victims at grave risk
2793612 weeks after peace had supposedly been restored we learned that the perpetrators were still roaming free celebrating their victory by threatening and beating up local residents
2793613 the authorities must show clear political will to end the climate of violence in nandigram
2793614 for lasting peace all those responsible for the violence must be prosecuted and the victims must receive redress
2793615 the accused generally belong to either political party we have taken the cases of the women away from the local police these cases are now being enquired by the criminal investigation department of the state police cid

2793619 i ran out into the courtyard shouting for help two men with big guns were standing there they started beating and kicking me they tore at my sari slapped me pulled my hair and cursed me meanwhile the others had set fire to my house as they left they threatened me and told me that they would kill my son i just lay there bleeding

2793621 well come back at night light your lamps and wait for us with open doors send your men away well come back to you at night
2793622 the chief minister may have said that he would not force us to leave but he was saying so many things and there was nothing in writing how could we trust him

2793639 last week me voice was a bag oshite i had to have a word with meself
2793640 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hard core family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2793641 one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have
2793642 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2793643 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather
2793644 i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
2793645 a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives
2793646 his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set
2793647 bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real
2793648 that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try

2793665 the downturn in the economy has affected people living in the private rental sector and the number of illegal evictions
2793666 where as landlords in the past are more forgiving of tenants if they get into rent arrears what we are noticing now is that a tenant who gets into a weeks arrears or a months arrears that the landlords are moving very swiftly against them

2793678 every test you go out to win and it would be massive if we could win this one
2793679 its been a good week for kev so far and weve got the chance to make it a very good week for him
2793680 hes very keen to start his captaincy reign with a win and so is everyone hopefully we can pull that off tomorrow
2793681 with the massive square its quite a quick scoring ground and if we get a head start and bat well its in our court and we should knock off 197
2793682 theres been a bit in it for the seamers and a bit of turn for monty panesar throughout the game but if the target started getting up towards 250 or 260 it would be a bit more dangerous
2793683 my target was to get a 250 run lead for the boys
2793684 i came up short by 50 runs so that was very disappointing
2793685 i was just trying to score runs i was not even thinking of my hundred it was never an issue
2793686 but we have a really good chance the bowlers have not really been where they can be so tomorrow will be a good chance for them to hit their straps and bowl like we know they can
2793687 if we can pick up a couple of early ones i cant see why we cant push through
2793688 they were pretty negative to me which was expected and just happy to bowl at the others which made life pretty tough
2793689 but they got worried and needed those last wickets badly
2793690 i just wanted to put the team out of trouble i am a team player and always will be and 97 was as a good as 150 today

2793699 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2793700 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2793701 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2793702 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2793703 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2793704 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2793705 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2793706 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2793707 the state of massachusetts has asked a federal judge for a temporary restraining order preventing three mit students from giving a presentation on sunday about hacking smartcards used in the boston subway system

2793713 estar an golpeando personas y adem s impidiendo a otros ciudadanos que no son afines al prefecto estuvieran evitando que los delegados de otras tenencias lleguen al lugar para contribuir con la transparencia del acto electoral
2793714 al parecer hay una informaci n period stica al respecto sin embargo consideramos que estos casos tienen que ser denunciados oficialmente ante las instancias pertinentes en este caso la polic a el ministerio p blico para que se investigue
2793715 para que se desarrollen las investigaciones correspondientes e identificar al o a los responsables en la hip tesis que esto hubiese acontecido
2793716 hasta las 10 de la ma ana el 98 5 por ciento de las mesas que estamos observando se ha instalado y la jornada electoral est transcurriendo con normalidad
2793717 because he bainimarama did not agree to support the sdls agenda
2793718 in all there were about 14 16 attempts to remove the commander
2793719 at that time there were some renegade officers who actually stood against the commander and actually rebelled there were officers who tried to remove the commander and take up appointment as commander when the commander was away
2793720 it was a rude awakening when they suddenly realised that the army stood by the commander and was united
2793721 we are confident in saying that the military is 100 per cent behind the commander the commander has the full support of all the officers and soldiers in the camp we are all together and in support of the vision of what military represents we all support what the president has mandated
2793722 but there were elements within our society and within the government circle at that time who had other intentions
2793723 in 2000 we were quite vocal in terms of prosecuting individuals who tried to destabilise the society
2793724 we started telling political parties not to bring in an agenda which basically undermined the society
2793725 but the introduction of the qoliqoli and many other bills were not in the best interest of the country
2793726 we have identified the ministries or departments where there is an urgent need to boost the performance we saw individuals in the military who would be best placed to do the work hence we allowed them to move out and assume those positions
2793727 i think the word is not unhappy we wanted to bring about reforms at a faster rate we want to expedite things so that we could move faster to benefit the people and what they are supposed to be given
2793728 leave in the army by law is of right its the right of every officer and soldier to enjoy leave leave is of right and cannot be forfeited whether you have a day or 100 days of leave the law does not permit forfeiture
2793729 the psc has no function or say in how the rfmf is to exercise its leave provisions psc regulations do not govern the rfmf hence they have no say in the way we manage our leave
2793730 this has been done since the inception of the forces
2793731 since 1978 the rfmf has been participating in numerous peacekeeping missions we were in lebanon sinai iraq and east timor with the number of service personnel we had in the army turnover from one mission to another is very quick we had some officers and soldiers coming back and staying in fiji from 3 6 months when they were rotated back into a mission for them having the opportunity to be in fiji and take leave was not there
2793732 we made the decision to ease the burden of the rfmf we took it as an opportunity that if we pay these officers and at that time when we did the payment we would be saving money there was a five per cent pay reduction
2793733 we should not be accumulating leave but the exigencies of service in the rfmf were such that we had to do that unfortunately we had allowed this to happen we should have stopped it a long time ago we have taken remedial actions to stop accumulation of leave and the payment is one way of trying to rectify this problem another way is we are trying to send service members on leave
2793734 we have had three meetings already they have indicated to us the documents they want and we will meet next week to go through the files and submit to them all the remaining documents
2793735 we have nothing to hide we will be very transparent we will show them everything we have done in fact we will go to the extent to show them all the documents in the personal files of the commander some senior officers and some other ranks in the military who have been paid
2793736 i walked up and asked him what he was doing
2793737 he said you and your muscleman dont scare me ill protect myself
2793738 that was what i was trying to do 50 years ago and the attorney general of texas stopped me
2793739 when he broke ground on jamaica beach he was only 30 years old a young man with a vision
2793740 it was something very unique when you look at the desolate barren island land then who could have envisioned all the communities on the west end and where they are at today he might have been a little ahead of his time
2793741 jamaica beach was my favorite project because i was so personally involved in it
2793742 the rich people had a second home but the middle class didnt
2793743 the first thing we had to do is convince people they needed a second home and then we had to convince them that jamaica beach is where they wanted to be
2793744 i hate my life please help me i am going crazy right now
2793745 we got her away from him before it got worse
2793746 shell live with this for the rest of her life but we got her away from him
2793747 the thing i dont want is for this to go to trial and a jury to give him probation
2793748 the settlement gave those children a sense of security that could not be guaranteed if they had to sit across from him in the courtroom and testify before a jury
2793749 readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities

2793861 i was blown away by how good he looked tonight
2793862 i came with the right hand and i put it where i needed to put it
2793863 its one of those things i was stunned for a second
2793864 let me tell you brock lesnar is a mixed martial artist
2793865 heath herring was 29 13 and hes fought all over the world holland pride hes been here for two years and hes fought the best fighters in the world he got dominated tonight dominated by brock lesnar brock lesnar is a mixed martial artist no doubt about it
2793866 initially when he was hospitalized we expected him to come back home but as the weeks went on i kind of knew
2793867 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
2793868 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
2793869 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
2793870 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him
2793871 im sad that my daughter will never know or be able to feel how much he loved her
2793872 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
2793873 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
2793874 i have no idea ive not spoken to him about that as youre aware im sure senator edwards announced through one of his staffers he would not be attending the convention in denver
2793875 lets be very honest theres weakness when it comes to both political parties i feel very badly for john and elizabeth who are friends i know them and i know their families theyre going through a very difficult time i hope they can resolve this between them
2793876 obviously he let a lot of people down i feel for elizabeth but you know the public is forgiving obviously this is something between himself and his family and voters you know i feel for that family i still believe that john edwards is committed to reducing poverty i think his concern in the campaign was genuine
2793877 this is a difficult period you know but im just not going to be one of those that pile on richardson continued
2793878 and then you additionally you have the money angle which is fred baron big trial lawyer big supporter of john edwards paying millions of dollars to relocate rielle hunter and andrew young and his family the man who has claimed paternity for the child to california supposedly just out of the goodness of his heart and without telling john edwards
2793879 its not good to be talking especially when were going to see a certain former president speaking at the convention to be reminding people of peoples marital missteps on the other hand sexual misconduct and adultery is something of a bipartisan failing in washington and elsewhere so i think its not great for democrats but not terrible
2793880 we went out there and we tried to do our best and it didnt exactly work out how we had hoped for
2793881 but were young and were going to come back in 2012 and hopefully bring back medals
2793882 between a really really bad dive and a good one i can feel it but between an ok and a great one i can ever really tell
2793883 we ll keep training and come back in four years and win a medal
2793884 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
2793885 it was so thrilling that we actually got away with it
2793886 im glad it ended when it did it would have been a mess
2793887 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is
2793888 at some point in our lives you have to have some sort of accountability i cant see how people in my situation deny that
2793889 to know how truly sorry i am and i am willing to pay
2793890 i need to pay back i cant pay back monetarily this is the way
2793891 it was an experience its real strange to think on that and how i got here

2793898 a widespread movement of marxist education rectification means the whole party studying marxism through criticism and self criticism it is an arduous task to ensure a better life for the several hundred million people of china and to build our economically and culturally backward country into a prosperous and powerful one with a high level of culture and it is precisely in order to be able to shoulder this task more competently and work better together with all non party people who are actuated by high ideals and determined to institute reforms that we must conduct rectification movements both now and in the future and constantly rid ourselves of whatever is wrong
2793899 has nothing to do with the preparation of the games
2793900 its very sad whats going on in the world and we share the concern of the ioc but i would refer to the politicians for that
2793901 but personally i do believe that the olympics is something that can make things happen and im sure the olympic values and olympic ideals will be considered
2793902 it is a national problem and the ioc is not supposed to comment on situations like this we just hope that its going to be solved fast and it seems they made progress today we hope for the best
2793903 this is a wonderful opportunity for two organizing committees who have the same common interests to celebrate a little bit the time we have together in beijing

2793909 i think anyone who comes into the games wants to win a gold medal
2793910 we knew they were the world record holder to get a silver medal here against these athletes is a tremendous feat
2793911 its a great feeling i was looking at the medal and how beautiful it was i do have 10 i think michael phelps is going to surpass that
2793912 we knew america and australia were very fast and strong
2793913 i thought no one would go under 4 30 it hurt so much more than the swim i did at the trials its awesome im still in shock
2793914 i am a little tired but i am happy to get my first ever olympic medal
2793915 everyone in that race was i gave it everything i had you cant complain when you get a best time
2793916 its an honor and a privilege to be here especially to swim in front of the president
2793917 out back in the dressing rooms i saw the tv and i saw the president and i said the president is watching its time to step it up
2793918 we have had three practices the first one was interfered with by lightning again we have got to get that thing solved and the only way to solve that is to get a place to work out in inside it can kill you i tell you what you miss key practices the practices have been good people have been asking me about the freshmen coming in and all this and that what do you think about them and stuff like that its hard to evaluate when you are out there in shorts with no pads on you cant evaluate they all look good they all look like all americans they look like an olympic team out there there isnt anybody hitting anybody when you get your pads on thats when you begin to see what level a kid is on the good thing is as i watched them i havent seen anything bad i havent seen anything that i would say oh well he cant block he isnt as big as i thought he was going to be or that kid cant jump as high as i thought i havent seen anything negative with those kids im excited and im looking forward to getting the pads on and seeing who is ready for it we are going to count on more freshman this year more new faces than we have in the past some kids that normally would redshirt will not be able to redshirt maybe we will redshirt them later you know it used to be that you redshirted sophomores freshmen play on the freshmen team and it counted a year of eligibility now you do more redshirting with freshmen im anxious to see who can help us well get some help from them you hope you get enough then in the fourth ball game we get everybody back and if you keep everybody healthy by that time you should have a little depth to go with our football team
2793919 definitely the offensive line because of numbers you have three starters returning from the bowl game all three were freshmen one of them gets a blood clot and cant play this year now you are down to two then of course daron rose didnt make it and there is another starter out then i think with the suspensions you might have one guy who is going to be suspended and so the numbers scare you to death we simply have got to stay healthy there if we dont you might see a freshmen offensive line out there thats our biggest concern right now im not concerned about ability i think we have some talent there even these young boys that have come in this year these freshmen are pretty talented you know but total inexperience but i would rather have talent than no experience than experience and no talent
2793920 well we understood our situation last spring we understood how it was going to be we tested it in the kentucky game that could have been a disaster as it was it ended up being a pretty darn good football game so it shows you what you are capable of doing at least we know what we are capable of doing now if we get a little bit of help from our freshmen maybe we can survive our first three ball games
2793921 if they have confidence you know most of your freshmen that come in throughout the years their talent is unquestionable the question is do they think they are good because they go out there and find out gosh im not as big as they are building confidence is as big as any part of it some freshmen come in with all sorts of confidence like deion sanders there was no doubt in his mind he was going to play his first year deion terrell buckley some of those guys then we have others who have come and dont play for three years and then make all american its different degrees of maturity and most of it is up here
2793922 if we are smart we will if our coaches are smart they will do everything they can to make that kid think hes pretty good
2793923 well yes it would be a good motivating factor they arent picking us very high because we dont deserve to be picked very high all of your pickings are based on last year whoever is picked number one must have finished number one last year too we were always picked number one in the 90s we got preseason number one a lot we didnt win a championship every year that doesnt surprise me us being picked low i will tell you this though the fun part of coaching is trying to build its tough up there i would rather be up there but thats a struggle getting there is fun we are going to have some good times getting back
2793924 familiarity they are familiar with the boys this time last year they were not the boys were not familiar with their coaches they understand exactly what these coaches want and how to do it that part has been solved i believe
2793925 that goes back to the familiarity i was talking about they know what he expects and they know they better do it so why ask why ask the coach just do it they know what these coaches expect they know they better do it if they want to play so thats much stronger than it was a year ago
2793926 i would think so i would think that would relay to getting things done quicker better
2793927 well he isnt exactly looking over my shoulder i dont know what term you mean
2793928 thats been very comforting for me im not going to be here forever i dont want to fool these kids and say hey boys yall got five more years and im going to be right there with you thats a lie i aint going till im 83 right now i have no desire to quit im enjoying it as long as i can but still my days are numbered does that mean next year not necessarily does that mean the next year after that not necessarily its comforting for me to know its really helped our recruiting i have to go in there and explain to those kids and their mothers that im going to be here for five years well they are going to go somewhere else because the other schools will tell them that i wont now i can say im not sure how much longer im going to coach but this guy right here is going to take my place how do yall like him and they all like him he is a likable guy he is a knowledgeable guy so that has really been to my benefit
2793929 i dont know what would any coach do why would any coach decide to retire something will sake it out i dont have a routine or nothing
2793930 it could be that there are certain things i would like to accomplish before i get out
2793931 well it would be very bad to have another 7 6 season you aint showing any improvement you brought this new staff in and you arent showing any improvement i hate to get pinned down to numbers in case it happens laughing i dont want you to come in here and say next year and say i thought you were leaving yall were 7 6 last year
2793932 you know the thing about it is the thing about it darnet were losing so close i was talking to the team the other night in 2006 we lost by two by four by five by seven i think every we game we lost by seven or less except for wake forest they beat us 30 to nothing you are talking about one or two plays a game man if you do that you win so we have got to start winning the close games thats all there is you got to win the close games its not like we are getting beat 40 to nothing every saturday sometimes that can be one or two guys one more great linebacker one more great star we havent had a star around here in a long time im talking about a star you go out there and play a game and that kid if its close he is going to win the game when i was at west virginia pitt was our big rival we might have had a two or three game win streak over them and then they went out and recruited a guy named tony dorsett dorsett would get a long one every game 70 yards 60 yards i think he had three against us my first year but dorsett is going to get a long one every game well you start losing games by two points three points five points seven points then you have a guy like that and you have got seven before you even start the game one player a lot of times can make the difference one or two players i think we are one or two players away maybe they are in this recruiting class or maybe they are an underclassmen that is already here but hasnt broken out yet but is fixing to breakout i dont know were going to find out
2793933 i havent forgotten the coaches havent forgotten we dont forget stuff like that we just havent done it we just havent done it
2793934 i stress its about the first three if i talk about wake forest im putting those other two teams down ill be honest with you im worried about im concerned about those other two teams more than wake forest we can get our kids up for wake forest you know we better they have beaten us a couple years now what we better not do is slip up here or slip up there every year it happens to somebody
2793935 the thing you learn is that you have got a chance no matter what the circumstances you got a chance your quarterback played good your receivers played good you had three freshmen on the offensive line that played good you held your own against a team that was pretty well respected in the sec under dire circumstances
2793936 oh i think so you are looking for everything you can find to get them confident everything you can think of to get them confident so playing well against a kentucky team that was pretty good the fact you went out there and played well against those folks is better than playing bad
2793937 no i dont think so because we are going to use our judgment to determine if he deserves to go back you might be getting play from a guy that isnt quite good enough and so its very obvious you have to get this guy back in there you know they are first team for some reason i dont think that will be an issue i think it will be a joyous day to have everyone back
2793938 thats probably helpful thats helpful people ask me how you are going to prepare well you have to have two teams one for the fourth game and one for the first game right now we are working them all equally whether they are on the first or second team we are working them all equally they are getting the same amount of reps we are getting them all in shape at the same time eventually we will take the team that is going to start against west carolina and get them up on the first team get our older guys on the second team they will still be getting all the work but we have got to get a starting lineup feeling out of those other guys which we will get into at a certain time
2793939 yeah when i was young i can remember when i got laughed at in college when i was telling someone how old my uncle was who was 30 laughing coach what do you mean 30 thats young then of course i can remember when 50 was old i remember when 60 used to be old old is fifteen years older than what you are dont forget that because you are going to face that some day you hope laughing
2793940 oh he wont be here in five years hes getting up in age
2793941 ive heard that ever since age 60 especially that guy from clemson laughs
2793942 i know it i was just kidding about that you bet your life ive heard it terry bowden used to say that tommy and terry used to use that one
2793943 dvontrey is coming along he just needs work work work hes got some talent he could mess up that whole quarterback thing hes got talent once he gets consistency with that talent he could be a factor jimbo wants to play him some this year we want to use him in different styles like throwing a change up in the middle of a baseball game just get him in and throw a change up he can run so good and throw on the run he did good in the spring game
2793944 coach let me play a little at this other position
2793945 its his job to lose but those other guys marcus sims looked good yesterday he was running pretty good and these young kids have some talent its just a matter of whether theyre going to be mature enough to make the adjustment
2793946 id like to see him he needs to be knocking off a lot more long runs against kentucky he got a hundred some yards he needs to get 100 yards a game at least against kentucky he got loose one time for about 30 yards and the guy caught him from behind he needs to break that and get into the end zone hes got speed
2793947 yeah he nearly gets tripped up too much youre running good and somebody gets a hand on his legs his attitudes always good it looks like hes worked harder this year
2793948 i believe so but dont let it deceive you we still have to do it up front you dont block you dont have runners you dont block you cant protect the passer so we need real good play up there i think we have more skill
2793949 thats what i wish would happen i wish somebody would just take control and it might happen because that way you know youre in pretty good shape
2793950 im not worried about that it might come to that that you need the most mobile guy you could get back there there are other ways to handle that the quarterback has to know how to get rid of the ball when to get rid of the ball things like that if he doesnt it could be disasterous if you cant protect the quarterback i think our line will be better than that
2793951 they did improve we ran for more yardage than we did the year before when youre young you just have to get better we have a young group this year theyll get better
2793952 weve been working on it all spring all i know to do is go out and practice this spring we spent a lot of time on the 10 yard line a lot of time and we did well you just have to practice it its harder to score down there we probably moved the ball from 20 to 20 as good as anybody we didnt get into that dadgum end zone we go out against florida and kick four field goals you have seven points instead of three youd have a good ball game we didnt get it so we spent a lot of time on that this spring and well keep working on it
2793953 maybe not being physical enough when you get on the goal line youve got to knock people away you get out in the middle of the field youre just shaking them get to the goal line and youve got to knock them out of the way you got to have a little physical about you you dont and you have to throw every down
2793954 i think well get good play out of drew drew has started for four years his sophomore and junior year his sophomore year he threw for 11 interceptions i believe last year he threw one until the bowl game and one of those was an end of the game throw it up for grabs things if he can improve like that this year he could be that quarterback youre looking for and it might happen now you have ponder there trying to get his job too ponder would have to beat him out if my offensive line can play adequately i wouldnt be surprised if drew could have a good year
2793955 yeah preston has worked hard hes come back and really tried to earn himself back if he hadnt have gone home he wouldnt have been in that trouble he got with his old buddies but hes really been trying to make up for it since we got back
2793956 myron needs to start making some big plays hes played very steady for three years now you need to start intercepting that dang ball he needs to start making some big plays and he knows it wouldnt be surprised if he does that this year

2794165 oh gee why arent you concerned because obama isnt perfect you cant ever vote for someone who is not perfect so maybe all us democrats should just vote for bob barr this time
2794166 the truth is that no one would be paying any attention to me at all if i wasnt talking about things that really matter to a lot of people
2794167 the polls have to be way off with obama leading by 25 points
2794168 yes i am why arent you what do you have against the freedom of speech
2794169 you bet im a flip flopper when i get new information i reevaluate my position and make dynamic decisions i wont stay the course if it means driving over a cliff george w bush will

2794172 i am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponents youth and inexperience
2794173 i dont plan on exploiting my opponents lack of popularity and vision
2794174 attack the opponent for what we are secretly doing or our own weakness and put the focus spotlight on them while we get away with it

2794176 osa has been increasingly recognized as a serious and frequent health condition with potential long term morbidities that include learning and psychological disabilities
2794177 a growing body of evidence suggests that the adverse neurobehavioral consequences imposed by ih stem at least in part from oxidative stress and inflammatory signaling cascades
2794178 recent studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective activity of gtp in animal models of neurodegenerative conditions such as parkinsons and alzheimers disease
2794179 gtp treated rats exposed to ih displayed significantly greater spatial bias for the previous hidden platform position indicating that gtps are capable of attenuating ih induced spatial learning deficits

2794204 we have shown that a gene called p11 is involved in the multiple complex changes that underlie depression
2794205 our findings demonstrate that patients with depression and mice that model this disease have decreased levels of p11 protein and they suggest that drugs that increase p11 are likely to have anti depressant properties
2794206 in addition to exploring ways to increase p11 in depressed patients it may also be possible to develop peptide based compounds that can mimic the action of p11 to achieve a new class of anti depressant compounds

2794215 initially when he was hospitalized we expected him to come back home but as the weeks went on i kind of knew
2794216 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
2794217 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
2794218 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
2794219 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him
2794220 im sad that my daughter will never know or be able to feel how much he loved her
2794221 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
2794222 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
2794223 i am responsible for it i alone am responsible for it
2794224 fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want
2794225 i was there from a very simple reason because i was trying to keep this mistake that i had made from becoming public
2794226 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2794227 you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2794228 i dont know if the picture has been altered manufactured if its a picture of me taken some other time holding another baby i have no idea
2794229 i was not at this meeting holding a child for my photograph to be taken i can tell you that
2794230 i have responded to consistently to these tabloid allegations by saying i dont respond to these lies
2794231 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done
2794232 i think the longer these allegations go unanswered and unresponded to the more difficult it is for the people producing the convention to give him a prominent spot
2794233 but i would expect that he would not speak or have any role at the convention unless this is cleared up
2794234 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2794235 my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2794236 john edwards was a great champion of working people during the first of this campaign many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified at the convention
2794237 my thoughts and prayer are with the edwards family today
2794238 i think furious would be a good way to describe it
2794239 it is time for me to step aside so that history can blaze its path
2794240 who will take the final steps to 1600 pennsylvania avenue
2794241 a national reputation as a forceful and tireless champion for regular hard working people
2794242 the key this time is there are a fair number of battleground states that are becoming more diverse and maybe diverse enough to make a difference
2794243 the diversity used to be mainly in pretty safe states like texas california and new york
2794244 but is he generating enough enthusiasm to excite people who lack a formal education and are disproportionately young and not likely to vote
2794245 tend to pick up stories from the national enquirer with tongs
2794246 they have been very right about some things but theres been some misses too so its a little scary to follow on those stories
2794247 its also a little scary for big outfits to step up on a story like this sex may sell but it can really hurt your relationship with readers
2794248 we at abc were working on this story and if we had had any proof and any verifiable facts we certainly would have gone with the story
2794249 it was just a matter of were not going to put something on the air until we know that its true
2794250 we were able to prove i think with satisfaction to our bosses that there was money being paid to rielle hunter
2794251 this began to be for us an aspect of something we could report some hard facts
2794252 until he called and its on the record that he called us on friday and said i want to talk you know thats what broke the story he was willing to admit that he had been lying
2794253 but it became a ludicrous situation almost became a conspiracy of silence by the media and edwards meanwhile would not give interviews was not acting like a man who didnt have something to hide
2794254 i think at that point we should have earlier than we did told readers and viewers what we knew and we didnt know
2794255 i was taught when i was a young reporter that its news when we say it is i think thats still true its news when we say it is its just who we is has changed
2794256 members of the public people with modems people with cell phones are now producers editors they can push and push and push on a story until it ends up being acknowledged by everyone
2794257 on the plane ride over i was kind of thumbing through it looking through it just trying to remember it
2794258 one thing we have to get straight is this chad thing
2794259 were going to have to call him rook or call me c p or something
2794260 i dont know he looks a little thin he needs to eat some chicken wings or something
2794261 hes cool though ive played against him so many times he owes me some money though because i get all those personal fouls against him every year so i might take his shoes or something and maybe hell give me a ransom
2794262 its going to be a lot of fun im looking forward to it i really do
2794263 i dont have revenge on my mind or anything like that i have one thing on my mind and thats a victory period
2794264 i think when youre in this business you know that things can happen anytime
2794265 being in it now this being my second year ive seen things happen throughout the season the last year where hey its just the way this business goes its the nfl and you have to be ready to live with whatever happens it went down
2794266 they said over and over again theyre going to do what they have to do to help this team win
2794267 ive been there before i know what its all about i think it brings out the best in all of us and i think it makes our team better so im no stranger to that i welcome the challenge and i look forward to it
2794268 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2794269 house republicans have remained on the floor speaking directly to the chorus of americans filling the house visitors gallery requesting that speaker pelosi reconvene the house and allow a vote on comprehensive common sense approach to reducing the price of energy
2794270 there is nothing that the republicans are proposing that will have an impact on the price at the pump yeah 10 years from now 2 cents but what we are saying is free our oil in 10 days not 10 years and thats what we will keep pushing
2794271 the lawbreakers drove a taxi to the local public security office industry and business administration and other sites and tossed homemade explosives destroying two police vehicles
2794272 our leaders havent determined the nature of the incident yet
2794273 i dont know exactly what happened but whatever it was will make them even more worried about stability
2794274 want to use the platform of the olympics to amplify the effects
2794275 im not downplaying this race by any means but i have to put that race behind me
2794276 i have to act like it never happened because i have so many tough races ahead of me
2794277 going into the last 50 and looking to my right and seeing that i was ahead of ryan and laszlo i sort of started smiling
2794278 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2794279 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2794280 we had a deal i told bob that i wanted this to be my last 400 im he said i have to end on a record
2794281 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2794282 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2794283 i saw lochte was going slower and i tried to do everything to go better than phelps but i dont have enough power for that
2794284 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for
2794285 that was amazing setting another world record you cant ask for anything else that was a great way to start off the meet for usa
2794286 i sort of turned around and thought i saw 4 31 and i was thinking that hurt a lot for a 4 31
2794287 but when i walked over and saw the 4 29 i thought thats amazing
2794288 it was a tough race but i cant really be mad
2794289 i was only like a half second off my best time so im happy to get my first medal of the olympics
2794290 everyone did a great job and were really happy with silver because i dont think we were even expecting that
2794291 current policies to tackle hiv aids in africa emphasise individual behaviour such as the abc approach to prevention abstain be faithful condomise however these measures require that people have hope for the future and goals to aim for and if wider economic and social circumstances are so poor that people lack hope for the future then these current policies will have limited success
2794292 hope is quite straightforward to measure via questionnaires and surveys can help to identify high risk environments
2794293 although there is not a great deal of experience in developing programmes to increase hope policies such as cash support for children microfinance for small businesses womens education reduced discriminations against sexual minorities and health system reform will improve the wider environment and with more to live for interventions to encourage individuals to change their behaviour are more likely to succeed

2794311 i got a really good start and knew that i needed to get away as early as possible i was feeling really comfortable on the airwaves ducati but saw from my pit board that the gap to the guys behind was up and down all the time i came into turn one and as soon as i touched the brake i was down it was a really strange crash because everything felt normal right up until that point im feeling sore but ill be back training in a couple of days preparing for cadwell park
2794312 at the start of race one the conditions were tricky so i started off pretty steady to avoid making any mistakes once i felt more comfortable on the airwaves ducati the lap times started coming down and i was actually quicker than the leaders over the final ten laps of the race unfortunately after losing so much time at the start i couldnt finish higher than 5th i was feeling really confident going into the second race as i knew i had the pace to be fighting up the front but we made the wrong tyre choice for the re started race and i just didnt have enough grip its been a tough weekend a 5th and an 8th isnt what i had hoped for but at the end of the day weve secured some decent championship points and made up some ground on those ahead of me
2794313 race one was fantastic my rizla suzuki was doing just what i wanted it to and once i passed michael rutter for the lead i controlled the gap until the end a couple of the back markers upset my rhythm a little but i kept going and to score my third superbike win is brilliant
2794314 race two was more difficult with a wet first part and then damp but drying second fourth is ok and ill take the points but if it had been another couple of laps long i would have been able to take the two riders in front of me and a second was on the cards if not another win i am frustrated a little at the result but overall its been a good weekend thank you to my rizla suzuki team for all the effort and support
2794315 race one was maybe ok result until i was hit by another rider and into the gravel there was nothing i could do this is disappointing as a top 10 was possible i was winded and sore but no problem
2794316 the wet second race was difficult but i think i improved the rain setting on my rizla suzuki i started from back of grid after making some last minute bike change on the second part of the restart the weather conditions were tough but 15th place is at least one point
2794317 it has been a difficult race day with the weather changing by the minute
2794318 atsu was unlucky in race one and then had to contend with the changing weather in race two whilst starting from the back of the grid he did well against that backdrop and will take heart from his first race performance and go to the next round in good spirits
2794319 its been another positive weekend for rizla suzuki and we are now much closer to second in the championship with tom than when we started that is now our clear target for the season
2794320 also on behalf of rizla suzuki i would like to dedicate the first race win to craig jones a friend to many of the team and a great talent lost to british racing
2794321 what can i say bad luck strikes again for smt honda qualifying went really well for us and we had a good bike set up for both the wet and the dry and tom did a great job to get 12th on the grid in the first race he had 9th place in the bag but he started to get a bit of arm pump in the last few laps and he was unable to stop a couple of riders getting by nevertheless 11th was still our best finish of the year and it added more points to our total
2794322 race 2 was a different affair but although tom didnt get a great start he was up inside the points when he got taken out tom was riding well but simply got hit by a fallen rider and he didnt know what had hit him hes in a lot of pain right now and although x rays have shown nothing is broken his arm got crushed by the impact and his hand has swollen up so hes gone to the hospital for an operation to relieve the pressure at this moment in time it looks unlikely that well be at cadwell but well have to see the bike is working well and weve got a good young rider in tom so lets hope we can be back out on the grid soon

2794370 how much does it pain my heart and my soul to announce to the palestinian people the arab and islamic world and to everyone who loves peace and freedom the passing of the star of palestine
2794371 will leave a great void in our cultural political and national life
2794372 the whole world knew palestine by two names or two symbolic figures yasser arafat and mahmud darwish
2794373 now palestine is without a symbolic figure it has been orphaned just as poetry itself has today been orphaned by the passing of our poet
2794374 before anything mahmud darwish was a great poet who possessed real poetic power
2794375 he quickly became the national palestinian poet the poet of the exile and of the refugees
2794376 deprives the palestinians and all the arabs of one of their most noted representatives for contemporary poetry and culture
2794377 with his poetry darwish transcended all the frontiers and broke the chains of narrow patriotism in order to become the voice of palestine
2794378 his poetic masterpieces advocated the just cause of the palestinian people and expressed their aspirations
2794379 beginning yesterday afternoon unomig has reported ongoing aerial bombardments of georgian villages in the upper kodori valley
2794380 also observed the movement by the abkhaz side of substantial numbers of heavy weapons and military personnel towards the kodori valley
2794381 push the georgian armed forces out of the upper kodori valley
2794382 she sourced the location about four months ago and has already paid for the lease which didnt come cheap
2794383 the idea is to get the club up and running before the end of the year and to host the wildest new years eve party ever
2794384 paris has already promised her backers that shell get them free publicity through one of her reality tv shows
2794385 is run by lobbyists that represent georgia and other countries
2794386 he takes huge amounts of money from oil companies that are profiting in the former soviet union and many parts of the world
2794387 this has been one of the failures of the bush administration failing to build a strong relationship a mutually beneficial relationship with russia so wed have the kind of influence to persuade them to stop some of these very very dangerous efforts within their territory
2794388 experience is only positive insofar as it creates good judgment
2794389 and i think senator obamas strong case to the american people is that he will have the right judgment about how to balance americas military force with strong diplomacy to protect our interests abroad
2794390 john mccains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government
2794391 mr scheunemann proudly represented a small democracy that is one of our closest allies in a very dangerous region
2794392 the reaction of the obama campaign to this crisis so at odds with our democratic allies and yet so bizarrely in sync with moscow doesnt merely raise questions about senator obamas judgment it answers them
2794393 theyre an example of senator mccains push to spread democracy in that part of the world as a very important advance of americas interest as well as being good for international stability
2794394 so instead of trying to detract from the central issue i wish senator obama had actually confronted the issue not trying to detract our attention by focusing on a mccain adviser
2794395 psychologists strive to benefit those with whom they work and take care to do no harm
2794396 this morning some people were going to the grape fields when the bomb exploded on their vehicle five people died and three were wounded
2794397 the reports we received from the police chief of kapisa show that 11 civilians have been killed one of the dead was a woman
2794398 right now we are working to find out what exactly happened
2794399 it will be one of the toughest races for michael to win the world record will be in danger
2794400 if somebody 10 or 15 years ago would have said the 400 im will be won in 2008 in 4 03 8 id have bet everything i had or would ever get that it wouldnt happen
2794401 that was one of the most amazing swims ive ever seen in my life
2794402 he absolutely blew me away hes going to be on fire now its going to be hard to stop him
2794403 the four of us set out to do something that not a lot of people thought we could do
2794404 going into the last 50 and looking to my right and seeing that i was ahead of ryan and laszlo i sort of started smiling
2794405 i just think he was caught up in the moment
2794406 there are a lot of middle aged men and women who i know that tell me that im an inspiration to them and theyre now doing things they thought they couldnt do
2794407 im hoping that my age paves the way for other athletes who maybe think theyre too old to do something
2794408 but getting bronze does still leave me a little bit hungry for things that are a little higher it will just drive me all week
2794409 ive been working on everything not just the right hand
2794410 we broke heath herring down and thats the advantage we had in our camp heath didnt have any footage on me and we had everything on him
2794411 this fight is in the record books already and ive got to turn the page
2794412 what happens when a hip young college student heads to a small town barber for a haircut aaron kaufman a carleton college junior makes an appointment at northfield minnesotas bridge square barbershop to find out
2794413 they will have to elect a new president and a new squabble will begin
2794414 the government has not done well in the first four months
2794415 to remove musharraf would make it look as if they are doing something it would be a huge political plus but that doesnt replace good governance
2794416 but pakistan has so many problems and the government does nothing to solve them
2794417 the take home message here is its a big deal
2794418 its probably the biggest impact in the shortest time that i can think of
2794419 if i can use some of that heat energy and convert it to electricity you can improve the overall efficiency
2794420 there are several other steps that are required to commercialize the material but were cautiously optimistic that these steps can be carried out successfully
2794421 we think we can make people feel cooler more quickly feel comfortable more quickly and that will translate into less power in the central ac system
2794422 it just shows how long ago it is i put on my manifesto when i stood for parliament in 1983 this constituency needs a member of parliament of youth and fresh ideas
2794423 at the last election i put on my manifesto this constituency needs a member of parliament of maturity and experience
2794424 i want aung san suu kyi not only to be released but to be in power in burma and thats one of the great causes of the 20th century every country should be a democracy and burma is one of these countries that has been prevented from doing so
2794425 there are still many interesting events which were not yet sold out
2794426 come along and be brave you never know how big that person could be next year
2794427 creating our 25th anniversary programme has been a mind bending forehead clutching joy

2794433 lets state clearly that we are ready to put an end to the war that we will withdraw from south ossetia that we will sign an agreement on non use of force
2794434 russias intention to erase georgian statehood to exterminate georgian people
2794435 an attack on the secretariat is an attack on the institution
2794436 profoundly concerned over mounting tensions in the abkhaz zone of conflict including the bombing of the upper kodori valley and the ongoing military build up along the security zone
2794437 all armed contingents which are not authorised by respective agreements on south ossetia should leave the zone of conflict
2794438 he khalilzad raised the issue and i think i responded quite adequately to it
2794439 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2794440 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2794441 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2794442 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2794443 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2794444 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2794445 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2794446 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2794447 precisamos ter tranq ilidade a gente sabe que o corinthians tem condi o de buscar o resultado fora perdemos no s bado para o vila nova mas temos condi es de ir a florian polis e conseguir o resultado
2794448 iraq and china are concerned with completing the agreement to develop ahdab oil field
2794449 negotiations with shell to sign a deal to process oil shale in jordan are nearing an end
2794450 if our plans succeed it would be one of the countrys largest projects to help the jordan become energy self sufficient with a possibility to export oil in the future
2794451 costs for such plans are estimated at six billion dollars
2794452 would provide the kingdom with oil for the coming 700 years
2794453 the quickest way for a parent to get a childs attention is to sit down and look comfortable
2794454 i do not think there is anyone who takes quite such a fierce pleasure in things being themselves as i do
2794455 they had no effect whatsoever on the power station it genuinely was business as usual
2794456 if the government gives permission to build this power station we will be back to stop it and not just here but all over the country we will disrupt the building of the site and as materials will have to be sourced from other places we will be taking action all over the country to stop them getting here as well
2794457 why should we sacrifice storm boy country so that big business can grow crops in the driest continent on earth
2794458 why have we abandoned our international obligations to the lower lakes so that managed investment schemes can fatten the wallets of well heeled city investors who couldnt find the coorong on a map
2794459 changing the nature of those wetlands from the point of nomination as is happening to the coorong and the lakes contravenes that piece of legislation
2794460 there is enough water in the system we know that he must find enough water and send it down to save our precious lakes
2794461 we know that wind energy can and must play a critical role in securing our future needs
2794462 but our review of wind energy in the country finds that there is an urgent need to reassess the current policies and incentive structures so that the business of wind gets serious about generating power and not just installing wind farms and reaping benefits from fiscal incentives
2794463 in the current scheme which gives an accelerated depreciation benefit of 80 per cent and other tax incentives for installation of the plants wind energy has become the business of cash rich investors who take advantage of tax benefits and are not serious about generation of power
2794464 the current business is not geared to generation of power and increasing efficiencies and reducing costs this is clearly not good if we want wind energy to play an important role in our future energy security
2794465 the indian wind energy sector needs to be re energised and for that to happen policy needs to change and get real
2794466 but this step is too little too inadequate and too hesitant to change the business as it operates currently

2794476 the problem unfortunately is not between the simple people or the athletes
2794477 the problem is between the leaders and principles of both sides
2794478 no no im not talking about that we came here to play theres no need to mix politics and sport
2794479 it was okay for me i have to be happy with that it was a pb personal best for me and a national record i am focusing on the 200 metres

2794530 the only reason i watched this was because south park made fun of it
2794531 initially when he was hospitalized we expected him to come back home but as the weeks went on i kind of knew
2794532 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
2794533 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
2794534 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
2794535 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him
2794536 im sad that my daughter will never know or be able to feel how much he loved her
2794537 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
2794538 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
2794539 well jaguar i dont have the power to do that but if you want to go home go up to the front desk and let them know
2794540 oh jaguar cmon you only have 15 minutes left you can do it
2794541 uh no im not a supervisor and ive been here for 3 weeks i dont know every little technical term here
2794542 so youve called a total of four people in the past 5 minutes and youve hit answering machine for all of them why
2794543 well that supervisor right over there points to supervisor said i could do that
2794544 youre lying theres no way you wouldve been told to do that
2794545 maam with all due respect i cannot tell a lie why dont you ask the supervisor for yourself
2794546 thats not a supervisor she works up front why would you listen to her
2794547 uhhh shes walking around like shes a supervisor telling people what to do and what not to do why wouldnt i listen to her look just have the girl come over here and you can ask her for yourself
2794548 i told him to put in answering machine only if an answering machine picks up
2794549 well since youre 23 ill let you in on a secret since you have a supervisory role you need to be crystal clear with your orders to your subordinates otherwise it will be up to gross misinterpretation
2794550 i dont need you to tell me how to do my job
2794551 funny im pretty sure you said press answering machine for all of the calls why would i lie about that i seem pretty adamant about it do i not
2794552 ok you are right i am sorry i shouldve clarified my request
2794553 i gently put my hands on her arms and say im sick
2794554 dont you put your expletive hands on me you expletive ever again i dont give a expletive if youre expletive sick
2794555 you werent dialing you were yelling making a scene you were constantly getting up throughout your shift and you put your hands on a person
2794556 1 i was doing as i was told 2 this is the first time i am raising my voice 3 i was talking calmly those two lovely women went off the deep end at me and for 4 im sick i need water constantly
2794557 youre not supposed to get out of your seat for the last hour of your shift and whenever you get up youre supposed to raise your hand
2794558 listen dearest ive been back from my break for 30 minutes so your made up rule is dumb im not signing that
2794559 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2794560 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2794561 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2794562 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2794563 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2794564 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2794565 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities and balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
2794566 our stance would not change with sanctions or the threat of sanctions
2794567 it is important that our country is ready to insist on its rights under any conditions
2794568 i was assured no economic blockade shall be allowed and every effort will be made to keep the highway open
2794569 from tomorrow there will be a great meeting of our peoples to continue to deepen the process of change
2794570 he translated the pain of the palestinians in a magical way
2794571 he made us cry and made us happy and shook our emotions
2794572 today i have come bearing an olive branch and a freedom fighters gun do not let the olive branch fall from my hand
2794573 he created a national palestinian identity that no other poet could achieve
2794574 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2794575 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2794576 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2794577 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2794578 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2794579 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2794580 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c
2794581 organising something on the scale of the lambeth conference will inevitably result in a small deficit sometimes

2794586 you put the ball on the ground you have to run and thats the way when we talked about it he wanted it and thats the way i wanted it
2794587 its more of a team unity thing nick and i ran it i told eric day 1 that unless i pass out i am going to try to do everything that everyone else does
2794588 im no different aside from being a little gray headed and a little bit older
2794589 you get used to a new guy and it takes a little bit of time and usually you get the luxury of doing it in the spring where no ones really around or cheering for laps
2794590 i need to call my mom and have her tape espn
2794591 hopefully i got on there today with a penalty lap it was weird because its a penalty lap and youre running it because youve done something wrong and people are cheering it was a little different
2794592 you have to get used to a guys voice his placement of his hands how quickly hes getting out you try to make it look as effortless as possible
2794593 i think its kind of funny but yet serves its purpose i think things like that are important in the fact that everyone is involved in it
2794594 when you come out here and the fans are going crazy and having fun it just helps you get through the day
2794595 weve just got to make sure were handling everything around him so we have the chemistry we need to have before the season starts
2794596 the ball comes out hard and fast and straight and long so thats always good
2794597 its been a whirlwind for him and theres a lot of new information going in were progressing quickly
2794598 until i can see the cadence and see the mechanics
2794599 brett had his two hard boiled eggs a little bit of orange juice
2794600 there was a garnish i think and some hashbrowns and i can take you through minute by minute after that
2794601 the eggs were mixed with the hashbrowns so i dont know which one actually hit his mouth first ill film it next time
2794602 the switching costs for people to leave a league to come over to another site is a significant hurdle
2794603 brings fantasy football to the player instead of having the player come to you
2794604 do you look at what yahoo has been able to do and say its just not worth taking a chance
2794605 its just us with a slingshot going against the big guys
2794606 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2794607 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2794608 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2794609 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2794610 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie

2794695 th ats always the hardest part of making any picture is getting the financing writing it directing it or anything else is easier than getting the financing for it so i said sure i would do it
2794696 i had no idea for anything for it and then about a week or two later i got a call from penelope cruz
2794697 then i heard javier bardem was interested so gradually it took shape i was writing for these people i was deliberately writing for these people

2794745 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2794746 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2794747 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2794748 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2794749 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2794750 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2794751 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2794752 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2794753 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

2794755 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2794756 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2794757 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2794758 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2794759 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2794760 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2794761 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2794762 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2794763 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2794764 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
2794765 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2794766 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2794767 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2794768 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2794769 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help

2794773 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
2794774 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
2794775 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
2794776 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
2794777 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
2794778 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
2794779 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
2794780 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
2794781 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
2794782 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
2794783 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
2794784 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2794785 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2794786 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
2794787 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2794788 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2794789 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2794790 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2794791 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
2794792 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
2794793 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
2794794 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
2794795 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
2794796 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
2794797 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
2794798 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2794799 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
2794800 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2794801 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
2794802 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
2794803 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
2794804 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
2794805 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
2794806 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
2794807 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
2794808 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
2794809 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
2794810 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
2794811 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
2794812 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
2794813 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
2794814 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
2794815 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
2794816 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
2794817 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
2794818 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
2794819 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2794820 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2794821 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2794822 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2794823 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2794824 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2794825 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2794826 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2794827 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2794828 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2794829 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2794830 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2794831 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
2794832 ive been teaching political science and public policy for almost 30 years and increasingly ive become so disturbed by the assumption that people are self interested
2794833 i think the help your neighbor ethic is the closest thing we have to a universal moral value
2794834 the vast majority of people who get any kind of public or private help dont want it theyre ashamed when they take it and they take it almost always because they need to support their kids or their sick parents
2794835 i think we have a moral obligation to help people who are suffering and thats unconnected to whatever faith you hold or dont hold
2794836 i kept being so angry at the phrase personal responsibility because it was hurled at people and meant take care of yourself and dont be a burden on any one else for most people personal responsibility means taking responsibility for the world around you you notice someone lying on the side of the road you take responsibility

2794874 as i drove down the main street all i saw were dead bodies there were very few buildings still standing and the ones that were were very badly damaged
2794875 they had an great acid jazz night that brought together great players from the local to national scene who might not otherwise have the opportunity to play together
2794876 i thought the acid jazz experiments would be a great asset to the humboldt county music community
2794877 it brings out everyone from musicians to music connoisseurs to people who just want to get down with the funk
2794878 the idea was to gather all of the musicians in town
2794879 see who wants to play funk music and instead of doing an open mic thing i have a structured thing where theres usually two sets of players every night and they get a full 90 minute set so its really like having two bands that have never played together before
2794880 after the second or third jam during the acid jazz experiment you start to get to know the players
2794881 and after a while the music starts sounding really good
2794882 it always starts out with just a jam in a key
2794883 this particular night is made to forget what you know and get onstage and make people dance funky style
2794884 im extremely interested in seeing what people can do when they get outside of themselves
2794885 my view for this whole thing is that id like to see the next five or six good bands come out of this
2794886 id like to see some of these players get together and form bands so thats why its different from a blues night
2794887 its got its own style its got its own niche its got its own music scene its a total community that breathes its own life and theres tons of good music

2794939 sudanese justice minister abdul basit sabdarat said on tuesday august 5 2008 that he had appointed a prosecutor to examine alleged crimes in the war torn western region of darfur and to present cases to courts i have signed a decision to name a prosecutor for crimes in darfur from 2003 until now sabdarat told reporters at his ministry
2794940 the khartoum regime has over the years perfected internal and external mobilization techniques that have served it well whenever it faced serious threats to its hold on power one tactic is to persuade the public that the threat is in fact aimed at core national values and strategic interests rather than only the national congress partys national islamic fronts partisan interests the state controlled mass media and friday prayer sermons were used to send that message the ncp staged demonstrations objecting to the prosecutors request for an arrest warrant charging bashir with genocide
2794941 international aid workers are expressing concern over what some describe as the worsening security situation in eastern chad aid workers say as the number of car thefts and armed assaults has increased so has the fear of banditry in a complex region filled with rebel factions refugees and vulnerable communities
2794942 field workers from international humanitarian organizations have expressed renewed worries over their personal security in eastern chad in light of what some call a severely deteriorating security environment for the international agencies that provide aid to hundreds of thousands of chadians and refugees from neighboring sudan
2794943 oxfam international which supplies water and food to over 120 000 people in eastern chad has been forced to pull out of one area because of attacks on its workers says spokeswoman judith enriquez ferrano weve seen through 2007 and 2008 a real increase in the insecurity in chad slowly its not a drastic change but slowly it becomes more violent and more difficult to work three or four years ago there wasnt this type of problem in chad you could move quite easily wherever you wanted and quite freely now its not the case anymore she said
2794944 oxfam pulled its workers out of the town of kerfi in southeastern chad last week along with paris based doctors without borders after the compounds of each of the organizations were attacked by armed local residents oxfam said in a press release the attackers had tried to burn down the workers house with the workers still inside
2794945 last july 2007 i went to chad to look into how the international criminal court which has a field office in abeche and works with refugees in the camps is performing on the ground as part of my assessment i interviewed dozens of refugees considering the hardships the refugees faced daily i was not sure how they would feel talking about a topic as abstract as accountability in an international forum thus i was surprised when their reactions to my questions were positive with even a hint of impatience because the icc prosecutor had not yet gone after the president of sudan omar hassan ahmed bashir icc prosecutor moreno ocampos actions will no doubt be greeted with joy in the camps for displaced persons
2794946 as one darfur refugee put it to me there is no justice in sudan
2794947 yet some commentators outside darfur have argued that this moment of jubilation can only be a symbolic victory for the long suffering people of that region they contend that should the prosecution of top officials however terrible their crimes go forward it will interfere with prospects for peace and security sudans history makes a strong case for the opposite conclusion the persistent lack of accountability has instead undermined the prospects for peace and stability there has been little peace to keep
2794948 we have said that the humanitarian situation is precarious many times but this time its really serious
2794949 the massive majority of attacks occur in the main towns and state capitals where the khartoum regime has absolute control it is simply not in their interest to improve security
2794950 the aid group doctors without borders said friday it has pulled staff out of two locations in sudans war torn darfur region which the united nations said will leave 65 000 people without medical aid the group said in a statement it had been forced to evacuate its staff from the tawila and shangil tobaya areas of north darfur after a series of violent attacks against them
2794951 the sudanese government have a responsibility to ensure security throughout their territory john holmes under secretary general for humanitarian affairs said in a statement
2794952 in an attack on february 27 2004 in the tawilah area of northern darfur 30 villages were burned to the ground over 200 people killed and over 200 girls and women raped some by up to 14 assailants and in front of their fathers who were later killed a further 150 women and 200 children were abducted
2794953 during the month of july bureaucratic impediments and insecurity continued to hamper relief efforts and humanitarian access throughout darfur humanitarian agencies report regularly changing administrative procedures the non issuance of visas to humanitarian workers and government refusal to allow humanitarian agencies to use rented vehicles
2794954 the large majority of attacks on humanitarians occur in main towns and state capitals where the government of sudan has absolute control its not in their interest to improve security
2794955 sudanese authorities have expelled the head of the dutch branch of the charity medecins sans frontieres msf from the war stricken region of darfur a humanitarian source said on wednesday banu altanbas who heads operations in nyala south darfur was ordered to leave darfur immediately by sudans humanitarian affairs commission hac on sunday the source told afp asking to remain anonymous
2794956 altanbas who was declared persona non grata in darfur by the sudanese authorities left the vast western region of darfur but she has stayed on in sudan the source said
2794957 i t is the first time such measures are taken against msf which won the nobel peace prize in 1999 in darfur where five of its branches from belgium spain france holland and switzerland operate
2794958 after a report by msf holland in 2005 that highlighted incidents of rape in darfurs refugee camps angry sudanese authorities briefly detained its head in sudan paul foreman accusing him of crimes against the sudanese state it is obvious that since then msf holland is being watched the matter is very serious said the head of a european ngo
2794959 other ngos have been targeted by expulsions since the 2003 outbreak of the darfur conflict including the us agency care in 2007 the norwegian refugee council in 2006 and britains oxfam and save the children in 2004 two members of the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs unocha were also expelled in 2007
2794960 last week an official with hac urged international ngos not to collaborate with the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs accusing the un agency of interfering in sudans domestic political affairs
2794961 the poverty is beyond description the fear is physically palpable when you move there the suffering of the population has gone on for so long now that if we have an escalation with this very small margin of survival for people in darfur that we may have the risk of a catastrophic development
2794962 five years into the armed conflict in sudans darfur region women and girls living in displaced persons camps towns and rural areas remain extremely vulnerable to sexual violence sexual violence continues to occur throughout the region both in the context of continuing attacks on civilians and during periods of relative calm those responsible are usually men from the sudanese security forces militias i e janjaweed rebel groups and former rebel groups who target women and girls predominantly but not exclusively from fur zaghawa masalit berti tunjur and other non arab ethnicities
2794963 survivors of sexual violence in darfur have no meaningful access to redress they fear the consequences of reporting their cases to the authorities and lack the resources needed to prosecute their attackers police are physically present only in principal towns and government outposts and they lack the basic tools and political will for responding to sexual violence crimes and conducting investigations
2794964 five years on no justice for sexual violence in darfur
2794965 one eyewitness reported that she witnessed four girls being escorted to an abandoned hut and raped at gunpoint by a group of soldiers belonging to the saf
2794966 information gathered by unamid human rights officers indicates that these actions by khartoums regular armed forces and its arab militia allies violated the principle of distinction stated in international humanitarian law failing to distinguish between civilian objects and military objectives
2794967 the scale of destruction of civilian property including objects indispensable for the survival of the civilian population suggests that the damage was a deliberate and integral part of a military strategy
2794968 six people have been killed and 28 wounded after men on camels attacked a civilian convoy in the sudanese region of darfur the un has said the convoy was traveling between nyala and fasher in northern darfur according to unamid a joint un african union peacekeeping mission it said the attackers were suspected members of the janjaweed militia
2794969 un officials said friday july 27 2008 that sudan government planes had bombed darfur this week despite a highly publicised peace pledge from sudanese president omar al beshir during a visit to the darfur region
2794970 a decline in the frequency of convoys and government escorts particularly with the re deployment of the police force during president al bashirs visit to the region further worsened the turnaround time for trucks delivering wfp food to darfur
2794971 coalition of more than 50 africa based and africa focused ngos dedicated to working together to promote a just peaceful and sustainable end to the ongoing humanitarian and human rights crisis in darfur
2794972 putting people first the protection challenge facing unamid in darfur
2794973 conducted by darfur consortium partners through interviews carried out in 2008 with internally displaced and or conflict affected darfur civilians humanitarian workers based in darfur and un au personnel based in darfur khartoum and new york
2794974 various bodies shoulder the responsibility for the shortcomings of unamid the government of sudan has effectively stalled deployment and the united nations security council and the african union peace and security council have allowed it to do so while supporting the mission with the voice and votes at the un major donor countries have not fulfilled their pledges to support the mission
2794975 despite the unanimous security council agreement on the need for unamid the force still lacks resources and capacity to operate at full strength i e more than 26 000 troops and civilian police to date it has just over 9 479 uniformed personnel most of who are ex amis forces i e part of the antecedent african union mission in sudan darfur the government of sudan continues to delay agreement with troop and police contributing countries and since january 2008 only 600 troops have been added to the ex amis forces
2794976 approximately 70 per cent of the police donated to unamid are assigned to local community policing centres in the idp camps but there is a shortage of international police and formed police units fpus which are armed and have greater powers to arrest perpetrators thus leaving the mission overstretched as of 18 june 2008 1 661 police officers and only one formed police unity were deployed without adequate police support troops are left to assumes the roles of both soldiers and policemen conducting patrols inside camps and communities without the proper training to do so
2794977 we also need to look urgently at broadening the participation in this peacekeeping force security council resolution 1769 which gives us our mandate in darfur speaks of the predominantly african character of unamid it does not say the peacekeeping force must be exclusively african given the understandable constraints among african contributing nations we should now be able to turn to those non african countries willing and able to assist our mission at short notice darfurians deserve nothing less
2794978 attack on unamid forces in darfur the khartoum regime is responsible
2794979 militiamen in sudanese army uniforms ambushed a convoy of nigerian peacekeepers in darfur robbing them of cash and weapons united nations officials said friday no one was wounded in the attack which took place on wednesday may 21 2008 near geneina the capital of west darfur state but it was nonetheless a humiliating blow to the hybrid united nations and african union peacekeeping force which is struggling to prove it can do better than the african force it replaced
2794980 the unamid security officer went to the market area in el fasher yesterday may 21 2008 to investigate a road accident involving a un staff member a military vehicle and a taxi according to unamid he had just started taking pictures of the scene when a small group of military personnel assaulted him despite the intervention of unamid civilian staff
2794981 s ets out for the first time which states have the necessary helicopters and estimates how many are available for deployment to darfur it identifies a number of countries including the czech republic india italy romania spain and ukraine that have large numbers of helicopters that meet the required specifications and are not on mission or mission rotation elsewhere many of these helicopters are gathering dust in hangars or flying in air shows when they could be saving lives in darfur
2794982 using conservative estimates the report calculates that nato alone could provide as many as 104 suitable helicopters for the unamid force among nato countries those countries best placed to provide helicopters to unamid are the czech republic italy romania and spain in addition ukraine and india both countries that traditionally contribute to un peacekeeping missions could together contribute 34 helicopters between them these six countries could provide an estimated fleet of over 70 helicopters four times the number required by unamid countries with the ability to provide these helicopters must do so immediately and security council members especially the five permanent members must engage in concerted diplomacy to make sure this happens
2794983 for those who fled their village as long as five years ago those who have waited in camps for an international force to make it safe enough for them to return home unamids performance has been a crushing blow we thought they would save us said zahara khetir a 60 year old mother of 10 living in zamzam camp 16 miles outside el fasher but there is no change we are just waiting for when we will die the town she fled from tawila is still being attacked the most recent janjaweed offensive was last month the un troops stationed there watched as the market was burned and homes were looted
2794984 we are expecting one battalion from ethiopia and one battalion from egypt in june
2794985 current data for total mortality from violence malnutrition and disease
2794986 do we move ahead with the deployment of a force that will not make a difference that will not have the capability to defend itself and that carries the risk of humiliation of the security council and the united nations and tragic failure for the people of darfur

2794988 i see great ugliness mommy daddy why is that island so ugly and dead looking
2794989 this is a tiny island that the military has used for many many years to test their munitions they tested their guns and all sorts of bombs there after years of testing there is no more life left on that island no one really goes there anymore
2794990 its gray and dead and generally yucky there are no people and no life no tall beautiful buildings i like maui much better

2794994 the farther we go down the more things look the same on both sides it looks exactly the same on both clunk uh sides hey we just hit bottom
2794995 sweetheart on the surface the islands appear to be very different but as you can see that is not really true at the lowest level beneath the surface of what we can see they are connected and that makes them the same they are one down here while up there they appear to be separate on the surface the illusion of separateness while in truth the reality of oneness
2794996 first phase of operation sailor hat a series of three large scale tnt explosions to test the blast resistance of navy ships was completed february 6 near kahoolawe island hawaii
2794997 three manned ships were anchored near the site of a 500 ton tnt blast to measure the effects of the explosion the ex light cruiser uss atlanta taken out of moth balls and refitted with an array of radar antennae plus special blast recording and measuring devices served as primary test ship accompanied by the guided missile destroyer uss cochrane and the canadian destroyer escort frazer
2794998 the atlantas crew of 169 navy men and 60 scientists will remain onboard for the second test explosion scheduled for april but will be removed prior to the third detonation sometime in june for each successive blast the test ship will be closer to the charge
2794999 data from the tests will be used by the navy to evaluate present and planned blast hardened structure aboard ship

2795332 in a circle draw forth in blood and ash these sigils four stand within the circle and speak thy oath hmm have blood and there is some ash near the furnace there might as well try this
2795333 by blood and ash i swear mine life to this path i accept the gift of mine art and the burden of mine arts duty i accept the gift to give motion to the motionless and the duty to bring rest to the restless this i do so swear to do by mine blood and this gift
2795334 might as well see what else it says whats this small print be warned if there is any blood magic used that is harmful in its impact this ritual will expunge it as well note this would be quite painful as the body has to force it out in addition to restoring any damage the body had experienced such as injury malnutrition and birth defects wait the books in plane english now how did that happen ah well i need to get going or the dursleys will have a fit
2795335 so that is what the book meant i had best make sure trouble doesnt try to eat you
2795336 you know that really isnt the smartest of things to do
2795337 we dont like people like you oh dont be so surprised in thinking that no one would find out it probably would be simpler if you had chosen to confess to the police we dont have the same qualms in dealing with your kind besides my friend has been quite restless ever since she killed her own murderer why he even planned to do what you have been doing with her so i do think it is best to let you reap what you have sown
2795338 i dont think you need to worry about any one finding out what happened you can just pretend none of this happened
2795339 i dont want to forget or it might happen with someone else someday please help me show me how not to be afraid again teach me to make them pay
2795340 but you must be sure about this there is no going back you will do things that most would revile you as much as they would him for what he did do you choose to do this of your own free will

2795347 een mexicaan zul je nooit tequila zien drinken met een schijfje citroen en zout dat doe je alleen om het weg te spoelen als het bocht is
2795348 het is wel een drank waaraan je even moet wennen zeker de eerste keer
2795349 ze hopen zo ook tequila beter bekend te maken maar ik denk dat ze nog een lange weg te gaan hebben ook gezien de prijs
2795350 voor dat geld kun je ook een mooie franse cognac of whiskey kopen zegt van der klink terwijl hij een tequila blanco inschenkt

2795361 maar ook wel weer handig voor de toervaarders ze zullen daar sneller aanmeren voor een boodschap of een kop koffie dan in zuidland want in dat dorp is niet zoveel smaalt de wit over de bernisser plannen

2795428 were literally printing money on the north slope we decided to strike the balance a little bit more on our side
2795429 clearly from the investor standpoint alaska has become a less attractive place to invest exploration and production dollars
2795430 it was a bad idea in the 1980s and it is an even worse idea today
2795431 increase our dependence on foreign oil and hinder exactly the same kind of domestic exploration and production we need
2795432 what the tax has done is take away all the upside
2795433 i dont think wed have been able to make that investment
2795434 we think that hopefully the new tax system will encourage firms to get on the slope and produce more oil and gas
2795435 you dont want take so much that you discourage activity
2795436 thats not the place to go if youre serious about your education
2795437 i think i am as prepared as i can be at the moment and this is the best time to be in that position
2795438 i cant express how excited i am to be able to start off with that event and how it turned out
2795439 act like it never happened because i have so many tough races ahead of me and so many hard opponents
2795440 im pretty happy i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2795441 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2795442 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2795443 i saw lochte was going slower and i tried to do everything to go better than phelps but i dont have enough power for that
2795444 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2795445 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2795446 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for
2795447 that was amazing setting another world record you cant ask for anything else that was a great way to start off the meet for usa
2795448 when you are shoving a lot of money into a very narrow space who do you sell it to when it is time to leave or when you find out it didnt work or when you have to cut back china is down about 50 this year so that is somewhat indicative of what you can expect in those worlds which are too dangerous for us
2795449 i remember when tv was going to replace radio and cable was going to replace the movies and none of that happened
2795450 but i know that most of these guys particularly the guys at gannett get it
2795451 as long as you believe that you are going to have a camera on your phone and you are going to get video on your phone you want to be in 3g
2795452 interesting it looks sunny outside and it doesnt actually sound like its raining outside

2795457 do you look at what yahoo has been able to do and say its just not worth taking a chance
2795458 its just us with a slingshot going against the big guys
2795459 i want to do it because its fun its fun to do bad things like drive into a car

2795465 when you are staying so long together its very important that you have a good time outside of the pitch we enjoy playing together and being together and i think those close bonds do help the team be successful at tournaments like this one
2795466 we want to carry on being energetic and working together as a team
2795467 we may not have the greatest individuals but we have a really strong team spirit and we always work together for each other
2795468 leni and melissa played together for many years in asker in western norway so they know each other very well so there is a good connection between them
2795469 they want to improve with every single training session and theres a great atmosphere in the squad a great togetherness a great sense of humour and i think that its one of the best thing about our team
2795470 when i was in the squad at the european championships in england back in 2005 i was 22 and everything was new and a little bit scary but weve always had a good squad and we like to be together
2795471 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
2795472 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
2795473 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
2795474 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
2795475 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
2795476 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
2795477 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
2795478 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
2795479 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
2795480 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
2795481 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
2795482 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
2795483 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
2795484 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one

2795486 overall i feel like we obviously didnt play well as a team
2795487 i was disappointed that some of them nonstarters didnt do better
2795488 weve been having a good training camp were excited to come out and play with the confidence weve had so far we have so many veterans when we step on the field we feel confident we should score

2795493 how much does it pain my heart and my soul to announce to the palestinian people the arab and islamic world and to everyone who loves peace and freedom the passing of the star of palestine
2795494 will leave a great void in our cultural political and national life
2795495 the whole world knew palestine by two names or two symbolic figures yasser arafat and mahmud darwish
2795496 now palestine is without a symbolic figure it has been orphaned just as poetry itself has today been orphaned by the passing of our poet
2795497 before anything mahmud darwish was a great poet who possessed real poetic power
2795498 he quickly became the national palestinian poet the poet of the exile and of the refugees
2795499 deprives the palestinians and all the arabs of one of their most noted representatives for contemporary poetry and culture
2795500 with his poetry darwish transcended all the frontiers and broke the chains of narrow patriotism in order to become the voice of palestine
2795501 his poetic masterpieces advocated the just cause of the palestinian people and expressed their aspirations

2795505 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
2795506 has the fed done research that allows it to find the market rate of interest so that it doesnt make the cost of borrowing artificially too low or too high
2795507 is there any reason to believe that fed bureaucrats have the necessary information and ability to successfully fix the price of money ie interest rates in a 12 trillion economy of 350 million people when free markets are more successful at fixing market clearing prices for all other commodities
2795508 if you have both types of accounts you should hold the tips and all bonds and the reits in the tax advantaged accounts and then hold the most tax efficient equities in the taxable accounts that is the proper answer to the location problem also want to hold volatile equity asset classes in taxable accounts since that increases the value of the tax option loss harvesting foreign holdings in taxable allow you to take the ftc

2795530 should buy us time to come up with a new architecture and people have been working on this already a number of efforts including but it has been slow to get adopted most likely because there was no need no clear example of why it would be good to adopt a much safer standard for managing the dns system
2795531 means a huge upgrade in the entire fabric of the internet
2795532 now weve got a very good example here fortunately a white hat researcher for one of the good guys found out about it
2795533 and he did the responsible thing and he did a great job in managing the process we are in a race to get local administrators isp administrators to understand that this is an important problem and they should work on upgrading the infrastructure
2795534 everyone needs to see we have the new technology that would improve these things
2795535 the implementation there is no government no single entity to direct it this is a global initiative there is nobody who can mandate that the internet has to run on ipv6 as of a certain date
2795536 and as we continue to deal with commercial entities people will continue to deal with weighing the cost benefits its not a policy decision
2795537 so i think we will do this incrementally there will have to be parallel internets we cannot switch simply on one day im confident though that we can resolve all these issues
2795538 or at least close to the same day apples round of fixes to bind were announced just last week

2795542 why cant i cook something simple im not an awesome cook i just want to make noodles
2795543 the idea of noodle bar from the start was to take the humblest meal a bowl of noodles a pork bun and with a combination of obsessive devotion and four star technique turn it into something amazing
2795544 are you willing to fucking sacrifice yourself for the food it takes those little things the properly cut scallions to set us apart from daniel just because were not a four star restaurant why cant we have the same fucking standards i know weve won awards all this stuff but its not because were doing something special i believe its really because we care more than the next guy
2795545 getting these awards freaks me out the last thing i want is a michelin star because i know im not the best
2795546 i just feel unease almost all the time im a total head case right now i cannot keep this up all i want to do is fucking move to idaho and ski and fish and read books all i want to do is run away and stop
2795547 one of the few things that make chang happy in life is setting up his friends in restaurants of their own

2795552 this is a struggle for the hearts of the people and good governance and the creation of afghan security forces
2795553 there is no doubt that we should aim to limit changes in the global mean surface temperature to 2c above pre industrial
2795554 but given this is an ambitious target and we dont know in detail how to limit greenhouse gas emissions to realise a 2 degree target we should be prepared to adapt to 4c
2795555 government failure to curb emissions and the likely scale of the climate crisis facing us is very clear from these reports not only has the government been selectively using statistics to make false claims on emissions reductions as i have been arguing for the past year see e g
2795556 yet still the labour government appears set to press on with expanding airports major road bulding more incinerators and imposing massive urbanisation on eastern region and many other parts of the uk all of which will raise emissions even higher
2795557 unlike the other parties the green party is ready to take urgent and radical action on climate change to move towards a green economy where the top priorities are sustainability and fairness business as usual growth economics should be off the agenda as the stern report made so clear action now will cost far less than delay
2795558 as a major western economy the uk needs to take a lead on tackling climate change we know we cannot solve the crisis on our own but we can set an example the tragedy of the labour government is that ministers have strutted around the globe making claims about cutting emissions which have been proved to be completely misleading wasting years when opportunities should have been taken to move to a green economy for the second summer in a row it looks as if the ice cap melt in the arctic will be at record levels this is a stark warning that climate change is already upon us there should be no more complacency from gordon browns government the first important decision his ministers should announce this autumn is the scrapping of plans to expand heathrow and stansted
2795559 estar en vivo jaime ha sido muy gentil con la invitaci n que me hizo y se lo agradezco

2795562 we are not aware of that and i think we probably would be if it were true
2795563 even if the pipe is out of action for a week or two weeks it s very unlikely that this would have much effect on global oil supplies
2795564 the task of the russian forces at present is to ensure control of south ossetia the pipelines would be in danger only if the war escalated
2795565 if russia started an economic blockade then it might target the pipelines
2795566 attempts to take control of that pipeline would be extreme
2795567 we ve made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on us russian relations
2795568 we deplore the dangerous and disproportionate actions by russian forces and we would be particularly troubled if these attacks are continuing now as the georgians are pulling back
2795569 very very concerned if in fact there is ground action inside of georgia proper that is outside of these areas of abkhazia and ossetia
2795570 it does not really matter whether 2007 or 2008 is the worst year on record for arctic sea ice the crucial point is that ice is clearly not building up enough over winter to restore cover and that when you combine current estimates of ice thickness with the extent of the ice cap you get a very clear indication that the arctic is going to be ice free in summer in five years and when that happens there will be consequences
2795571 when we did the first climate change computer models we thought the arctics summer ice cover would last until around 2070
2795572 it is now clear we did not understand how thin the ice cap had already become for arctic ice cover has since been disappearing at ever increasing rates
2795573 if you werent watching that guy riding the dorkmobile we wouldnt have almost crashed

2795591 i dont have any profit motive in this im doing it for america
2795592 it will be similar to the eisenhower interstate highway period in the 1950s
2795593 he said it was an emergency i want it to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2795594 and weve had a pretty good drop in the oil price
2795595 he believes in global warming i do too but global warming is on page 2 for me on page 1 its the 700 million going out the back door from our dependency on 70 percent of imported oil
2795596 and its also driving the key challenge for us which is energy independence
2795597 ive been working on this since i was elected in 1996 so i get excited whenever anybody else joins this effort
2795598 hes saying if you are not going to listen because im wealthy im going to shame you into listening to people its a great approach

2795612 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
2795613 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
2795614 some places were unprepared some places just couldnt handle it
2795615 people know its going to be a historically high turnout whether they can do anything about it is another question
2795616 tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of voters are disenfranchised sometimes raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
2795617 the first couple of primaries get all the attention its decided and nobody turns out for other elections later on in the primary season
2795618 and that didnt happen this time and i think thats where some elections administrators in later primaries got caught
2795619 some might get lost or replaced or the person didnt fill out all the information and theyre not on the rolls

2795627 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2795628 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2795629 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2795630 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2795631 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2795632 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2795633 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2795634 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2795635 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2795636 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2795637 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2795638 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2795639 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2795640 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2795641 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
2795642 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
2795643 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
2795644 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
2795645 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
2795646 the jonah factor 13 spiritual steps to finding the job of a lifetime
2795647 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
2795648 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
2795649 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2795650 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2795651 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2795652 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2795653 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2795654 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2795655 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
2795656 the fishbein family came up with the idea of giving this trail as a gift
2795657 in 1993 we built our first green building but it didnt create the buzz this building has so we can thank al gore or oil at 140 a barrel our trail has come along at the right time and very much with a purpose
2795658 we wanted to see the composting toilets in any building approved and open to the public
2795659 if small children and international visitors accepted the bathrooms we concluded friends and relatives could accept this idea
2795660 the more we did the more we wanted to do
2795661 this stands as a shining example of what can and should be done in new construction
2795662 this building is very advanced and very functional but has much less of an environmental footprint than any traditional building would
2795663 if we are to live sustainably in the future we really have to change the way we live
2795664 climate change is the number one issue of our time
2795665 at mass audubon we are making a tremendous effort in this area
2795666 seven thousand people in july alone came through this building
2795667 a lot of people were interested in green features and how they could apply them to their own home
2795668 things can be a little more expensive but over time it pays for itself and uses less energy green materials dont have to be renewed and the more and more green materials are produced the price will come down
2795669 it had to grow organically and look like it was part of a whole
2795670 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2795671 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2795672 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2795673 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2795674 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2795675 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2795676 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2795677 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2795678 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2795679 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2795680 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2795681 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2795682 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2795683 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2795684 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2795685 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2795686 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2795687 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2795688 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2795689 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2795690 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2795691 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2795692 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2795693 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2795694 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2795695 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2795696 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2795697 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2795698 everybody says they want to support it but its been a tough sell
2795699 a number of utilities have reported that only 20 percent to 30 percent of their customers are aware that a green power option is offered
2795700 thats confusing they think its the wind why isnt it free
2795701 what we see in georgia is whats the minimum that we can do well take your money and well green wash and do a lot of propaganda about the program
2795702 10 years behind the curve southern co is looking at offshore wind but theyre not really advancing the ball on renewable energy in a credible or serious way
2795703 as much as 1 billion on renewable generation over the next 10 years
2795704 if they had something in place where they were doing wind turbines on the coast or solar modules or solar plants or something like that i would be more inclined to pay more for that
2795705 but its just really hard for me to justify paying more for landfill methane gas
2795706 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2795707 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2795708 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2795709 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2795710 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2795711 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2795712 just so you all know we did set a record
2795713 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2795714 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2795715 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2795716 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2795717 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2795718 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2795719 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2795720 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2795721 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2795722 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2795723 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2795724 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2795725 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2795726 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2795727 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2795728 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2795729 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2795730 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2795731 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2795732 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2795733 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2795734 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2795735 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2795736 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2795737 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2795738 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2795739 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2795740 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2795741 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2795742 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2795743 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2795744 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2795745 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2795746 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2795747 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2795748 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2795749 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2795750 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2795751 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2795752 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2795753 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2795754 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2795755 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2795756 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2795757 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2795758 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2795759 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2795760 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2795761 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2795762 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2795763 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
2795764 are you better off now than you were four years ago
2795765 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2795766 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2795767 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2795768 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
2795769 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2795770 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2795771 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2795772 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2795773 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2795774 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2795775 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2795776 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2795777 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2795778 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2795779 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2795780 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2795781 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2795782 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2795783 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2795784 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2795785 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2795786 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2795787 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2795788 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2795789 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2795790 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2795791 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2795792 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2795793 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2795794 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2795795 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2795796 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2795797 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2795798 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2795799 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2795800 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2795801 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2795802 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2795803 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2795804 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2795805 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2795806 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2795807 doesnt look like all those presidents on the dollar bills
2795808 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
2795809 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
2795810 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2795811 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2795812 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2795813 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2795814 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2795815 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2795816 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2795817 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2795818 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2795819 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2795820 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2795821 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2795822 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2795823 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2795824 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2795825 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2795826 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2795827 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2795828 channel 4 will not be in a hurry to commission him poor old durkin again
2795829 it is entirely appropriate that people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2795830 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2795831 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2795832 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2795833 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2795834 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2795835 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2795836 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2795837 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2795838 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2795839 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2795840 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2795841 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2795842 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2795843 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2795844 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2795845 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2795846 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2795847 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2795848 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2795849 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2795850 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2795851 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2795852 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2795853 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2795854 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2795855 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
2795856 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
2795857 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
2795858 we have said that this is a condition driven process
2795859 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2795860 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
2795861 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home

2795871 nick did a great job of freezing on that line drive to right field to stay out of the double play millar said
2795872 you get tired of driving in runs sometimes he said

2796164 now we believe that the lord is something than which nothing greater can be conceived
2796165 then is there no such nature since the fool has said in his heart god is not
2796166 but certainly this same fool when he hears this very thing that i am saying something than which nothing greater can be imagined understands what he hears and what he understands is in his understanding even if he does not understand that it is for it is one thing for a thing to be in the understanding and another to understand that a thing is
2796167 for when a painter imagines beforehand what he is going to make he has in his understanding what he has not yet made but he does not yet understand that it is but when he has already painted it he both has in his understanding what he has already painted and understands that it is
2796168 therefore even the fool is bound to agree that there is at least in the understanding something than which nothing greater can be imagined because when he hears this he understands it and whatever is understood is in the understanding
2796169 and certainly that than which a greater cannot be imagined cannot be in the understanding alone for if it is at least in the understanding alone it can be imagined to be in reality too which is greater
2796170 therefore if that than which a greater cannot be imagined is in the understanding alone that very thing than which a greater cannot be imagined is something than which a greater can be imagined but certainly this cannot be
2796171 there exists therefore beyond doubt something than which a greater cannot be imagined both in the understanding and in reality

2796179 how much does it pain my heart and my soul to announce to the palestinian people the arab and islamic world and to everyone who loves peace and freedom the passing of the star of palestine
2796180 will leave a great void in our cultural political and national life
2796181 the whole world knew palestine by two names or two symbolic figures yasser arafat and mahmud darwish
2796182 now palestine is without a symbolic figure it has been orphaned just as poetry itself has today been orphaned by the passing of our poet
2796183 before anything mahmud darwish was a great poet who possessed real poetic power
2796184 he quickly became the national palestinian poet the poet of the exile and of the refugees
2796185 deprives the palestinians and all the arabs of one of their most noted representatives for contemporary poetry and culture
2796186 with his poetry darwish transcended all the frontiers and broke the chains of narrow patriotism in order to become the voice of palestine
2796187 his poetic masterpieces advocated the just cause of the palestinian people and expressed their aspirations

2796360 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2796361 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2796362 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2796363 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2796364 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2796365 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2796366 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2796367 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2796368 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2796369 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2796370 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2796371 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2796372 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2796373 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2796374 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2796375 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2796376 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2796377 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2796378 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2796379 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2796380 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2796381 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2796382 who are open to doing something on the production side
2796383 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2796384 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2796385 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

2796393 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2796394 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2796395 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2796396 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2796397 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2796398 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2796399 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2796400 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2796401 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2796402 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2796403 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2796404 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2796405 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2796406 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2796407 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2796408 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2796409 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2796410 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2796411 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2796412 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2796413 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2796414 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2796415 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2796416 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2796417 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2796418 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2796419 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2796420 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2796421 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2796422 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2796423 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2796424 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2796425 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2796426 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2796427 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2796428 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2796429 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2796430 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2796431 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2796432 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2796433 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2796434 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2796435 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2796436 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2796437 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2796438 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2796439 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2796440 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2796441 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2796442 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2796443 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2796444 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2796445 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2796446 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2796447 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2796448 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2796449 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2796450 i learned a lot this weekend and i picked up a whole lot through the whole race
2796451 dave rogers made an awesome call on our fuel mileage and that got us the finish we ended up with ill take what i learned and be happy with it im glad ive got something to go back to next time we race here
2796452 life is a journey time is a river the door is ajar
2796453 ive never felt ive been valued by anyone im just a waste of space that everyone ignores like a ghost without a home
2796454 its rubble how do you convert that into condos and rentals it takes a lot of work
2796455 i feel it is one of those fringe cities of manhattan that has potential for growth starting with access to manhattan
2796456 i see this as a catalyst nothing happens until this building gets up and running
2796457 the optimal use for the building from the citys perspective is office space
2796458 we have entertained proposals including mixed use retail residential medical offices senior housing governmental school board offices and a number of other ideas as well none of the ideas have unfortunately progressed beyond an initial expression of interest
2796459 if its too costly we many not want to go forward with it
2796460 i think the message was without some kind of public money in the project it doesnt make sense financially he said
2796461 to have the project done privately the numbers dont work
2796462 it feels good it really does im extremely excited to be apart of this organization and to be a miami dolphin i cant tell you how excited i am and am looking forward to the opportunity when one door closes another one opens but its not about me its about our team and how i can make us a better team and win football games thats what its about
2796463 i do remember a little bit as a matter of fact i had some stuff at the house that i brought with me from 2000 on the plane ride over i was just sort of thumbing though it just looking through it trying to recall some of it some of it sounds familiar some of it doesnt because it has been eight years but im excited about it ive always held dan henning in such a great respect i have a lot of respect for him and what hes done in this league im really excited about this i enjoyed him as a rookie and learned a lot of football from him
2796464 the last 48 hours has been a whirlwind its been a little crazy just trying to figure out what was the best decision for me as a professional and what was the best decision for my family but i just tried to enjoy it take it one moment at a time and look at everything and i just felt that this was a great fit this was a place i needed to be and wanted to be here i am
2796465 i see myself in all aspects by nature i enjoy playing the mentor role it doesnt matter if im the starter or not i enjoy playing that role because i think thats part of your job as a veteran part of your responsibility as a veteran in this league to help the young guys along to show them things youve learned along with the way ive had great veterans in my time to help me vinny testeverde curtis martin wayne chrebet those guys helped me tremendously not only as a football player but how to be a professional
2796466 its obvious bill drafted me in 2000 ive never been able to experience bill as a head coach in a coaching capacity i was around him for a year in 2000 and one thing about coach parcells is that hes going to tell you the truth and hes going to be honest with you and tell you exactly what he expects from you as a player and as a professional and i respect that
2796467 not at all a lot of people mightve thought it was the revenge factor it had nothing to do with it i just tried to look at each opportunity as it presented itself and try to make the best decision for me and my family and for my professional career
2796468 when it first happened it was surreal but for some reason i had real peace about it i wasnt overly shocked or overly emotional about it for some reason i just had an inner peace about it and things would work out i would say the reason for that is because all the things that ive been through ive been through a lot of difficult challenges through a great support group and great teammates ive been able to overcome all those challenges its one of those things i chalked it up as another opportunity and make the best of it
2796469 its going to be a lot of fun im really looking forward to it i dont have revenge on my mind or anything like that i have one thing on my mind and thats victory period so im looking forward to it im looking forward to the challenge and really excited about that right now ive got a lot of work to do ive got to try and get in there and grinding a little bit talk to the quarterbacks talk to my teammates and get to know those guys try to be a sponge its not like being a rookie all over again but in some aspects it is because youve got to learn a whole new system and things like that luckily ive been around this system before so i do know what to expect in some aspects i just need to take it in a little bit at a time
2796470 all the drama and excitement from the pageantry of the opening ceremony to the extinguishment of the olympic fame
2796471 when i saw him go in there was no time to think and instinct just took over
2796472 when the waves were pounding me and i was sucking in water i wondered if i had done the right thing but you dont think twice were both alive so i guess it was the right thing
2796473 the young bloke wouldnt have lasted much longer he was like an ice block
2796474 they were really clever to take their clothes off so it didnt weigh them down
2796475 i dont ever want something like that to happen to me again matt is definitely a hero
2796476 it seems to me they have already made their decision before they came to see us
2796477 there is a potential for me to lose at least 1000 a week if not more
2796478 if they put forward their reasons we could accept the decision if there was absolutely no other alternative
2796479 there is no way i could run for labor at a state level because im so opposed to their plan for privatising electricity
2796480 i will offer the people of port macquarie the best possible opportunity to send the major parties the message that we do not want electricity privatisation
2796481 there are 300 country energy workers in port macquarie who will lose their jobs in the privatisation agenda supported by both major parties
2796482 only an independent can represent these 300 electricity workers the large number of other businesses that will be affected and the high number of older australians in the electorate who will end up paying higher electricity prices
2796483 labor is rating mr oakeshott as a surrogate labor candidate and they are prepared to abandon their own local people for the back room support of mr oakeshott
2796484 mark arbib is the most senior power broker in nsw labor politics he is now a senator and former secretary of the labor party in nsw and is kevin rudds numbers man
2796485 it will open the area and it will be somewhere people will want to come and have a look
2796486 the upgrade works will ensure significant access improvements are made particularly for older people and people with disabilities
2796487 it has been a great weekend and the show continues to grow
2796488 people simply love the lifestyle wealthy people still choose to get around the country in a caravan
2796489 we were meant to fly out of port macquarie at 11am now it looks like well be getting into sydney about 5pm
2796490 we havent been to sydney in 30 years so were really going to miss those few extra hours to sight see
2796491 all we were told was that there was a problem with the weather but qantas seems to be flying into sydney so we dont understand the problem
2796492 the staff here in port macquarie have been pleasant but it does not feel like we are being told the entire story
2796493 our passengers flying from sydney were able to catch the afternoon plane
2796494 the government claims to care about climate change but is pressing ahead with new coal fired power stations
2796495 now we discover that the home office is paying the police to harass and attack people who are peacefully opposing this decision its not hard to put two and two together
2796496 it has now become impossible for citizens to assert their views against the money and influence of a wealthy few the only option left is for us to take personal responsibility for the actions where the government is failing us for the sake of our children tomorrow i am willing to peacefully break the law in order to draw a line in the sand its time more politicians joined me
2796497 this is the clearest expression yet of the widespread public disapproval for e ons plans to build new coal plants
2796498 despite the police campaign of intimidation and harassment thousands have turned out to stop this environmental catastrophe people across the country are showing they are no longer prepared to sit back and watch politicians andcompanies destroy our future today the climate movement has come of age
2796499 olympic medals does anyone else finding it embarassing to take so many
2796500 theres just not that pull there even though we get on great
2796501 the governments case got under way early last year when an undercover agent of the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms atf placed a call to a 61 year old retired united states army officer named harrison jack at his home in woodland calif

2796513 how much does it pain my heart and my soul to announce to the palestinian people the arab and islamic world and to everyone who loves peace and freedom the passing of the star of palestine
2796514 will leave a great void in our cultural political and national life
2796515 the whole world knew palestine by two names or two symbolic figures yasser arafat and mahmud darwish
2796516 now palestine is without a symbolic figure it has been orphaned just as poetry itself has today been orphaned by the passing of our poet
2796517 before anything mahmud darwish was a great poet who possessed real poetic power
2796518 he quickly became the national palestinian poet the poet of the exile and of the refugees
2796519 deprives the palestinians and all the arabs of one of their most noted representatives for contemporary poetry and culture
2796520 with his poetry darwish transcended all the frontiers and broke the chains of narrow patriotism in order to become the voice of palestine
2796521 his poetic masterpieces advocated the just cause of the palestinian people and expressed their aspirations
2796522 you know what ed and i laugh about it its kind of funny but its like you know i guess some people assume theres a seed of truth to it people think where theres smoke theres fire people think that but they dont realise that er its obviously er its just so amazing the way something can be just a complete fabrication yet it gets twisted its just one of those things that rolls off my back theres not one seed of truth to it so itll just go away in the end i have to accept that it will become one of those things people will speculate about
2796523 hey if theres a gay rumor you know youve made it
2796524 what do you do with an infant with pyloric stenosis
2796525 the buck stops with the parent end of discussion weve all been humiliated and mortified parents need to be in the same boat weve all been there
2796526 please stop doing that youre going to hurt yourself its very rude you make other people feel bad
2796527 our relationship is constructive and its important and also very candid
2796528 he told president hu that this is an important aspect of the u s china dialogue and that the chinese can expect that any future american president will also make it an important aspect of our dialogue
2796529 president hu seemed to indicate that the door is open to religious freedom in china and that in the future there will be more room for religious believers
2796530 while i cant confirm this specific report were disappointed anytime that someone is unable to worship freely
2796531 it just goes to show that god is universal god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2796532 i looked up and saw president bush giving me the thumbs up and holding the american flag that was pretty cool
2796533 a true fan is defined as someone who will purchase anything and everything you produce they will drive 200 miles to see you sing they will buy the super deluxe re issued hi res box set of your stuff even though they have the low res version
2796534 assume conservatively that your true fans will each spend one days wages per year in support of what you do if you have 1 000 fans that sums up to 100 000 per year which minus some modest expenses is a living for most folks
2796535 its interesting as the task didnt involve any kind of problem solving
2796536 irregularity of timing probably arises at a more fundamental biological level owing to a kind of noise in brain activity
2796537 we know that accuracy at millisecond level in neuronal activity is critical to information processing and learning processes
2796538 optimally you want to provide enough information so the other party reaches a certain level of confidence but stop once you reach that level
2796539 otherwise it may be the case that more information causes the confidence level to go down
2796540 our result suggests that the chairperson the president and media can bias the decision of the committee electorate and public by strategically restricting the flow of information

2796542 the problem is that brake lights are yes and no on and off
2796543 the driver behind does not know the speed at which the car in front is slowing or stopping its not enough information for the following driver
2796544 of course we would have expected that the tuatara which does everything slowly they grow slowly reproduce slowly and have a very slow metabolism would have evolved slowly
2796545 in fact at the dna level they evolve extremely quickly which supports a hypothesis proposed by the evolutionary biologist allan wilson who suggested that the rate of molecular evolution was uncoupled from the rate of morphological evolution
2796546 googles model is choice we let employees choose from a bunch of different machines and different operating systems and my support group supports all of them its a little bit less cost efficient but on the other hand i get slightly more productivity from my googles employees
2796547 the traditional security model is to try to tightly lock down endpoints and it makes people sleep better at night but it doesnt actually give them security we have programs in our infrastructure to watch for strange behavior this means i dont have to worry about the endpoint as much
2796548 the basic premise of providing biofeedback certainly has its merit in performance
2796549 they didnt have a decimal system they used base twenty number system based on fingers and toes
2796550 i didnt know what to expect some kind of moonscape perhaps
2796551 but it was incredible huge matrices of branching porites coral up to 8 meters high had established creating thriving coral reef habitat

2796553 this is a historic find the earliest known recording of sound
2796554 it takes time to get new classes of antibiotics onto the market
2796555 whereas bacteriophages can be easily isolated from environmental sources such as sewage water
2796556 once mercurys eccentricity gets up above about 0 6 then its getting close to crossing venuss orbit
2796557 once you get orbit crossings you sort of transition from the orderly yet chaotic configuration that the solar system is in currently to a much more violently chaotic situation then all bets are off a lot of bad things can happen
2796558 all life gets extinguished immediately and earth glows at the temperature of a red giant star for about 1000 years
2796559 let s be honest here any punk with a cell phone can record an officer upload it to the internet and make it look horrible
2796560 but pistolcam can give you a leg up in the court and in the public arena
2796561 if people have well founded claims and have suffered physical harm then we will look into it
2796562 but many people try to use these incidents for material gain
2796563 its the same reason we dont build superhighways in front of elementary schools
2796564 the most severe volcanic cooling event in the northern hemisphere in the past 2 000 years

2796568 the trouble is that we cant really put the genie back in the bottle once the new weapons are out there they will be fairly easy to copy how long is it going to be before the terrorists get in on the act
2796569 with the current prices of robot construction falling dramatically and the availability of ready made components for the amateur market it wouldnt require a lot of skill to make autonomous robot weapons
2796570 i like wind because its renewable and its clean and you know you are not going to be dealing with a production decline curve
2796571 decline curves finally wore me out in the oil business
2796572 ooh rah civilian sound off like you got a pair think you have what it takes to make it in my beloved armed services test your warrior skills with this list of games see if you think you have what it takes try to make it through these without dying cause in the real world you dont get extra lives remember one shot one kill semper fi carry on
2796573 that might prepare you for the unforgiving life of an active soldier
2796574 think you have what it takes to make it in my beloved armed services
2796575 see if you think you have what it takes try to make through these without dying cause in the real world you dont get extra lives
2796576 we are brothers forever ill stop talking now so that you may continue your noble work indeed youd better or else
2796577 a post adolescent boy who doesnt know what fear is is likely unable to understand many other things in short he is a dunce and not worthy of our attention
2796578 well i like music the speech could be on that
2796579 i saw you today sitting beneath the tree just sitting there so still how is it that you can wait so patiently in the moment i cant seem to get used to the idea of doing nothing
2796580 well theres the problem right there young lady youve bought into the cultural myth that when youre waiting youre doing nothing
2796581 i hope youll hear it all the way down to your toes
2796582 then what if nobody cancels should i stay at the airport for the whole night
2796583 the preference now is for excising deleting restricting information rather than letting it sit there and grow
2796584 how are you going to know what is in there or whether its safe if you dont know where it comes from
2796585 this means that the twin universe will have the same laws of physics and in particular the same notion of time as in ours
2796586 in our analogy it will look identical to its twin when seen from afar one could not distinguish them
2796587 while different biomarkers such as grey hair wrinkles or elasticity of the skin can help us estimate a persons biological age these features are hard to quantify
2796588 at age 90 people can function as though they are 30
2796589 there are folks who are feeling that things are getting too complicated
2796590 the good news is that you have a lot of choices the bad news is that you have a lot of choices
2796591 we now know where the influenza a virus comes from every year
2796592 and because we now know how the virus evolves we have a much better chance of controlling it

2796612 dalam rapat tersebut kami sepakat untuk telepon fixed tetap penurunan tarif interkoneksi berkisar 5 20 persen sedangkan untuk mobile seluler bisa sampai 40 persen
2796613 dengan penurunan tarif interkoneksi tarif ritel atau tarif telepon di masyarakat diharapkan turun 5 20 persen untuk telepon tetap dan penurunan tarif seluler 20 40 persen
2796614 saat ini tarif investasi jaringan dari setiap operator terus turun jadi pemerintah lebih leluasa menurunkan tarif interkoneksi tanpa merugikan penanam modal
2796615 kami terus mencari cara bagaimana komunikasi tersebut lebih memasyarakat lagi sampai di lapisan terbawah salah satunya dengan menurunkan biaya
2796616 sektor telekomunikasi ingin menyumbangkan deflasi bagi masyarakat bukan inflasi seperti sektor lain
2796617 tarif lokal hanya untuk sambungan jarak jauh dan internasional yang turun karena fixed masih disubsidi pemerintah untuk layanan sms akan diatur di regulasi lain nantinya
2796618 saya pikir kemungkinan itu sangat kecil sebab kebijakan tersebut membantu operator sendiri dalam bisnisnya
2796619 implementasinya ya mulai 1 april kalau kecepetan implemetasinya red operator rugi dong sekarang lagi itung itungan sesuai kepmen
2796620 struktur tarif itu ada tiga yakni biaya operasional keuntungan operator dan biaya interkoneksi antaroperator pemerintah menurunkan biaya interkoneksi kami harap ini bisa mengurangi besaran tarif seluruhnya
2796621 tarif ditentukan secara business to business yang penting tidak boleh lebih mahal
2796622 penyusunan skema baru itu sudah melalui proses yang lengkap kita patuh saja terhadap peraturan pemerintah
2796623 penurunan tarif interkoneksi pasti berpengaruh terhadap pendapatan tapi dengan adanya elastisitas penurunan tarif mestinya diimbangi kenaikan trafik
2796624 setiap operator punya strategi pemasaran berbeda sehingga saya tidak bisa ngomong penurunan berapa persen karena ini strategi pemasaran
2796625 kalau tarif ritel tetap tinggi tentu tidak akan dipilih oleh masyarakat

2796637 as of today most of the city tskhinvali is controlled by russian peacekeeping forces
2796638 we deplore the dangerous and disproportionate actions by russian forces and we would be particularly troubled if these attacks are continuing now as the georgians are pulling back
2796639 the georgian tanks fired at everything they saw including women and children
2796640 we are not going to undertake any actions which are going to lead to escalation of the situation in this region
2796641 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
2796642 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
2796643 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
2796644 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance

2796646 pervez has insulted and compromised pakistans sovereignty by allowing the cia and fbi to operate freely in pakistan and arrest interrogate torture deport and detain any person whether pakistani or not for as long as they like thus turning the pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade

2796649 we have a number of businesses that depend on good air service
2796650 its going to be much harder for us to convince a high tech company that they should come here it hurts
2796651 we have a few airports out there that i think are spending more than they should quite frankly and so there are some real total airport cost increases that we are very vocal about
2796652 the more you raise fees the more you drive airlines and customers away
2796653 its rhetoric ive heard for 41 years but i understand
2796654 these folks arent sure if theyre going to be in business in six months
2796655 the more we can mobilize this community the fewer patents that will actually be granted
2796656 whatever happens in the patent reform world in the next u s administration is great but we have to act now to stop the granting of patents that threaten linux and open source in general
2796657 a production environment where we educate and train people to do this well work with them to make sure its put in a form that is acceptable
2796658 those are kind of the key areas to linux as it moves forward

2796661 how much does it pain my heart and my soul to announce to the palestinian people the arab and islamic world and to everyone who loves peace and freedom the passing of the star of palestine
2796662 will leave a great void in our cultural political and national life
2796663 the whole world knew palestine by two names or two symbolic figures yasser arafat and mahmud darwish
2796664 now palestine is without a symbolic figure it has been orphaned just as poetry itself has today been orphaned by the passing of our poet
2796665 before anything mahmud darwish was a great poet who possessed real poetic power
2796666 he quickly became the national palestinian poet the poet of the exile and of the refugees
2796667 deprives the palestinians and all the arabs of one of their most noted representatives for contemporary poetry and culture
2796668 with his poetry darwish transcended all the frontiers and broke the chains of narrow patriotism in order to become the voice of palestine
2796669 his poetic masterpieces advocated the just cause of the palestinian people and expressed their aspirations
2796670 is run by lobbyists that represent georgia and other countries
2796671 he takes huge amounts of money from oil companies that are profiting in the former soviet union and many parts of the world
2796672 this has been one of the failures of the bush administration failing to build a strong relationship a mutually beneficial relationship with russia so wed have the kind of influence to persuade them to stop some of these very very dangerous efforts within their territory
2796673 experience is only positive insofar as it creates good judgment
2796674 and i think senator obamas strong case to the american people is that he will have the right judgment about how to balance americas military force with strong diplomacy to protect our interests abroad
2796675 john mccains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government
2796676 mr scheunemann proudly represented a small democracy that is one of our closest allies in a very dangerous region
2796677 the reaction of the obama campaign to this crisis so at odds with our democratic allies and yet so bizarrely in sync with moscow doesnt merely raise questions about senator obamas judgment it answers them
2796678 theyre an example of senator mccains push to spread democracy in that part of the world as a very important advance of americas interest as well as being good for international stability
2796679 so instead of trying to detract from the central issue i wish senator obama had actually confronted the issue not trying to detract our attention by focusing on a mccain adviser
2796680 i believe what senator mccain is proposing is totally totally wrong
2796681 is run by lobbyists that represent georgia and other countries
2796682 this morning some people were going to the grape fields when the bomb exploded on their vehicle five people died and three were wounded
2796683 the reports we received from the police chief of kapisa show that 11 civilians have been killed one of the dead was a woman
2796684 right now we are working to find out what exactly happened

2796693 eu penso que a elei o do omar vai valer a pena para as pessoas que moram em manaus por isso estou apostando nele
2796694 o mercosul e o sul obviamente al m de aprofundar as boas rela es com v rios pa ses do mundo
2796695 rumo a outras latitudes que at o momento foram descuidadas
2796696 descobri por exemplo que angola um pequeno pa s que recentemente conquistou a independ ncia hoje est sendo o terceiro importador da carne paraguaia uma das principais fontes de divisas do pa s
2796697 se as tropas georgianas abandonarem a oss tia do sul e entre a ge rgia e essa regi o for firmado um acordo de ren ncia ao uso da for a a paz se restabelecer independentemente do destino pessoal de saakashvili
2796698 r ssia n o pode considerar como parceiro algu m que ordenou que fossem cometidos crimes de guerra que causaram a morte de milhares de cidad os russos incluindo soldados de paz

2796710 reclaiming history is as much a piece of propaganda as the warren commission findings that it supports
2796711 a blind monkey could tell you bush is a murderer i dont need bugliosi for that he seems to be sniffing the winds and cashing in on some obvious crimes that only the lunatic neo con right would argue against good however hes also boosting his own credibility and thus his previous works his bullshit kennedy cover up is indefensible we must ask why he wrote it anyone with three brain cells knows the cia was behind kennedys assassination this isnt even controversial except on corporate media
2796712 the purpose of bugliosis reclaiming history is to defend the integrity of the usg national security state by grossly distorting its nature and function
2796713 according to bugliosi only the lunatic can seriously entertain that kennedy was murdered because he pursued d tente with the ussr championed nuclear disarmament decided not to back the invasion of the bay of pigs with us military might made a peaceful resolution of the cuban missile crisis when the joint chiefs wanted invasion and war and decided to withdraw us troops from vietnam rather than pursue by brute force an imperial venture in southeast asia
2796714 bugliosi tells the story of charming his audience of six hundred lawyers mostly skeptics of the warren commission by asking for a show of hands from those who doubt the official story

2796720 id also like to see you reprise your lesson from the union square event some time ago on extracting minimal value from the network you create so the network grows as large as possible and the value youve created and can extract in the end is greater than if you had tried to extract more value at the beginning did i get that right i quote you to that effect all the time did it just the other day with a big publisher whose blog ad network is taking too high a cut i told him to just cover his costs for the first year or less and hed end up growing something bigger that would be more valuable to each member thus bigger thus more valuable to him eh
2796721 darwin was fascinated by questions of hair colour and the role it might play in choosing sexual partners he was keen to test whether english blondes really were more likely to stay single with a resulting decrease in blonde hair in subsequent generations

2796724 it does not really matter whether 2007 or 2008 is the worst year on record for arctic sea ice
2796725 the crucial point is that ice is clearly not building up enough over winter to restore cover and that when you combine current estimates of ice thickness with the extent of the ice cap you get a very clear indication that the arctic is going to be ice free in summer in five years
2796726 the most detailed computer models suggest the arctics summer ice is going to last for only a few more years and given what we have seen happen last week i think they are probably correct
2796727 where is the blockade there is no blockade it has been invented by the separatists who after having been caught on the wrong foot are seeking to guilt trip the amarnath shrine sangharsh samiti into calling off the jammu agitation which is just and has been completely peaceful
2796728 the shrine board act clearly lays down that it will be the responsibility of the body to provide these facilities to the pilgrims and the government should ensure that it carries out the brief without any hindrance

2796730 over the past nine years the ccp has used a variety of inaccurate labels on falun gong
2796731 in each case the aim has been to vilify people who practice falun gong and therefore justify the horrors these people are subject to under ccp rule
2796732 there exists sadly a real possibility that the ccp would attempt to stage or attribute a disruptive act perhaps even one involving violence with the intent to pin it on falun gong
2796733 the people location time and story in that report were all fabricated there did not exist a lady named zhi wen zhang at all
2796734 anyone who participates in an organized act of violence in the name of falun gong is by the very act itself not a falun gong practitioner and certainly does not represent the community of falun gong practitioners
2796735 in all our efforts to regain our basic freedoms over the past nine years we have never engaged in acts that intentionally harm innocent people

2796773 the wicket flattened out it was quite slow and took bounce out of the equation its still a very good wicket
2796774 we knew we didnt want them to get away from us its a very quick scoring ground at the oval with the square being so large but we didnt want de villiers to get away and the new ball comes a bit harder
2796775 we set defending fields with the aim of keeping them to a total of about 320 and thats what they got

2796792 hanno dei fucili e cacciano e molto noioso allevano anche delle galline e il loro solo interesse tu cerchi delle galline
2796793 tu fino ad ora per me non sei che un ragazzino uguale a centomila ragazzini e non ho bisogno di te e neppure tu hai bisogno di me io non sono per te che una volpe uguale a centomila volpi ma se tu mi addomestichi noi avremo bisogno luno dellaltro tu sarai per me unico al mondo e io saro per te unica al mondo
2796794 la mia vita e monotona io do la caccia alle galline e gli uomini danno la caccia a me tutte le galline si assomigliano e tutti gli uomini si assomigliano e io mi annoio percio ma se tu mi addomestichi la mia vita sara illuminata conoscero un rumore di passi che sara diverso da tutti gli altri gli altri passi mi fanno nascondere sotto terra il tuo mi fara uscire dalla tana come una musica e poi guarda vedi laggiu in fondo dei campi di grano io non mangio il pane e il grano per me e inutile i campi di grano non mi ricordano nulla e questo e triste ma tu hai dei capelli color delloro allora sara meraviglioso quando mi avrai addomesticato il grano che e dorato mi fara pensare a te e amero il rumore del vento nel grano
2796795 ma non ho molto tempo pero ho da scoprire degli amici e da conoscere molte cose
2796796 gli uomini non hanno piu tempo per conoscere nulla comprano dai mercanti le cose gia fatte ma siccome non esistono mercanti di amici gli uomini non hanno piu amici se tu vuoi un amico addomesticami
2796797 in principio tu ti sederai un po lontano da me cosi nellerba io ti guardero con la coda dellocchio e tu non dirai nulla le parole sono una fonte di malintesi ma ogni giorno tu potrai sederti un po piu vicino
2796798 se tu vieni per esempio tutti i pomeriggi alle quattro dalle tre io comincero ad essere felice col passare dellora aumentera la mia felicita quando saranno le quattro incomincero ad agitarmi e ad inquietarmi scopriro il prezzo della felicita ma se tu vieni non si sa quando io non sapro mai a che ora prepararmi il cuore ci vogliono i riti
2796799 e quello che fa un giorno diverso dagli altri giorni unora dalle altre ore ce un rito per esempio presso i miei cacciatori il giovedi ballano con le ragazze del villaggio allora il giovedi e un giorno meraviglioso io mi spingo sino alla vigna se i cacciatori ballassero in un giorno qualsiasi i giorni si assomiglierebbero tutti e non avrei mai vacanza
2796800 io non ti volevo far del male ma tu hai voluto che ti addomesticassi
2796801 va a rivedere le rose capirai che la tua e unica al mondo quando ritornerai a dirmi addio ti regalero un segreto
2796802 voi non siete per niente simili alla mia rosa voi non siete ancora niente
2796803 nessuno vi ha addomesticato e voi non avete addomesticato nessuno voi siete come era la mia volpe non era che una volpe uguale a centomila altre ma ne ho fatto il mio amico ed ora e per me unica al mondo
2796804 non si puo morire per voi certamente un qualsiasi passante crederebbe che la mia rosa vi rassomigli ma lei lei sola e piu importante di tutte voi perche e lei che ho innaffiata perche e lei che ho messa sotto la campana di vetro perche e lei che ho riparata col paravento perche su di lei ho uccisi i bruchi salvo i due o tre per le farfalle perche e lei che ho ascoltato lamentarsi o vantarsi o anche qualche volta tacere perche e la mia rosa
2796805 ecco il mio segreto e molto semplice non si vede bene che col cuore lessenziale e invisibile agli occhi
2796806 e il tempo che tu hai perduto per la tua rosa che ha fatto la tua rosa cosi importante
2796807 e il tempo che ho perduto per la mia rosa
2796808 gli uomini hanno dimenticato questa verita ma tu non la devi dimenticare tu diventi responsabile per sempre di quello che hai addomesticato tu sei responsabile della tua rosa

2796825 the conservatism that speaks to us through its actions in washington is institutionally opposed to those baseline good intentions we learned about in elementary school its leaders laugh off the idea of the public interest as airy fairy nonsense they caution against bringing top notch talent into government service they declare war on public workers they have made a cult of outsourcing and privatizing they have wrecked established federal operations because they disagree with them and they have deliberately piled up an everest of debt in order to force the government into crisis the ruination they have wrought has been thorough it has been a professional job repairing it will require years of political action
2796826 we are a free and sovereign people we govern ourselves and the government is ours but that is the point we are responsible not our leaders since we follow them we let them divert our loyalty from the united states to some party we let them boss the party and turn our municipal democracies into autocracies and our republican nation into a plutocracy we cheat our government and we let our leaders loot it and we let them wheedle and bribe our sovereignty from us

2796859 strengthening the middle class was a theme early in the election cycle while both candidates seem to have forgotten about the topic building a strong and inclusive middle class is more important than ever given the forecasts for population growth candidates who say they are trying to build a better future for america cannot continue to ignore the great disparities especially in key areas such as assets and housing costs that make the african american and latino middle classes financially weaker and less stable than their white counterparts

2796893 estamos ansiosos por pasar la eliminatoria y celebrarlo en el vicente calder n con nuestra gente
2796894 we have said that this is a condition driven process
2796895 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2796896 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
2796897 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
2796898 this was a heinous attack by al qaida in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
2796899 i did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town
2796900 al qaida is to blame for this attack operations in diyala have pushed them here
2796901 of course there will be pressure the only thing i can do is overcome it
2796902 i hope the pressure can become the motivation and that i can be very calm
2796903 it was not as relaxed and easy as it looks because we actually worked very hard every day training from morning until night

2796917 the crowd cheered me on as if i was a popular player
2796918 its really cool to be valued for what you are doing and you can sense the appreciation when you do a really difficult rally you know that they can appreciate it because a lot of them are players themselves they know who you are they value your sport
2796919 the gym is a lot bigger than what im used to the stage is bigger and there is a lot more anticipation and pressure

2796960 you are expected to be not a person but a tabula rasa and a simple member of a team the task of which is to work for the enjoyment of every guest
2796961 offering a smile and some understanding while keeping a neutral position where possible
2796962 its rare that i surrender but some guests simply refuse to be satisfied
2796963 after all guests are humans too and they naturally gravitate towards beautiful people
2796964 guests really let themselves go when theyre here and some mistake my professional interest for interest of the more intimate variety
2796965 they should respect the work we do were people too and this is hard work
2796966 guests should not assume that when they paid for their vacations they bought the animators at the same time

2796972 its more of a team unity thing nick and i ran it i told eric day 1 that unless i pass out i am going to try to do everything that everyone else does
2796973 im no different aside from being a little gray headed and a little bit older
2796974 you get used to a new guy and it takes a little bit of time and usually you get the luxury of doing it in the spring where no ones really around or cheering for laps
2796975 i need to call my mom and have her tape espn
2796976 hopefully i got on there today with a penalty lap it was weird because its a penalty lap and youre running it because youve done something wrong and people are cheering it was a little different
2796977 you have to get used to a guys voice his placement of his hands how quickly hes getting out you try to make it look as effortless as possible
2796978 i think its kind of funny but yet serves its purpose i think things like that are important in the fact that everyone is involved in it
2796979 when you come out here and the fans are going crazy and having fun it just helps you get through the day
2796980 weve just got to make sure were handling everything around him so we have the chemistry we need to have before the season starts
2796981 the ball comes out hard and fast and straight and long so thats always good
2796982 its been a whirlwind for him and theres a lot of new information going in were progressing quickly
2796983 until i can see the cadence and see the mechanics
2796984 brett had his two hard boiled eggs a little bit of orange juice
2796985 there was a garnish i think and some hashbrowns and i can take you through minute by minute after that
2796986 the eggs were mixed with the hashbrowns so i dont know which one actually hit his mouth first ill film it next time
2796987 initially when he was hospitalized we expected him to come back home but as the weeks went on i kind of knew
2796988 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
2796989 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
2796990 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
2796991 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him
2796992 im sad that my daughter will never know or be able to feel how much he loved her
2796993 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
2796994 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
2796995 when i post new things will my friends actually see them

2797035 how much does it pain my heart and my soul to announce to the palestinian people the arab and islamic world and to everyone who loves peace and freedom the passing of the star of palestine
2797036 will leave a great void in our cultural political and national life
2797037 the whole world knew palestine by two names or two symbolic figures yasser arafat and mahmud darwish
2797038 now palestine is without a symbolic figure it has been orphaned just as poetry itself has today been orphaned by the passing of our poet
2797039 before anything mahmud darwish was a great poet who possessed real poetic power
2797040 he quickly became the national palestinian poet the poet of the exile and of the refugees
2797041 deprives the palestinians and all the arabs of one of their most noted representatives for contemporary poetry and culture
2797042 with his poetry darwish transcended all the frontiers and broke the chains of narrow patriotism in order to become the voice of palestine
2797043 his poetic masterpieces advocated the just cause of the palestinian people and expressed their aspirations
2797044 to remain in their homes and maintain contact with frances embassy
2797045 i decided to forget that i hit the ball in the water

2797055 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2797056 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2797057 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2797058 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2797059 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2797060 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2797061 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2797062 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2797063 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2797064 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2797065 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2797066 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2797067 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2797068 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2797069 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2797070 we have said that this is a condition driven process
2797071 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2797072 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
2797073 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
2797074 this was a heinous attack by al qaida in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
2797075 i did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town
2797076 al qaida is to blame for this attack operations in diyala have pushed them here
2797077 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2797078 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2797079 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2797080 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2797081 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2797082 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2797083 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2797084 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2797085 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2797086 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2797087 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2797088 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2797089 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2797090 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2797091 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2797092 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2797093 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2797094 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2797095 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2797096 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2797097 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2797098 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2797099 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2797100 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2797101 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2797102 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2797103 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2797104 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2797105 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2797106 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2797107 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2797108 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2797109 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2797110 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2797111 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2797112 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2797113 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2797114 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2797115 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2797116 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2797117 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2797118 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

2797161 22 the fact that the practical power of modern society has detached itself from itself and established itself in the spectacle as an independent realm can only be explained by the self cleavage and self contradictoriness already present in that powerful practice

2797170 the excellent weblog iowahawk summarized some of the thoughts i had i must also laud david burge of iowahawk for his gritty pragmatism he is no armchair crusader full of empty imprecations
2797171 if iowahawk ever decides to turn his guns on you accept your beating with good grace and a rueful chuckle if you try to fight back it only gets funnier
2797172 next time iowahawk beats up on you just take it if you try to fight back it only gets worse its like one of those monsters that the harder you fight it the stronger it gets because it actually feeds on your pathetic swats

2797183 i really dont know how best to summarize iowahawks you are there white trash treatise if you crossed hunter thompson and michael lewis you might get something this angry and bizarre
2797184 hands down the best damn roadkill centric caucus coverage youll read
2797185 should be required reading for all students planning a career in journalism
2797186 inspired i was going to say parody but really it is far too close to the original to be called a parody really it is like the play hamlet stages to catch the conscience of the king a dramatic re enactment of the very crime claudius had committed but had yet to acknowledge it worked for hamlet will iowahawks performance work for the rest of us it is too early to tell but it is more truthful and far more amusing than anything youll read in the new york times

2797193 good thing that iowahawk exists otherwise wed have to invent him
2797194 you almost cant parody this mess but iowahawk can and does so again brilliantly

2797197 all the presidents prior to george w bush had a least one book under their belt and most had written several white papers during their education or early careers not so with president bush
2797198 he has no published works or writings so in many ways that made it more difficult to arrive at an assessment we had to rely more heavily on transcripts of his unscripted public speaking
2797199 he who has the gold makes the rules what is to stop the actively disengaged occupying some of the higher levels of the organization where they can do the most damage
2797200 youre going to have to come to the republican convention to find out whats going to happen there

2797204 the danger with teaching using this example is that many students only learn how to solve the problem with the trains

2797270 exactly what this is securing we are not sure but i for one feel that my olympic games experience will be much safer now that i cant listen to music in a bomb shelter
2797271 like a lot of businesses we have a lot of knowledge in peoples heads and with a typical ageing workforce we have a lot of intellectual property sitting in peoples heads which we need to get out so we can show in a visual way how work is actually done
2797272 you have got to take a lot of plant apart to get to the piece you have got to replace and then you have got to put it back together in extreme conditions
2797273 we animated the whole process so people know what they are doing and when so it is a heck of a lot clearer for a lot more people
2797274 the vision here is to slowly draw all the plant up based on an as needs basis
2797275 we are not multimedia animators trying to step into heavy industry
2797276 our background is mechanical engineering and manufacturing and we can walk the talk
2797277 having organisations choosing to partner with us and potentially each other to create a cluster group is a key step on that journey
2797278 is too many smiley and good behavior no tv and no frozen just sitting in the apartment each night
2797279 bennie jolink daphne bunskoek en herman finkers trokken er samen opuit om het goede voorbeeld te geven

2797287 the new yorker may think as one of their staff explained to us that their cover is a satirical lampoon of the caricature senator obamas right wing critics have tried to create but most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
2797288 we completely agree with the obama campaign its tasteless and offensive
2797289 haal jij eens een klein stukje taart voor deze jongen
2797290 the often inaccurate belief that a usage you have recently noticed is in fact a recent development in the language
2797291 what you wont hear from this campaign or this party is the kind of politics that uses religion as a wedge
2797292 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans for example have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging they have been reminded that the history of immigration in this country has a dark underbelly they need specific reassurances that their citizenship really means something that america has learned the right lessons from the japanese internments during world war ii and that i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
2797293 ive spent many an hour wandering around a field back home trying to get all these different jokes and puns to stay in there
2797294 i dont really see it as any different to what actors do
2797295 remembering things like hamlet would seem a lot harder to me yet nobody ever asks these actors how they remember all their lines
2797296 in hindsight i have tried to look back and imagine if i did start out like that as some form of protest
2797297 but i really think its just my natural act my comedy heroes are all people who are just fun comics but im also a fan of people like jeff green though who do try and put some meaning into their act there will always be a place for politics in comedy it wouldnt work if everyone put on the same performance as me itd be disastrous for my career for a start
2797298 my first full hour though was 1995 when i managed to win the perrier best newcomer award things have just so much bigger now since then of course theres just so many shows i remember in 1995 there was the odd corridor you could walk down and there wouldnt be anyone telling a joke or performing a play but now theyre just everywhere
2797299 if its something thats going to turn out to affect the person whos toiled over their show for ages and makes it harder for them to get that break then its defeating the real nature of stand up comedy it always works best when its not such a big event theres a promoter i know in london who puts on shows and theres only about 15 people in the audience but i still enjoy doing them theres just zero pressure and its the natural environment for comedy just one bloke on stage trying to show off
2797300 thats thanks to lee mack the writer and tims close friend really he wrote the pilot then asked me if i was interested to take part in a reading i was unsure myself if it was the sort of thing i could do but i think lee trusted me with his writing and felt i could do justice to the jokes
2797301 i have very good answer for that actually and its my sisters show its called the rules of drama and suspense with bronya and siony and it comes highly recommended
2797302 serve it well chilled in a proper wine glass and revel in its quality

2797306 the immediate cause of the seabird breeding failures is generally believed to be a shortage of food they have trouble finding sand eels to feed their chicks probably what is happening is that there is some change in the ocean which is reducing the availability of food and also increasing warm water but we dont really know the details of what the cause is
2797307 data suggest that global civil society did have some casual effect on great power foreign policies and the changes to the trips regime with regard to public health
2797308 for drezner the cumulative contributions from non governmental organisations ngo and other non state actors must be conceptualised through state based frameworks with gcs being one contributory element in the evolution of the trips and generic drugs agenda
2797309 as it stands unilever suppliers are driving species extinction climate change through the significant greenhouse gas ghg emissions linked to deforestation and peatland destruction and land conflict with forest dependent communities
2797310 this is just the first step in our campaign to get a moratorium on forest destruction in south east asia in place within what we hope will be months unilever is supporting our call for a moratorium on the ground but even through they are the biggest buyer they represent only 3 per cent of the palm oil purchasers and the moratorium will need a lot more support from other companies before we see real change on the ground in indonesia
2797311 it cannot be ruled out that sandeel fishing could adversely effect sic the breeding success of the birds it would therefore be precautionary to close areas to fishing until more is known about sandeel stock structure and interactions between sandeels and seabirds
2797312 the amount of industrial fish species taken by fishermen in the north sea appears to leave little for seabirds and marine mammals
2797313 on the whole current arrangements to regulate global communications global ecology global markets global money and finance global organisations and global production rest at best on the thinnest consent of the affected publics

2797322 there is going to have to be some kind of adjustment in what the contractors are making if the state is going to recruit staff psychologists
2797323 grassroots initiatives that are funded solely by internally mobilised resources have a limited capacity to expand activities or touch more people they need external resources for quantitative functional and organisational scaling up
2797324 the poorer the country and the weaker its government the more important the role and the power of international development organisations in many african countries for instance development is basically managed by the undp representative and the world bank delegation for local communities this international presence is often as much of the problem as of the solution
2797325 increased funding and the requirements attached to it as well as the need to sustain it over time create a dynamic in favour of staying in business at any cost it also can lead to adopting projects for which funding is available rather than focusing on local needs
2797326 ive based my life on touring and the rock industry is a high energy consuming industry
2797327 unlike pessimists such as james lovelock i dont believe we are all doomed

2797332 in their early years most financial ngos offered both microcredit and a gamut of non financial services such as education health services or technical assistance with business or agriculture financial and non financial services are strong complements for the households that consume them and ngos thought they could efficiently link them to the production side in practice the multiple purposes wrecked many ngos non financial services distracted ngo staff from financial services ngos lost loads of funds to boot this prompted some ngos to focus just on microfinance
2797333 in theory the apex organisation is meant to perform the same functions as a donor but without the same constraints and at less cost
2797334 apex organisations have not improved the sustainability of mfis in bolivia much the strong mfis now in place developed without the help of an apex thus apex organisations have not developed a market indeed an apex that intermediate funds might destroy its ability to develop a market since mfis would have fewer reasons to strengthen their sustainability through the pursuit of funds on the market deposits and loans from commercial sources

2797338 grand inga could produce up to 39 000 mw of electricity over twice the power generation of three gorges dam in china and more than a third of the total electricity currently produced in africa
2797339 with a price tag of us 80 billion concerns are growing that foreign companies will gain vast economic benefits from this mega project taking attention away from the development needs of africas poor majority
2797340 the scheme which will initially focus on the inga rapids near the rivers mouth in western congo kinshasa drc would generate more power than the giant power schemes on chinas yangzi river previous plans have concentrated on the growing need for power and water in southern africa but eskom holds that the inga rapids plant will produce enough energy to supply southern europes growing demand of clean power
2797341 environment groups and local people warned that it could bypass the most needy and end up as africas most ruinous white elephant consigning one of the poorest countries to mountainous debts
2797342 despite congo having exported electricity for years from inga 1 and inga 2 access to electricity across the country is less than 6 and in rural areas where nearly 70 of people live it is only 1
2797343 my village is 3km from ingas power lines they built a line almost 2 000km to the mines in katanga province but in all of these years we have been left without electricity
2797344 there are huge social issues around grand inga that must be dealt with congo must benefit if congo is bypassed then the whole project fails
2797345 big business which for years shunned africa has suddenly developed a new interest attracted by the rich pickings to be had in the new carbon emissions market and the credits they can get from investing in so called clean development projects
2797346 it is hoped it will boost africas electricity supply by a third but opponents doubt it will help the poorest africans without electricity

2797353 when you discuss security issues if you are telling the truth that should be something protected at the core of the first amendment
2797354 if you are truthfully telling the world about a dangerous situation and it is a situation which is dangerous not because the security researcher exposes the vulnerability but because the person who made the product made the vulnerability then this should be core speech
2797355 knowingly causes the transmission of a program information code or command to a computer or computer system
2797356 the statute on its face appears to be discussing sending code or similar types of information to a computer
2797357 it does not appear to contemplate somebody who is giving a talk to humans nevertheless the court believed that the act of giving a presentation to a group of humans was covered by the computer fraud computer intrusion statute we believe this is wrong
2797358 basically what the court is suggesting here is that giving a presentation involving security to other security researchers is a violation of federal law
2797359 as far as i know this is completely unprecedented and it has a tremendous chilling effect on sharing this sort of research and we intend to fight it with everything weve got

2797365 they were always the hometown airline they were in the downtown parades they invested in the community
2797366 we have a number of businesses that depend on good air service
2797367 its going to be much harder for us to convince a high tech company that they should come here it hurts
2797368 we have a few airports out there that i think are spending more than they should quite frankly and so there are some real total airport cost increases that we are very vocal about
2797369 the more you raise fees the more you drive airlines and customers away

2797376 i began the story terese svoboda gave as homework it was really hard for me because i wanted it to be profound and important and prolific but it read more like a play or one of those easy read books like shopoholic and such and right as i was putting it down as crap i had an epiphany not everything i write has to be profound or life changing or earth shattering besides good writing is good writing and i know im a good writer
2797377 ahora lo que tenemos que hacer es el configurar cada router para que pueda establecer la comunicacion de uno con el otro y en primer lugar crearemos las redes internas de los routers esto es crear la red de router laptop y dejar la interfaz serial del router con una red diferente que la de ethernet esta nos servira mas adelante como la red que podra conectar ambas de las redes asi que nuestro plan de ejecucion al momento queda asi aqui nuetra lap top tiene la direccion 192 168 2 11 la direccion del router es 192 168 2 1 esta es la red que tenemos configurada en la interfaz de ethernet por otra parte la interfaz serial muestra que hay otra red la 192 168 3 0 y el router en esta red tiene la direccion 192 168 3 33 asignada

2797385 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
2797386 it was so thrilling that we actually got away with it
2797387 im glad it ended when it did it would have been a mess
2797388 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is
2797389 at some point in our lives you have to have some sort of accountability i cant see how people in my situation deny that
2797390 to know how truly sorry i am and i am willing to pay
2797391 i need to pay back i cant pay back monetarily this is the way

2797431 the north koreans have a very sour feeling toward the new government in seoul and they are giving expression to their feelings you might see a protracted period of this kind of behavior
2797432 you could see that the distrust between the two korean government is much deeper than we expected

2797465 we need an organisation that is independent from government actually has the powers to get hold of the various records of new zealand first and get to the bottom of the money that is has changed hands here
2797466 but now he has reconciled you by his physical body through his death to present you holy faultless and blameless before him
2797467 and abover all things have fervent love for one another for love will cover a multitude of sins
2797468 in everything you do stay away from complaining and arguing
2797469 i hate my menial and routine job a job i might love would be challenging and full of variety
2797470 i hate the constant deadlines and having no time to reflect or relax a career that would allow me time to smell the roses that i would love
2797471 god is faithful he will no let you be tempted beyond what you can bear but when you are tempted he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it
2797472 we actually get to push the bondaries more than we usually do in the adult industry
2797473 this really freed us up to see what kind of trouble we could get into
2797474 i spent the money on a nice car but to me its not worth it i dont think i will go that route again
2797475 we are looking at stuff that reminds me of the 1970s
2797476 americans have seen a huge amount of their balance sheet evaporate the effects will be more lingering
2797477 we werent big spenders but now we are watching our money more
2797478 even if i fell into a pile of money i still wouldnt be spending a lot
2797479 people are spending money on food and the products they need to sustain life
2797480 i am seeing a younger crowd who lives in the disposable world
2797481 they are learning an economics lesson they will see the benefit of the savings and how much money they walk away with when they fix their shoes
2797482 my age group spends tens of thousands of dollars to go to college and then owes thousands of dollars more in student loans and credit cards before they get their first paycheck
2797483 we know we dont want to spend ourselves into disaster but we also dont want to give up the finer things in life
2797484 saying no to debt completely isnt realistic for my generation the problem is young people dont know a thing about how to make money let alone make their money work for them
2797485 this is one of the few things we cant rely on the parents to teach at home because many adults are just learning the consequences for bad spending habits themselves
2797486 we are the next generation of leaders and taxpayers if someone doesnt reach out and explain the disaster we are headed for americas financial future will come crumbling down like a house of cards
2797487 if you visualise being stronger running faster or winning you are priming your nervous system to do just that
2797488 studies have found that the method can enhance physical performance significantly sometimes by 20 percent or more
2797489 breathing deeply imagine your headache wash away as a stream of cool blue light or fluid runs through your head dispersing the pain and calming the whole area down
2797490 after a bout of sex the body releases endorphins known as happy chemicals
2797491 from a physical point of view its similar to enjoying a good workout or going swimming but if youre having sex with someone you love it also makes you feel cared for and promotes self esteem
2797492 theres no doubt that sex is relaxing and so helps tackle insomnia
2797493 lots of people use sex whether with a partner or on their own as a way of getting to sleep the surge in oxytocin is a natural sedative
2797494 it is also released in people in secure relationships and during sexual contact
2797495 often when i see couples in trouble they have stopped having sex and one of them will say their partner no longer finds them attractive
2797496 we know that having a strong relationship is a good indicator of longevity and a healthy sex life is a big part of that
2797497 traiesc cu sentimentul ca pot triumfa in multe domenii si ca pot deveni un om marcant al istoriei ce o vor citi nepotii mei insa lenea ma impinge sa traiesc viata unui simplu muritor dar am de gand sa schimb asta
2797498 well when youve been with a ball club for so long and you have had a lot of success obviously its kind of tough to break ties and go in a whole new direction
2797499 but again as weve seen throughout this whole saga its a business and sometimes organizations try to put a leash on you and try to control everything thats there and i guess if it happens to brett it can happen to all of us
2797500 its a lot different than last year a lot different than last year and it will show but thats not what its really about its about just going out and trying to make plays and trying to win games
2797501 it was an experience it was a learning experience i got a chance to see how fast the game was i only got a taste of it in practice
2797502 you know it really was tough because you couldnt get in a pass rush rhythm
2797503 they werent dropping back much they wanted to run the ball and we held our own
2797504 well i thought the whole offensive line did a great job in the run game and in the pass game and that includes max
2797505 he was excited about his performance and we were excited as well
2797506 food should be fresh from the land and sea to create healthy nourishment
2797507 it will be one of the toughest races for michael to win the world record will be in danger
2797508 if somebody 10 or 15 years ago would have said the 400 im will be won in 2008 in 4 03 8 id have bet everything i had or would ever get that it wouldnt happen
2797509 that was one of the most amazing swims ive ever seen in my life
2797510 he absolutely blew me away hes going to be on fire now its going to be hard to stop him
2797511 the four of us set out to do something that not a lot of people thought we could do
2797512 going into the last 50 and looking to my right and seeing that i was ahead of ryan and laszlo i sort of started smiling
2797513 i just think he was caught up in the moment
2797514 there are a lot of middle aged men and women who i know that tell me that im an inspiration to them and theyre now doing things they thought they couldnt do
2797515 im hoping that my age paves the way for other athletes who maybe think theyre too old to do something
2797516 but getting bronze does still leave me a little bit hungry for things that are a little higher it will just drive me all week
2797517 its kind of disappointing when you talk it up and talk it up and then nothing happens
2797518 the houston area got most of the rain today two to four inches
2797519 with instability caused by the low pressure we could still see a 50 percent chance of rainfall throughout the day
2797520 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2797521 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2797522 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2797523 the leader was four shots ahead of me so i thought id just go out and have fun im very happy
2797524 i was nervous i hardly dared to talk to her
2797525 before the tournament i wanted annika to win it shes my favourite player
2797526 i knew this was my last tournament in sweden im enormously thankful for the fans support this week
2797527 if we cannot eliminate bias then we should instead attempt to be more responsible about it and explicitly decide on and defend the perspectives represented in information systems

2797530 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2797531 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2797535 i guess its an inescapable reality of human life regardless of our vocation or profession that the initial joy of our first commitment often wanes as we get caught up in the burdens and cynicism of the world it might be inevitable but its profoundly sad when it happens
2797536 too often i get caught up in a labyrinth of daily administrative and pastoral activities to the point that prayer becomes an appendage of my day
2797537 perhaps we should try to return to our ordination day and recapture the excitement and fervor of that time in our life maybe it would be helpful to recall the commitments we made and the reason for those commitments
2797538 do you resolve with the help of the holy spirit to discharge without fail the office of priesthood do you resolve to to exercise the ministry of the word worthily and wisely preaching the gospel and teaching the catholic faith do you resolve to celebrate faithfully and reverently in accord with the churchs tradition the mysteries of christ do you resolve to implore with us gods mercy upon the people entrusted to your care do you resolve to be united more closely every day to christ the high priest
2797539 brothers its critical that we evaluate our commitment to the ministry of the word do we devote sufficient time to the preparation of our sunday homily do we immerse ourselves in the word spending time in prayer and reflection taking it unto ourselves before we preach it to others are our homilies faithful effective challenging and joyful proclamations of the saving message of jesus christ
2797540 our daily personal attention to the eucharist faithfully celebrated gratefully received and humbly adored is certainly one of the keys to maintaining the joy and enthusiasm of our priestly ministry
2797541 even recent experience has shown that when the sacrament of reconciliation is explained and promoted and when the priest is truly available people will in fact frequent the sacrament the message of forgiveness reconciliation and peace is certainly something our church and society need to hear
2797542 the question reminds us that praying with and for our people is one of the primary responsibilities of the priest
2797543 we know that prayer is essential to our spiritual survival and ministerial effectiveness prayer is to priesthood what oxygen is to life
2797544 our desire to be ever more closely united to christ our desire to grow in holiness is indeed the work of a lifetime but a goal for which we can never stop striving
2797545 nothing is more effective even in our jaded culture today than the compelling example of a holy priest in love with the lord enthusiastic about his work and completely dedicated to the people he is sent to serve your work is important dear brothers you do make a difference your people are watching waiting hoping and praying for your leadership and example
2797546 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2797601 nor am i making the absurd claim that darwinism of logical necessity leads directly or indirectly to nazism
2797602 it would be foolish to blame darwinism for the holocaust as though darwinism leads logically to the holocaust
2797603 the multivalence of darwinism and eugenics ideology especially when applied to ethical political and social thought together with the multiple roots of nazi ideology should make us suspicious of monocausal arguments about the origins of the nazi worldview
2797604 social darwinism is often taken to be something extraneous an ugly concretion added to the pure darwinian corpus after the event tarnishing darwins image but his notebooks make plain that competition free trade imperialism racial extermination and sexual inequality were written into the equation from the start darwinism was always intended to explain human society

2797765 queda de manifiesto que se ha atentado a uno de los rewe correspondiente al territorio lafkenche lago budi por la carretera de la costa en la comuna de saavedra
2797766 por tanto se denuncia al estado y al gobierno de chile por no escuchar y hacer caso omiso a nuestras peticiones para evitar la construcci n de la carretera en nuestros espacios sagrados y la incapacidad de solucionar los graves problemas existentes en los diferentes territorios de nuestro pueblo

2797771 comenzando por el se or alcalde de puerto saavedra sr ricardo tripainao calfulaf por cuanto l fue quien autoriz y propici la construcci n de dicha carretera usando a las personas con enga o diciendo mejoramiento de camino pasando por encima de los estudios de impactos ambiental sociocultural llevado a cabo por la universidad de la frontera adem s el ministerio de obras p blicas y la intendencia estaban en conocimiento de los hechos y acontecimientos acaecidos en dicho territorio
2797772 no queremos que avance un metro mas la carretera porque fue un gran enga o del se or alcalde ricardo tripainao diciendo que era mejoramiento de camino esto no es mejoramiento de camino sino que derechamente una carretera

2797782 you should understand something your security is based on the state of our relationship
2797783 what you can give me then may be some real reform in election commission
2797784 she should not be hoping for much there reforms either
2797785 they ve been listening to her calls for months including an earlier call she made to her son
2797786 united states is generally hesitant to ensure the protection of anyone who is not a designated leader
2797787 if you re retreating from that what can you give me may be some real reform in the election commission
2797788 the americans can call all they want with their suggestions about you and me let them call
2797789 your security is based on the state of our relationship
2797790 by the next day musharraf calls bhutto at her estate near karachi
2797791 the priority of this trip is to get bhutto the security support she lacks
2797792 this is a volatile situation you re walking into benazir
2797793 senator kerry i want pakistan to provide me with the security i am entitled to under the laws of my country i d be grateful if you would talk to the musharraf government and tell him the us expects he will fulfill those obligations
2797794 well benazir i will certainly talk to the state department about that point being made to musharraf
2797795 the initiative to reinsert bhutto into pakistan was in fact launched and led by rice and her state department
2797796 was that arranging this marriage can only backfire on us bhutto is complicated and unpredictable it s best to just support musharraf give him whatever he wants or needs to stay in power our position the advisor added is that this whole thing with bhutto is being run out of state let them fly or fall on their own
2797797 democrats openly say they are going to you and republicans say they arent but then they do
2797798 african americans vote democratic anyway so what difference does it make how many vote for obama
2797799 would people you know not vote for a black person
2797800 obama is so great the only reason someone wouldnt vote for him is race
2797801 they asked the same whites if most of the people they knew would vote for a black candidate nineteen percent said that those they knew would not
2797802 how many of you know someone you think wont vote for a black person

2797805 how much does it pain my heart and my soul to announce to the palestinian people the arab and islamic world and to everyone who loves peace and freedom the passing of the star of palestine
2797806 will leave a great void in our cultural political and national life
2797807 the whole world knew palestine by two names or two symbolic figures yasser arafat and mahmud darwish
2797808 now palestine is without a symbolic figure it has been orphaned just as poetry itself has today been orphaned by the passing of our poet
2797809 before anything mahmud darwish was a great poet who possessed real poetic power
2797810 he quickly became the national palestinian poet the poet of the exile and of the refugees
2797811 deprives the palestinians and all the arabs of one of their most noted representatives for contemporary poetry and culture
2797812 with his poetry darwish transcended all the frontiers and broke the chains of narrow patriotism in order to become the voice of palestine
2797813 his poetic masterpieces advocated the just cause of the palestinian people and expressed their aspirations
2797814 to remain in their homes and maintain contact with frances embassy
2797815 this morning some people were going to the grape fields when the bomb exploded on their vehicle five people died and three were wounded

2797817 right now we are working to find out what exactly happened
2797818 beginning yesterday afternoon unomig has reported ongoing aerial bombardments of georgian villages in the upper kodori valley
2797819 also observed the movement by the abkhaz side of substantial numbers of heavy weapons and military personnel towards the kodori valley
2797820 push the georgian armed forces out of the upper kodori valley
2797821 following the withdrawal of georgian troops from south ossetia the president of the republic believes there is a real perspective of rapidly finding a way out of the crisis
2797822 intends to pursue contacts with both georgian and russian presidents in the coming hours to bring their positions closer together and create the conditions to end the crisis

2797847 in our time do we still have to fast for the whole of tisha bav seeing that our sovereign independence has been regained may we reduce the outward signs of mourning and permit eating after the
2797848 if tisha bav commemorated only the destruction of the two temples in 586 b c e and 70 c e its capacity to appeal to the modern jew would have vanished though it is true that both calamities threatened the very survival of the jewish people conservative jews no longer pray for the restoration of the sacrificial cult in jerusalem the verbal and musical worship of the synagogue surely represents a more edifying humane and universal form of prayer but early on tisha bav began to absorb the memory of other national disasters
2797849 reform judaism has never assigned a central religious role to the ancient temple therefore mourning the destruction of the temple in such an elaborate fashion did not seem meaningful more recently in reform judaism tishah bav has been transformed into a day to remember many jewish tragedies that have occurred throughout history

2797894 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2797895 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2797896 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2797897 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2797898 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2797899 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2797900 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2797901 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2797902 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2797903 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2797904 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2797905 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2797906 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2797907 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2797908 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2797909 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2797910 the only reason youre conscious right now is because i dont want to carry you
2797911 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2797912 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2797913 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2797914 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2797915 you will find love or love will find you just hold out for the right right person

2797918 its the word micro that explains his interest he concentrates not on the personal biological family social but rather on the precise details of the situation in which violence occurs he looks for the the contours of the precise situation which shape the emotions and acts of the individuals that step inside them for example when he looks at an incident of violence hell be concentrating on patterns of surge or counter surge in the crowd of the precise chain of events that precedes the attack upon a fallen policeman the number of people actually involved in the violence and the number of non participants

2797934 this is what it should be instead of making children ordinary with that dull vulgar common sense which becomes an inveterate habit this is like an acid a destructive acid in the being which takes away hope certitude confidence in future possibilities and if you avoid this when you are very small you have much less difficulty than if later on you have to undo all the bad effects of a bad education undo that kind of dull and vulgar common sense which makes it insipid boring and contradicts all the hopes all the so called illusions of beauty

2797995 balasku sambil memakai kaca mata hitam dan memakai topi menutupi kopiah putih yang telah menempel di kepalaku
2797996 saif rudi minta dibangunkan pukul setengah dua tadi malam dia lembur bikin makalah kelihatannya dia baru tidur jam setengah sepuluh tadi terus tolong nanti bilang sama dia untuk beli gula dan minyak goreng hari ini dia yang piket belanja oh ya hampir lupa nanti sore yang piket masak hamdi dia paling suka masak oseng oseng wortel campur kebetulan wortel dan koftanya habis bilang sama rudi sekalian
2797997 maria atau maryam sama saja seperti david dengan daud yang jelas namaku tertulis dalam kitab sucimu kitab yang paling banyak dibaca umat manusia di dunia sepanjang sejarah bahkan jadi nama sebuah surat surat kesembilan belas yaitu surat maryam hebat bukan
2797998 hei bagaimana kau mengatakan adalah kitab suci paling banyak dibaca umat manusia sepanjang sejarah dari mana kamu tahu itu
2797999 jangan kaget kalau aku berkata begitu ini namanya objektif memang kenyataannya demikian charles francis potter mengatakan seperti itu bahkan jujur kukatakan jauh lebih dimuliakan dan dihargai daripada kitab suci lainnya ia lebih dihargai daripada perjanjian baru dan perjanjian lama pendeta j shillidy dalam bukunya the lord jesus in the koran memberikan kesaksian seperti itu dan pada kenyataannya tak ada buku atau kitab di dunia ini yang dibaca dan dihafal oleh jutaan manusia setiap detik melebihi di mesir saja ada sekitar sepuluh ribu mahad al azhar siswanya ratusan ribu bahkan jutaan anak mereka semua sedang menghafalkan karena mereka tak akan lulus dari mahad al azhar kecuali harus hafal aku saja yang seorang koptik suka kok menghafal bahasanya indah dan enak dilantunkan
2798000 aku hafal surat maryam dan surat al maidah di luar kepala
2798001 fahri aku geli sekali mendengar perkataan doktor dari sorbonne itu dia itu orang arab juga muslim tapi bagaimana bisa mengatakan hal yang stupid begitu aku saja yang koptik bisa merasakan betapa indahnya dengan alif laam miim nya kurasa rangkaian huruf huruf seperti alif laam miim alif laam ra haa miim yaa siin nuun kaf ha ya ain shaad adalah rumus rumus tuhan yang dahsyat maknanya susah diungkapkan maknanya tapi keagungannya bisa ditangkap oleh mereka yang memiliki cita rasa bahasa arab yang tinggi jika susunan itu dianggap sebagai suatu ketidakberesan orang orang kafir quraisy yang sangat tidak suka pada dan memusuhinya sejak dahulu tentu akan mengambil kesempatan adanya ketidakberesan itu untuk menghancurkan dan tentu mereka sudah mencela bahasa habis habisan sepanjang sejarah namun kenyataannya justru sebaliknya mereka mengakui keindahan bahasanya yang luar biasa mereka menganggap bahasa bukan bahasa manusia biasa tapi bahasa yang datang dari langit jadi kukira doktor itu benar benar stupid tidak semestinya seorang doktor sekelas dia mengatakan hal seperti itu
2798002 wah pendapat yang terlintas begitu saja dalam benak kok bisa sama dengan pendapat mayoritas ulama tafsir ya
2798003 cuacanya buruk sangat panas apa tidak sebaiknya istrirahat saja jarak yang akan kau tempuh itu tidak dekat pikirkan juga kesehatanmu akh
2798004 semestinya memang begitu syaikh tapi saya harus komitmen dengan jadwal jadwal adalah janji janji pada diri sendiri dan janji pada syaikh utsman untuk datang
2798005 dengan topi dan kaca mata hitammu itu kau seperti bintang film hong kong saja tak tampak sedikit pun kau seorang mahasiswa pascasarjana al azhar yang hafal
2798006 di helwan saya belajar qiraah riwayat imam hafsh pada syaikh hasan yang tak lain adalah murid syaikh utsman berkali kali syaikh hasan memintaku untuk ikut belajar qiraah sabah langsung pada syaikh utsman tapi aku tak ada waktu aku sudah terlalu sibuk dengan pekerjaan dan keluarga jadi kau termasuk orang yang beruntung orang indonesia
2798007 itu mumpung ada orang amerika minggu depan mereka mungkin sudah kembali ke amerika kau bisa titip pesan pada mereka agar presiden mereka tidak bertindak bodoh seperti yang kau katakan tadi
2798008 perempuan bule muda mengungkapkan rasa terima kasih pada perempuan bercadar
2798009 oh not at all its all right cuaca memang panas dan melelahkan semuanya lelah dalam keadaan lelah terkadang susah untuk mengalah dan itu sangat manusiawi
2798010 kau memang sungguh kurang ajar perempuan kau membela bule bule amerika yang telah membuat bencana di mana mana di afganistan di palestina di irak dan di mana mana mereka juga tiada henti hentinya menggoyang negara kita kau ini muslimah macam apa hah
2798011 meski kau bercadar dan membawa mushaf ke mana mana nilaimu tak lebih dari seorang
2798012 orang indonesia kau tahu apa sok mengajari kami tentang islam heh belajar bahasa arab saja baru kemarin sore juz amma entah hafal entah tidak sok pintar kamu sudah kau diam saja belajar baik baik selama di sini dan jangan ikut campur urusan kami
2798013 kapten kau tidak boleh berkata seperti itu orang indonesia ini sudah menyelesaikan licence nya di al azhar sekarang dia sedang menempuh program magisternya walau bagaimana pun dia seorang azhari kau tidak boleh mengecilkan dia dia hafal dia murid syaikh utsman abdul fattah yang terkenal itu
2798014 tidak aku tidak teman kuliahnya aku tahu saat berkenalan dengannya tadi
2798015 kau terlalu mudah percaya bisa saja dia berbohong program magister di al azhar tidak mudah jadi murid syaikh utsman juga tidak mudah
2798016 hei orang indonesia kalau benar kau s 2 di al azhar mana kartumu
2798017 kebetulan saat ini saya sedang menuju masjid abu bakar ash shiddiq untuk talaqqi kalau ada yang mau ikut menjumpai syaikh utsman boleh menyertai saya
2798018 maafkan kelancangan kami orang indonesia tapi perempuan bercadar ini tidak pantas dibela ia telah melakukan tindakan bodoh
2798019 terus terang aku sangat kecewa pada kalian ternyata sifat kalian tidak seperti yang digambarkan baginda nabi beliau pernah bersabda bahwa orang orang mesir sangat halus dan ramah maka beliau memerintahkan kepada shahabatnya jika kelak membuka bumi mesir hendaknya bersikap halus dan ramah tapi ternyata kalian sangat kasar aku yakin kalian bukan asli orang mesir mungkin kalian sejatinya sebangsa bani israel orang mesir asli itu seperti syaikh muhammad mutawalli syarawi yang ramah dan pemurah
2798020 maafkan kami orang indonesia kami memang emosi tadi tapi jangan kau katakan kami bukan orang mesir jangan pula kau katakan kami ini sebangsa bani israel kami asli mesir kami satu moyang dengan syaikh syarawi
2798021 lelaki setengah baya itu tidak terima syaikh syarawi memang seorang ulama yang sangat merakyat sangat dicintai orang mesir hampir semua orang mesir mengenal dan mencintai beliau mereka sangat bangga memiliki seorang syarawi yang dihormati di seantero penjuru arab
2798022 yang aku tahu selama ini orang mesir asli sangat memuliakan tamu
2798023 tapi amerika sudah keterlaluan apa salah jika kami sedikit saja mengungkapkan kejengkelan kami dengan memberi pelajaran sedikit saja pada orang orang amerika itu
2798024 kita semua tidak menyukai tindak kezhaliman yang dilakukan siapa saja termasuk yang dilakukan amerika tapi tindakan kalian seperti itu tidak benar dan jauh dari tuntunan ajaran baginda nabi yang indah
2798025 lalu kami harus berbuat apa dan bagaimana ini mumpung ada orang amerika mumpung ada kesempatan dengan sedikit pelajaran mereka akan tahu bahwa kami tidak menyukai kezhaliman mereka biar nanti kalau pulang ke negaranya mereka bercerita pada tetangganya bagaimana tidak sukanya kami pada mereka
2798026 justru tindakan kalian yang tidak dewasa seperti anak anak ini akan menguatkan opini media massa amerika yang selama ini beranggapan orang islam kasar dan tidak punya perikemanusiaan padahal baginda rasul mengajarkan kita menghormati tamu apakah kalian lupa beliau bersabda siapa yang beriman kepada allah dan hari akhir maka hormatilah tamunya mereka bertiga adalah tamu di bumi kinanah ini harus dihormati sebaik baiknya itu jika kalian merasa beriman kepada allah dan hari akhir jika tidak ya terserah lakukanlah apa yang ingin kalian lakukan tapi jangan sekali kali kalian menamakan diri kalian bagian dari umat islam sebab tindakan kalian yang tidak menghormati tamu itu jauh dari ajaran islam
2798027 coba kalian jawab pertanyaanku ini kenapa kalian berani menyakiti rasulullah
2798028 akhi mana mungkin kami berani menyakiti rasulullah yang kami cintai
2798029 kenapa kalian kelak di hari akhir berani berseteru di hadapan allah melawan rasulullah
2798030 akhi kau melontarkan pertanyaan gila kita semua di hari akhir kelak mengharap syafaat rasulullah bagaimana mungkin kami berani berseteru dengan beliau di hadapan allah
2798031 tapi kalian telah melakukan tindakan sangat lancang kalian telah menyakiti rasulullah kalian telah menantang rasulullah untuk berseteru di hadapan allah kelak di hari akhir
2798032 paman aku tidak berkata sembarangan aku akan sangat malu pada diriku sendiri jika berkata dan bertindak sembarangan baiklah biar aku jelaskan dan setelah aku jelaskan kalian boleh menilai apakah aku berkata sembarangan atau bukan harus kalian mengerti bahwa ketiga orang bule ini selain tamu kalian mereka sama dengan ahlu dzimmah tentu kalian tahu apa itu ahlu dzimmah disebut ahlu dzimmah karena mereka berada dalam jaminan allah dalam jaminan rasul nya dan dalam jaminan jamaah kaum muslimin ahlu dzimmah adalah semua orang non muslim yang berada di dalam negara tempat kaum muslimin secara baik baik tidak ilegal dengan membayar jizyah dan mentaati peraturan yang ada dalam negara itu hak mereka sama dengan hak kaum muslimin darah dan kehormatan mereka sama dengan darah dan kehormatan kaum muslimin mereka harus dijaga dan dilindungi tidak boleh disakiti sedikit pun dan kalian pasti tahu tiga turis amerika ini masuk ke mesir secara resmi mereka membayar visa kalau tidak percaya coba saja lihat paspornya maka mereka hukumnya sama dengan ahlu dzimmah darah dan kehormatan mereka harus kita lindungi itu yang diajarkan rasulullah saw tidakkah kalian dengar sabda beliau barangsiapa menyakiti orang zhimmi ahlu zhimmah maka aku akan menjadi seterunya dan siapa yang aku menjadi seterunya dia pasti kalah di hari kiamat beliau juga memperingatkan barangsiapa yang menyakiti orang dzimmi dia telah menyakiti diriku dan barangsiapa menyakiti diriku berarti dia menyakiti allah begitulah islam mengajarkan bagaimana memperlakukan non muslim dan para tamu asing yang masuk secara resmi dan baik baik di negara kaum muslimin imam ali bahkan berkata begitu membayar jizyah harta mereka menjadi sama harus dijaganya dengan harta kita darah mereka sama nilainya dengan darah kita dan para turis itu telah membayar visa dan ongkos administrasi lainnya sama dengan membayar jizyah mereka menjadi tamu resmi tidak ilegal maka harta kehormatan dan darah mereka wajib kita jaga bersama sama jika tidak jika kita sampai menyakiti mereka maka berarti kita telah menyakiti baginda nabi kita juga telah menyakiti allah kalau kita telah lancang berani menyakiti allah dan rasul nya maka siapakah diri kita ini masih pantaskan kita mengaku mengikuti ajaran baginda nabi
2798033 jawabku sambil menangkupkan kedua tanganku di depan dada aku tidak mungkin menjabat tangannya
2798034 ini bukan berarti saya tidak menghormati anda dalam ajaran islam seorang lelaki tidak boleh bersalaman dan bersentuhan dengan perempuan selain isteri dan mahramnya
2798035 oh never mind and this is my name card for you

2798051 sekali kali kita jadi orang mesir beneran satu ayam untuk dua orang
2798052 kalau ini bukan makan nasi lauk ayam ini makan ayam lauk nasi nasinya dikit sekali mbok ditambah dikit
2798053 tujuannya memang kita makan ayam bakar nasi pelengkap saja untuk melestarikan budaya indonesia bagi yang mau tambah nasi ambil saja sendiri benar nggak mas
2798054 sekarang bukan saatnya diskusi kalau mau diskusi besok sabtu di wisma nusantara rudi presentatornya bismillah ayo jangan banyak cingcong langsung kita ganyang saja
2798055 kami berempat belas dibagi dalam dua kelompok kami mencoba jalur baru kelompok kami istirahat terlalu lama kami mengejar kelompok pertama sayang kurang kompak kami bertiga tertinggal dan terlunta selama dua hari dalam hutan gunung lawu hanya pertolongan dari allah yang membuat kami tetap hidup
2798056 jika kau tidak mau mendengar kata kata kami jangan sekali kali kau injak rumah kami kami bukan keluargamu
2798057 maria apa kau bangun kau dengar suara tangis di bawah sana
2798058 si hitam bahadur bisa melakukan apa saja ayahku tidak mau berurusan dengannya
2798059 tidakkah kau bisa turun dan menyeka air matanya kasihan noura dia perlu seseorang yang menguatkan hatinya
2798060 kumohon turunlah dan usaplah air matanya aku paling tidak tahan jika ada perempuan menangis aku tidak tahan kumohon andaikan aku halal baginya tentu aku akan turun mengusap air matanya dan membawanya ke tempat yang jauh dari linangan air mata selama lamanya
2798061 untuk yang ini jangan paksa aku fahri aku tidak bisa
2798062 baiklah demi cintaku pada al masih akan kucoba tapi kau harus tetap mengawasi dari jendelamu jika ada apa apa kau harus berbuat sesuatu
2798063 begini fahri aku sudah berusaha keras tapi noura tidak mau menceritakan segalanya dia hanya bilang telah diusir oleh ayah dan kakaknya karena tidak bisa melakukan hal yang ia tidak bisa melakukannya
2798064 ia tidak mau mengaku hanya itu yang bisa kudapat kami sekeluarga hanya bisa membantu sampai di sini
2798065 terus terang sebelum si bahadur bangun noura harus sudah meninggalkan rumah kami
2798066 bukannya kami tidak peduli kau tentu tahu sifat si bahadur itu di samping itu noura memang ingin pergi untuk sementara ia kelihatan ketakutan dan cemas sekali ia tidak mau ayahnya tahu kalau ia ada di rumah kami
2798067 untuk itulah kami berdua kemari mau tidak mau pagi ini noura memang harus pergi untuk kebaikan dirinya dan untuk kebaikan seluruh penghuni apartemen ini jika sampai ia masih ada di sini ayahnya akan kembali membuat keributan noura akan jadi bulan bulanan masalahnya semua orang sudah bosan yang jadi pikiran kami adalah noura harus pergi ke mana kami tidak tega dia pergi tanpa tujuan dan tanpa rasa aman
2798068 anda benar tuan boutros dia harus pergi ke suatu tempat yang aman dan tinggal di sana beberapa waktu sampai keadaan membaik hmm apakah dia tidak punya sanak saudara paman bibi atau nenek misalnya
2798069 di cairo ini dia tidak memiliki siapa siapa selain keluarga yang telah mengusirnya dia masih punya paman dan bibi tapi sangat jauh di mesir selatan dekat aswan sana tepatnya di daerah naq el mamariya yang terletak beberapa puluh kilo di sebelah selatan luxor bahadur dan isterinya yaitu madame syaima berasal dari sana tapi noura tidak bisa ke sana katanya seingatnya ia baru dua kali ke sana dan tidak tahu jalannya ia tidak bisa sendirian ke sana
2798070 kami sudah memberikan saran itu padanya tapi noura tidak mau ia ingin pergi ke tempat yang tidak akan ditemukan ayah dan kedua kakaknya sementara waktu seluruh rumah temannya telah diketahui ayahnya dia pernah diseret ayahnya saat tidur di rumah salah seorang temannya di thakanat maadi itu akan membuatnya malu pada setiap orang begitu katanya
2798071 bagaimana dengan saudara atau kenalan kalian pasti kalian punya saudara dan kenalan yang tidak akan terlacak oleh ayahnya noura dan itu bisa membantu noura
2798072 fahri mohon kau mengertilah posisi kami sungguh kami ingin menolong noura tapi menempatkan noura di rumah kami atau rumah saudara dan kenalan kami itu tidak mungkin kami lakukan karena ini akan menambah masalah
2798073 fahri sebetulnya bisa saja kami membawa noura ke tempat saudara kami tapi kalau nanti sampai ketahuan bahadur masalahnya akan runyam bahkan kalau ada orang tidak bertanggung jawab yang suka memancing ikan di air keruh masalahnya bisa berkembang tidak hanya antara kami dan bahadur bisa lebih gawat dari itu kau kan tahu kami sekeluarga ini penganut kristen koptik bahadur sekeluarga adalah muslim seluruh sanak saudara dan kolega kami yang paling dekat adalah orang orang koptik jika noura bersembunyi di rumah kami atau rumah saudara kami bisa mendatangkan masalah meskipun kami tidak melakukan apa apa kecuali menyediakan tempat dia berlindung kami nanti bisa dianggap merekayasa meng kristen kan noura kami harus menjaga perasaan noura sendiri dan perasaan semuanya kau tentu tahu noura siswi mahad al azhar dia tentu akan merasa asing di rumah orang yang bukan satu keyakinan dengannya dia akan merasa canggung untuk shalat membaca dan lain sebagainya di rumah kami saja yang tetangganya yang kenal baik dengannya dia merasa canggung untuk shalat dia merasa tidak enak tadi kami yang mempersilakan dia untuk shalat kami tidak ingin ini terjadi pada noura apa pun alasannya yang paling bijak adalah menempatkan noura di tempat orang yang satu keyakinan dengannya yang bisa mengerti keadaannya terus terang untuk ini kami minta bantuanmu meskipun kamu bukan orang mesir tapi kamu tentu punya kenalan orang mesir yang muslim menurut kami semua orang muslim itu baik kecuali si bahadur itu
2798074 bagaimana kalau sementara waktu noura tinggal di salah satu rumah mahasiswi indonesia di nasr city
2798075 saya kira ini usul yang bagus mungkin mahasiswi indonesia itu bisa mendekatinya dan noura bisa menceritakan semua derita yang dialaminya setelah itu bisa dicarikan pemecahan bersama yang lebih baik sebab dia kelihatannya sudah benar benar dimusuhi keluarganya noura berkata bahkan ibunya sendiri yang dulu sering membelanya kini berbalik ikut memusuhinya kita tidak tahu apa yang terjadi pada noura sebenarnya
2798076 baiklah aku akan menghubungi seorang mahasiswi indonesia di nasr city
2798077 begini saja kak fahri si noura suruh turun di depan masjid rabah aku dan farah akan menjemputnya tepat pukul setengah sembilan
2798078 biar cepat kau naik metro sampai ramsis setelah itu naik eltramco jurusan hayyul asyir atau hayyu sabe yang lewat masjid rabah turun di masjid rabah dan cari dua mahasiswi indonesia kau tentu tahu kan muka orang indonesia nurul memakai kaca mata jilbabnya panjang farah tidak pakai kaca mata dia suka jilbab kecil ditunggu setengah sembilan tepat ini nomor telpon rumahnya
2798079 terimalah untuk ongkos perjalanan dan untuk menelpon kalau ada apa apa
2798080 jangan ragu aku tidak bermaksud apa apa kita ini satu atap dalam payung al azhar sudah selayaknya saling menolong
2798081 noura terimalah fahri ini orang yang baik dia hafal apa kamu tidak percaya dengan orang yang hafal
2798082 baik dia sekarang sedang tidur di kamarku benar katamu kak dia memang patut di kasihani punggungnya penuh luka cambuk
2798083 belum masih dalam taraf mencoba saling kenal tapi dia tidak tahan merasakan sakit di punggungnya akhirnya dia sedikit bercerita kalau ayahnya suka mencambuknya dengan ikat pinggang ayah yang kejam
2798084 jangan suudhan pada saya dan teman teman kak keberadaan noura di sini tidak ada masalah kok kenapa sih kakak terlalu berprasangka begitu
2798085 nggak nggak apa apa sure nggak apa apa jangan kuatir
2798086 pertanyaanmu memang aneh jawabnya ya dia berambut pirang kenapa kau tanyakan itu
2798087 ingin tahu saja tapi jika dia berambut pirang memang aneh
2798088 bukan itu maksudku bukankah ayah dan ibunya seperti orang sudan hitam dan berambut negro
2798089 nein danke heute bada shalat el ashr habe ich leider keine zeit ich habe schon eine verabredung
2798090 insya allah dia akan datang sepuluh menit lagi dia sedang dalam perjalanan dari wawancara dengan ibrahem nafe pemimpin redaksi harian ahram
2798091 semoga lima belas menit cukup bagi alicia untuk mendapatkan jawaban atas ketidaktahuannya akan islam
2798092 sebetulnya saya senang diajak berbincang untuk menjelaskan keindahan islam tapi kali ini saya ada jadwal khutbah maafkan saya
2798093 kalau waktunya tidak cukup anggaplah ini pertemuan pengantar saja semoga anda tidak keberatan seandainya alicia minta waktu lagi entah kapan
2798094 aku kenal seorang mahasiswa turki dia cukup akrab denganku dia pernah bilang tinggal di dekat kentucky maadi mungkin pamanmu kenal
2798095 sampaikan salamku untuknya katakan saja dari fahri abdullah shiddiq teman itikaf di masjid helmeya zaitun tahun lalu juga sampaikan salamku pada bibimu dan kedua puteranya yang lucu amena dan hasan
2798096 begini fahri di barat ada sebuah opini bahwa islam menyuruh seorang suami memukul isterinya katanya suruhan itu terdapat dalam ini jelas tindakan yang jauh dari beradab sangat menghina martabat kaum wanita apakah kau bisa menjelaskan masalah ini yang sesungguhnya benarkah opini itu atau bagaimana
2798097 tidak benar ajaran islam menyuruh melakukan tindakan tidak beradab itu rasulullah saw dalam sebuah haditsnya bersabda
2798098 sebab itu maka wanita yang saleh ialah yang taat kepada allah lagi memelihara diri ketika suaminya tidak ada oleh karena allah telah memelihara mereka wanita wanita yang kamu kuatirkan nusyuznya maka nasihatilah mereka dan pisahkanlah mereka dari tempat tidur dan pukullah mereka kemudian jika mereka mentaatimu maka janganlah kamu mencari cari jalan untuk menyusahkannya sesungguhnya allah mahatinggi lagi mahabesar
2798099 nusyuz adalah tindakan atau perilaku seorang isteri yang tidak bersahabat pada suaminya dalam islam suami isteri ibarat dua ruh dalam satu jasad jasadnya adalah rumah tangga keduanya harus saling menjaga saling menghormati saling mencintai saling menyayangi saling mengisi saling memuliakan dan saling menjaga isteri yang nusyuz adalah isteri yang tidak lagi menghormati mencintai menjaga dan memuliakan suaminya isteri yang tidak lagi komitmen pada ikatan suci pernikahan jika seorang suami melihat ada gejala isterinya hendak nusyuz hendak menodai ikatan suci pernikahan maka memberikan tuntunan bagaimana seorang suami harus bersikap untuk mengembalikan isterinya ke jalan yang benar demi menyelamatkan keutuhan rumah tangganya tuntunan itu ada dalam surat an nisaa ayat 34 tadi di situ memberikan tuntunan melalui tiga tahapan pertama menasihati isteri dengan baik baik dengan kata kata yang bijaksana kata kata yang menyentuh hatinya sehingga dia bisa segera kembali ke jalan yang lurus sama sekali tidak diperkenankan mencela isteri dengan kata kata kasar baginda rasulullah melarang hal itu kata kata kasar lebih menyakitkan daripada tusukan pedang jika dengan nasihat tidak juga mempan memberikan jalan kedua yaitu pisah tempat tidur dengan isteri dengan harapan isteri yang mulai nusyuz itu bisa merasa dan interospeksi seorang isteri yang benar benar mencintai suaminya dia akan sangat terasa dan mendapatkan teguran jika sang suami tidak mau tidur dengannya dengan teguran ini diharapkan isteri kembali salehah dan rumah tangga tetap utuh harmonis namun jika ternyata sang isteri memang bebal nuraninya telah tertutupi oleh hawa nafsunya ia tidak mau juga berubah setelah diingatkan dengan dua cara tersebut barulah menggunakan cara yang sering tidak dipahami oleh orang banyak adalah cara memukul yang dikehendaki ini tidak boleh sembarangan suami boleh memukul dengan syarat pertama telah menggunakan dua cara sebelumnya namun tidak mempan tidak diperbolehkan langsung main pukul isteri salah sedikit main pukul ini jauh dari islam jauh dari tuntunan dan islam tidak bertanggung jawab atas tindakan kelaliman seperti itu kedua tidak boleh memukul muka sebab muka seseorang adalah segalanya bagi manusia rasulullah melarang memukul muka ketiga tidak boleh menyakitkan rasulullah saw bersabda bertakwalah kepada allah dalam masalah perempuan isteri mereka adalah orang orang yang membantu kalian kalian punya hak pada mereka yaitu mereka tidak boleh menyentuhkan pada tempat tidur kalian lelaki yang kalian benci jika mereka melakukan hal itu maka kalian boleh memukul mereka dengan pukulan yang tidak menyakitkan ghairu mubrah dan kalian punya kewajiban pada mereka yaitu memberi rizki dan memberi pakaian yang baik para ulama ahli fiqih dan ulama tafsir menjelaskan kriteria ghairu mubrah atau tidak menyakitkan yaitu tidak sampai meninggalkan bekas tidak sampai membuat tulang retak dan tidak di bagian tubuh yang berbahaya jika kena pukulan dengan menghayati benar benar kandungan ayat suci itu dan makna hadits hadits rasulullah itu akan jelas sekali seperti apa sebenarnya ajaran islam apakah seperti yang dituduhkan dan diopinikan di barat yang menghinakan wanita apakah tuntunan mulia seperti itu yang bertujuan menyelamatkan bahtera rumah tangga karena ada gejala isteri hendak nusyuz tidak lagi bersahabat pada suaminya hendak menodai ikatan suci pernikahan dianggap tiada beradab kapan seorang suami diperbolehkan memukul pada isteri macam apa syaratnya memukulnya apa saja tujuannya apa itu semua haruslah diperhatikan dengan seksama memukul seorang isteri jahat tak tahu diri dengan pukulan yang tidak menyakitkan agar ia sadar kembali demi keutuhan rumah tangga apakah itu tidak jauh lebih mulia daripada membiarkan isteri berbuat seenak nafsunya dan menghancurkan rumah tangga ya inilah ajaran islam dalam mensikapi seorang isteri yang berperilaku tidak terpuji islam sangat memuliakan perempuan bahwa di telapak kaki ibulah surga anak lelaki hanya seorang lelaki mulia yang memuliakan wanita demikian islam mengajarkan
2798100 maaf aku harus pergi sekarang aku sudah terlambat lima menit dari rencana
2798101 dari jawaban yang kau berikan aku mendapatkan masukan yang sama sekali baru aku mengerti sebenarnya masih ada banyak hal yang ingin aku tanyakan kepadamu tentang islam memperlakukan perempuan tentang islam memperlakukan non islam tentang islam dan perbudakan dan lain sebagainya dan aku berharap akan mendapatkan jawaban yang baik dalam perspektif yang adil
2798102 saya senang berjumpa dengan orang seperti anda nona alicia sebisa mungkin saya akan memenuhi harapan anda itu
2798103 saya kira ini ide yang bagus saya akan tuliskan pertanyaan saya secepatnya dalam dunia jurnalistik wawancara tertulis lazim juga digunakan terus bagaimana kita bisa bertemu lagi meskipun cuma sebentar untuk menyerahkan pertanyaan pertanyaan saya itu
2798104 baik bagaimana kalau kita berjumpa besok senin tepat pukul sebelas pagi

2798114 tolong dekati dia sepertinya dia memendam masalah serius perlakuan keluarganya selama ini tidak wajar kata tuan boutros kita tidak akan bisa membantu kalau dia tidak jujur menjelaskan masalahnya kenapa malam malam sampai dicambuk dan diusir ayahnya dia cerita pada maria ayah dan dua kakak perempuan menyuruh dia melakukan suatu pekerjaan yang dia tidak bisa melakukannya pekerjaan apa itu dan kenapa dia tidak bisa melakukannya apa masalah dia sesungguhnya kalau ayahnya menuntut dia harus kerja untuk dapat uang madame nahed ibunya maria menawarkan dia bisa kerja di kliniknya sore hari tolong nur kau dekati dia dan bicaralah dari hati ke hati aku paling tidak tahan kalau melihat ada orang tertindas dan menderita di depan mataku

2798175 di mesir ini banyak sekali orang mengakui muslim tapi akhlaknya tidak muslim mengaku islam tapi sangat jauh dari cahaya islam bagaimana mungkin seorang ayah yang mengaku umat muhammad bisa begitu kejam pada anaknya pada seorang gadis yang semestinya dia lindungi dan dia sayangi fahri menghantarkan kesejukan ruh islam ke dalam hati semua pemeluknya memang tidak semudah membalik kedua telapak tangan tapi kita tidak boleh berpangku tangan apalagi berputus asa sebisa kita kita harus terus berusaha
2798176 tidak hanya di mesir saja syaikh di indonesia juga ada bahkan di indonesia lebih parah ada lelaki yang meniduri anak gadisnya dengan paksa lebih parah lagi ada yang tega menjual isteri dan anak gadisnya pada lelaki hidung belang setan memang ada di mana mana dengan segala tipu dayanya setan selalu berusaha membutakan hati manusia sehingga mereka beranggapan tindakan yang keji menjadi terpuji
2798177 noura kau juga harus mengucapkan terima kasih tiada terhingga pada
2798178 tuan boutros sekeluarga mas bagaimana apa mereka boleh masuk kemari
2798179 agaknya kau terlalu memforsir dirimu banyak banyaklah istirahat ada gejala heat stroke kau harus minum yang banyak dan makan buah buahan yang segar istirahatlah dulu jangan bepergian menantang matahari

2798188 maaf setiap orang berbeda dalam memandang hidup ini dan berbeda caranya dalam menempuh hidup ini peta masa depan itu saya buat terus terang saja berangkat dari semangat spiritual ayat suci yang saya yakini dalam surat ar raad ayat sebelas allah berfirman sesungguhnya allah tidak akan merubah nasib suatu kaum kecuali kaum itu sendiri yang mengubah nasibnya jadi nasib saya masa depan saya mau jadi apa saya sayalah yang menentukan sukses dan gagalnya saya sayalah yang menciptakan saya sendirilah yang mengaristeki apa yang akan saya raih dalam hidup ini
2798189 takdir tuhan ada di ujung usaha manusia tuhan mahaadil dia akan memberikan sesuatu kepada umat nya sesuai dengan kadar usaha dan ikhtiarnya dan agar saya tidak tersesat atau melangkah tidak tentu arah dalam berikhtiar dan berusaha maka saya membuat peta masa depan saya saya suka dengan kata kata bertenaga thomas carlyle seseorang dengan tujuan yang jelas akan membuat kemajuan walaupun melewati jalan yang sulit seseorang yang tanpa tujuan tidak akan membuat kemajuan walaupun ia berada di jalan yang mulus peta hidup ini saya buat untuk mempertegas arah tujuan hidupku sepuluh tahun ke depan ini bagian dari usaha dan ikhtiar dan setelah itu semuanya saya serahkan sepenuhnya kepada tuhan
2798190 apa kubilang fahri seorang visioner yang tegas tidak seperti dirimu maria hidup manja tanpa visi kau ini sudah berada di jalan yang mulus dikaruniai otak yang cerdas hidup berkecukupan disayang keluarga tapi kau tidak akan membuat kemajuan tanpa visi yang jelas

2798214 ummu darda menjenguk seorang lelaki ahli masjid dari kalangan anshar
2798215 apakah benar riwayat yang mengatakan anda tidak mengakui mushaf utsmani
2798216 yang tidak mengakui mushaf utsmani dan tidak suka dengannya adalah orang orang munafik dan orang orang yang memusuhi agama allah mereka mencatut namaku untuk membela tujuan tujuan mereka yang jahat apa yang ada di dalam mushaf utsmani dari al fatihah sampai an naas adalah wahyu yang diturunkan allah melalui malaikat jibril kepada baginda nabi tertulis utuh dan sempurna tidak berkurang dan tidak bertambah meskipun cuma satu huruf dan apa yang ada dalam mushaf utsmani itulah yang aku ajarkan pada para tabiin dan mereka mengajarkan pada murid muridnya begitu seterusnya hingga sampai kepadamu dan kepada jutaan umat muhammad di seluruh penjuru dunia terjaga keasliannya memang akan selalu ada orang orang jahat yang berusaha meragukan kebenaran dan merusak kesucian namun ketahuilah usaha mereka akan sia sia sebab allah sendiri yang akan menjaga keutuhan dan kesuciannya sampai hari akhir dan orang orang pilihan allah di dunia ini adalah mereka yang disebut ahlul quran orang orang yang hatinya selalu terpatri pada mengimani dan berusaha mengajarkan dan mengamalkan isi dengan penuh keikhlasan

2798221 bagaimana syaikh bisa yakin aku benar benar di datangi abdullah bin masud
2798222 seperti keyakinan rasulullah ketika bermimpi akan berhaji dan membuka kota makkah
2798223 anakku apa yang kau dapat dari abdullah bin masud yang mendatangimu ceritakanlah pelan pelan aku ingin tahu syaikh utsman kembali mengulangi pertanyaannya aku lalu menceritakan semuanya syaikh utsman menitikkan air mata dan berkata

2798243 in 2007 my husband myself and our young daughter traveled together to welcome a beautiful baby boy into our family
2798244 please be assured that she will continue to assist you as well as the thousands of other constituents who contact her with their concerns including active military and disabled veterans elderly social security recipients juvenile special immigrants who have been abused and myriad others who have an urgent need for assistance
2798245 they said shes going to give us a baby but we cant buy her a bag of groceries
2798246 it is a birth mom and a baby drain and it means ohio couples are losing babies
2798247 probably 25 or 30 percent of our birth moms are adopting out of state this bill will help keep ohio babies here for ohio couples
2798248 but i would never have an abortion that was never an option for me
2798249 the philosophy for allowing these kinds of expenses is that the birth mother should not suffer but neither should she profit
2798250 i think this does create some equity among the states that was missing before
2798251 with an ohio adoption i would not have gotten any help
2798252 a lady offered up a couch and were in a situation where we needed it

2798324 we are also issuing it a warning not to hold such a public forum again
2798325 conversion to islam article 121 1a of the federal constitution subashini and shamala revisited

2798328 we respect everybodys views in this building and that is what the bar council is about
2798329 even if we do have one we would prefer to hold it behind closed doors
2798330 we didnt want the anger to lead to any untoward incident
2798331 there are certain things that are out of bounds for public discussion even if held in a private place
2798332 there are many ancillary issues arising out of the provisions of article 121 1a and these must be resolved fast i believe the forum if it was allowed to go to its full length could have found solutions to some of the issues
2798333 how funny would it be if you shaved it off and i walked out there

2798350 not to a positively disgusting one but i am disposed to think that the greatest number of happy people may be found busy in employments that they have not chosen for themselves and never would have chosen
2798351 i am afraid these very happy people are haunted by longings to be doing something else

2798355 das publikum ist schon anders die menschen hier klatschen nur wenn etwas passiert daran muss man sich erst gew hnen
2798356 es hie die hallen seien ausverkauft und die chinesen geben sich auch viel m he aber es ist schade f r olympische spiele wenn so viele pl tze hier leer bleiben
2798357 wir kennen das ja schon von vorrunden bei welt und europameisterschaften
2798358 es ist tradition dass sich sponsoren und vips viele karten verschaffen und dann an den vorrunden nicht so interessiert sind
2798359 ich pers nlich habe beim judo und beachvolleyball festgestellt dass die trib nen f r vorrunden wettk mpfe gut gef llt waren
2798360 ich bin aber sicher dass sich demn chst die lage bessern wird
2798361 wenn die welt daraus eine lektion lernen soll dann die dass wir im 21 jahrhundert leben und es nie mehr krieg geben sollte
2798362 die sollen sich endlich an einen tisch setzen und die situation kl ren wenn sie das nicht tun dann mischen wir uns ein wir brauchen frieden
2798363 zur gleichen zeit in der die spiele in peking mit einem feuerwerk er ffnet wurden musste georgien mit bombenangriffen auf viele seiner st dte leben
2798364 es brauchte einige berwindung f r ihn um sich vor den augen hitlers mit mir anzufreunden man k nnte alle medaillen und pokale die ich habe einschmelzen aber sie k nnten die 24 karat freundschaft die ich in diesem moment f r luz long empfand kein bisschen goldener machen
2798365 hitler muss durchgedreht sein als er uns umarmen sah das traurige an der geschichte ist dass ich long nie mehr gesehen habe er wurde w hrend des zweiten weltkriegs get tet

2798373 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2798374 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2798375 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2798378 a trio of gentlemen humourists who perform victorian sketch comedy across the uk
2798379 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2798380 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2798381 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2798382 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2798383 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2798429 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2798430 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2798431 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2798432 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2798433 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2798434 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2798435 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2798436 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2798455 i was back home where i grew up you know but it was different like it was how i wanted to remember it sort of
2798456 it sounds daft i know but this is the weirdest part id been there before in a dream i mean i was sure of it and there was this bloke there who told me i had
2798457 yeah he was the only other person there about my height thin short hair shaved you know couldnt have been much older than me or he didnt look it anyway he was wearing a white t shirt and a black jacket
2798458 i dont know i woke up before i got to find out
2798459 oh sorry ill wait a little bit longer before i wake you up should i
2798460 nat left some proofs with me a while ago i brought them around to see what you wanted to do with them hold on i left them in the hall
2798461 they were covers she was doing for a romance novel
2798462 a real bodice ripper you know it was pretty racy actually lots of heaving bosoms and illicit relations under the stairs
2798463 we can get down to business this time want a coffee or something
2798464 do you want to get a coffee or a cup of tea
2798465 hmm no you wouldnt would you right im assuming you know where this place is now yes
2798466 the dreams when i was younger this has something to do with that right
2798467 theres someone i have to see outside there back in a minute
2798468 im really sorry this wasnt supposed to happen i tried to get hold of curtis to tell him i tried to stop him youre not ready for this not now
2798469 hes not ready yet something happened its too soon i tried to get you tell you to leave this alone for now
2798470 but somethings happened this isnt the right time for him
2798471 is somewhere in new york i think curtis lives there now he comes to this place regularly i kind of like it ill have to try and find it if i get to new york sometime
2798472 jesus the biggie eh um you know this place dont you you remember it
2798473 yeah from when i was about thirteen it was in a dream
2798474 i dont know where to start theres a lot you youre like me and curtis you have a thing its a a power of some sort a gift but its not fully realised in you yet
2798475 an and curtis we both have it you can control dreams not just your own but any dream this whole thing with curtis making contact with you it was all designed to bring you out i realised when you told me about the first meeting with him i recognised curtis when you told me what he looked like he did the same for me a couple of years back they mustve thought it was the right time and sent him they couldntve known about natalie
2798476 can do the same thing this seems to be some kind of meeting place for some of them they come here and talk about stuff easier than e mail more personal too
2798477 i never told her i couldnt i wanted to though christ knows i wanted to but i couldnt one of the rules
2798478 explain everything then show you how to use it i suppose i dont know curtis was supposed to take you through it all hes the expert here not me
2798479 i come over and see you tomorrow and well talk this out
2798480 you can try and hold out for as long as you can but at the end of the day its not worth it
2798481 most of them arent i doubt theyll be yours either curtis is about the only one i can stomach hes a good bloke most of the people ive met so far have been pretentious wankers after i got shown the ropes i kept away from them thats a choice you can make theyll let you alone after you become fully aware
2798482 you cant just conjure her up and stay here with her i i wont let you do it
2798483 i have something im interested in and then i decide im going to explore it i dont know where the characters are going to go or what the screenplays going to do for me thats the way to keep it alive and make it interesting and worthwhile
2798484 realistic and naturalistic are not the same thing and i think its interesting to play with surrealism or dream logic and try to create a poem a metaphor something that sort of conveys a feeling or makes something happen in your gut that you dont necessarily intellectually understand
2798485 i have a collection of antique postcards from around 1900 to 1930 i dont know how many there are maybe 300 or more i look at them all the time i think about time about near empty streets in central london children in suits and gloves horse drawn transport soot stained cities and ancient sites without interpretation centres or gift shops
2798486 hollywood has finally figured out how to make web video pay
2798487 when the story begins youre in world you have a gun all hell is breaking loose and your job as a player is to stay alive and figure out where you are
2798488 shes already in the second act the part where everything goes wrong
2798489 the content business is in crisis if you want to look at the way it will go take a look at the music industry and newspapers these sectors have really been on the front lines of a perfect storm the problem is that content has become simply an adjunct of advertising
2798490 when you take away the gatekeepers everything becomes crap writers dont get rich and famous on their own
2798491 ninety nine percent of all screenwriting contests have little connection with the industry and a win means absolutely nothing in the professional arena contests love to suggest that a win will help open doors but its highly unlikely since most contests are unknown to hollywood and the proliferation of them is almost satirical the nicholl fellowships are one of the few exceptions contests that award big cash prizes are worthwhile because a win boosts the bank account even if it doesnt open hollywoods doors
2798492 nine times out of ten the author is blamed for poor sales as an editor i can assure you that i have too many books to edit and there are too many books to promote why is it a safe bet to blame the author because we all want to keep our jobs thats why the bottom line is this when sales are good we all pat ourselves on the back and take credit but when sales are bad we find fault with the author when in fact many times the poor results are our own fault
2798493 the iemma government has to meet its obligations to fund public schools or we are going to see unacceptable levels of corporate intrusion into our schools as seen in america
2798494 the department has set up an infrastructure working party including the school principal and members of the school community to develop a four year master plan for the school and to explore the communitys ideas
2798495 rielle hunter was a private individual who is not running for public office and she wanted to maintain her privacy
2798496 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2798497 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2798498 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2798499 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2798500 rielle hunter was a private individual who is not running for public office and she wanted to maintain her privacy
2798501 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2798502 alcohol and drugs are most often the cause behind it
2798503 i have been working in the city for 10 years so i have experienced and seen a lot there wouldnt be an officer who hasnt been abused or attacked
2798504 there just seems to be a lack of respect from this generation x
2798505 i dont think people who are perpetuating this will take any notice of a campaign they need to be shown they can go to jail if they assault or abuse an officer
2798506 the last thing they should have to deal with is abuse and threatening behaviour
2798507 from the veteran communitys point of view he is not the person we want in the job
2798508 he is representing veterans and our history and our contribution
2798509 during the vietnam war he left australia then actively campaigned against the war in the uk saying it was a sad day when the viet cong was defeated this is the guy weve got to deal with and thats not good enough
2798510 we would not consider him an appropriate person to be doing veterans affairs
2798511 his views on conscription at the time of the vietnam conflict are well known and were indeed shared by many other australians both at the time and across the spectrum of australian military and political history
2798512 they hoped to lock me in jail for two years because i like thousands of others had not registered for what was euphemistically called national service in vietnam
2798513 we did explore options for two of the 737s to be checked in malaysia however as a space became available at tullamarine a decision was taken to have the work done there
2798514 now is the time qantas should sit down with us to commit now to maintaining maintenance operations onshore
2798515 and to move off the path of cost cutting and any further possibilities of further job reductions in their maintenance and engineering area
2798516 he weighed about 300 grams i mean what a hero to do something like that to a baby koala
2798517 a couple of weeks ago they cross pinned cane toads to the trees with big nails and the next time they pinned up a row of magpies they were still alive and they nailed them by their wings to the trees
2798518 zomg osx is sooooo much better than xp or vista u will get teh viruses lol
2798519 theres something like 900 per head additional in this budget for pensioners and for seniors but i accept that many of them are doing it reallytough
2798520 this review will address the adequacy of social welfare payments including the age pension so we get it right for older australians who have helped build this nation
2798521 first there is a squeamishness that leads people to be superficial and stereotypical about their villains because they dont want to go deeply into them yet they want them to be very bad so theyre picking out surface aspects which means itll never be convincing you do have to accept them as actual human beings and also as parts of yourself which is where the emotional honesty comes in
2798522 youre gonna think im such a loser he said miserably
2798523 oh my gosh i can see the egg whites this girl knows what shes talking about

2798534 i arrived at the theater at 7 33 to be greeted by chris day
2798535 i just wanted to go out and hold her a bit they wouldnt even let me go out
2798536 its just not right that people have to worry about police have their jobs to do but the house is marked over there all they had to do was go look
2798537 i want the sheriff to apologize to my family for killing their dog
2798538 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families and the u s government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2798539 no reason to believe the assailant targeted the victims as american citizens
2798540 beijing is a safe city the police will do its utmost to ensure a safe environment for chinese and foreign visitors here to view the competition
2798541 this summer is the first year we were not able to hold back on raising prices people dont realize how the cost of fuel has affected all farmers
2798542 oil is at a tipping point it is an exaggeration to cry that a bubble has burst it is a break
2798543 the market is simple reflecting the fundamentals of supply and demand markets participants are considering the world slowdown the deterioration in expectations for the growth worldwide
2798544 some of this demand slowdown is definitely permanent the question is how much
2798545 even if americans return to their old driving habits it will likely be in smaller cars
2798546 i know nothing about any plan to block the shipments
2798547 in fact the fact that ships are being stopped and searched does not mean there is a blockade
2798548 since last night the import and export of oil through the georgian ports of kulevi and batumi have been halted
2798549 this is due to armed actions in the area of the georgia ossetia conflict
2798550 iraqs debt to kuwait is an old debt it has to be paid or iraq has to pay its interest these are the rights of the kuwaiti people
2798551 the economic situation in iraq is witnessing a big improvement this year and iraq will have a large surplus in the budget
2798552 no one in this world so far as i know and i have searched the records for years and employed agents to help me has ever lost money by underestimating the intelligence of the great masses of the plain people
2798553 can you imagine what the conversation was like when putin went back and talked to
2798554 i would like to have fewer hopes and vague generalities and more plans with details
2798555 since last night the import and export of oil through the georgian ports of kulevi and batumi have been halted
2798556 this is due to armed actions in the area of the georgia ossetia conflict
2798557 people who would kill their sisters or daughters for bringing shame on the family would do anything to avoid being labeled a debtor
2798558 of all races in an advanced stage of civilization the american is the least accessible to long views always and everywhere in a hurry to get rich he does not give a thought to remote consequences he sees only present advantages he does not remember he does not feel he lives in a materialist dream
2798559 the take home message here is its a big deal
2798560 its probably the biggest impact in the shortest time that i can think of
2798561 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2798562 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2798563 not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armour and increased attacks on tskhinvali
2798564 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on unprecedented scale
2798565 initially when he was hospitalized we expected him to come back home but as the weeks went on i kind of knew
2798566 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
2798567 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
2798568 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
2798569 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him
2798570 im sad that my daughter will never know or be able to feel how much he loved her
2798571 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
2798572 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
2798573 i think there is a great sense of urgency to try to get the firefighter to hospital as soon as possible
2798574 there was a very very large amount of fire when we arrived and the extent of the explosion if the blast was heard as far away as it was could have been much more serious
2798575 hopefully we wont find that there are a lot of people missing or injured but so far it looks like we got off very lucky
2798576 the person who we described as being unaccounted for i believe is someone who was an employee of the business where the explosion took place
2798577 so efforts continue to try to track down that person
2798578 i certainly dont think it will be days i think it will be hours
2798579 but that all depends on what we run into if we run into some more problems or problems that we dont see now then it could be longer
2798580 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2798581 my whole room lights up orange and i look out i live on the top floor so i had a perfect view and i just seen a huge ball of flame hundreds of metres in the sky big black pillars of smoke
2798582 we got freaked out my family woke up they thought it was a plane that went down
2798583 he was going to check on my parents but the explosions were getting louder and louder so the three of us just ran and ran and ran
2798584 everyone was just running down the street it was like something from a movie
2798585 we were concerned when this company moved at the end of the street
2798586 but we werent even advised that they were going to be there they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen im surprised that they let a company like that move in a residential area
2798587 arriving in rangoon after two decades away its sad to see how the country hasnt changed for the better for most people with the exception of few

2798715 i felt basically that i let the other two down that i should have pulled my weight more and i didnt
2798716 its really frustrating and disappointing when youre that close to a medal youre almost touching it four years is a long time to wait to try again
2798717 it was very difficult with the weather and poor light but i did too little too late

2798741 in principio tu ti sederai un po lontano da me cos nellerba io ti guarder con la coda dellocchio e tu non dirai nulla le parole sono una fonte di malintesi ma ogni giorno tu potrai sederti un po pi vicino
2798742 se tu vieni per esempio tutti i pomeriggi alle quattro dalle tre io comincer ad essere felice col passare dellora aumenter la mia felicit quando saranno le quattro incomincer ad agitarmi e ad inquietarmi scoprir il prezzo della felicit ma se tu vieni non si sa quando io non sapr mai a che ora prepararmi il cuore ci vogliono i riti

2798776 you get used to a new guy and it takes a little bit of time and usually you get the luxury of doing it in the spring where no ones really around or cheering for laps
2798777 i need to call my mom and have her tape espn
2798778 hopefully i got on there today with a penalty lap it was weird because its a penalty lap and youre running it because youve done something wrong and people are cheering it was a little different
2798779 you have to get used to a guys voice his placement of his hands how quickly hes getting out you try to make it look as effortless as possible
2798780 i think its kind of funny but yet serves its purpose i think things like that are important in the fact that everyone is involved in it
2798781 when you come out here and the fans are going crazy and having fun it just helps you get through the day
2798782 weve just got to make sure were handling everything around him so we have the chemistry we need to have before the season starts

2798792 would provide the kingdom with oil for the coming 700 years
2798793 youre going to have to come to the republican convention to find out whats going to happen there
2798794 well first of all if you know john mccain you know theres not going to be much politics in the white house anyway

2798796 an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of all forces to the status quo
2798797 russia must affirm that its aim is not to change the democratically elected government of georgia and that it accepts that territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia
2798798 to bring up publicly the idea of president mikheil saakashvili stepping down
2798799 sometimes there are democratic leaders who do things which create great problems for their country
2798800 sometimes those leaders need to contemplate how useful they have become to their people
2798801 this is completely unacceptable especially from the lips of a representative of a country whose actions we are aware of in serbia
2798802 to consider the implications of this aggression against the sovereign and democratic state of georgia
2798803 russias relations with the united states and others would be affected by its continued assault on georgia and its refusal to contribute to a peaceful conclusion of the crisis
2798804 if they want to pull out they are welcome to do that
2798805 russian forces are actually impeding the withdrawal of georgian forces from south ossetia
2798806 this is an unconscionable effort to continue the conflict and prevent the georgians from taking concrete steps to de escalate the situation

2798811 a hybrid of machine and organism a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction
2798812 a matter of fiction and lived experience that changes what counts as womens experience in the late twentieth century this is a struggle over life and death but the boundary between science fiction and social reality as an optical illusion
2798813 argument for the cyborg as a fiction mapping our social and bodily reality and as an imaginative resource
2798814 a cyborg world might be about lived social and bodily realities in which people are not afraid of their joint kinship with animals and machines not afraid of permanently partial identities and contradictory standpoints the political struggle is to see from both perspectives at once because each reveals both dominations and possibilities unimaginable from the other vantage point

2799059 even mackay admits that fast breeders and oceanic uranium together would power the entire human race at hoggish american levels for well over a thousand years or at current european consumption for several millenia he also says that known thorium reserves used with current tech would run the whole race at rich westerner levels for several decades theres also a thing called a thorium energy amplifier reactor which would be a lot more efficient if it works as its nobel prize winning designers predict known thorium reserves would run six billion people at american luxury for sixty thousand years

2799067 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2799068 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2799069 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2799070 i no direu que no s unificadora la idea que hi caben les estelades blaves i grogues les blaves de val ncia capital les liles oficials bale riques les verdes de castell les blaugrana delx amb els castells deivissa o menorca amb el sant jordi dalcoi la cosa s que les quatre barres de lestendard reial tornen a adornar el paisatge de la nostra grisa quotidianitat
2799071 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2799072 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2799073 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2799074 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2799075 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2799087 sie haben georgien einen furchtbaren denkzettel verpasst mehr brauchen sie nicht
2799088 uma alegria poder levar esta equipe ao quinto lugar e quem sabe logo mais de volta ao primeiro
2799089 nada melhor que uma vit ria depois de uma semana inteira de trabalho v nhamos fazendo bons jogos mas os resultados n o estavam vindo
2799090 o que importou foi ter entrado e ajudado o flamengo a vencer foi muito importante uma vit ria como essa suada para aumentar a moral
2799091 fired a total of 1 104 rain dispersal rockets from 21 sites in the city between 4 pm and 11 39 pm on friday which prevented a rain belt from moving toward the stadium
2799092 a gente nem lembra mais daquele jogo a imprensa quem vive recordando
2799093 ser um jogo duro pois costumamos enfrentar dificuldades com as bolas altas da r ssia vamos ter de nos concentrar na defesa e no bloqueio mas sem pensar em revanche da semifinal de atenas cada jogo um jogo
2799094 terei outra oportunidade de disputar uma final ol mpica e apagar o que aconteceu em atenas
2799095 estou mais madura e tamb m muito feliz com o resultado da nossa gin stica art stica
2799096 s de estarmos dentro da elite do esporte j uma fa anha merecemos chegar onde chegamos por tudo que trabalhamos muito bom ouvir dos treinadores e de pessoas ligadas ao esporte que as apresenta es dos atletas brasileiros s o dignas de medalhas
2799097 a austr lia a grande for a da nossa chave como vice ol mpica em sydney 2000 e atenas 2004 e mundial em 2006 os principais destaques delas s o a armadora kristi harrower a ala penny taylor e ala piv lauren jackson mas o conjunto da equipe muito bom para vencer uma sele o como a australiana preciso manter a regularidade durante toda a partida
2799098 a austr lia um time que admiro muito e tem grande estrelas do basquete mundial mas ainda assim formam um grupo humilde
2799099 a nossa equipe tamb m est se renovando precisamos jogar com solidariedade e defesa consistente
2799100 wir konzentrieren uns wieder auf das vertriebs und projektgesch ft
2799101 an einem solchen joint venture m ssten wir auch nicht zwingend die mehrheit halten

2799104 we are working with the amazing team at wildstorm so that both the artists work and the physical book itself will be reflective of the storys place and time
2799105 to end up in the hellish realm of mictlan you had to die either from old age or from a disease with a couple of exceptions
2799106 we need a commander in chief who will end the war in iraq but will win it the right way and thats by winning it
2799107 just because people wont vote for obama doesnt mean they are racist
2799108 in 2008 99 of blacks wont vote for a white president
2799109 democrats openly say they are going to you and republicans say they arent but then they do
2799110 african americans vote democratic anyway so what difference does it make how many vote for obama
2799111 would people you know not vote for a black person
2799112 obama is so great the only reason someone wouldnt vote for him is race
2799113 they asked the same whites if most of the people they knew would vote for a black candidate nineteen percent said that those they knew would not
2799114 how many of you know someone you think wont vote for a black person
2799115 er hadden zich zelfs 11 meisjes ingeschreven maar er zijn er twee niet komen opdagen
2799116 you put the ball on the ground you have to run and thats the way when we talked about it he wanted it and thats the way i wanted it
2799117 its more of a team unity thing nick and i ran it i told eric day 1 that unless i pass out i am going to try to do everything that everyone else does
2799118 im no different aside from being a little gray headed and a little bit older
2799119 you get used to a new guy and it takes a little bit of time and usually you get the luxury of doing it in the spring where no ones really around or cheering for laps
2799120 i need to call my mom and have her tape espn
2799121 hopefully i got on there today with a penalty lap it was weird because its a penalty lap and youre running it because youve done something wrong and people are cheering it was a little different
2799122 you have to get used to a guys voice his placement of his hands how quickly hes getting out you try to make it look as effortless as possible
2799123 i think its kind of funny but yet serves its purpose i think things like that are important in the fact that everyone is involved in it
2799124 when you come out here and the fans are going crazy and having fun it just helps you get through the day
2799125 weve just got to make sure were handling everything around him so we have the chemistry we need to have before the season starts
2799126 the ball comes out hard and fast and straight and long so thats always good
2799127 its been a whirlwind for him and theres a lot of new information going in were progressing quickly
2799128 until i can see the cadence and see the mechanics
2799129 brett had his two hard boiled eggs a little bit of orange juice
2799130 there was a garnish i think and some hashbrowns and i can take you through minute by minute after that
2799131 the eggs were mixed with the hashbrowns so i dont know which one actually hit his mouth first ill film it next time

2799138 russian officials said they werent targeting civilians but russias foreign minister sergey lavrov said that
2799139 its regrettable that russian civilians and troops were killed when georgia tried to assert their legitimate authority in south ossetia

2799184 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth the earth was void and without form and darkness was over the face of the deep and the spirit of god was hovering over the face of the waters

2799237 an example of senator mccains push to spread democracy in that part of the world as a very important advance of americas interest
2799238 i wish senator obama had actually confronted the issue not trying to detract our attention by focusing on a mccain adviser
2799239 i think this is another example during these uncertain times where we need experienced leadership we need someone like senator mccain who will take a stronger view a more experienced view when it comes to international security and protecting americas interest
2799240 what senator mccain wants to do is continue the bush policies of trying to isolate russia its not working
2799241 i would say obama is spending exactly the same amount of time attacking us and frankly probably more money
2799242 obama started negative campaigning on john mccain long before we started punching back
2799243 barack obama has been in the united states senate less than 300 working days he has voted for 90 tax increases
2799244 now we could have an ad on every tax increase hes voted on every single day between now and the election and still not get them all in
2799245 the profit taking by the oil companies is not being used to look for new sources of oil and gas overwhelmingly theyre buying back their stock theyre paying out dividends theyre paying the ceo salaries
2799246 when john mccain says well they need 4 billion more in tax breaks he just doesnt understand the reality of what this economy is facing
2799247 those are the folks who have been disadvantaged by a war thats costing us 10 billion to 12 billion a month a war thats taking money out of our economy that could be spent here in america
2799248 we have no plans to insert money into either of those two institutions
2799249 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor here in treasury
2799250 an example of senator mccains push to spread democracy in that part of the world as a very important advance of americas interest
2799251 i wish senator obama had actually confronted the issue not trying to detract our attention by focusing on a mccain adviser
2799252 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2799253 there was a very large of amount of fire when we arrived
2799254 we are just planning to share some additional information about the chip
2799255 were not wearing apparel that identified them as members of the u s delegation at the time of the attack
2799256 its far too early to suggest that this has anything to do with the olympics taking place
2799257 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2799258 im really shocked to hear there has been an attack here
2799259 here in beijing is very safe i have been walking outside at 3 a m you never see anything like this maybe this is related with the olympics i didnt expect anything like this it is shocking
2799260 i doubt they would have said anything at all if it didnt involve foreigners
2799261 such things are very unusual not just in this area but all of beijing i am shocked i am very shocked this is tragic
2799262 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2799263 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them our thoughts prayers and deepest condolences are with the bachman and mccutcheon families
2799264 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others
2799265 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2799266 kids around here they need money so what else is there to do
2799267 the kids dont have parents watching them and they feel like they dont have any hope
2799268 its been historically a community thats been very hard for us to build inroads in
2799269 all i see is 4 year olds walking around holding hands with 7 year olds
2799270 theres nothing for me to do around here every corner is a drug corner
2799271 kids should try to stay away from that do something positive sell bottles of water or something anything
2799272 they walk around with their bellies pushing a stroller and they think its cute
2799273 we have to get in our cars so the kids can have everything their heart desires
2799274 i believe drug traffickers find fertile ground for their trade where you have depressed areas because poor people are desperate
2799275 theyre looking to put food on the table and unfortunately i believe thats whats happened in the whitman park neighborhood
2799276 city officials dont take advantage of positive organizations like ours
2799277 we operate out of a small storefront and we make miracles work
2799278 you wonder why the children dont have anywhere to go its political people down there in city hall who dont have vision
2799279 in the olympic games you have to be ready to swim at any time
2799280 rarely does a case get solved by only forensic evidence
2799281 here the science is highly informative but its also limited
2799282 obviously we anticipated that we would have had to defend the reliability of our scientific findings at trial and were confident we would have been able to do so
2799283 anthrax spends the majority of time as a spore thats why we dont see diversity in the genome that we see in other organisms

2799290 he promises more taxes on small business seniors your life savings your family
2799291 but mr mccains latest attack on the obama tax plan crosses the line from reasonable argument to unacceptably misleading

2799300 everything to calm down feelings and bring mauritanians closer together
2799301 i telephoned him abdallahi personally to explain to him the gravity of his decree and suggest he postpone it to avoid the worst
2799302 the solution to the problem rests solely with the mauritanians we are going to help them to reach an agreement
2799303 we want to prevent mauritania from falling into a vicious cycle where the crisis deepens and the international community is led to take measures that would be unfortunate for the lives and the future of the mauritanian people
2799304 joins other institutions in calling for the return of constitutional order
2799305 avoid the times when there have been really rancorous debates in the confirmation process
2799306 we are supporting the georgian military units that are in iraq in their redeployment to georgia so that they can support requirements there during the current security situation
2799307 flights have in fact begun today and georgian forces are redeploying
2799308 god willing not only the georgian forces will withdraw but all other troops will leave our country and security and stability will come back to our land
2799309 tend to pick up stories from the national enquirer with tongs
2799310 they have been very right about some things but theres been some misses too so its a little scary to follow on those stories
2799311 its also a little scary for big outfits to step up on a story like this sex may sell but it can really hurt your relationship with readers
2799312 we at abc were working on this story and if we had had any proof and any verifiable facts we certainly would have gone with the story
2799313 it was just a matter of were not going to put something on the air until we know that its true
2799314 we were able to prove i think with satisfaction to our bosses that there was money being paid to rielle hunter
2799315 this began to be for us an aspect of something we could report some hard facts
2799316 until he called and its on the record that he called us on friday and said i want to talk you know thats what broke the story he was willing to admit that he had been lying
2799317 but it became a ludicrous situation almost became a conspiracy of silence by the media and edwards meanwhile would not give interviews was not acting like a man who didnt have something to hide
2799318 i think at that point we should have earlier than we did told readers and viewers what we knew and we didnt know
2799319 i was taught when i was a young reporter that its news when we say it is i think thats still true its news when we say it is its just who we is has changed
2799320 members of the public people with modems people with cell phones are now producers editors they can push and push and push on a story until it ends up being acknowledged by everyone
2799321 we have said that this is a condition driven process
2799322 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2799323 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
2799324 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
2799325 this was a heinous attack by al qaeda in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
2799326 i did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town
2799327 al qaeda is to blame for this attack operations in diyala have pushed them here
2799328 your actions have hurt not just two americans but they have hurt the way americans will view china during the games the way all the people of the world will view china the bright dream of these momentous olympics has been darkened by you tang yongming even if you had ten thousand excuses the chinese people will never forgive your actions

2799333 its true that the number of infections is declining but consider this if the world can be satisfied with 2 7 million people infected per year 7 500 per day then im not sure where the standards are for declaring something a total disaster what i see is that we are making progress through combination prevention but in order to stop the epidemic theres no doubt that well need a vaccine
2799334 there is no greater tool to end aids than a preventive vaccine
2799335 even in a country like the u s with significant resources and education dedicated to prevention were still losing the battle against aids especially among certain high risk populations
2799336 the bottom line is that we need a long term solution to this epidemic we need a vaccine if we are to turn the tide on aids
2799337 its clear 25 years after the discovery of the virus that were on a long journey and its not going to be a straight line thats why i think that the
2799338 said dr alan bernstein executive director of the global hiv vaccine enterprise
2799339 divide up the mission into a set of interim milestones this is a way to measure progress to hold people accountable
2799340 the second recommendation is a practical one we have to trim and significantly improve the pipeline we believe that the 30 odd candidates in the pipeline should be trimmed based on their probability of success resources from these candidates should be re directed instead towards solving the biggest challenges facing researchers today
2799341 to move the aids vaccine field forward we have to sustain the effort we need a new cadre of young researchers we need stable and predictable financing that is flexible
2799342 failure is a momentary setback on the road to success
2799343 developing a vaccine may take more time and innovation than we once imagined but we are confident that science will prevail
2799344 scientists and those who support their work private corporations and governments alike should redouble their commitments
2799345 the challenges are huge but i have no doubt that we will live in a world without hiv some day
2799346 nearly all of us in this room were born into a world without aids we owe it to future generations to work to leave them a world without aids
2799347 i am responsible for it i alone am responsible for it
2799348 fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want
2799349 i was there from a very simple reason because i was trying to keep this mistake that i had made from becoming public
2799350 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2799351 you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2799352 i dont know if the picture has been altered manufactured if its a picture of me taken some other time holding another baby i have no idea
2799353 i was not at this meeting holding a child for my photograph to be taken i can tell you that
2799354 i have responded to consistently to these tabloid allegations by saying i dont respond to these lies
2799355 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done
2799356 i think the longer these allegations go unanswered and unresponded to the more difficult it is for the people producing the convention to give him a prominent spot
2799357 but i would expect that he would not speak or have any role at the convention unless this is cleared up
2799358 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2799359 my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2799360 john edwards was a great champion of working people during the first of this campaign many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified at the convention
2799361 my thoughts and prayer are with the edwards family today
2799362 i think furious would be a good way to describe it
2799363 it is time for me to step aside so that history can blaze its path

2799369 esta desinformaci n fue difundida por la parte georgiana para inducir a error a la comunidad internacional sobre los eventos en curso en osetia del sur
2799370 hemos exigido a las tropas georgianas que abandonen territorio abjazo pero se niegan
2799371 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2799372 we do not plan to escalate the conflict in this region
2799373 they were on a mass scale and were directed against individuals
2799374 were being driven away the place was in flames and we couldnt stay
2799375 this reminds me all too much of other recent conflicts that have torn our continent apart particularly in the balkans
2799376 i believe that the international community is not looking to destabilise mauritania
2799377 when it has all the information it will turn in a positive direction

2799384 we had some very difficult choices to make this year
2799385 im confident we came out with the best squad for the upcoming season we look forward to introducing the girls at the islanders pre season game against the devils on october 1st
2799386 this will be my fourth year as an ice girl theres nothing more exciting than being able to interact with fans at the coliseum and all over long island
2799387 its a tribute to all of the work these ladies have brought to the ice and community knowing that we were the first nhl ice girl squad and so many nhl teams have followed our shining example
2799388 the ice girls have not only become a major part of our game night entertainment but key ambassadors in our community functions like the i c e tour
2799389 i think there is a great sense of urgency to try to get the firefighter to hospital as soon as possible
2799390 there was a very very large amount of fire when we arrived and the extent of the explosion if the blast was heard as far away as it was could have been much more serious
2799391 hopefully we wont find that there are a lot of people missing or injured but so far it looks like we got off very lucky
2799392 the person who we described as being unaccounted for i believe is someone who was an employee of the business where the explosion took place
2799393 so efforts continue to try to track down that person
2799394 i certainly dont think it will be days i think it will be hours
2799395 but that all depends on what we run into if we run into some more problems or problems that we dont see now then it could be longer
2799396 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2799397 these vital new additions and people who have just been promoted all possess complementary skill sets and believe in the focused vision of campus crest

2799416 housing stock is a core element of any communitys infrastructure
2799417 it provides a safe nurturing environment to pursue the american dream in a community as young as ours we havent had a huge issue in terms of aging and deteriorating quality but we have to stay ahead of it
2799418 this will help determine what type of reinvestment is most needed on an area by area basis
2799419 when a code enforcement officer is out in the community and encounters a challenge thats bigger than a couch on the sidewalk they can call us in
2799420 it almost verges on being criminal the way we have underutilized the expertise of faculty and students
2799421 the 20 something market is looking for amenities and a sense of place the older properties tend to not represent that they may have a swimming pool but the new ones have wireless internet access pool tables fitness centers concierge service we need to start talking to property owners about what they can do to make themselves comparable to the newer properties
2799422 were always willing to work with the city and make the properties more marketable
2799423 if theres grants out there available for these properties then that would be great

2799428 were in a unique position to do an in depth market analysis to demonstrate that reinvestment in their property will allow them to go to a higher rental rate were also in a position to help them market their property
2799429 lets be honest the challenge we have in the economy is the people you need to help support the overall economy cant have a piece of the dream
2799430 theres some communities on the west coast that are major tourism economies and theyre unable to house the people who fuel that segment of the economy
2799431 youve got to have all the price ranges to have a healthy workforce
2799432 if we had some nice condos that students could own it would be an alternative to living in neighborhoods
2799433 rather than do a focus group i envision it as an ongoing thing where we engage the community
2799434 im a realist and ive been in the community since 1970
2799435 i appreciate the challenges that are facing it what im hearing is a change in philosophical position instead of putting out spot fires lets take that 2 million and instead of trying to fix a little house here and a little house there try to find a large project and go after it

2799593 im so happy that we could light this crowd up
2799594 its been a long summer and im so proud of this corps im so proud of this staff im so proud of my husband because i was there from the very beginning watching this thing develop in the office on the field and everything that theyve gone through has been amazing absolutely amazing i thought i was going to have to pick my husband up off the floor when he heard how close the score was
2799595 you can never get upset weve obviously been in this spot many a time
2799596 its just amazing to come out to finals and to do what you do best perform your heart out things work out the way they are but we had the performance of our lives i wish i could do it again but i cant
2799597 the blue devils is a great place to work and the members are incredibly talented every year
2799598 this was a very young group there are only five age outs in this group but they come from a lot of talented places with a lot of talented instructors and we really appreciate their hard work and commitment
2799599 you never know if youre going to fall off or if youre going to make it all the way across
2799600 the guys had the performance of a lifetime tonight there were some great drum corps out there and we are just very happy with the job they did today this summer we grew day by day getting better and better as a drum corps and finally we met the highpoint tonight so were happy about that
2799601 it has been the most amazing life changing experience and im so blessed to be a part of it
2799602 dont hold back do everything with your heart full out with your passion out there for the crowd to see
2799603 today was the best show of the year hands down
2799604 each of these three nights we got better and better and those performances were all better than the ones before that thats all you can hope for there was a lot of development with our show as far as the design process goes but the one thing that remained consistent was that the members woke up every day and they worked hard forget the scores forget the judges forget the placements they were just looking to make the best product they could and they absolutely succeeded in that goal
2799605 tonights show was phenomenal its the reason weve been working so hard the entire summer this was one of the hardest things ive ever done but in the end you get a warm feeling inside and you know thats the reason why youve put in all this time
2799606 as we formed the final v on the field with the cymbals i was trying to take it all in i dont have any regrets after this season im going to try to be firefighter and vanguard and the drum corps experience has definitely set me up for what it takes to pursue a career like that
2799607 todays show was amazing especially because it was my first time in the finals it was great to see the crowd from the other side looking back i have no regrets about marching drum corps has taught me to persevere and that i can do anything i want to do in life
2799608 weve grown and worked together and weve accomplished so much way more than any of us thought we ever could ive grown so much with everyone here i feel like i have 149 brothers and sisters
2799609 todays show was really emotional when i was marching everything just felt perfect i would never trade this experience for anything else drum corps has taught me to be a family and how to get along with your peers and a lot of time management its not about the show and its not about the scores its about how you interact with the people around you and how you care for them
2799610 today was above and beyond anything i had ever hoped for
2799611 it was fantastic this has been such a great season and im sad to see that its all over after all these years
2799612 todays performance was unlike any other performance ive ever had in my life the day went by so fast and everything was so perfect it felt like a huge fairytale and its just a great time to be a madison scout

2799618 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
2799619 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
2799620 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him
2799621 im sad that my daughter will never know or be able to feel how much he loved her
2799622 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
2799623 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family

2799647 the indecency controls that began as a limited tool for reining in a small number of provocative broadcast personalities and irresponsible licensees have become a rallying cry for a revival of nineteenth century
2799648 we do not expect that pressure to disappear with this courts ruling but a clear decision of unconstitutionality will at least have the salutary effect of removing the agencys discretion to respond to it

2799734 its a very special car for customers who want to take the bespoke experience to a higher level
2799735 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
2799736 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
2799737 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
2799738 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
2799739 so if he were to pick governor kaine it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what
2799740 we are feeling very very good about where the senator is in the polls and we obviously expect as america the american electorate turns their attentions even more to this race in connection with the conventions we expect to do to do quite well
2799741 i mean it was funny but wearing a clown suit and juggling would be funny too but it doesnt connect with the concerns americans have about gas prices about the war about the economy
2799742 so i think on things like that shoot i hope the mccain camp does more of those ads and well just let them do those ads
2799743 senator mccain is running the same old negative karl rove style ads that were all tired of
2799744 with a restive electorate with an economy thats sort of chugging along with a war in the background at the end of eight years of republican rule in the white house obama should be way ahead
2799745 the fact that he isnt says that there are grave doubts about senator obama
2799746 i would make the argument that part of the reason why senator obama is in the shape he is in today is because hes failed to run a positive campaign
2799747 hes run a negative campaign hes claimed to be something new and different and yet given these you know it is really beyond the pale to sit there and insinuate that senator mccain is somehow going to attack him for being black which is what he did for over a month
2799748 hearing the news was tragic stunning words cant describe it
2799749 how can i help thats all we were thinking we talked about how the best thing we could do was try to play volleyball
2799750 it meant a tremendous amount to myself and the guys when we heard from him
2799751 he talked about trying to move on he just told us it will be difficult but together well be much stronger
2799752 we wanted to have a moment of silence where we could gather our thoughts before starting this journey
2799753 it was a moment of silence to honor the bachman family
2799754 the one thing weve always talked about is that this is about a team its not about individual people
2799755 the thing that came across as hugh was talking to us is you know what ive got this happening right now but we came here with a goal in mind and weve invested all this time in it and we need to go out there and try to complete what we started
2799756 it means going out there and playing better every match than we did the previous match
2799757 we really felt the loss as one of our own
2799758 maybe thats why it hurt so much it just felt so close
2799759 the best way we can honor them at this juncture is to go out and compete every day and play hard every day and enjoy and love the game of volleyball and it is a game
2799760 we should be playing it and enjoying it and loving it as they would
2799761 were totally aware that we may see him and we may not
2799762 thats completely all right with us he has other priorities
2799763 i think that the allies will have no choice but to take further measures that would be punitive given that we dont have a decent and responsive statement from the iranians
2799764 just doesnt look like its anything worth writing home about
2799765 the iranians have long stalled on responding to the allies
2799766 we are very disappointed that iran has yet again failed to give javier solana a clear answer to the generous incentives package
2799767 we agreed that we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran
2799768 given the absence of a clear positive response from iran the six countries are discussing the next steps in the un security council and beginning to consider the possible outlines of another resolution
2799769 the letter we received yesterday appears to be a stalling tactic
2799770 we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran as part of this strategy
2799771 but we believe it can be effective and therefore were going to continue proceeding with that process

2799778 georgian missile patrol boats today made two attempts to attack russian military ships the russian ships opened fire in response and as a result one of the georgian ships carrying out the attack was sunk
2799779 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2799780 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a cease fire and termination of hostilities
2799781 not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armor and increased attacks on tskhinvali
2799782 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on unprecedented scale
2799783 russias president dmitry medvedev said that moscow sent troops into south ossetia to protect its peacekeepers and civilians on a mission to
2799784 russian officials said they werent targeting civilians but russias foreign minister sergey lavrov said that
2799785 its regrettable that russian civilians and troops were killed when georgia tried to assert their legitimate authority in south ossetia
2799786 slept with too many women done too many drugs and been to too many parties
2799787 george has been giving him advice on things such as presentation public speaking and body language he also emails him constantly about policy especially the middle east
2799788 climate shift to unprecedentedly dry weather along with diversion of water for irrigation has converted this former reservoir in chinas minqin county into desert
2799789 your problem is not global warming your problem is that youre nuts
2799790 in yesterdays most recent tank attack the advancing tanks were supposedly crewed by ukrainians two unidentified bodies found today are said to be black possibly they are americans but we cant say for sure yet
2799791 there were blacks among the dead who were probably either mercenaries or instructors in the georgian armed forces
2799792 there are lots of bodies over there a lot of people have been killed mostly ossetians but also georgians they had american emblems on their forearms and they were in black uniforms
2799793 there was a time when we knew he could do anything

2799830 john mccain has said that improving veterans health care would be his top domestic priority as president yet he has repeatedly voted against increased funding for veterans health care and now he offers up an plastic card option that will lead to privatization of veterans health care no one knows how to help and heal veterans like veterans had i ended up in a regular hospital after returning from iraq i would lost my arm mccains plan will only hurt the va and our veterans more than they are already hurting
2799831 john just isnt the same as he used to be hes not his own man
2799832 a lot of that has to do with how hes wanted this job so bad for so long that hes tied himself to president bush
2799833 he should have been talking about veterans issues not his opponent
2799834 friedman tells stories well with a keen eye for wars absurdities and his own fading illusions of wars glory

2799846 the ministry of defence will decide this summer whether to equip the queen elizabeth class ships which were intended to operate stovl aircraft with catapults and arresting gear for conventional carrier planes if the u s navy seems likely to do something to boost the jsfs purchase price the aircraft could become a target in the u k mod which is struggling to cut costs that could force the royal navy to consider buying the f 18 or the dassault rafale or even a navalized version of the eurofighter
2799847 following the withdrawal of georgian troops from south ossetia the president of the republic believes there is a real perspective of rapidly finding a way out of the crisis
2799848 intends to pursue contacts with both georgian and russian presidents in the coming hours to bring their positions closer together and create the conditions to end the crisis
2799849 beginning yesterday afternoon unomig has reported ongoing aerial bombardments of georgian villages in the upper kodori valley
2799850 also observed the movement by the abkhaz side of substantial numbers of heavy weapons and military personnel towards the kodori valley
2799851 push the georgian armed forces out of the upper kodori valley
2799852 this morning some people were going to the grape fields when the bomb exploded on their vehicle five people died and three were wounded
2799853 the reports we received from the police chief of kapisa show that 11 civilians have been killed one of the dead was a woman
2799854 right now we are working to find out what exactly happened
2799855 has leased to the royal navy the warship hms clyde which is armed with 30mm guns
2799856 but in a world where irregular warfare is the primary focus and appears to be for the foreseeable future a balance of fighter jets and armed prop driven aircraft could prove beneficial
2799857 shiite militias in basra openly controlled wide swaths of the city on saturday and staged increasingly bold raids on iraqi government forces sent in five days ago to wrest control from the gunmen
2799858 theres a report that shatra is under sadrist control and it seems to be totally bogus according to a source who spoke with acquaintances there today qurna ghammas and nassiriya have all witnessed the collapse of whatever resistance the mahdi army could muster in facing government troops
2799859 the ministry of defence will reluctantly hand control of a project to build two new aircraft carriers for the royal navy to bae systems in an attempt to avoid a 700 million tax bill
2799860 it concerns me greatly that silver has now surpassed white as the most popular choice for new vehicles
2799861 the safest car color has now been replaced by one of the least safe
2799862 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2799863 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2799864 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2799865 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2799866 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2799867 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2799868 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2799869 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2799870 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2799871 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2799872 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2799873 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
2799874 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2799875 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2799876 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution

2799880 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
2799881 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
2799882 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
2799883 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
2799884 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2799885 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2799886 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2799887 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2799888 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2799889 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2799890 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2799891 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2799892 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2799893 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
2799894 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
2799895 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
2799896 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2799897 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2799898 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2799899 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2799900 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2799901 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2799902 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price

2799904 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2799905 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2799906 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2799907 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2799908 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2799909 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2799910 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2799911 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2799912 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2799913 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2799914 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2799915 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2799916 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2799917 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2799918 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2799919 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2799920 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships

2799922 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2799923 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2799924 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2799925 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2799926 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2799927 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2799928 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2799929 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2799930 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2799931 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2799932 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2799933 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2799934 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2799935 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late

2799940 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2799941 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2799942 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2799943 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2799944 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2799945 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2799946 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2799947 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2799948 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2799949 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2799950 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2799951 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2799952 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2799953 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2799954 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2799955 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2799956 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2799957 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2799958 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2799959 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2799960 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2799961 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2799962 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2799963 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2799964 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2799965 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2799966 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2799967 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2799968 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2799969 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2799970 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2799971 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2799972 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2799973 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2799974 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2799975 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2799976 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2799977 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2799978 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2799979 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
