7790000 life is what happens while you are busy making other plans
7790001 dar a una calurosa bienvenida al dalai lama y sus seguidores que huyeron a la india
7790002 el fin de la revoluci n cultural en 1976 y la destrucci n de la banda de los cuatro llev al poder a un nuevo grupo de l deres del partido comunista cuyas ideas cambiaron la suerte de los n madas de pala sus ideas eran completamente diferentes a las de mao y la banda de los cuatro para ellos la revoluci n cultural fue una cat strofe para china cerraron las comunas populares establecieron una econom a rural orientada hacia el mercado que llamaron el sistema de la responsabilidad la responsabilidad por la producci n pas de la comuna a la familia
7790003 el impacto de los cambios se hizo sentir en pala en 1981 de un d a para el otro se repartieron todos los animales de la comuna cada n mada ya fuera infante de apenas una semana de edad adolescente adulto o anciano recibi 37 animales desde ese momento en adelante cada familia era responsable de su propio ganado y pod a hacer con l como quer a tambi n se repartieron tierras a peque os grupos de tres a seis viviendas que compart an el mismo campamento
7790004 otra dram tica consecuencia de las reformas instituidas despu s de 1981 es la rapidez y alcance de las diferencias econ micas y sociales en pala
7790005 mientras que en 1981 ninguna familia ten a menos de 37 animales por persona para 1988 el 38 ten a menos de 30 la proporci n de familias de pala con m s de 50 animales por persona aument del 12 en 1981 al 25 en 1988 en 1988 el 10 de las familias ten a m s de 90 animales por individuo en comparaci n con ninguna en 1981 como resultado de ese proceso de diferenciaci n econ mica en 1988 el 16 m s rico de la poblaci n era due o del 33 de los animales mientras que el 33 de la poblaci n m s pobre era due o del 17 de los animales en los ltimos siete a os del sistema de responsabilidad ha surgido una nueva minor a de ricos con una mayor cantidad de animales y tambi n una nueva capa de pobres con pocos o nada de animales los nuevos pobres subsisten trabajando para los ricos algunos de los cuales al igual que en la vieja sociedad emplean regularmente a pastores orde adores y sirvientes por largas temporadas
7790006 una peque a fortuna en tibet donde el sueldo anual de un catedr tico en lhasa suma entre 2500 y 3000 yuan
7790007 el grueso del sistema cultural tradicional ya estaba funcionando nuevamente para 1988
7790008 con la muerte de mao y la ca da de la banda de los cuatro los nuevos l deres le dieron incentivos lucrativos a los jan para poblar a tibet
7790009 las medidas actuales empezaron en enero de 1983 para septiembre pek n informa hablaba de la exhortaci n oficial a la inmigraci n a tibet con incentivos garantizados y un aumento de dividendos a los ocho y los 20 a os
7790010 la poblaci n de dos millones no era suficiente para desarrollar sus recursos
7790011 si la derecha lleva a cabo un golpe de estado anticomunista en china estoy seguro de que no conocer tampoco la paz y muy probablemente su dominaci n ser de corta vida ya que esto no podr ser tolerado por ninguno de los revolucionarios que representan los intereses del pueblo constituido por m s del 90 por ciento de la poblaci n
7790012 tienen que contarle a la gente en lhasa lo que est pasando aqu
7790013 no se dan cuenta estoy hablando de los enemigos de clase se est n levantando de nuevo
7790014 aunque todav a no se conoce toda la historia del comit mucha especulaci n y pruebas circunstanciales indican que una gran fuente de financiaci n fue la cia
7790015 los hijos e hijas de los arist cratas y ricos tibetanos que estaban estudiando en universidades alrededor de darjeeling no vinieron a ayudar
7790016 5000 ni os fueron separados de sus padres y enviados a campamentos permanentes de refugiados a otros 3000 les permitieron quedarse con sus padres en los campamentos de trabajo y con frecuencia se o a que ni os menores de 15 a os realizaban trabajos peligrosos
7790017 el dolor es el patr n con que se mide el placer
7790018 una de las principales fuentes de poder pol tico del dalai lama es su habilidad para controlar los fondos de socorro las becas estudiantiles y la contrataci n de maestros y bur cratas
7790019 se le considera el rey de la comunidad y puede mandar a todos sus miembros
7790020 las operaciones de socorro han tenido constantes problemas debido a rivalidades e intrigas de miembros poco reputables de la camarilla gobernante tibetana
7790021 mientras los ni os que estaban a su cargo pasaban constante hambre una trabajadora recuerda que una vez la atac un grupo de ni os muertos de hambre para quitarle un plato de sobras del desayuno sus almuerzos de 12 platos eran famosos
7790022 los refugiados representan desproporcionadamente la jerarqu a mon stica las clases altas y los participantes en el movimiento de resistencia tibetano
7790023 viv an en extrema pobreza en campamentos insalubres en las tierras de sobra en las zonas m s pobres de la india la mayor a de sus energ as las consume la lucha personal por la subsistencia caen en la pobreza la apat a la enfermedad el alcoholismo y la desesperanza
7790024 la situaci n de las mujeres es peor que la de los hombres pues necesitan permiso de un hombre para salir no pueden votar y tienen menor preferencia en materia de educaci n

7790064 the worlds spiritual home of cricket don being by far the best cricketer of all time
7790065 it will not only be the bradman museum but it will be the international cricket hall of fame whose captain will be don bradman and the team will be obviously the best
7790066 the initial team of 12 people will be from all over the world i dont know exactly who they will be but they will include people like sachin tendulkar from india
7790067 as the hall of the fame is implemented we will be setting up to embrace the other cricket nations like india and pakistan
7790068 he gave australia pride and hope at a time when through the depression and wwii we really needed it
7790069 we had a tiny population then and the fact that he could go out and be the worlds best gave a lot of hope to australia
7790070 i think its one of the reasons why australia does so well in sport now we can approach any sport and challenge the worlds best we dont feel diffident we dont feel that we cant win at any sport that we do
7790071 the wonderful values that cricket has and how it helps society helps young people learn fairness and competition

7790080 pidi la farmacia permiso para reformar la fachada y poner un tejado al local
7790081 el problema es que no est bien anclada si pasa algo de qui n es la responsabilidad
7790082 nadie se opone a la instalaci n del ascensor nos oponemos a los hechos consumados y al atropello porque el fin no justifica los medios
7790083 estos se ores iban a hechos consumados porque la comunidad les retir la autorizaci n pero siguieron con las obras y por eso se vot presentarlo a juicio

7790085 however there is nothing like godfathers running the process in america it is all the affairs of the people
7790086 no political party is allowed by law to raise or take funds from outside the country
7790087 whenever funds are raised the source of the fund has to be verified it has to be made public how much is raised you have to know who is donating what and the integrity of the donors and perhaps the party and the candidate owe a duty to explain how the money is spent
7790088 once you are elected as a candidate no matter your political party you owe allegiance to the people not your political party or a godfather the party cannot dictate to you but the people the party cannot control the candidate once elected it is the integrity of the candidate what he wants for the americans that is important

7790090 these abnormal features of tumor vessels impair delivery of circulating chemotherapeutic drugs to the actual tumor site
7790091 because high cell density increases contractility across the entire cell layer these findings suggested that tumor capillary cells are inherently hyper contractile
7790092 in this study weve uncovered a previously unrecognized role for tumor capillary cell mechanosensing and contractility in the formation of irregular tumor vessels and have identified potential new targets for vascular normalization therapy that might be implemented in the clinic someday
7790093 who say that taking away consumers right to sue would also take away a strong incentive for the fda and the pharmaceutical industry to be open about a drugs potential for causing harm
7790094 havent always been completely open or correct in their labeling even when the risk of lawsuits has been present
7790095 preserving the right of consumers to sue will keep federal agencies and manufacturers more honest and the public more protected
7790096 we are pleased to have acquired sareums structure based drug discovery assets and welcome their team and their clients to biofocus dpi
7790097 the assets and expertise acquired from sareum strengthen our drug discovery adding a novel technology that our customers are expressing interest in we look forward to extending and expanding this business within the biofocus dpi client base
7790098 i am confident that the acquisition of sareums expertise in structure based drug discovery services will further enhance biofocus dpis leading position in global drug discovery service provision
7790099 now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us
7790100 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7790101 hillary often says that bill isnt a complicated person the obama people dont have to do much to make peace with him
7790102 for now this is a hard human process making room on the stage for everyone
7790103 kennedys embrace of obama was in part about seeing personal qualities in obama that he saw in his brothers
7790104 for the clintons who were in and out of power much more recently it is more complicated the democrats will have a new leader in november and president clinton and hillary are still coming to terms with that
7790105 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7790106 there are going to be some of sen clintons supporters who were going to have to work hard to persuade to come on board thats not surprising
7790107 but if you take a look this week i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes
7790108 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7790109 hes been a fighter for the hispanic community hes been a fighter for the immigration issue
7790110 im sure theres also a baseball game on tonight too
7790111 was a tremendous success in showing the knowledge stamina intellect the political savvy that a woman can run for president come very close to winning and that the american people are ready for a woman president
7790112 my success as speaker of the house and the bigger step that hillary clinton has taken as president of the united states are not just about us theyre about breaking marble ceilings opening doors and leading the way for many many more women
7790113 i attribute it a great deal to the hillary factor
7790114 and her competence and resiliency and capacity have removed forever the question im shocked at how much it did remove it
7790115 i wonder if a woman could appear out of nowhere like barack obama and be taken seriously i somehow doubt it
7790116 hillary clinton has put the picture of a female president into peoples head but the bar for her is still higher
7790117 but the questions are gone we know a woman can be our commander in chief
7790118 in the next 10 to 12 years we will have a republican woman candidate
7790119 non sar solo protesta diplomatica ammonisce il ministero degli esteri russo e uno dei progetti per abbandonare il trattato start sul controllo delle armi atomiche
7790120 i come here tonight as a sister blessed with a brother who is my mentor my protector and my lifelong friend
7790121 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7790122 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7790123 and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
7790124 i stand here today at the crosscurrents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7790125 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country
7790126 america has never considered the possibility of a young smart black woman as first lady
7790127 he and my mom poured everything they had into me and craig
7790128 and thanks to their faith and hard work we both were able to go on to college so i know firsthand from their lives and mine that the american dream endures

7790132 i wholeheartedly congratulate the overseas anti corruption unit for their landmark success in this case
7790133 bribery and corruption not only hurts the poor but hurts business too this is why the department for international development has funded this programme i am delighted to see this result
7790134 if we could prevent these infections in the first place or detect them sooner we might one day be able to prevent some of these premature births
7790135 to find that this amniotic compartment which we have traditionally viewed as somewhat sacrosanct is infected significantly more often than we thought is a little shocking
7790136 weve become very good at growing some bacterial species what might be called the weeds of the microbial world
7790137 but many other species cant be cultured by current methods
7790138 although we know now that humans should respect and even cherish their microbial symbionts
7790139 this type of infection reflects a situation in which our microbial companions have overstepped their bounds something has gone awry with this balance
7790140 risks significant misuse of funds in this 39 billion program
7790141 has seriously degraded cms ability to meet its responsibilities in combating fraud and abuse
7790142 some plan sponsors are dragging their feet on required anti fraud prevention and cms is letting them get away with it
7790143 orally instructed auditors to deviate from written policies by making determinations based primarily on the limited medical records available from equipment suppliers
7790144 i want to know what happened whos responsible who will be held accountable and what hhs secretary mike leavitt will do about it
7790145 if people cooked the books manipulated the methodology or told the contractor to ignore the rules those individuals need to take the heat
7790146 if this is true this is an outrageous and unforgivable stunt cracking down on fraud should be a top priority for medicare not fixing numbers to make an agency look better
7790147 i expect hearings and i expect answers truthful answers from medicare about this report
7790148 an unsupported extrapolation at this time because the report only cited percentages
7790149 we have far exceeded our expectations having reduced the error rate beyond the 2006 goal of 5
7790150 exceeded only by a staggering lack of oversight by congress and by medicares own failure to protect the program against open thievery
7790151 cooking the books proves true heads should roll at cms
7790152 adequately fund investigations and after medical industry lobbyists complained about a new law requiring competitive bidding congress reneged on the deal
7790153 politicos lingering around washington can barely keep a straight face as they claim to be shocked
7790154 his ilk consistently claim that medicare is a model for government run universal health care because it spends less on overhead than the private sector
7790155 insurance companies spend money to screen their claims for fraud
7790156 medicare automatically pays more than 95 of the bills it receives
7790157 this lack of scrutiny reduces overhead but it makes the program highly vulnerable to abuse
7790158 the real reason liberals like mr stark are outraged is because they want to claim one of medicares vices as a virtue to help along their health care ambitions
7790159 shows that taxpayers will be literally poorer if stark gets his way

7790178 kita sudah terbiasa dengan peruntukan anggaran yang jauh di bawah minimum yang kita terima dalam empat tahun terakhir memang kita mengalah pada perekonomian dan kesra karena prioritas pembangunan saat ini pemulihan ekonomi yang berlanjut dan pengentasan kemiskinan
7790179 yang namanya tentara rakyat tentu memihak kepada rakyat kepentingan rakyat sekarang ya pengentasan kemiskinan pembangunan sekolah bandara pelabuhan pembangkit listrik karena itu akan membantu penerimaan negara yang lebih besar sehingga anggaran pertahanan lima tahun bisa meningkat
7790180 apakah rp32 triliun atau rp 33 7 triliun terserah yang kita persoalkan sekarang bagaimana bisa memanfaatkan jumlah yang ada itu
7790181 misalnya tahun ini ada penambahan enam helikopter tempur dua kapal corvette serta kita harapkan ada penambahan tiga pesawat sukhoi sehingga alat pukul kita lebih kuat

7790183 sehingga bisa memberi masukan dan bantuan pemikiran kepada eksekutif legislatif dan yudikatif

7790188 with the growing number of tv stations over the past few years and their need to stand out from the crowd the demand for high quality 3d graphics has picked up significantly
7790189 at the same time tv stations are looking for solutions that are simple easy to use and do not require high cost of ownership to date you could either choose a simple 2d character generator or a high end yet more complicated 3d system morpho 3d is positioned to bridge this gap and brings the best from all sides
7790190 morpho 3d is a brand new product resulting from an intense two year development phase
7790191 the system offers a new and refreshing approach to how real time 3d graphics should be created in todays television production environment

7790214 at a time when iraq has a 79 billion surplus they have parked it in banks in new york city it doesnt make too much sense for us to be still spending u s taxpayer dollars 10 billion monthly rebuilding baghdad
7790215 we should use some of that money to rebuild virginia building roads and laying broadband lines and putting people back to work

7790242 there are important unanswered questions about pipeline network requirements economic regulation utility cost recovery regulatory classification of co2 itself and pipeline safety
7790243 carbon sequestration by reacting naturally occurring mg and ca containing minerals with co 2 to form carbonates has many unique advantages most notably is the fact that carbonates have a lower energy state than co 2 which is why mineral carbonation is thermodynamically favorable and occurs naturally e g the weathering of rock over geologic time periods secondly the raw materials such as magnesium based minerals are abundant finally the produced carbonates are unarguably stable and thus re release of co 2 into the atmosphere is not an issue however conventional carbonation pathways are slow under ambient temperatures and pressures the significant challenge being addressed by this effort is to identify an industrially and environmentally viable carbonation route that will allow mineral sequestration to be implemented with acceptable economics
7790244 available geological information shows absence of major tectonic events after the deposition of the utsira formation saline reservoir this implies that the geological environment is tectonically stable and a site suitable for carbon dioxide storage the solubility trapping is the most permanent and secure form of geological storage

7790248 that omission sends a message that verges on the sinister not that ministers have abandoned their commitment to decency and fairness but that when it comes to devising strategies for dealing with the numbers crisis and the other challenges facing the prison estate the monitoring task has simply disappeared off the agenda

7790312 the fear is given our track record that the sailing will not be so smooth

7790323 that hedge fund manager came in again on friday when you were at home
7790324 he looked at quite a few pieces i took him through into the storeroom as well hes so rude he wanted me to leave him alone in there to look at things said i was putting him off concentrating by telling him about each work he just needs to bite on a couple of the more expensive ones
7790325 he can bite my backside before i allow you to leave him alone with the stock i dont trust him ive been wondering whether he might have been sent to snoop around here by the bank who says hes a hedge fund manager anyway
7790326 last time you were out when he came in with his wife or he said she was his wife she looked like the type whod be married to a hedge fund manager you know swiss finishing school euro accent brain the size of a walnut armani sunglasses in october
7790327 well if he ever actually buys anything ill eat something this styrofoam cup your handbag i dunno something
7790328 penny ive been meaning to talk to you about something for a while
7790329 when you address me by my name i know it must be bad
7790330 you know better than anyone else how difficult things have been over the last couple of years
7790331 everyones been proud of you for having got through at all jake for one often says how highly he rates you
7790332 i dont mean so much personally im really talking about the business its not viable any longer is it you can see the costs of running the space the price these days of finding new stock and you can see also what we take each month
7790333 im trying to tell us both something you and i are the gallery these days although admittedly i own whats left of the stock i think ive decided to call it a day at the end of jakes show its not working for me any more im afraid
7790334 im really breaking up with the last fifteen years of my life im not exactly going out on a high am i
7790335 at least youve bloody well given it a good go
7790336 this all means youve got nearly four months to find something else youll get three months redundancy pay on top of that
7790337 what can i say im gutted but i do understand your decision i half expected it to come sooner than this to be honest jake was even wondering at one point whether you might bail on his show n not that he knows anything about the gallery finances of course
7790338 he was just wondering whether your heart was really in it all any more
7790339 hes right i dont think it really is in the gallery i mean
7790340 but well certainly go ahead with his show after all the work hes put into it
7790341 got back about half an hour ago i go about twice a week
7790342 all those sweaty locals ive never fancied that form of exercise with everyone watching you going through the motions on the treadmill or the rowing machine
7790343 i was a sweaty local until i had a shower
7790344 its the only activity that gets me in a sweat these days
7790345 i dont quite know what to say to that id like to try to help you remedy that situation is that an appropriate reply
7790346 i dont think we have it in america were a post cart kind of nation unless you happen to be amish
7790347 i mean lets take it one step at a time see what happens theres no rush is there
7790348 when it comes to anything to do with sex men are rarely honest in my experience
7790349 are you basing that on a lot of past case studies
7790350 i was married for quite a while dont forget there was no one else for some time before and a long time afterwards as well
7790351 likewise i hardly know where to begin is that honest enough for you
7790352 i think it is yeah im not quite sure where this leaves us though but at least were being honest im sure well muddle through somehow
7790353 are you free for a drink or something later this week
7790354 what about thursday night i have a meeting with a client that might go on fairly late tomorrow but im definitely free on thursday
7790355 ill pick you up about seven thirty if thats okay
7790356 no i heard the sound of breaking twigs and thought it must be you or a deer
7790357 and there was me thinking i could creep up on you at will without making a sound
7790358 why dyou go in for that sort of thing then
7790359 one night i was having a cigarette in my bedroom window a couple of months back and thought i saw someone sitting in the woods watching the house i was a bit worried at the time but mustve been seeing things it was pretty dark
7790360 god knows perhaps they were casing the joint as your people might say or they just like sitting in the woods at night looking at georgian houses i guess i mustve been seeing things
7790361 oh quite quiet things always start getting quieter the month before christmas in the legal business people are too busy shopping to get divorced
7790362 i thought christmas was the peak time for break ups
7790363 the petitions for divorce start hitting our desks in the new year
7790364 out with the old and in with the new dont you find it a bit depressing having to deal with divorces and deaths all the time you must see some of the worst aspects of human behaviour
7790365 well im not really implicated am i i just do the paperwork
7790366 still it must be hard sometimes to keep your professional distance
7790367 if i can help some woman get a fair divorce settlement
7790368 when shes given up her career and stayed at home for years to look after the kids while her husband goes off to work and sleeps with his secretary then im pleased
7790369 im going to have the spaghetti alla carbonara and a tricolore salad please is the pasta fresh
7790370 and ill go for the veal milanese and a side order of chips can you make sure theyre crunchy please
7790371 shall we get another bottle of house red yes lets get another bottle of red
7790372 your demanding american ways seem to be rubbing off on me
7790373 hardly ive learnt not to expect service of any kind in this country that way i find im never disappointed
7790374 id call my drinking anything but regular id say it was extraordinary
7790375 no seriously it became more ah regular when linda and bryony left it is under control though you know theres really nothing to worry about
7790376 i know its just if were going to do this whatever this is
7790377 then i have a right to worry about you to ask awkward questions
7790378 theres no awkwardness about it because its really not a problem
7790379 the week seems never ending these days i cant wait for christmas ive taken too little time off this year
7790380 you need to get your beauty sleep no thats not true youve got quite enough of that already
7790381 ive got the day off tomorrow but youve to go to work dont you

7790388 i i never do anything for christmas these days since linda left its a dead day for me are you going away somewhere this year or staying at home
7790389 i was planning to go to my sister and her husbands in banbury but thats not set in stone why
7790390 i i know you might find this a little erm premature but i was wondering if youd like to spend it with me up here id much prefer talking to you than staring into the fire
7790391 if i say yes well do it down here i know where everything is
7790392 i expect the global slowdown will continue and affect germany significantly more than has been reflected in forecasts up to now
7790393 i hope georgian president mikheil saakashvili will not go down in history as a new gavrilo princip
7790394 we want our relations to be fully fledged and those of partners but we do not want an illusion of partnership
7790395 naturally we are not happy with being surrounded by military bases and being told do not worry everythings fine
7790396 there are georgian forces on one side ossetians on the other yes they are peacekeepers but we are afraid every single night that something will happen the only thing we want is peace i dont care who we are with russia or georgia
7790397 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7790398 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7790399 maybe a little experience came through for me at 4 all in the last set
7790400 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7790401 people just come to me and say oh im happy for you
7790402 i dont know what is best to be a little bit tired but very comfortable and very positive or to be fresh and not play in the olympic games
7790403 your generation has done more travel and service work than ours did your generation sees yourselves as citizens of the world
7790404 i am particularly pleased to report strong performances in both our radio and news media divisions
7790405 this is further indication that the groups decision to diversify away from a pure television offering was indeed the right one
7790406 well placed to take advantage of opportunities arising from an upturn
7790407 while advertising remains a difficult environment we expect to markedly outperform our peer group over the next quarter
7790408 we are confident in the groups ability to deliver robust revenue and profit figures in the face of uncertain macroeconomic conditions
7790409 christ profits us nothing satan does not want us living in truth but in his lies or his half truths the gospel is present reality satan does not want us to live in reality but to live in a disneyland type of future fantasy
7790410 good ideas are killed as we only have time for the great ones
7790411 be strong and of good courage for you shall bring the children of isreal into the land of which i swore to them and i will be with you
7790412 on that day the lord exalted joshua in the sight of all isreal and they feared him as they had feared moses all the days of his life
7790413 si grazie per la tua lode la accetto sono cos felice che tu abbia voluto trovare il tempo di stare in comunione con me ho ascoltato la tua richiesta e il padre ti dar quello che il tuo cuore desidera ma ti prego aspetta per favore rimani ancora un po non andartene subito ho delle cose da dirti il mio cuore si strugge dal desiderio di aprirsi con te ho raccolto le tue lacrime ho lenito la tua mente travagliata ora permettimi di parlare lascia che io ti dica quello che nel mio cuore
7790414 manchmal spielte ich dreimal an einem abend oft bekam ich viel mehr gage aber es war auch h llisch anstrengend

7790417 professore ma perch ci vuole a tutti i costi turbare io vivo cos serenamente la mia vita e lei invece fa di tutto per intristirmi e guastare la mia felicit
7790418 calare questa dottrina nella vita reale nella mente delluomo e del cristiano moderno quando gli apostoli predicavano potevano contare sul fatto che anche i pagani che li ascoltavano avevano una consapevolezza concreta di meritare lira divina i misteri pagani esistevano appunto per alleviare il peso di questa consapevolezza e la filosofia epicurea sosteneva di poter liberare luomo dalla paura del castigo eterno in questo contesto il vangelo apparso come una buona novella portava la notizia di una possibile guarigione a uomini che sapevano di essere mortalmente malati ma tutto questo cambiato il cristianesimo oggi deve predicare la diagnosi che in s una notizia molto brutta prima di captare lattenzione per poter prescrivere la cura
7790419 spesso ho preferito chiamarmi ottimista per evitare la troppo evidente bestemmia del pessimismo ma tutto lottimismo dellepoca stato falso e scoraggiante per questa ragione che ha sempre cercato di provare che noi siamo fatti per il mondo lottimismo cristiano invece basato sul fatto che noi non siamo fatti per il mondo
7790420 la pi semplice verit sulluomo che egli un essere veramente strano strano quasi nel senso che straniero a questa terra
7790421 solo fra tutti gli animali scosso dalla benefica follia del riso quasi avesse afferrato qualche segreto di una pi vera forma delluniverso e lo volesse celare alluniverso stesso
7790422 non esiste investimento sicuro amare significa in ogni caso essere vulnerabili
7790423 non vi sono cose cattive ma solo un uso cattivo delle cose o se volete non vi sono cose cattive ma pensieri cattivi specialmente cattive intenzioni le cose buone come il mondo e la carne sono state contorte da una cattiva intenzione chiamata il diavolo ma egli non pu fare cattive cose queste rimangono come nel primo giorno della creazione lopera del cielo fu materiale la costruzione di un mondo materiale lopera dellinferno interamente spirituale
7790424 il sesso di per s non pu essere morale o immorale pi di quanto lo siano la forza di gravit o lalimentazione
7790425 il comportamento sessuale degli esseri umani invece pu esserlo e proprio come il loro comportamento economico politico agricolo parentale o filiale a volte buono e a volte cattivo

7790430 i hope you dont think i took advantage of your erm high spirits
7790431 i took advantage of you if anything with some men i mightve woken up in the morning to find someone unwanted in bed beside me
7790432 what as in a smart suited city slicker with deviant sexual tendencies and a penchant for handguns
7790433 i think i wouldve picked up on that by now and you have brown eyes
7790434 are you feeling up to being driven into cheltenham for your car are you feeling okay to drive
7790435 would it be alright with you if we waited until early afternoon say around two i dont think im fit to drive yet my heads still exploding im sorry if thats a pain
7790436 i dont have anything planned at all another action packed day ahead
7790437 a lot better it was a bit touch and go this morning i tell you id forgotten that hangovers could make you so queasy
7790438 blame it on me i shouldnt have let you mix white and red wine that probably did it
7790439 women make their own choices these days havent you heard
7790440 okay they might do but i shouldve warned you in any case trust me i know what im talking about
7790441 next time we go out for a drink im in your hands
7790442 dyou want to follow me up to my house we could watch a film and i could make you some supper
7790443 thats so kind of you i love chinese i could eat a ming horse id given up hope that you were coming i was going to send out a search party
7790444 the service at chis is bloody slow but their foods fantastic nice cottage by the way
7790445 point me in the direction of the kitchen and some plates and ill dish up
7790446 youre my guest you just take a seat in the living room through there and ill sort it out shall i just give us half each of everything dyou want some soy sauce
7790447 i think they were sent to the quaint cotswolds for a holiday once by friends of theirs in london and fell in love with the place my father had some money spare and bought the cottage
7790448 what was it like what is it like to be an only child
7790449 i dont know what its like to have brothers and sisters i was a bit lonely sometimes i guess my parents or more my father always seemed to be too busy to have much time for me they just sent me away to school or gave me money its me against the world again now and thats still a bit frightening
7790450 im an only child of only children my father did have one much older brother but he died at eighteen in world war two when your parents go thats pretty much it
7790451 well well have to try and do something about your being lonely
7790452 i just need to freshen up ill be back in a minute dont you worry
7790453 its at the top of the stairs first on the left
7790454 ive just seen the time i had no idea it was so late ive got an eight thirty conference call in the office tomorrow morning im really sorry id better make a move and get to bed soon
7790455 of course why shouldnt it be ive had a really nice evening
7790456 it just seems a bit er sudden your needing to get home i mean
7790457 no everythings fine i just need some sleep ill make it up to you i promise
7790458 all my stuffs at home this was all a bit um spontaneous
7790459 look ill come with you in your car to make sure you get back safely then walk home through the woods i could do with some wintry air to cool me down
7790460 can i give you a ring in the next few days once i know whats in my work diary and we can do something just before christmas again ive had a lovely time tonight
7790461 this is a world war ii battleship with high fixed costs for maintenance and theres the cost of running the museum and utilities 720 000 a year its an expensive place to run
7790462 for the 3 million the state was getting back 9 2 million in economic impact
7790463 if the state wants to see vibrant cultural and historical museums in the state theres a level of support thats needed
7790464 each of these sites and activities are equally important to fueling the states economy
7790465 the liberty science center in jersey city was cut by 2 7 million and the newark museum lost 2 2 million
7790466 the goal of the budget was to take steps to fix state finances so we could match recurring spending with recurring revenues reduce state debt and ease the structural budget shortfall
7790467 the focus was to preserve core programs that service our seniors and other vulnerable populations
7790468 we are dependent on the states help so this is a big blow to us
7790469 its been a rough month we will have to do a better job of bringing in more money well have to work harder
7790470 we will have to handle tasks in much different ways assess operational priorities we will probably have some limited hours during the winter we will still have groups and encampments for a day
7790471 we are not a philadelphia based museum with main line support from wealthy contributors
7790472 i listened to the nlcr everything about them appealed to me their style their singing their sound their songs ran the gamut in styles everything from mountain ballads to fiddle tunes and railroad blues all their songs vibrated with some dizzy portentous truth i couldnt listen to them enough
7790473 f reedom of speech is being able to speak freely without censorship
7790474 so den tell me woil oi was clappin moi hands how many of yer family doid
7790475 matts our new litigator and joans our office manager shes been at sturgess mccarter longer than i have shes part of the furniture
7790476 the museum and art gallery dyou know where that is
7790477 ive even been in there once or twice sir the kids and missus like it didnt trade in my life for the taxi license
7790478 its a good place isnt it full of interesting things
7790479 i just meant i dont know the name of the road thats all
7790480 white wine doesnt stain like red does theyre not allowed to serve red in case the guests start splashing it over the works on the walls like crazy abstract expressionists
7790481 isnt that kind of unlikely in twenty first century cheltenham of all places
7790482 risk managers would probably say their job is the art of the unlikely
7790483 still i dont like white very much its always too sweet or too sharp isnt it although this isnt too bad
7790484 well just stay for a couple of drinks ive booked our table for eight thirty in any case
7790485 shes my best life model stacy she has this er stillness its quite breathtaking
7790486 as often as my wife will allow she doesnt like my nudes very much for some reason
7790487 why is it that some men think that theyre such a hit with the ladies when theyre so obviously not
7790488 are you trying to tell me something by any chance
7790489 i dont think youve got arrogance issues probably quite the opposite in fact
7790490 i have every reason to be its hardly been a vintage few years im just going to get us two more glasses of wine
7790491 here we are wed better find another taxi quite soon and get up to birdlip
7790492 perhaps theyre expressions of his desire to deflower fresh young things
7790493 theyre quite painterly hes certainly got technique hes well trained
7790494 technical abilitys probably at the bottom of the pecking order in the sort of contemporary art that makes it on the international market its all about the idea these days the notion the angle
7790495 perhaps im a traditionalist but i like paintings that look like paintings
7790496 i think wed better eat something im beginning to feel a little sloshed
7790497 its necessary to unwind after a long week at work though isnt it not that id know about long weeks as such any more hows your work going at the moment by the way
7790498 christ were not going to spend the evening talking about the law and office politics are we
7790499 i just thought id better ask i only need the potted version
7790500 oh its all fine it is what it is im working on one or two interesting cases at the moment family stuff
7790501 very much the latter they only come my way when theres been a divorce or a death
7790502 it was very nice of you to buy me supper
7790503 im still forty five actually if you dont mind excuse me can we get a glass of still water here please plenty of ice
7790504 nothing i cant handle im just not used to female attention i only ever get weird menopausal women staring at me on the tube
7790505 how dyou guess something like that i dont have the teeth or the lines i hope
7790506 you certainly dont youre a stunner as the tabloids would say
7790507 this is a methamphetamine and firearms case that arose from a traffic stop made by an aurora police officer
7790508 firearms and methamphetamine were seized and a number of individuals are in state custody the matter continues to be under investigation well provide more information as it becomes available
7790509 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7790510 there was a real opportunity missed there to hear from somebody who really understood what it was like to fight for the powerless that was his life i want to speak to some of those same concerns he had
7790511 youve got to be economical with your words though and the longer youre in the senate the more long winded you get
7790512 people dont know his story weve got to show them his heart his story of overcoming obstacles
7790513 i think because hes so eloquent and graceful people dont know he had to struggle
7790514 senators from both parties will tell you that hes always been willing to listen to other points of view
7790515 thanks for taking my calls when you knew i was calling to ask for money
7790516 youll always be my hero because you were willing to take on santorum
7790517 bund wie l ndern sind im grundgesetz unmissverst ndlich ihre verantwortungen zugeschrieben
7790518 es muss endlich schluss sein den f deralismus zu missbrauchen um bildungspolitisches versagen zu verstecken
7790519 der vbe erwartet vom bildungsgipfel konkrete beschl sse statt freundlicher appelle
7790520 dass sich bund und l nder endlich auf eine nationale bildungsstrategie einigen um mit vereinten kr ften den gesamten bildungsbereich vom kindergarten bis zur hochschule finanziell und inhaltlich zu pushen soziale benachteiligungen m ssen von anfang an aufgefangen werden k nnen
7790521 zweitens muss auf den tisch des bildungsgipfels das thema bildungsinvestition
7790522 der investitionsbegriff muss zugunsten von bildung modernisiert werden deshalb dringt der vbe auf eine nderung des grundgesetzartikels 115
7790523 ein klares wort in dieser sache w rde die finanzierung von bildung durch bund und l nder auf eine solidere basis stellen
7790524 drittens stehen die ministerpr sidenten in der pflicht endlich daf r zu sorgen dass die durch sch lerr ckgang frei werdenden mittel im bildungssystem verbleiben
7790525 unserer gemeinsamen erkl rung vom oktober 2006 siehe anhang die individuelle f rderung jedes sch lers zum prinzip jeder schule zu machen folgte das schweigen der ministerpr sidenten
7790526 wenn die bundeskanzlerin jetzt zu einer bildungsreise aufbricht darf es nicht nur um vorzeigeprojekte gehen das deutsche bildungssystem braucht dringend durchgreifende reformen eine sch nwettertour ist deshalb unangebracht
7790527 der erste tag der offenen t r der politischen kommunikation war f r den vbe bundesverband ein voller erfolg
7790528 die gespr che drehten sich vor allem um die integration von migranten die zusammenarbeit von

7790530 allaient tirer sur obama depuis une position tr s favorable avec un fusil une distance de 750 yards
7790531 nous avons t inform s de cette question ce soir par les services de police daurora les agences f d rales travaillent main dans la main avec la police de aurora comme le cas fait encore lobjet dinvestigations il ny a pas grand chose que nous puissions dire ce stade
7790532 nous pouvons dire ceci nous sommes absolument confiants dans le fait quil ny a pas de menace cr dible contre le candidat la convention d mocrate ou la population du colorado
7790533 it would end up being very expensive and removal could take years
7790534 an unsafe agency for children in violation of the federal constitutional and statutory rights of abused neglected and dependent children
7790535 they have the audacity to claim theyre riding to the rescue when really theyre riding in the ambulance
7790536 this is obviously coming on the heels of a suit from the same firm with regard to danieal kelly this kind of nonsense has to stop they should be embarrassed
7790537 is in a crisis and as a result innocent children are dying being neglected and abused around the clock
7790538 is this firm in this for change of dhs or for cash
7790539 this suit takes energy from an agency dhs that is already trying to fix what it knows is broken
7790540 the kindest thing i can say about these lawyers is that i dont understand what they are doing or why
7790541 we are concerned about them especially in the area of meeting face to face with children every month they have yet to meet their deadline in that area
7790542 the lawyers seem to be unfamiliar with this field of practice according to their biographies
7790543 my organization has brought most of the class action litigation around the country and i havent heard from these people
7790544 there was a blue ribbon panel and new leadership brought in all working to implement reform so the things that would happen after such a lawsuit are already under way
7790545 the fear is given our track record that the sailing will not be so smooth
7790546 we may return to the hoary days of the past which discredited the political class as a whole and prepared the ground for an extra constitutional intervention
7790547 this is a threat that looms over our heads permanently
7790548 beside a worsening of the economic situation the political instability could encourage the
7790549 reminding us how much we share and how alike we really are
7790550 you see barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is
7790551 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7790552 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
7790553 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7790554 and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7790555 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7790556 inspires me the way people tell me my father inspired them
7790557 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7790558 and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
7790559 those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7790560 seldom has an emerging leader so matched the needs of the moment
7790561 if you care about hillary youve got to work for sen obama
7790562 do we really want four more years of the same old tune

7790571 there are 160 men in state prisons that are able to come home but they cant because they dont have anywhere to go
7790572 ultimately we need to find more homes for them in lancaster county
7790573 the decision of the borough is that may means may or may not
7790574 in this case the zoning officer decided that may means may not
7790575 we really need to get our arms around the issue so were looking at what really impacts public safety not what makes us feel better
7790576 its like putting 10 overweight people in a grocery store and saying dont go near the doughnuts
7790577 i dont lock my doors i dont lock my cars we dont have to but hes making it that kind of place and that bothers me
7790578 why cant they find an older home in lancaster county farmland rehab it grow tomatoes whatever
7790579 would they rather have me living on my own in an isolated area or in a mentored faith based home where im being monitored
7790580 ive paid my debt but society keeps footing the bill how is that beneficial for anyone
7790581 i want to become a part of the community and help the community

7790585 we want people to be able to stop in and spend some time here thats our ultimate goal

7790623 if the incident had been reversed and it had been an atheist that had physically assaulted a theist for postering for a theist event that would easily be considered a hate crime and it frequently is this is the exact reverse scenario
7790624 they are treating it not as a hate crime but as a dispute that arose and led to an altercation
7790625 we dont have anything that suggests that as far as im aware of i know mr trottier was talking about that but certainly from what i see it doesnt look like it falls within what our policies and procedures define as a hate crime
7790626 but were still looking at that as well to cover all the bases
7790627 the first individual smacked me in the face twice and said
7790628 atheists have never been accorded the same respect as those with religious beliefs even though our position originates in logic and reason not myth and superstition this escalation of a systemic although till now hidden discrimination is very troubling
7790629 i think i discovered the hard way the boundaries of freedom of speech
7790630 the fact that an atheist should fear for his well being while advertising for a university event that seeks to promote free inquiry is alarming and though i feared for my life briefly ive never felt as strong about my atheism my colleagues and i have only strengthened our resolve to forge ahead with our agenda to push for secularism science and freedom of thought
7790631 you can turn me over i am done on this side
7790632 love your enemies do good to those who hate and persecute you
7790633 if a man slaps you on one cheek offer the other as well
7790634 if a man should take your shoes offer him your coat as well
7790635 love your enemies do good to those who hate and persecute you
7790636 if a man slaps you on one cheek offer the other as well
7790637 if a man should take your shoes offer him your coat as well

7790640 if this case is not a hate crime then what is a hate crime
7790641 if you shout racial epithets and if you break someones face based on their ethnicity it is a hate crime
7790642 the victim received pro bono representation through clarence dyer south asian bar association are advocating for the community
7790643 it is not only the asian not only the south asian but any community is hurt by this crime
7790644 it is not a crime against an individual but against the entire community at large
7790645 this will have terrible and drastic repercussions to hate crimes the community will be discouraged from reporting crimes because they cant find justice
7790646 the community becomes very vulnerable in being attacked because perpetrators wont be seriously treated by the law
7790647 i am sympathetic to people having issues but if they are incapable to restrain themselves they should not be out in the community they are a danger to society

7790667 while much has been said of the timing and the scoop by news outlets obamas v p text message still ranks as one of the most important text messages even sent and one of the most successful brand engagements using mobile media
7790668 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7790669 and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
7790670 because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7790671 our party and our country has been strengthened by her candidacy
7790672 barack obama will close the book on the old politics of race and gender of group against group and of straight against gay
7790673 and barack obama will be a commander in chief who understands that young americans in uniform must never be committed to a mistake but always to a mission worthy of their bravery
7790674 we thought he was joking and his wife came over and she was crying and thats when it sunk in
7790675 we were totally devastated it was so upsetting we were in shock
7790676 we had to break it to his parents they were really upset they said as long as we have pictures but it doesnt have the same effect

7790682 ik had de overstap naar ldd al lang overwogen maar het vertrek van regiogenoot en limburgs vlaams belang boegbeeld john vrancken bevestigde nogmaals mijn vertrouwen in mijn keuze voor ldd
7790683 ik weet nu al dat men bij het vb met de wildste indianenverhalen zal komen over het hoe en het waarom van mijn overstap maar dat zal niet meer zijn dan het zoveelste natrappen bij de zoveelste overstap zoals ook bij john ook het geval was ik denk dat men bij het vb stilaan niet meer weet van welk hout pijlen maken nu meer en meer mensen resoluut de kaart van het gezond verstand willen trekken in limburg het vlaams belang heeft zijn pijlen verschoten en smijt dan maar met modder om het eigen falen te vergoelijken
7790684 de misnoegdheid over de interne werking van het vlaams belang limburg de aanhoudende ideologische radicalisering van de partij maar vooral de verwaarlozing van de inspraak van de lokale mandatarissen het is een greep uit de redenen die smeets aanzetten tot zijn overstap naar ldd

7790689 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7790690 clearly we found there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified them
7790691 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7790692 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7790693 he jumped out of the window and landed on an awning

7790701 were very excited to be handling the sale of this retrospective sketch of jack vettrianos the singing butler on behalf of the university of st andrews

7790703 it leaves me cold i dont trust these carelines any more than i trust the concept that you can have a one stop shop i want to see the wardens retained
7790704 i had 40 stitches in my head and my leg in a frame the warden used to call in and make sure i was all right
7790705 i would still like her to be here and i dont think we should be without a warden
7790706 its not viable to have a scheme manager just looking after 19 people because the cost of that manager is met by the tenants
7790707 homes in sedgemoor like all other providers have moved away from scheme managers looking after one scheme to looking after groups of schemes
7790708 these people are living independently and they have that reassurance of an intercom call or the visit five days a week

7790717 i think that i had very positive campaign last season it would be a dream that becomes reality to win it not any player has done what i did last season i believe i can win it this year
7790718 at this very special moment for me i really want to send a message to the chelsea fans who in the past two years have always made me feel their support a heartfelt thank you for that
7790719 i would like to thank chelsea football club the fans staff players and management for all the support you gave me during my time at the club i would also like to express my gratitude to roman abramovich for all his help and encouragement
7790720 it was unfortunate i suffered a number of injuries during my time here but i always gave my all whatever the circumstances i really have enjoyed playing in england and have made many friendships that will stay with me forever i will always look back with fond memories of my time at this really great club thank you

7790738 if we had won one of our away games and done what we have done away from home we would have had a brilliant start
7790739 but ive told the lads if they keep doing what they did in the second half that win will soon come
7790740 in the first 25 minutes or so they could really have put the game beyond us
7790741 but there were a few raised voices and changes in personnel at half time and anybody here in the second half would have had to agree that there was only one team in it and we deserved the point

7790782 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7790783 an open time limit is not acceptable in any security deal that governs the presence of the international forces

7790786 i knew it wasnt an engine problem there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft it was incredibly cold
7790787 the next thing the oxygen masks were dropping my highest priority was to get a mask on to my son who was sitting next to me in a bemused and frightened state we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft as we landed we saw fire engines every quarter of a mile down the runway
7790788 mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons
7790789 from where i was sitting i could see about 20 masks and only a few of them were inflating
7790790 it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
7790791 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
7790792 the first thing we do in these situations is divert to safety take the safety first option
7790793 we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew also deploy their oxygen masks they cant be making passenger pa announcements when they have their oxygen masks on as the passengers confirmed the pilot did make an announcement once he got down to 8 000ft where it is safe to take the oxygen masks off that they were diverting to limoges
7790794 ryanair confirms that the fr9336 from bristol airport to barcelona girona airport on the evening of august 25 experienced an inflight depressurisation incident which caused the oxygen masks on board to deploy all 168 passengers disembarked safely upon landing a total of 16 passengers together with five accompanying family members have transferred at their request to a local hospital complaining of earache

7790865 didgeridoo virtuoso william barton has played a leading role in bringing his instrument into the arena of western concert music and major australian composers like peter sculthorpe and ross edwards have written for it his touring schedule sounds like that of a major international soloist with appearances with the london philharmonic and at the venice biennale and the aldeburgh festival composer sean oboyle shares credit with writing his concerto for didgeridoo with barton who supplied much of the basic musical material for it the concerto is a pleasant piece and while its not strong on substance it does provide barton with a terrific opportunity to show off his formidable talent oboyle wrote his riversymphony for brisbanes riverfestival so its essentially civic music in his program notes the composer writes that the music is intended to symbolize all the rivers of the world and for such an ambitious effort he enlists a symphony orchestra brass band symphonic choir and two soprano soloists the result is embarrassingly trite for the most part it sounds like mediocre or bad movie music and when the wordless chorus enters the effect is reminiscent of a kitschy disney score from the 1940s or 1950s the composer leads the queensland symphony in spirited readings of both pieces
7790866 gordon brown has privately predicted that it the economy could soon turn a corner and start to recover
7790867 we have selected 10 spots in the city where these services will be made available for around 2 000 customers of the rs 750 plan within two km of the 10 bts that are 3g enabled customers will be able to access 3g services there will be no additional cost for the time being as we are in the trail period customers will be able to access 3g services at 2g rates
7790868 we have been asked to design the equipment for 20 per cent of the customer base
7790869 the cost of the services will depend upon the auction of the spectrum the number of people opting for 3g services will also matter but it will still be expensive if the spectrum is auctioned at a high price
7790870 in the apec countries the costs are over 20 30 per cent higher than 2g services
7790871 the most flexible and efficient messaging experience on the market
7790872 frankly the rapidly increasing scarcity of great 19th century rugs
7790873 combined with our clienteles escalating knowledge and the ability to view and purchase one in the world investment level rugs on our website have created a unique confluence of factors during my nearly 30 years in the business
7790874 collectible to museum level rugs that are both rare works of art and still in the superb condition that they can be used on the owners residences
7790875 potential clients who have been drawn to great antique rugs over the last three decades often come to him with a seasoned eye and a great hunger in drought like conditions in the international market
7790876 many clients continue to purchase spectacular pieces more than they could possibly display in their homes and either ask us to store them or are putting them into private museums we often revolve clients rugs over periods of time at one or more of their residences
7790877 our clients soon discover that the quality of carpets we consistently offer is virtually never found elsewhere and when they occasionally do appear at auction they often sell for prices that exceed the established market value
7790878 the 100 to 200 year old rugs in our collection can never be duplicated such as handmade area rugs silk rugs persian rugs oriental rugs wool rugs etc they were created at time when the artistic sensitivity of the weavers and their craftsmanship were unmatched
7790879 in that sense rug collectors view their pieces in the manner that a collector of paintings views a monet or van gogh
7790880 additionally the market for rugs of this quality does not fluctuate depending on external economic conditions
7790881 the intrinsic value of this kind of art and its one of a kind quality separates it from other kinds of investments
7790882 there appears to have been a significant amount of investment money on the sidelines
7790883 the collection with its extensive inventory of top 19th century carpets has allowed our clients to diversify as well as enjoy their investments
7790884 i would say to myself i cant move i was so tired from the day before
7790885 our band members have to be conditioned to all kinds of different time zones so to combat the jetlag we make sure they are ok to get out of bed after midnight and be able to perform when asked
7790886 making the band is sometimes harder than making the football team
7790887 to this day we follow the path the founders have set for us
7790888 when students tryout for the band they are not allowed to have dreadlocks beards or jewelry the band is here for one purpose to raise future leaders of this country
7790889 it was tough because this was during the civil rights movement and many other blacks labeled us as tokens

7790901 leider einmal mehr wurde best tigt was ich schon vor wochen gesagt habe werner faymann verkauft f r seinen eigenen vorteil kalt l chelnd die eigene gro mutter
7790902 ich nehme zur kenntnis dass faymann den sterreichischen arbeitnehmerinnen und arbeitnehmern und dem mittelstand die kalte schulter zeigt denn ihnen h tte der gro teil der gemeinsam f r das jahr 2010 vereinbarten steuerreform zugute kommen sollen dank faymanns wortbruch und seinen vollmundigen versprechen bliebe jedoch kein geld mehr daf r
7790903 ein l cheln f llt weder staatskassen noch tilgt es schulden
7790904 handschlagsqualit t verl sslichkeit und stabilit t sind f r faymann offensichtlich ebenso politische fremdworte wie entgegen seinen behauptungen soziale treffsicherheit
7790905 dank wissenschaftsminister gio hahn verf gen wir ber ein stipendien system dass es auch sozial schw cheren erm glicht an den heimischen universit ten zu studieren seit einf hrung der studiengeb hren ist die zahl der studenten sogar um 38 prozent gestiegen mit der abschaffung der studiengeb hren gef hrdet faymann das sterreichische bildungssystem und setzt die zukunft unserer jugend aufs spiel die hat das doppelb dige spiel der sp jedoch l ngst durchschaut
7790906 faymanns ank ndigung die mehrwertsteuer auf lebensmittel zu halbieren ist ein undurchdachter populistischer h ftschuss der in den menschen erwartungen weckt die faymann schon gar nicht erf llen kann
7790907 die halbierung der mehrwertsteuer auf lebensmittel ist nicht sozial sondern eine gie kanne die zwischen arm und reich nicht unterscheidet
7790908 faymann riskiert f r schlagzeilen die steuerreform 2010 die die menschen zielgerichtet und nachhaltig entlastet vor allem die geringeren einkommen
7790909 was macht faymann mit den 10 mehrwertsteuersatz f r die privaten mieten sowie die beherbergung im tourismus werden mieten und beherbergung jetzt auf 20 angehoben

7790911 during our recent meeting grasims management said it expects a rise in the northern markets share of its volumes from the current 30 to 40 by end fy09 after capacity expansion at shambupura is complete the ongoing expansions would increase grasims consolidated cement production capacity to nearly 50mtpa including subsidiaries besides we expect pricing power erosion in the northern power to be modest compared to that in the south in our view the stocks current valuation a 25 discount to replacement cost of usd 140 per tonne does not do justice to its strength in the business
7790912 infosyss acquisition of axon highlights its need to introduce non linearity to counter the slowdown in organic growth it is also an attempt at giving a boost to its small consulting business to compete with mncs accenture cap gemini ibm etc
7790913 in our view the proposed purchase price of usd 753 million 2xrevenues 17xcy2008e is reasonable for acquiring a credible sap presence and broadening its geography vertical spread now the key challenge for infosys will be to manage any conflicts arising out of differences in compensation ideologies and work culture of employees given the discretionary nature of erp implementations these risks might be amplified by global headwinds for fy09 10 we expect the acquisition to be earnings neutral reduce 12 months target price rs 1710
7790914 the party is meeting this morning to look at our position in parliament and whether we are participating or not

7790920 the easiest way to restore normalcy is for prime minister samak to quit
7790921 if we do not receive a clear and positive response we will prolong the rally to the next day and mobilise more protesters
7790922 wait for the prime minister so far there is no special instruction
7790923 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7790924 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7790925 that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7790926 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and me our country will be committed to his cause
7790927 the work will begin anew the hope will rise again and the dream lives on
7790928 let there be no mistake about it we are united
7790929 hillary wants us to support obama the same we supported her and thats what we are going to do
7790930 das w rde passen der aurelius chef war schlie lich der gr nder von arques
7790931 were monitoring the track of gustav and reviewing our destructive weather plans and procedures
7790932 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7790933 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7790934 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7790935 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7790936 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7790937 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7790938 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7790939 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7790940 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7790941 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7790942 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7790943 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7790944 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7790945 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7790946 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7790947 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7790948 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7790949 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7790950 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7790951 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7790952 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7790953 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

7790962 we have a lot of work ahead to do that and obviously its a complicated time but its always complicated out here
7790963 construction in the settlements has increased by a factor of 1 8 by comparison to the same period last year
7790964 the housing ministry initiated 433 new housing units during the period of january to may 2008 compared to just 240 units during the period january to may 2007
7790965 the fear is given our track record that the sailing will not be so smooth
7790966 we may return to the hoary days of the past which discredited the political class as a whole and prepared the ground for an extra constitutional intervention
7790967 this is a threat that looms over our heads permanently

7790972 it is not righteousness that you fast while on journey
7790973 that refers to the old person who is not able to fast he must feed a poor person a half saa two handfuls of grains for everyday missed

7791001 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7791002 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

7791008 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7791009 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7791010 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7791011 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7791012 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7791013 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7791014 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7791015 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7791016 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7791017 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7791018 this is a big change in blubber and if it continues it could make it more difficult for the whales to survive it indicates there have been some big changes in their ecosystem
7791019 i dont think you could measure this by other non lethal means
7791020 this is the first time a long term decline in energy storage in minke whales has been demonstrated
7791021 explosive harpoons and a large calibre rifle in the event that death was not instantaneous
7791022 lots of dead bodies will provide robust data so if you kill lots of whales then you will be able to get some information the question is whether the benefits outweigh the number of whales killed and how they were killed scientific whaling is not about science and there is no pressing conservation need that requires it to be done
7791023 journals need to think very carefully about information that comes from this source different journals have different ethical standards

7791036 in summe deckt die verkehrsbeeinflussungsanlage einen bereich von 92 autobahn kilometern rund um graz ab
7791037 bundesminister werner faymann hat mit seiner zusage zur vba steiermark gro es verst ndnis f r die feinstaubsituation vor allem im gro raum graz gezeigt und hat sein versprechen zu 100 eingehalten damit ist die steiermark ab 15 dezember 2008 das erste bundesland mit einer feinstaub abh ngigen ganzj hrigen geschwindigkeitsreduktion auf autobahnen ein meilenstein in unserem programm zur reduktion der feinstaubbelastung
7791038 die umsetzung des algorithmus erfolgt in zwei modulen mit unterschiedlichen entscheidungskriterien im ersten modul wird berpr ft ob die gemessene schadstoffbelastung ber einem bestimmten schwellenwert liegt beziehungsweise in naher zukunft liegen wird im zweiten modul wird der aktuelle beitrag der pkw emissionen zur feinstaubbelastung berechnet dadurch wird die reduzierte geschwindigkeits begrenzung ausschlie lich zu zeiten mit hoher ma nahmenwirksamkeit aktiviert

7791044 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7791045 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7791046 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7791047 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7791048 who are open to doing something on the production side
7791049 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7791050 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7791051 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7791052 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7791053 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7791054 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7791055 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7791056 the doctor told me to take off two weeks i guess hes not going to like that i didnt listen
7791057 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7791058 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7791059 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7791060 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7791061 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7791062 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7791063 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7791064 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7791065 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7791066 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7791067 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7791068 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7791069 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7791070 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7791071 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7791072 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7791073 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7791074 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7791075 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7791076 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7791077 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7791078 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7791079 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7791080 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7791081 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7791082 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7791083 i expect the global slowdown will continue and affect germany significantly more than has been reflected in forecasts up to now
7791084 the story sucks theres nothing but eye candy and special effects
7791085 thats what lucas should have done why didn t he do it this way
7791086 it is the first of the many more steps that will ready indian companies for offering transformational services
7791087 we expect such trend to continue and we believe the transaction by infosys would act as a catalyst for similar moves by other indian it companies
7791088 two worlds was a phenomenal hit back when it was first released and even now the massive open world is continually growing in popularity
7791089 i cannot afford to return the 400 acres if that land has to be returned then tata motors project has to be dropped i cannot allow this to happen
7791090 i am not an egoist we are ready to formulate a package for those affected by the project

7791099 we have seen many times how such truce deals in the past have been broken by militants who use them primarily to re group
7791100 when we have not registered the movement with the government then how it can impose a ban we have registered it with allah almighty and we will continue to struggle for the imposition of sharia whatever ban the government imposes on us
7791101 is as keen to fight against terrorism as musharraf was
7791102 they just changed their names and started operating under different names
7791103 musharraf and zardari try to create an impression of co operating with the u s without actually doing so
7791104 they try to create a cosmetic effect through seemingly bold statements formal bans etc

7791117 the fear is given our track record that the sailing will not be so smooth
7791118 we may return to the hoary days of the past which discredited the political class as a whole and prepared the ground for an extra constitutional intervention
7791119 this is a threat that looms over our heads permanently
7791120 beside a worsening of the economic situation the political instability could encourage the taliban to step up their war on pakistan
7791121 this extremist phenomenon exists in many arabo muslim countries in many countries in the muslim world in general
7791122 you cant call what has happened here a real terrorist threat
7791123 sure there are young people who were in al qaeda but they are isolated cases maybe 20 people who travelled abroad to fight for al qaeda
7791124 but i think in mauritania it isnt on a big scale
7791125 the forces of defence and security have done everything to end it and they are still working
7791126 what we can guarantee is that we will not spare any effort to eradicate this evil
7791127 its true that the armed struggle isnt the only effective way of dealing with this we also have to find the roots of all these problems that are developing and to treat them too in other ways
7791128 when he was elected he released a lot of prisoners who he wrongly believed were falsely imprisoned and he and his prime minister said terrorism did not exist
7791129 so the security forces went to sleep and we all saw what happened
7791130 general abdelaziz in fact the two generals who led the putsch were in charge of destroying al qaeda theyre seen as enemies of al qaeda so its possible there could be more attacks
7791131 but i think we could finally get a really essential thing something we have never had a real strategy for fighting against terrorism
7791132 green is in his last year as a wolf pack and i expect him to lay it on the line and play the best football hes ever played

7791139 i think what we have here is like the gold rush
7791140 people went out and mined some did well many did not the people who did do well were those who sold blue jeans picks and axes
7791141 anton is up today for a medical and we hope to get that tied up today
7791142 i met him last week and it went well he will be a good addition to our squad and it will keep people on their toes
7791143 hes had a slight hamstring strain so it would be unfair to throw him straight in
7791144 there is an international break coming up so it would give him a chance to train with us for two weeks
7791145 im going to go home and spends some time with my family ill sit down with them and talk about it
7791146 ill also sit down with terry edwards and see what he has to say and what offer there is on the table
7791147 to win another gold medal in my home city in 2012 would be fantastic thats what i want to do
7791148 it will be hard to say no to 1million but im going to see what terry says
7791149 there are a lot of rewards out there for professionals i could become middleweight champion of the world
7791150 its going to be a difficult decision but its not just about money its a feeling too
7791151 representing your country and standing on a podium with a medal is an unbelievable feeling
7791152 i say get in the gym get in the gym because it gives you lots of discipline boxing has made me a better person
7791153 get in the gym all those little kids all the little teenagers that want to be naughty get in the gym
7791154 decisions are made that at the time might offend some people and benefit others but they are done for the good of all
7791155 i dont feel bitterness towards anyone and much less towards the club or the coach

7791160 september 13 the birthday of the childrens author has been decreed roald dahl day and lots of celebrations are planned
7791161 he followed the rules as far as recess appointment goes
7791162 it seems that this recess appointment is a futile attempt to undermine the decision of the senate because this specific appointment was not confirmed by the senate on two occasions
7791163 he wanted to help the students it was good intentions but it was against the rules and that cant keep going i would hope all the branches continue to check and balance each other
7791164 glick was put in a very difficult position with this but as of june 30 i am unemployed i have no idea as to what im going to do

7791180 we cant wait for the legislature to adjourn in the spring to find out there was a big budget reduction because of the near recession in the nevada economy and then just start slashing at that point
7791181 were trying to look very closely at our small enrollment programs and some of our ancillary activities that arent really at where our mission is
7791182 if we are going through a 14 percent cut then we are going to make the very best of the 86 percent we have left
7791183 we cant have the conversation until the faculty and students are back on campus
7791184 we are going to do whatever we can whether through course substitutions or course extensions to make sure students who are close to finishing the program can graduate
7791185 theres a limit to that of course if someone started that major 10 years ago and has just been slow to finish we cannot guarantee that to them forever
7791186 i think the fraternities and the sororities will continue to operate much as they have in the past

7791189 i think that it is no secret and ive said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think the settlement activity is helpful to the process
7791190 what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7791191 in the end of the day the role of the leaders is to try to find a way to live in peace in the future and not to let any kind of noises that relate to the situation on the ground these days to enter the negotiation room

7791201 coach gardner did an amazing job with our softball program

7791208 the middle east is one of bhels key export regions and one of the fastest growing markets for power generating equipment globally
7791209 it is an easy opener for us the fact that nobody gives us a chance and does not expect us to beat chiefs takes the pressure off us the bottom line is we have nothing to lose and can go out against chiefs and play our normal game
7791210 we have learnt some valuable lessons from the last season we had no pre season training we took charge with seven days before the new season kicked off and inherited a lot of players some of whom lacked psl experience and others who were at the end of their careers
7791211 it was not easy trying to put the side together but we are not looking for excuses we survived thanks to thanda having an exceptional technical team that believed in the club and now we are targeting a top eight finish at the end of this season
7791212 we have had a good pre season and are ready for action we are really pleased with the progress in the pre season and look forward to the new season with confidence
7791213 chiefs have a budget 200 million times bigger than ours and that should ensure they beat smaller teams like us thats the way it works in europe but i have been surprised to see that big money does not necessarily mean success in the psl just look at how chiefs orlando pirates and mamelodi sundowns struggled despite their wealth last term
7791214 we know what to expect having seen so much of chiefs in the last six weeks so we are ready
7791215 he is now well and truly back on the rails and has plenty of experience to help us
7791216 i expect that the russian president wont sign the resolution
7791217 the north atlantic alliance not russia is the one more interested in our cooperation
7791218 if they cease this cooperation nothing terrible will happen to us were prepared to make any decision up to breaking relations with nato completely
7791219 nato russia relations will need to take fully into account the implications of russian military actions in georgia however we believe it would be a mistake to suspend all nato russia contacts when they are so much needed
7791220 for some time now russians have been wondering if our opinion counts for nothing in those institutions do we really need them just to sit at the nicely set dinner table and listen to lectures
7791221 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honour our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic

7791227 i dont have any sense that this will somehow lead to a cure for pws but it does present a new area for those interested in the disease to study and hopefully a new understanding of how the disease functions
7791228 we dont understand the purpose of sleep but it must be important because all animals do it
7791229 the very fact that dolphins have developed the remarkable specialization rather than merely getting rid of sleep altogether should count as evidence that sleep must serve some essential function and cannot be eliminated
7791230 sleep may be the price you pay so your brain can be plastic the next day
7791231 while there may still be no consensus on why animals need to sleep it would seem that searching for a core function of sleep particularly at the cellular level is still a worthwhile exercise
7791232 although the major mechanism of bluetongue virus spread is undoubtedly that of culicoides midges feeding on infected ruminants growing the virus and then transmitting it to further susceptible animals other mechanisms may also be at work these may assume greater importance during the midge free season winter such as we in northern latitudes experience
7791233 experiments have revealed a toolbox of possible mechanisms with the potential to interact with and complement one another

7791239 this far reaching program will position us well for the next stage of our growth and development
7791240 people dont understand how much these guys could actually make
7791241 the potential is simply huge now particularly because we have the olympics on our doorstep big brands are going to be falling over themselves because these people are such good ambassadors for their sports and we are going to be obsessed with the olympics for four years
7791242 it will be exciting and fun but youve got to get the balance right
7791243 in about a months time ill be getting back in the pool at 5am every morning youve got to get your head down
7791244 its about planning it and not taking the quick buck
7791245 its about building a brand their own brand once youve won a gold medal no one can take it away from you that gives you the potential to become both respected and wealthy
7791246 its the pinnacle of four years of hard work and momentum which sees a lot of adrenalin and emotions build up
7791247 athletes will need to deal with success or adversity so there is a shift in mood state which can last for several weeks
7791248 im not going to make a living out of kayaking in the long term and its important that i have a career that is challenging and fulfilling
7791249 im hoping to do corporate work rather than being at sea they have been very supportive

7791360 i learned something from moss just going up jumping over guys and making plays
7791361 it was my first touchdown in gillette stadium i was real excited about that it gave me a lot of confidence to go out there and show that i can make plays and help this offense progress
7791362 its the last chance to pretty much show what you got
7791363 most of the starters are probably not going to play most of the primary guys the big name guys are not going to play so its a big chance for me to go out there and show what more i can do

7791373 being from the state i know the history of the team and the sports history in all of new england when they gave me the opportunity i was grateful i have a week to show them what i can do hopefully i can play well enough and use what i did in the past and give me a chance to stick around and try to win a championship

7791482 scherzi in questo mondo dove la tifoseria gi ti attacca mogli e fidanzate figurati se uno si dichiara gay lo massacrano striscioni cori un inferno
7791483 comunque negli sport usa ci sono molti che hanno fatto coming out e sono stati accettati tranquillamente
7791484 verissimo per magari mi sbaglio ma la mia sensazione di non aver mai incontrato un calciatore gay
7791485 perch premier e liga hanno pi fascino della serie a
7791486 be dai il contorno la tifoseria gli stadi il modo di vivere il calcio l sono unaltra cosa
7791487 litalia paga lo scotto di una tassazione troppo sfavorevole i club di premier e liga pagano molte meno tasse e hanno un potere contrattuale troppo forte
7791488 la vera differenza con la premier che l non c un giornale che dia un voto vero gambero
7791489 io difficilmente guadagno lattenzione della stampa ed giusto cos le prime donne sono gli attaccanti gli adrian mutu gli jovetic il nostro nuovo fenomeno
7791490 be guarda che essere primedonne va considerato nel bene ma anche nel male
7791491 ma dai nellultima amichevole c stato uno di noi che stato una vergogna prima pagina questo giocatore da sballo gamberini per 90 minuti si fa il mazzo un difensore e non lo vede nessuno
7791492 prendete con leverton abbiamo fatto barricate per 120 ci siamo fatti un mazzo cos poi uno tocca un pallone e fa gol il titolo grande difesa no tizio trascina la fiorentina noi difensori ci mettiamo a ridere e amen
7791493 senza un po di incoscienza pure nel mondo dellimprenditoria certi traguardi non li raggiungi ma qui si trattava di salvare la squadra di una delle citt pi belle e famose del mondo poi c chi ci ha letto una scelta legata alla nostra azienda ma in realt i nostri prodotti di lusso hanno poco a che fare con il mass market del calcio
7791494 sfatiamo il mito non si guadagna un bel niente litalia ben diversa da inghilterra e spagna
7791495 molti la fiscalit troppo pesante c poca sensibilit verso i settori giovanili troppe barriere tra societ e tifosi questultimo aspetto proprio non lo capisco costa cos poco essere educati io e mio fratello cerchiamo di esserlo sempre limpronta che ci ha dato mio padre e a lui mio nonno la fiorentina una famiglia con 25 ragazzi credo di s con gli inevitabili problemi di tutte le famiglie
7791496 non mi do pace per questa cultura contrattuale ma come i contratti valgono dappertutto fuorch nel calcio non mentalit italiana europea si pensi al caso cristiano ronaldo a noi era gi successo con luca toni per gli sono bastati 5 minuti per capire e rinunciare ai tanti soldi che gli aveva promesso linter e io gli dico guadagna pi che puoi al bayern e poi torna da noi fra un paio danni
7791497 il patto con la citt chiaro la violenza lunico motivo per cui la famiglia della valle se ne va in 24 ore aspetto con ansia il giorno in cui potremo abbattere le barriere allo stadio mi piacerebbe fosse tra tre anni
7791498 that the problems i observed did not come from the idiosyncrasies of the people involved but from the systems that i created as the manager
7791499 like assigning a project team with two leaders giving neither the authority to make a decision that would conflict with the other i thought there was a personality conflict when it was my system drawing out the behavior if you want to make people really schizophrenic assign them to report to two different masters

7791505 i took the decision not to move to england i can tell you that the deal will definitely not go ahead
7791506 we were obliged to tell the player about interest from a leading english side

7791523 forged in the memory of united states air force staff sergeant christopher frost and all others who are called home before they leave the war
7791524 to put a permanent pc connection in a coffee shop and link it to internet
7791525 you dont even need a computer you can just go to a public library or you can go to an internet caf there is no control no regulation and no laws nobody is censoring the messages
7791526 you can sit in a coffee shop an internet caf in london use a server in south africa and send a message to north america without anybody being able to trace it
7791527 juveniles to enter or allowing unhealthy information to spread through internet followed by indian governments crackdown on net caf where the owners were asked
7791528 cyber cafes in pakistan will soon be made accountable as the government is all set to draft a law to regulate their activities
7791529 the state or quality of being secluded from the view and or presence of others
7791530 individuals are entitled to keep to themselves what they do online or offline unless some special situation like public interest in general demands otherwise in a civilized society no body has the right whatsoever to snoop over others
7791531 the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community against his will is to prevent harm to others
7791532 imagine what ordinary users do when they log on they check email and fire off replies chat surf some sites brows or play games what is there to be secretive or cautious about however cafes may be registered with some central authority seating arrangements in them should be open screen facing outwards this alone will clear so many doubts about the policy of any caf and will define the kind of crowd that gathers there
7791533 this is not the best way to track back miscreants any one up to some thing bad can sure outmanoeuvre such barriers big worry is that will any rule shift the onus of customers actions on caf owners or will we be made accomplice if and when something wrong happens
7791534 i am located near the university of the punjab hostels and my clients are mostly serious student who come here for preparing their assignments i try to provide them with an academic atmosphere in the cafe they search brows download documents and get required material printed or save it on their floppy disks for later use or they sit her and compose their assignments
7791535 i have some regular clients who can hardly read or write english but they have learnt to operate computers and internet what do you think they do online stop them and they will go find another cafe if the government has to ban pornographic sites isps should be regulated and not the net cafes
7791536 the scene in net cafes in multan is no different than any other city in the country some 70 to 80 per cent of the visitors come for entertainment whereas only 20 per cent visit for educational pursuits most of the visitors are male young boys in posh areas however female students are also seen visiting
7791537 i travel to different places all over the country in connection with my work and have to use net cafes to stay in constant touch with my company i use the nearest cyber caf where ever i happen to be i will revert back to telephone if some legal procedures are introduced to use the cafes
7791538 i do not want to get into legalities later on
7791539 i am neither geek nor nerd i am not a hacker a phreaker a programmer or any variety of technoid dweeb

7791566 the sultan who inherited the riches of an unbroken 600 year old muslim dynasty has had to cut back on his countrys oil production because of depleting reserves
7791567 we need to have greater clarity that this government is going to be around next year
7791568 if they break any law they will be dealt with accordingly
7791569 they shouted get out get out at us repeatedly all 150 of us were rounded up for a short while before police arrived and talked them down to the ground floor
7791570 the army will not launch a coup the people can be assured
7791571 the fear is given our track record that the sailing will not be so smooth
7791572 we may return to the hoary days of the past which discredited the political class as a whole and prepared the ground for an extra constitutional intervention
7791573 this is a threat that looms over our heads permanently
7791574 beside a worsening of the economic situation the political instability could encourage the taliban to step up their war on pakistan
7791575 er zijn 2 7 miljoen aansluitingen en 4 5 miljoen gezinnen er is dus nog potentieel

7791587 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7791588 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7791589 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7791590 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7791591 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7791592 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7791593 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7791594 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7791595 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7791596 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7791597 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7791598 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7791599 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7791600 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7791601 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7791602 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7791603 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7791604 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7791605 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7791606 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7791607 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7791608 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7791609 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7791610 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7791611 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7791612 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7791613 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7791614 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7791615 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7791616 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7791617 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7791618 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7791619 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7791620 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7791621 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7791622 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7791623 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7791624 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7791625 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7791626 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe

7791637 the fallout of the credit crisis will continue to dampen the global economy over the next 24 months with sharply escalated oil and food prices beginning to test inflation expectations
7791638 we recently concentrated on u s and uk primarily because we see value
7791639 the investment environment is expected to remain challenging with expectations of continued pressure on liquidity and possibly subdued trends in the equity markets
7791640 this may impact temaseks ability to divest its stake in various entities and manage its portfolio
7791641 i would think that both of them have gotten to the point where we feel confident we can win with both of them

7791647 we kind of deal with a spread offense every day
7791648 its an advantage practicing against the spread we feel well be ready for an up tempo pace
7791649 theyre solid theres really no weak spots and theyre a veteran team
7791650 its not like were opening up against somebody we can mess around and play awful and win

7791658 some bullying powers and their worthless followers of attempt to impose their will on the iranian nation
7791659 the president and the government have stood up to their excessive demands and moved forward
7791660 im willing to take this opportunity to express heartfelt thanks to all the countries including south korea and peoples that showed support to the beijing olympic games
7791661 the chinese people will unswervingly push forward the reform and opening up policy and continue to strive to comprehensively build a moderately well off society and accelerate the socialist modernization
7791662 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation

7791669 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7791670 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7791671 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7791672 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7791673 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7791674 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7791675 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7791676 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7791677 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7791678 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7791679 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7791680 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7791681 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7791682 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7791683 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7791684 oh my what a question really of course they wont stop asking until we can answer their questions

7791689 i have sympathies with many philosophies and i think itd be a mistake to be a follower of anything really
7791690 i just think any intelligent human being has to remain if you can objective i like the idea that everyones free to think what it is they think as long as it doesnt hurt anyone else
7791691 the media is a bigger animal than i ever will be it just becomes this soap opera and i guess i had a pretty good few episodes

7791715 i would say some people thought we were going to die
7791716 i knew it wasnt an engine problem there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft it was incredibly cold
7791717 it was obvious to me that there was depressurisation in the cabin but there was no announcement and no evidence of the cabin crew for most of this experience why on earth didnt they give a few more calming words to the passengers
7791718 the numbers are what they are and districts cant manipulate them
7791719 when youre telling people that everybody has to graduate in four years that sounds good in educational heaven
7791720 but here on earth there are a million and one circumstances that keep that from being realistic with some kids from poverty levels to moving around because of job loss
7791721 the graduation rate calculations are changing some schools are being forced to restructure under no child left behind then youve got the new more rigorous state curriculum in play its all crushing down on schools right now and its pretty critical to react
7791722 instead of asking if children have been left behind were asking are we leaving johnny behind
7791723 the new graduation numbers especially since they consistently track students are a great tool
7791724 but the solutions go beyond the numbers we need communities to continue the conversation to create real change
7791725 are you willing to tell citizens your positions on the issues you will most likely face on their behalf
7791726 weve gotta figure out how to get to the people
7791727 im gonna sign up for another tour of duty on this bond issue
7791728 but id really like other people to sign up with me

7791736 is this a remote control in your pocket or are you just happy to see me
7791737 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7791738 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7791739 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7791740 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7791741 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7791742 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7791743 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7791744 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7791745 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7791746 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7791747 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7791748 it leaves me cold i dont trust these carelines any more than i trust the concept that you can have a one stop shop i want to see the wardens retained
7791749 i had 40 stitches in my head and my leg in a frame the warden used to call in and make sure i was all right
7791750 i would still like her to be here and i dont think we should be without a warden
7791751 its not viable to have a scheme manager just looking after 19 people because the cost of that manager is met by the tenants
7791752 homes in sedgemoor like all other providers have moved away from scheme managers looking after one scheme to looking after groups of schemes
7791753 these people are living independently and they have that reassurance of an intercom call or the visit five days a week
7791754 heres a powerful and persuasive glimpse of the future you may not agree with every detail and recommendation but the overriding message is incredibly important cheap fossil fuel has made us the first humans with no practical need of neighbors that has to change for reasons ecological but also psychological the world on the other side of cheap oil may be a little less comfortable than the one we grew up in but it may also be much sweeter
7791755 in plan c pat murphy has not only shown us the life we should lead he has shown us the life we must lead if we are to survive on this planet
7791756 am i done with today and all of the shit that came with it yes i guess i am
7791757 people are tired of divisive political tactics and should not be bothered by robocalls
7791758 it is clear that junk foods and drinks gradually have replaced nutritious beverages and foods for many of our children
7791759 dentists have a saying snack and sip all day risk decay constantly bathing the teeth in sweetened beverages and unhealthy snacks is like providing an all you can eat buffet for the bacteria in your mouth the bacteria that cause tooth decay
7791760 its taking its affect on a lot of kids and im not seeing a lot of positives from it
7791761 its going to take some time to adjust to it
7791762 it really hurt us i really had to recruit just to get 12 guys
7791763 time will give everyone a chance to adjust to the changes
7791764 were looking for improvement from point a to point b
7791765 well need his leadership as we are a young team and we play a tough conference including defending state champions st joe as well as lakeview
7791766 with four promising freshman and newcomer blake kennedy who has teamed with adam koenig at doubles the beavers look to rebuild their program after graduating ten seniors last season
7791767 were returning a lot of experience plus a good group of incoming guys
7791768 the whole key to the year is everyone stepping up and taking it to another level
7791769 even our young players have a lot of tennis experience
7791770 i am excited about this season because we have quite a few returning players many of which are natural athletes
7791771 our toughest competitors look to be kalamazoo christian and hackett who we see in both the kva tournament and in the regional
7791772 our goal is to improve upon last years record with two to three solid wins in the kva we are also shooting to improve upon our regional performance from a year ago where we only grabbed four points
7791773 we should have the most wins at the bottom of our singles line up and in the middle of our doubles line up because this year we have a lot of athletic players who are close in ability our strong points are athletic ability and team unity
7791774 with a lot of returning players this year and several experienced freshman we should be a strong team
7791775 our goal is to try and finish second or third in our conference which is no easy feat when allegan otsego and plainwell
7791776 i dont know if we have any super strong areas but we do have some good no 3 and no 4 singles players and a good mix in our doubles area which should make us very competitive
7791777 our freshman will struggle some in doubles as they start to sync up with their partners as most of them are less experienced in doubles
7791778 im hoping the more experienced players will help pick up their game more quickly
7791779 around 700 800 houses have been damaged people are somehow managing to live on wooden logs and rooftops many rooftops are also damaged those people dont know where to go
7791780 no arrangements have been made we live here only near the river we drink its water when we feel thirsty even though people die because of this river
7791781 la verdad objetiva de los hechos vistos a traves de mi subjetivo cristal pero toda la verdad solo la verdad y nada mas que la verdad sin jurar sobre biblia alguna
7791782 some people do not appreciate that the very ethos of being indian is to accept different streams of thought faith caste and language
7791783 we should collectively ensure that any effort to create disharmony in society is not permitted let us collectively protect our social and communal harmony and isolate those who threaten it
7791784 an example of what can be achieved through the process of dialogue
7791785 i think we have another nuclear agreement in the queue ahead of that russian deal that were really focused on right now and thats the india civil nuclear agreement and thats generating a lot of work and time and energy on our part to get that done
7791786 we were able to work that through the iaea and now working with the nsg and trying to get that through nsg and eventually for presentation to our congress
7791787 with respect to our relationship across the board with russia were reviewing that and well think about it in terms of the mid term and the long term based on the choices that russia makes
7791788 i dont know some one sneezed in my direction i guess

7791793 teachers and classroom assistants welcome the additional help of volunteers as they often have busy workloads this is why rsvp volunteers are important as we are able to centre all our attention on any child who may need extra help
7791794 i am a great believer that learning should be fun at any age
7791795 it is so fulfilling to watch a child gain confidence in their work and their ability to achieve
7791796 as i was away from home for so long i was very lonely and eager to mix back into my local community and contribute in some way that is why i knew the schools project would be the right thing for me
7791797 wir sind berzeugt dass wir mit j rgen klinsmann den richtigen mann haben und dass wir auch den richtigen weg gehen

7791805 so are the opportunities for electronics makers content providers and consumers to get connected
7791806 consumers really arent driving the trend toward networked devices the device makers are
7791807 the companies are pushing this to try to build a new business to offer new services it is really a matter of getting the infrastructure in place
7791808 what this means for consumers is that some people may bring products home and discover that they cant communicate with others on their networks
7791809 we are just starting to see the first networked products roll out and a shakeout in standards is inevitable

7791818 as long as im governor of iowa ill be working with my friends in new hampshire to keep us first
7791819 we are pleased to invite the governor to visit the plant and to meet with our leadership and to see the truth firsthand
7791820 in such a meeting we would be delighted to hear the governors suggestions as to how we can further improve to fulfill the governors challenge to us
7791821 in addition to meeting with us the governor should meet with members of our community the mayor of postville with our happy employees and our supervisors and our compliance officers
7791822 agriprocessors fully subscribes to the governors call to begin to take the high road and join the family of responsible businesses in iowa since it wholeheartedly believes that it is doing precisely that
7791823 agriprocessors regrets that some of its employees may have used fraudulent documents to lie about their age
7791824 agriprocessors has been in contact with the iowa department of labor ever since it raised the issue early this year it repeatedly asked the department to advise it of underage workers who may have fraudulently presented documents to work at the plant
7791825 the department did its own audit in april and did not find any underage workers the company policy is clear no one under 18 may be employed at the plant when it did learn of several underage workers in the plant they were immediately dismissed
7791826 respectfully declines a visit to the postville facility at this time

7792091 you should understand something your security is based on the state of our relationship
7792092 what you can give me then may be some real reform in election commission
7792093 she should not be hoping for much there reforms either
7792094 theyve been listening to her calls for months including an earlier call she made to her son
7792095 united states is generally hesitant to ensure the protection of anyone who is not a designated leader
7792096 if youre retreating from that what can you give me may be some real reform in the election commission
7792097 the americans can call all they want with their suggestions about you and me let them call
7792098 your security is based on the state of our relationship
7792099 by the next day musharraf calls bhutto at her estate near karachi
7792100 the priority of this trip is to get bhutto the security support she lacks
7792101 senator kerry i want pakistan to provide me with the security i am entitled to under the laws of my country id be grateful if you would talk to the musharraf government and tell him the us expects he will fulfill those obligations
7792102 well benazir i will certainly talk to the state department about that point being made to musharraf
7792103 the initiative to reinsert bhutto into pakistan was in fact launched and led by rice and her state department
7792104 was that arranging this marriage can only backfire on us bhutto is complicated and unpredictable its best to just support musharraf give him whatever he wants or needs to stay in power our position the advisor added is that this whole thing with bhutto is being run out of state let them fly or fall on their own

7792107 david twohy right now is writing the scripts the only question is whether we take a page from the lord of the rings guys and try to shoot the two chapters at the same time there are two more in mind
7792108 everyone knows i love the riddick character and im always working on it it just takes five years to make another one because david twohy and i are so precious about it
7792109 there were a a couple things we couldnt do in transformers 1 due to budget but also because they seemed too
7792110 yes we do get a bit more dough expect an upgrade and we also know better what we can do this time to maximize the mighty buck and we have the secret weapon that is ian bryce
7792111 going by the length of the script can be tricky because the action is longer in reality than on the page were trying to keep it to two hours but i get a feeling itll be about the same as movie 1
7792112 transformers had 3 plot lines a boy and his car soldiers behind enemy lines and defense policy people all reacting to transformers in a somewhat multiple point of view disaster movie paradigm and structure part two will be a different paradigm more like parallel stories
7792113 the story for part 2 is more global for sure
7792114 back to the future jurassic park close encounters and terminator 2
7792115 we were emulating the style of movie from the old amblin days like back to the future and gremlins which if you watch today are still very funny also the cartoon itself was quite funny also comedy makes things more accessible to a larger audience
7792116 we knew the names of most but michael bay was so upset by leak that he put out a bit of disinformation even claiming that we the writers had no idea which characters we were writing which as i hope is painfully obvious is absurd on its face
7792117 the first movie is all about the mystery and reveal of the transformers as a concept and a species which means we had to hide them a lot in the first hour in the second movie now that everyone believes in the universe we can jump right into the world of the transformers
7792118 the hardest aspect is that you lose the element of surprise we got away with a lot in the first movies because for a long time no one thought it would work or that it was just a silly cartoon and simply proving that wrong is all we had to do the first movie was meant to be somewhat of a mystery for the sequel we need an entirely different structure and paradigm for the movie and we cant rely on it being the first
7792119 one of the themes is about the responsibilities you face when being away from home reflected by sam going to college and by the fact that the transformers themselves are of course far from cybertron
7792120 rumors are not exactly true he came he read for a while and he left then days later we had a meeting with him to talk about his concerns all of which were simple to deal with he wanted to make sure it wasnt too close to the characters hed been playing and we told him it would be our pleasure to differentiate him we all left the meeting smiling and laughing and his agents and the studio started negotiating we just couldnt come up with a mutually satisfactory deal sometimes its s scheduling conflict sometimes its that an actor only wants to agree to be in one movie at a time etc so all i can figure is some one who doesnt know much saw him leave the read early and assumed the rest no hard feelings here
7792121 teaser will surely come out before the end of the year

7792148 insistimos en que este aumento debe a adirse a los educadores bachilleres
7792149 tal petici n resulta improcedente en virtud de que el incremento otorgado en esa oportunidad a los bachilleres nunca fue una revaloraci n salarial sino m s bien un ajuste t cnico

7792222 this is an amazing note one of the classic rarities in canadian currency
7792223 until the discovery of this particular piece there were only two examples known to exist in private hands in fact this type and denomination is so rare that it is even lacking in the official bank of canada collection
7792224 the specimen were offering in our long beach auction has been graded pmg very fine 20 with mention of minor restorations which although present are exceedingly difficult to detect
7792225 its existence represents a true miracle of survival attesting to the fact that these high denomination pieces were actually used in commerce if this were a united states issue recognized as only the third example known for the design type it would easily be a million dollar note
7792226 canadian notes have been growing steadily in popularity and given the performance of the flynn collection which was part of our record setting central states auction held earlier this year the market for true canadian rarities is beginning to generate prices which are now standard south of the border the current charlton catalog places a value on this note in this grade of 250 000 canadian our best guess here is that this queen mary note will bring a solid six figure price but if two or more determined bidders decide they have to own it our estimate will likely be conservative in the extreme
7792227 its an ill wind that blows no one any good

7792259 sir salman rushdie will be at the high court today for the settlement of a libel action he brought over allegations in a book written by a former policeman
7792260 basically the idea is to rescue darwin from the crossfire of a battle between the creationists and public atheists that he had little personal interest in theres more to it than that but the main objective will be a kind of plague on both your houses arguing that both the creationists iders and the militant atheists are wrong that darwinian evolution is compatible with christianity and that we need to treat darwin as a supremely gifted scientist and not the mascot or demon for one anti religious cause or another
7792261 but every few minutes he spoils it by announcing that natural selection means there is categorically no god
7792262 his emotional implication that gee nature is too cruel to have been invented by god
7792263 as a scientist he should stop pretending that there are hard and reliable figures showing that a majority of christians are creationists
7792264 prof dawkins has just written us a somewhat furious letter
7792265 basically the idea is to rescue darwin from the crossfire of a battle between the creationists and public atheists
7792266 the fool hath said in his heart there is no god they are corrupt they have done abomniable works there is none that doeth good
7792267 how could you ignore all that scientific evidence did i give you brains so you could spend your lives believing some ancient manuscripts written by confused primates off to the burning pit with you
7792268 where darwin is right now hed love to come back and renounce all his
7792269 as stark as any bonkers tin hut preacher from the quivering brethren shouting repent or burn evolution or god take your choice kid the moment one of them found an ammonite on the beach professor dawkins demanded instant atheism
7792270 that is unjust to the point of outright mendacity and an insult to any professional educator
7792271 i can only reply that both of us at home watching his fine programme felt sorrowfully that he was hammering the evolution or god choice very hard indeed
7792272 the fool hath said in his heart there is no god
7792273 but every few minutes he spoils it by announcing that natural selection means there is categorically no god
7792274 the moment one of them found an ammonite on the beach professor dawkins demanded instant atheism
7792275 like you i see nothing incompatible between christianity and the theory of evolution nor did alfred russel wallace who co published the theory of evolution by natural selection with charles darwin
7792276 suggest that more than 40 per cent of the british population are creationists
7792277 certain features of living things are best explained by the intervention of a supernatural being e g god
7792278 i must ask in what way does god become involved in the process
7792279 in addition at what time in evolutionary history did he give us souls
7792280 do all animals have souls what does christianity say on the matter
7792281 if god is omniscient and omnipotent why did he not make sure that this information was in the bible
7792282 but that doesnt make what the believer believes in real does it
7792283 a child may believe in santa claus many do but this doesnt make santa claus real
7792284 science describes form and process but is completely blind to questions of meaning and purpose
7792285 you believers might fondly desire a province that is beyond the reach of science where your religious claims might be safe from rational scrutiny
7792286 there is no evidence for miracles of any religion or belief system
7792287 in my work i see the finger prints of god everywhere
7792288 so while everyone has the right to believe in tooth fairies and pixies
7792289 we should stop pretending that there is any substance behind any such beliefs
7792290 you believers might fondly desire a province that is beyond the reach of science where your religious claims might be safe from rational scrutiny but tough there is no such place
7792291 good religious faith cant just ignore the findings of science
7792292 anyone who believes love concern and compassion have any place in dawkins world are just sap brained morons who
7792293 do you think there is any greater reason purpose for our existence
7792294 but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day
7792295 for a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past and as a watch in the night
7792296 destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up
7792297 the bible is supposedly the true revealed word of god
7792298 had darwin lived to this day his theory would have evolved
7792299 oh and coel there are realms of knowledge to which science does not apply
7792300 dear coel please give me some scientific references that tell me by scientific method what my purpose and meaning are while you are at it please direct me to any lab results concerning moral decision making
7792301 dear coel while you are sitting around rolling dice and playing games trying to prove that love caring and compassion are the end points of evolution the russians have cut georgia in half how does that fit into your game theory
7792302 science may be able to deal with meaning and purpose at a trivial level but ive not seen it capable of doing so in any ultimate sense
7792303 dawkins says that 40 of the population is creationist while you claim that only 69 want evolution taught in schools leaving 31 wishing it were left out
7792304 meaning and purpose are properties of brains and thus products of evolution hence you would not expect to find them in any other context
7792305 but i do assert that there are no spheres of human knowledge that theologians or others can access while science cannot
7792306 beauty and many other useful concepts doesnt really exist its just all in our heads
7792307 so there are certainly areas of human life which appear to be beyond science
7792308 i wouldnt expect science to determine whether the mona lisa is great art
7792309 the life of jesus is one such area historians cant assess the miracle stories beyond saying that these are outside our experience
7792310 after all science and philosophy are also the product of brains and perhaps they also cant be found in that context called reality have you any reason at all for expecting that the reality constructed by science on the basis of human senses is reliable or is its existence merely a useful presupposition in the philosophy of science
7792311 why on earth would something being only in our heads mean it doesnt really exist
7792312 of course they can the historians verdict is that the evidence is pitifully inadequate to support any such claims
7792313 and now for the bonus round here is your final question what is meant by a monkeys uncle you have 10 seconds go
7792314 which cant possibly be the same thing as saying the miracles didnt happen
7792315 dont you think it worth asking whether that perceived reality is more or less than it seems
7792316 furthermore to do science i presume you have to have some basis for believing that there is some commonality between our respective perceptions of the world
7792317 do you think beauty and truth goodness justice etc etc have any real independent existence or are they merely our own mental contructs
7792318 of course if someone thinks that they dont really exist he might then decide to arbitrarily construct his own version turning normal human concepts on their heads
7792319 who is to say then for example that hitler was wrong
7792320 whats to stop this ending in utter relativism where everyone is entitled to their own ideas of truth beauty righteousness and justice
7792321 true but it is the same thing as saying there is no evidence for them and thus that belief in them is purely an act of faith
7792322 our moral aesthetic and emotional senses are hard wired into our biology just like our livers and kidneys are we cant re write them arbitrarily
7792323 depsite dawkins stating that evolution is a fact it remains a theory
7792324 i do not understand the argument that if evolution is true it disproves god
7792325 first of all there were the initial witnesses and the effect the miracles had upon them
7792326 secondly there is a surviving written record to be assessed scripture
7792327 thirdly there is the abiding influence of the miraculous in the lives of present day believers
7792328 faith is not merely a leap in the dark except perhaps in the cynics dictionary but a reasoned response to facts of history and to subsequent testimony and experience
7792329 faith in the religious sense is not based on reason but on emotional needs and wishful thinking you want those miracles to be true which is why you believe no objective assessment would lead to belief
7792330 unfortunately for you you have no testimony from the supposed
7792331 it must have happened because many of you believe it is that really what you call evidence
7792332 whilst of course you know that miracles do not happen and therefore any other explanation however unlikely is more probable than the possibility that they did
7792333 the evidence not only of the life death and resurrection of jesus christ
7792334 many scholars still uphold the authenticity of the eyewitness accounts certainly by both mark and john
7792335 and believe it or not intelligent design can fit with natural selection id is simply the theory that there is or has been a guiding force behind the development of the universe steering it in some sort of a direction which means that this intelligence could quite plausibly have used natural selection as the method by which to guide the development of life
7792336 it must have happened because many of you believe it is that really what you call evidence
7792337 faith offers a hypothesis about life you do an experiment try it out and find it works
7792338 id supporters say that life forms show evidence of being intelligently designed or that there is no way for them to have come about without a designer this is exactly the same as creationism
7792339 handed down to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses
7792340 the clear implication is that luke had direct access to the eyewitnesses
7792341 its handed down to us from an original eye witness source
7792342 even if all of the gospels are only second or third hand testimony it doesnt mean they are a pack of fabrications exagerations and lies
7792343 and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many
7792344 but it does mean they are highly unreliable as evidence for anything as notable as a resurrection if it were any other context than your dearly held religion you would not even begin to countenance such feeble evidence for any non prosaic event
7792345 just as they were delivered to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word
7792346 just as they were delivered to us by the eyewitnesses
7792347 luke clearly includes himself among those who received reports directly from the eyewitnesses
7792348 generally where lukes basic facts can be checked against other sources they are usually reliable im sure youll dig up the odd exception to this the census in the infancy narratives is one such problem
7792349 and you are still ignoring the acts connection where luke has direct access to eyewitnesses
7792350 so iders are evolutionists not creationists they accept natural selection even the role of apparent chance within it but they dont accept darwism

7792359 the principle is similar to the virtual shoe fitting mirror that we developed last year for the adidas flagship store in paris
7792360 but it is somewhat more difficult to create a realistic impression of t shirts shirts or sweaters in a virtual mirror these items of clothing develop folds that partially distort the image depending how the wearer moves about
7792361 to reproduce elastic deformations such as those in a woven or knitted fabric we have to evaluate many different parameters and process them all simultaneously
7792362 calculating the spatial parameters of the projected image on the basis of a two dimensional model this reduces the number of dimensions we need to simulate the image and allows us to rapidly evaluate any movements
7792363 just like we demand respect for trees and nature it would be important to make a gesture of respect for another part of creation
7792364 behold i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves
7792365 morality is not a human construct but a natural law established by our creator for our benefit
7792366 it is your fault entirely if you are unable to understand that you should take instruction in the catholic faith from your local priest hell put you straight about your obvious delusions concerning the church
7792367 like all atheists you keep wandering off and muttering something about evidence when the onus is on you as a small minority of the human race to prove that god does not exist
7792368 i am beginning to think rick very seriously that you too are actually anti christian and an atheist masquerading as a believer in christ in order to seduce his followers

7792372 for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus
7792373 for to him that is joined to all the living there is hope for a living dog is better then a dead lion for the living know that they shall die but the dead know anything neither gave they any more a reward for the memory of them is forgotton also their love and their hatred and their envy is now perished neither have they any a portion for ever in anything that is done under the sun
7792374 god is a spirit and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth
7792375 and as it is appointed unto men once to die and after this the judgement
7792376 the reason god wants us to study the scriptures is so you cant be deceived
7792377 search the scriptures for in them ye think you have eternal life and they they are they which testify of me
7792378 and apostle paul as his manner was went into them three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures
7792379 these were more noble then those at thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the scriptures daily whether these things were so
7792380 now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do
7792381 then peter said unto them repent and be baptized everyone of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
7792382 praying to dead people and believing they can hear and intercede on anyones behalf is a myth
7792383 golden bowls full of incense which are the prayers of gods people
7792384 and when he had taken the book the four beast and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb jesus the lamb of god having everyone of them harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of saints

7792423 very little substantive change has come to our poorest neighborhoods

7792425 i think that good pure affordable wholesome food should be available to everybody

7792427 no sooner did we get the green revolution no sooner did the specter of mass starvation get pushed aside than we got this organic nonsense

7792454 i thought she did that transition very well because the school did a good job of explaining how this process was going to work
7792455 so she just got very excited they kept talking about all the new things that would be here

7792481 wrong the plays of aristophanes prove that the overwhelming majority of athenians were straight and idiogenogamotics were ridiculed as either being effeminate or only doing kologamosis in return for political or financial favours if this was not so then aristophanes would not have mocked the politicians in the front seats as boy fuckers kologamosis with young boys will illegal in ancient athens and those engaging in it were banned from holding elected office or made numerous bum gags or brought naked girls on stage for an all male audience to represent peace or written plays featuring female prostitutes hellenistic romantic fiction such as the aethiopica also disproves your claims that women were only regarded as baby making machines menanders dyskolos also disproves your claims as does book 3 of apollonius argonougtica and euripides hellen kolofilia was nothing more than masturbation just ask yourself why it was only with a man and adolescent boy because it was easier for the giver to think the receiver was a young girl than if it was with a man the same age he might as well have fucked a sheep or a goat so to get back on topic it makes you wonder why rtd made captain jack an omnisexual read complete wanker

7792641 he was married and he made it clear that i should keep it mum about our affair i was in love with him and i accepted this he would take me on weekends far away and in hotels less comfy than the ones he usually picked for his holidays with his wife so he was sure he wouldnt bump into someone that might know him he would take me for dinner in remote and dark restaurant where no one could see him he also wanted me to call him on a special phone number so his wife couldnt track back his phone calls he told me she was really suspicious of something
7792642 he was simply out of my league we didnt come from the same background and we had no common point its just that we were attracted to each other and that we felt really no inhibitions when we had sex this was simply amazing we had a great time but the truth is we were a little bit ashamed of our partner choice
7792643 i really loved him but he simply wouldnt fit into my life i didnt see him chatting with my friends or with my family he was a very intelligent wealthy well educated and well known lawyer while i came from a modest environment so i insisted to keep our relationship secret i knew this relationship couldnt last because he would sooner or later find a woman whos more his type

7792651 for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace
7792652 its satans ultimate desire to cause christians to believe that living under grace has abolished the necessity of obeying gods law or that it is of no consequence what you believe as long as you believe in jesus the bible disagrees with both of these notions
7792653 obedience to gods law will never save however the law plays an integral role in pointing out what sin is thus creating a need for christ the saviour the fruit of accepting this invitation is living in obedience to gods laws
7792654 jesus said that if you love me keep my commandments and seeing that he and the father are one then the ten commandments are also jesus commandments
7792655 if god could have canceled his law then jesus would never have needed suffer death on the cross in place of humanitys transgression of gods law

7792666 in my view the facilitator of the talks south african president thabo mbeki should step back as he is now the chairman of sadc he should delegate negotiations to a wider mandate he cannot be the chairperson of sadc and the facilitator at the same time that will be the logical thing to do that is my point of view
7792667 we are at a loss as to what good the parliament will do to serve the people of zimbabwe we dont necessarily have problems with the zimbabwean parliament it was properly elected however if it starts work as a legislative body led by a president then we have a problem there because their electoral process failed to produce a president they do not have a president im yet to read their constitution and understand it but the opening of parliament will also be followed by cabinet appointments which is done by a president
7792668 mayhem mahemium being an attrocious breach of the kings peace and an offense tending to deprive him of the aid and assistance of his subjects for mayhem is properly defined to be as we may remember the violently depriving another of the use of such of his members as may render his the less able in fighting either to defend himself or to annoy his adversary and therefore the cutting off or disabling or weakening a mans hand or finger or striking out his eye or foretooth or depriving him of those parts the loss of which in all animals abate their courage are held to be mayhems but the cutting off his ear or nose or the like are not held to be mayhems at common law because they do not weaken but only disfigure him

7792682 we have not had this officially but milan andreas had a positive test for thc tetrahydrocannabinol the main active chemical in marijuana it appears he will not be nominated for beijing
7792683 we are thrilled to have been involved in commemorating this memorable event our record of the towers will not only provide a lasting memory of the symbolic landmark but the money raised will also benefit the people of sheffield for many years to come
7792684 the project has helped to place some of the objects in museums sheffields important decorative art collection more firmly in their wider historical cultural social and political contexts
7792685 displaying drink has been an exciting collaboration between two of the major cultural and educational institutions in the city we look forward to building upon this work in the future
7792686 a male and a female cat the males name is ziggy
7792687 his full name is zigeunerweisen have you ever watched a cat between around two and four in the afternoon you know how theyll rouse from that second or third nap of the day and start chasing shadows and their own tail doing their kitty version of a lion growl and darting through rooms and down hallways well there is a piece of classical music written by pablo de sarasate called zigeunerweisen that has that same frenetic energetic pace just like a cats crazy hour
7792688 anyway ziggy was like that when he was a kitten so that seemed like an appropriate name but its much easier to say ziggy than his full name
7792689 what about the female cat what did you name her
7792690 i walk past the hospital every day on my way to university but one day i saw a woman presumably a mother crying outside the hospital she was completely distraught and was being comforted by a nurse for the rest of the day i couldn t stop thinking about it
7792691 that experience confirmed sheffield children s hospital as my choice the fact that i walk past it everyday without realising that just the other side of the wall could be events unfolding that completely change the lives of children and their families
7792692 it started off as a bit of a family challenge my sister was boasting that none of us were fit enough to do it so now there s my mum sister her boyfriend and his mum taking part it s been a great way of getting the family fit while raising money for a very worthy cause
7792693 i was very touched by jacks comments its true that a lot occurs in the hospital every day that many people on the outside wont be aware of it shows great strength of character that jack is not only thinking of the people at the hospital by taking part in these races to raise money but that he has rallied half of his family to join in too
7792694 we really wish jack and his family the best of luck with their races and thank them on behalf of all our young patients

7792708 part of the money raised should be used to immediately help those struggling with rising fuel bills and should be particularly targeted at families in or facing fuel poverty
7792709 however the best strategy to eliminate fuel poverty forever is to ensure every home is insulated and energy efficient to the highest standards
7792710 therefore much of the money raised should be used to kickstart a national programme of home energy efficiency and installing renewable energy starting with the homes of the fuel poor

7792746 deities are masks that allow the human mind to conceptualize inherently ineffable cognitive states theyre anthropomorphic constructs of language that lend definition and logical value to shared experiences that are ultimately beyond logic and language in one sense theyre universal to the human condition but the way we relate to them is much more personal the mask that horus wears for me will always be somewhat different than the one thats worn for someone else the shared cultural aspects may be similar this is the archived interface handed down to preserve the horus thoughtform through time but there will always be unique elements created by the individual on this level the mask of deity is co created by the archetype and the individual accessing it

7792788 the main reason given for lifting the ban is that the general public is much more outspoken and broadminded than it was and that to ventilate vice and its tragedies would be to the general social advantage

7792790 for some time the subject of homosexuality has been so widely debated written about that it is no longer justifiable to continue the strict exclusion of this subject from the stage
7792791 we would not pass a play that was violently pro homosexual
7792792 we would not allow funny innuendo or jokes on the subject
7792793 we will not allow embraces between males of practical demonstrations of love
7792794 we will allow the word pansy but not the word bugger
7792795 in terms of censorship of representations of homosexuality it became almost a mania it was as much about latching on to one example of the new permissiveness that developed in the postwar years and seeing in it all the ills of a new world that the retired air force colonels found it hard to understand and instinctively opposed
7792796 it was a time of change but often incremental change and of compromises between old and new guard the old guard was more tenacious than might have been supposed and the new guard was prepared to work within existing systems as well as blazing new ground
7792797 as requested the line worn out but still a few good pumps in her will be omitted
7792798 ive read it and i think its revolting quite apart from the homosexual bits to me it has no saving grace whatsoever if we pass muck like this it does underlined give our critics something to go on
7792799 throughout there runs a rare vitality and with experience and greater conciseness one feels mr pinter may well make some impact as a dramatist
7792800 cannot understand why the younger generation instead of knocking on the door should bash the fuck out of it

7793098 you may hear more about zoos like the san diego zoo or the bronx but its really in many small and medium sized zoos like cape may countys where important works like the bongo repatriation project are going on

7793114 for months democrats have tried to say this race wont be close
7793115 the polls have been saying otherwise the primary results just confirmed that its dead even again
7793116 youre going to have a ton of young voters who will come out and vote for obama and no one else on the ticket
7793117 even though nationally it looks like this going to be a very strong democratic year both rossi and mccain seem like theyd be able to overtake those national odds for whatever reason

7793184 it strips a 300 year old authority of the general assembly for it to deal with land transfers specifically riparian land which is held in trust under article 1 section 27 of the state constitution
7793185 this is not a gaming issue but speaks directly to the authority of the general assembly it sets a dangerous new precedent here
7793186 the notion that a casino can acquire public lands without even paying a single cent to the commonwealth is offensive to both good public policy and common sense
7793187 i dont understand how the lawmakers are complaining about the states not getting paid for riparian rights
7793188 we paid the city over 282 000 for the license which is more than the state formula of 250 000
7793189 in addition we estimate that the commonwealth and the city are losing 4 5 million each week that we are delayed in lost gaming tax revenue
7793190 the devastating nature of the courts decision cannot be overstated
7793191 the court has effectively created a special casino class that is treated differently from all other forms of commercial development along the waterfront
7793192 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios

7793206 lenders have been trying to stay out of the best rate tables now they are competing again on price however lenders are still hedging against the future probability of default with stricter criteria

7793212 sampai saat akhir kebanyakan anggota kenisah rakyat percaya pada jim jones pengaruh pengaruh luar dalam bentuk kekuasaan atau bujukan dapat mengakibatkan orang jadi tunduk tapi yang harus diperhatikan adalah bagaimana anggota memproses kepercayaan itu dalam pikiran mereka meskipun perkataan perkataan jones selalu tidak konsisten dan metodanya kejam kebanyakan anggotanya tetap tunduk di bawah perintahnya
7793213 begitu diri mereka terasing di jonestown hanya sedikit ada kesempatan dan motivasi untuk menentang mereka tidak bisa melawan atau melarikan diri lagi dalam keadaan seperti itu setiap orang berusaha menerima nasib buruk dirinya sebagai hal yang tidak buruk orang yang mengalami nasib buruk cenderung menilai nasibnya lebih positif dari orang lain contohnya riset psikologi sosial menunjukkan bahwa jika anak anak tahu bahwa mereka akan disuruh makan sayuran yang mereka tidak sukai maka mereka cenderung meyakinkan diri bahwa sayuran itu tidak terlalu memuakkan untuk dimakan jika seseorang tahu dia harus berhubungan dengan orang lain dia cenderung menjabarkan diri orang tersebut dengan lebih ramah

7793293 most of the core supporters of keadilan are factory workers my concern is the turnout and its too low for comfort
7793294 from our exit poll figures and what we are tracking anwar is safely leading in the polls and i think that it is right to say about 61 percent
7793295 we are still not declaring victory as we will wait for the official election results from the election commission
7793296 we are expecting anwars win to be as big as when wan azizah contested but we think that it will be less in terms of absolute numbers due to it being a working day for many
7793297 i will vote for anwar he represents the voice of the people god willing he will win

7793309 this kind of advanced sophisticated cash management is a hot topic for banks right now it is very good business for them since fees earned from cash management are not related to capital adequacy tests

7793318 an 18 month old boy is in a critical condition in hospital with a serious head injury after what appears to be a tragic accident
7793319 the toddler was playing with other young children in the garden of his home in the washwood heath area when he sustained a pellet wound to the back of the head from an air weapon
7793320 a strong line of inquiry is that young children aged under five somehow managed to access the air weapon and accidentally caused it to go off
7793321 apparently the dad was cleaning the gun and left it loaded and then went to attend a phone call when it happened

7793366 he has not been fostered i have never signed any papers to have him fostered i was sat watching the x factor when my son came on i was shocked because id no idea he was on the show
7793367 i was even more shocked when i heard him say he had been fostered and wanted to find out who his real mum and dad were i only spoke to him five weeks ago
7793368 i dont want to make a big deal about this because i dont want to cause problems for him but the fact is he has told a lie hes made himself look a bit of a clot
7793369 his mam and dad have always been there for him hes invented this sob story just to dupe the judges into putting him through
7793370 this is the third time alan has auditioned for the x factor the other times he didnt get through so his antics this time have clearly worked
7793371 the family is up in arms about this after all weve done its not that i dont want the best for him but alan needs a reality check if he wants to win x factor he should do it on merit not by stabbing his family in the back
7793372 this is a world war ii battleship with high fixed costs for maintenance and theres the cost of running the museum and utilities 720 000 a year its an expensive place to run
7793373 for the 3 million the state was getting back 9 2 million in economic impact
7793374 if the state wants to see vibrant cultural and historical museums in the state theres a level of support thats needed
7793375 each of these sites and activities are equally important to fueling the states economy
7793376 the liberty science center in jersey city was cut by 2 7 million and the newark museum lost 2 2 million
7793377 the goal of the budget was to take steps to fix state finances so we could match recurring spending with recurring revenues reduce state debt and ease the structural budget shortfall
7793378 the focus was to preserve core programs that service our seniors and other vulnerable populations
7793379 we are dependent on the states help so this is a big blow to us
7793380 its been a rough month we will have to do a better job of bringing in more money well have to work harder
7793381 we will have to handle tasks in much different ways assess operational priorities we will probably have some limited hours during the winter we will still have groups and encampments for a day

7793395 i understand why we need the construction because it is good to update everything but it is always at the wrong time and wrong place and it just seems like its not done quick enough for school and that bothers me
7793396 though it is a huge area this was determined to be less invasive to students when they came back to school
7793397 these are important projects for the university and it is to make it better for students

7793404 weve been tested a lot i was tested four times before i even started running i have taken urine tests and blood tests i have been tested after every competition
7793405 i have been tested so many times i lost track and were okay with it we work hard and we perform well and we know were clean any time they want to test us is okay with us
7793406 weve been dazzled impressed and blown away by these beijing games
7793407 london definitely could take lessons from how the beijing games were run
7793408 the best parties arent always the ones that cost the most money
7793409 the challenge for london is to create a party atmosphere with a great sporting experience
7793410 you travel in numbers it usually means youll get caught easier
7793411 were still requesting the eyes and ears of the community
7793412 are looking at every family and background friend of the suspects and they will continue to do that until they hopefully capture these individuals
7793413 to get tunnel vision on where one suspect might be going we could actually miss the lead on another one
7793414 but now people realize the war was a sham and was based on a lie and theyre starting to even on network tv people are outspoken about this
7793415 so we feel its safe to express ourselves as well
7793416 you dont have to worry about going to a party and seeing someone in the exact same shirt
7793417 another nice thing about the recycled idea is that after you wash them theres no surprises theyve already been washed 20 times so theyre not going to shrink
7793418 each one represents a certain type of energy and a lot of people like to meditate on mandalas and its like a spiritual thing and an art thing for me
7793419 ive been doing art my whole life but its really exciting to see it on t shirts
7793420 heres a very funny one barack is a klingon name
7793421 you know all the speculation about his being arab and muslim and hussein is his middle name and all that kind of stuff
7793422 you have brazilian jujutsu and variations from other systems these systems are sport or competition oriented they basically severed their moorings their roots and they no longer reflect the original philosophies and traditions from which they came
7793423 the psychological domain has to do with the development of control self discipline focus and perseverance
7793424 basically a no quit attitude when you combine all four of these you develop something called focused power and its the ability to focus all the sources of power that makes the martial artist seem twice as strong as a normal person
7793425 when you lost your sword your katana you could still continue to fight and survive
7793426 fortunately campus police were able to intervene quickly and prevent a more serious crime from happening and thats what were here for
7793427 however i do not characterize it as a lot of cases
7793428 the biggest issues we have in terms of dealing with students and prevention is whether they are using good judgment
7793429 both men and women need to watch out because rape goes both ways
7793430 in an actual sexual assault case we take all necessary precautions to ensure the victims safety
7793431 i think there could be more police around campus but it is not terribly inadequate
7793432 the university is committed to expanding the police department and they are actively recruiting
7793433 work toward a professional parliament that will represent the true wishes of the people of zimbabwe
7793434 had not yet achieved the complete reconciliation that we need
7793435 now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us
7793436 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7793437 i will take unusual things that you dont always talk about and then make them funny
7793438 im an abstract comic how many people do you know make camel sounds when theyre smoking nobody can relate to it are people at home drowning dogs no we dont know why its funny it is abstract humor if ive done my job you laugh your ass off and you have no idea why it was funny to you
7793439 i have a strange sense of audio memory i almost remember everything that i hear no matter how stupid
7793440 i got so bored that i started combining them and doing my own and i came up with sounds for animals that dont exist so if i did a goat impression it would be stevie nicks goat combination
7793441 what amazes me is the degree of selflessness they show
7793442 for me the best comics slam everyone equally if you go after one political viewpoint you have to cover the other one as well in that sense we are truly democratic
7793443 i have bipolar tendencies my style is bipolar in the sense that one minute im completely calm and then im on a tangent about something but i always come back to the point
7793444 theres a lot of free flow stream of consciousness diatribe other people will take your standard observation about the world that everybody can relate to like boyfriend girlfriend relationships and the differences between new york and l a
7793445 telling our story will attract the best and brightest students faculty and staff
7793446 are excited about the lobo athletics then maybe theyll also check out our business school or the law department
7793447 but this ad money is only a fraction of unms budget
7793448 this summer we spent about 2 5 million on improvements to the residence areas
7793449 over the next five years we have many more projects planned and will probably end up spending about 14 million on renovations overall
7793450 unfortunately you cant predict the rain during a roofing project
7793451 when i first moved in the outside door was broken i had to bring my tools in and fix it so it would work again
7793452 another door in my room has already had the handle fall off of it
7793453 i dont think the cabinets or curtains have been replaced since the 60s theyre really kind of gross
7793454 all the sink knobs turn the wrong way and the showers arent very private
7793455 all you have to keep you hidden is a flimsy curtain
7793456 theres so many areas that should have received improvement long ago
7793457 things have fallen into disrepair and have been neglected too long
7793458 during the semester well be doing less invasive projects such as some security upgrades as well as fire safety upgrades
7793459 we want to put big screen tvs in la posada so students can gather to watch sports events if they dont have access to them on their own tvs
7793460 s t a l k e r shadow of chernobyl
7793461 we were married for six or seven years before we ever tried to collaborate musically
7793462 i was always writing and he was always playing music and we never considered that the two could work together
7793463 bittersweet its a good word thats sometimes how life feels
7793464 we always took him on tour with us hoping someone would discover this brilliant genius hes trying to help us in return by doing some covers he always does amazing things with our songs he just kind of reconstructs them in surprising ways so i dont recognize them so they seem more beautiful in his hands he uses a lot of loops
7793465 i think that making music and making records of our songs can be very frustrating and a source of great conflict and argument but a lot of times its also really a very satisfying thing to do
7793466 its like the most exciting thing you can do is make a weird beautiful object that exists outside of you thats kind of a common thing that people think that its difficult or whatever but i wouldnt challenge anybody that wants to have a kid to sit down and see if they can write a song together first it takes a special kind of relationship to do that its full of conflict but its part of the dynamic we get along fine
7793467 you wouldnt like me without my medication every time i go off my medication the first thing i think of is how to cut off the legs of my cat i wouldnt ever go through with it but it pops into my head
7793468 i kind of carry that with me and i think that i still embrace certain values and certain philosophies from the new testament and from jesus but obviously not in any southern baptist kind of way
7793469 ive had some experiences that lead me to believe there was an afterlife not like ouija board stuff but i dont know what it is seventy virgins or whatever floating around clouds playing harps people who profess to know what it is are probably going to be a little disappointed streets paved with gold what do you need that for
7793470 we get people to come to the show and they scream magic balls and like what they wanted us to tell the story we told on the cd the story of the cat litter well go onstage and ill break a string and rennie will start telling this wacky ass story and there are actually people who think we can replicate repeat those stories like theyre written down
7793471 we just have fun and try to treat it like people are hanging out with us at home in the living room just shooting the shit and telling stories
7793472 im really serious about the music and songwriting its one of the most important things in my life but you should have a good time on stage it should be fun
7793473 i have been watching the olympics the british success is amazing because you have no structure here
7793474 in france every village has sports facilities provided for the public here there is hardly anything where do they all go to train in paris there are 50 competitive swimming pools and in london two and yet you got the olympics
7793475 its all very well getting carried away with the fact that some investment in a few elite athletes has brought success
7793476 but what people should remember is that there has to be a wider base for the development of young people in sport the fact is we just dont have a sports infrastructure in britain we have improved here in sydney but that is because the most talented have at last been given some real support however there are so many other young people who could develop if they were given the right facilities
7793477 its not rocket science if you throw a ton of money at a group of talented athletes and buy up some top coaches the chances are you are going to do well

7793495 we pay more than our neighbours when it comes to our spend on food we do have a big problem here

7793509 i have been watching the olympics the british success is amazing because you have no structure here
7793510 in france every village has sports facilities provided for the public here there is hardly anything where do they all go to train in paris there are 50 competitive swimming pools and in london two and yet you got the olympics
7793511 its all very well getting carried away with the fact that some investment in a few elite athletes has brought success here
7793512 but what people should remember is that there has to be a wider base for the development of young people in sport the fact is we just dont have a sports infrastructure in britain we have improved here in sydney but that is because the most talented have at last been given some real support however there are so many other young people who could develop if they were given the right facilities
7793513 its not rocket science if you throw a ton of money at a group of talented athletes and buy up some top coaches the chances are you are going to do well but it is something you have to do over the years to maintain that success
7793514 it cant be a one or two olympic wonder not if you have to change the whole culture of a nations sport to get on the right track long term
7793515 i won the chocolate medal but i loved being there and i loved london for staging those games despite the austere times a lot of people made great sacrifice for their love of sport and you can never forget that but i do have to say that my country should be staging the next olympics
7793516 the campaign went very wrong maybe there was over confidence arrogance but if you look at our countries and have to say who has put most into sport who have cared most to give facilities to the young and made them value participation most well the answer is very simple over so many years since the london olympics of 1948 obviously it is france

7793529 actually it is part of my return visit i am going to the us not to sign any agreement it is part of the continuing defence dialogue between the us and india
7793530 india has a cordial defence partnership with the us during his gates visit and after that he invited me to the us i accepted that invitation and i am going there
7793531 i have known her for years and she has always dressed like that
7793532 in addition to the continued price hikes for energy and fast moving consumer goods expectations of weaker economic development are depressing the consumer mood in particular

7793534 it should be emphasised that the mood of irish consumers still remains very gloomy but this months results suggest that although confidence is fragile consumers are at least capable of taking comfort in a number of slightly encouraging developments
7793535 the fact that consumers noted a couple of encouraging developments in the past month suggests they havent entirely given up hope this openness to good news while encouraging also raises the question as to where more positive noises might come from
7793536 this increases the pressure on the irish government to come up with a credible response to current problems before long
7793537 the small improvement in consumer sentiment while welcome shouldnt be thought of as signalling a turnaround
7793538 current readings remain consistent with extremely weak levels of household spending however the fact that irish consumers remain capable of discerning good news in the shape of heavy price discounts by retailers lower oil prices or more favourable news on interest rates is a welcome development
7793539 it is probably premature to conclude that the worst news on inflation is behind us
7793540 donncha oconnor intimated to us yesterday that he would like to appeal the decision whenever a player wants to appeal we stand by our players and help them to fight their case we have always done that in the past and i think its the same with every county you have to stand by your players
7793541 i havent seen the incident myself but people have told me that theyd be hopeful after seeing the video evidence it seems like a minor incident but the powers that be will make the decision we will be lodging our appeal this morning and the case will be heard as soon as possible our secretary frank murphy will be involved in that
7793542 i feel sorry for donncha who was harshly done by he was walked into it and apparently he had to put up with some fierce verbal abuse lots of people dont realise the verbal abuse in certain matches at county board level we are very friendly with the kerry lads but the two teams have met so often over the last five years that it seems familiarity breeds contempt
7793543 but we dont really have any hassle with going back to croke park were always happy to play there maybe a double bill on saturday with our minors would have been better but we knew the minor was always going to be on saturday the senior game should be on sunday anyway
7793544 it is a close strategic fit with our core areas of expertise in whey and sports nutrition and brings us up the value chain into consumer markets
7793545 optimum also fits very well with the groups stated growth strategy and ambition to continue to internationalise our business the transaction is expected to be earnings enhancing from this year
7793546 the company has strong brands and a broad distribution network in an attractive market segment we have a long standing relationship with optimum and its leadership team and are delighted to welcome them
7793547 the only small consolation for shareholders is that at this stage the scope of profit revisions is diminishing and the lowly valuation should limit the share price downside
7793548 despite current credit market conditions merger and acquisition activity in the alcoholic drink sector remains robust
7793549 at current valuations there is a significant possibility of a takeover
7793550 the group is in a poor position to invest in expanding its business the spirits division is attractive and would produce synergistic benefits to an acquirer but a sale of this unit would necessitate a dividend cut for c amp c and focus the business entirely on a single product
7793551 its been talked about for a while now while it might not be very much on the cards it is a real possibility that someone might come looking
7793552 perhaps the one thing which could keep a takeover of c amp c on the backburner for the foreseeable future would be that many of the big international drinks companies are currently more interested in bigger deals or actually involved in them
7793553 this initiative will help link talent from the northeast to the fast growing indian it industry
7793554 if the inflation fails to ease in coming weeks the reserve bank of india will have no choice but to further tighten monetary policy
7793555 the rise in global commodity and food prices is still a major driver of inflation
7793556 the retreat of oil will only help ease the pressure on the government to further raise domestic energy prices

7793600 our parking lots are full even on nice sunny days were very proud of that
7793601 this park and zoo not only does its part in preserving open space and wetlands in an area where that is shrinking its also always been a place where families can come and enjoy an entire day together without spending very much
7793602 i dont think that even covers the enjoyment we get out of coming here
7793603 you may hear more about zoos like the san diego zoo or the bronx but its really in many small and medium sized zoos like cape may countys where important works like the bongo repatriation project are going on
7793604 its within these smaller facilities that the expertise and the care for these kinds of projects resides
7793605 i brought my kids here when they were little and now theyre 34 and i bring my grandchildren here i cant believe what they started with and now what they have here now you could spend all day
7793606 now that im a father i might say ill leave the stunts to the stuntmen
7793607 i havent been a thrill seeker in my normal life since i started doing action movies
7793608 it makes me want to be a better person it becomes the only and absolutely clear thing in your life i mean you love work and have a passion for it but you have a child and theres no mystery about your purpose any more
7793609 the clearest way you commit to the future is by having a child
7793610 here is the story of a guy who is essentially at the end of his rope
7793611 he is a war veteran who has completely given up on life on love on hope and has become a shell toorop has a very strong personal code and i was attracted to that part of his character
7793612 toorop lives by his own personal codes of conduct but allows the lines to blur in order to get his job done
7793613 he uses physical force in order to effectuate his professional needs but in his heart he is a generous man
7793614 why this sucks i was always told that it was my birth right to have half of a pie now i have to content myself with a fourth of a pie i have lost pie this is all that bitch marys fault
7793615 he who is rightly entitled to a larger share of worldly power and wealth by the chance of being born with a penis
7793616 be sexy be hot be available and wanted your sexuality is shameful
7793617 i have a biological impetuous to kick dogs its an evolutionary tactic you see
7793618 you see when we were all cave men dogs used to carry off babies i know this because i read it in a fancy university study or perhaps i didnt or the study was flawed but you and i know that dogs could at one point eaten babies so its hardwired into humanity officer this need to kick dogs we know that they could turn feral on us in their hunger at any moment even though dogs today dont carry off babies or go feral in hunger they used to so men naturally have the urge to kick dogs its there right beside the genetic code that makes hair grow on my balls i couldnt help myself officer i did it all for the evolutionary success of my species
7793619 this is a world war ii battleship with high fixed costs for maintenance and theres the cost of running the museum and utilities 720 000 a year its an expensive place to run
7793620 for the 3 million the state was getting back 9 2 million in economic impact
7793621 if the state wants to see vibrant cultural and historical museums in the state theres a level of support thats needed
7793622 each of these sites and activities are equally important to fueling the states economy
7793623 the liberty science center in jersey city was cut by 2 7 million and the newark museum lost 2 2 million
7793624 the goal of the budget was to take steps to fix state finances so we could match recurring spending with recurring revenues reduce state debt and ease the structural budget shortfall
7793625 the focus was to preserve core programs that service our seniors and other vulnerable populations
7793626 we are dependent on the states help so this is a big blow to us
7793627 its been a rough month we will have to do a better job of bringing in more money well have to work harder
7793628 we will have to handle tasks in much different ways assess operational priorities we will probably have some limited hours during the winter we will still have groups and encampments for a day

7793720 while the bounce in july existing sales is a welcome improvement the housing market still suffers from high inventories
7793721 this has been the story of the region for the last two decades
7793722 we manage not to participate in the hot markets and industries that cause national activity to surge and as a consequence we dont fall apart as much as the previously hot areas
7793723 most extreme overvaluation of homes are the areas suffering the most in the current foreclosure cycle
7793724 which saw home prices increase at somewhat more reasonable levels didnt have as high an incidence of consumers buying too much house with risky loans
7793725 more and more it appears that the existing home market nationally has bottomed even if the large number of homes on the market means prices may continue to fall
7793726 the monthly numbers of approvals for house purchases which have fallen by some two thirds over the last year levelled off in july
7793727 it would however be premature to think that the housing market will now start to recover because overall approval activity continues to be very low

7793731 it strips a 300 year old authority of the general assembly for it to deal with land transfers specifically riparian land which is held in trust under article 1 section 27 of the state constitution
7793732 this is not a gaming issue but speaks directly to the authority of the general assembly it sets a dangerous new precedent here
7793733 the notion that a casino can acquire public lands without even paying a single cent to the commonwealth is offensive to both good public policy and common sense
7793734 i dont understand how the lawmakers are complaining about the states not getting paid for riparian rights
7793735 we paid the city over 282 000 for the license which is more than the state formula of 250 000
7793736 in addition we estimate that the commonwealth and the city are losing 4 5 million each week that we are delayed in lost gaming tax revenue
7793737 the devastating nature of the courts decision cannot be overstated

7793752 sid lekwack came to me and said joel i like your play i want to do your play and i know that you think that its a tragedy and all that but i view it differently i think its a comedy
7793753 now he claimed in casting that he could not find the actress in the department to play the prostitute
7793754 during rehearsal he came to me one time and said joel you know how i thought this play was a comedy
7793755 well i said sid youre the director you direct it however you like

7793781 we are glad that we have been able to find an excellent distribution partner this soon after the acquisition of the world wide rights on reli va and that we can begin with the definition of a precise sales plan the major marketing costs for instance of tv advertising to the end consumer which is relevant to the us market will altogether be covered by dse healthcare the risk of marketing the product will therefore be strongly decreased for biofrontera in addition biofrontera can participate in the sales on two aspects first in advance through the manufacturing of the product then later through royalties related to sales and profit

7793863 when anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart this is the one on whom seed was sown beside the road and the one on whom seed was sown on the rocky places this is the man who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy yet he has no firm root in himself but is only temporary and when affliction or persecution arises because of the word immediately he falls away and the one on whom seed was sown among the thorns this is the man who hears the word and the worry of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and it becomes unfruitful and the one on whom seed was sown on the good soil this is the man who hears the word and understands it who indeed bears fruit and brings forth some a hundredfold some sixty and some thirty
7793864 the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field
7793865 first gather up the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them up but gather the wheat into my barn
7793866 the one who sows the good seed is the son of man and the field is the world and as for the good seed these are the sons of the kingdom and the tares are the sons of the evil one and the enemy who sowed them is the devil and the harvest is the end of the age and the reapers are angels
7793867 again the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet cast into the sea and gathering fish of every kind and when it was filled they drew it up on the beach and they sat down and gathered the good fish into containers but the bad they threw away

7793873 ready for them you arent dont feel too badly about that there have been thousands of students before you who werent ready for their finals
7793874 just as i wasnt ready for that geology final back there in the spring of 1951 when i was a student at ucla
7793875 i walked out of that examination fully expecting to flunk the course
7793876 a week or so later grades came out i went to the registrars office to get mine
7793877 an a in theories of dramatic direction an a in advanced acting and leaping out at me as if in giant type a d in physical geology i forgot any other grades except those three
7793878 now after that what proved to be a very interesting thing began to happen almost every morning as i was walking across campus between classes i would pass dr putnam who had been the teacher in geology and who also was the department head
7793879 my memory of dr putnam is that he was a man in his late fifties very conservative in appearance always wearing a sober suit shirt and tie polished dress shoes and an old fashioned bowler hat
7793880 each time he would pass me hed tip his hat say
7793881 and that would be it we would never say anything further to each other but there always would be that greeting
7793882 this went on for as long as i remained a student at ucla
7793883 three years after i took that class one day i was visiting with wally boyle a professor in the department of theater arts
7793884 by this time i was a graduate student working on my masters degree in theater
7793885 while talking with dr boyle on this particular day three years after i had taken the course in geology suddenly he asked me joel do you know a man on this campus by the name of dr putnam
7793886 sure i said hes the head of the department of geology i took a class from him several years ago why do you ask
7793887 he told me that dr and mrs putnam were good friends to him and his wife that the previous saturday evening the putnams had been their dinner guests
7793888 that after they had finished eating while going through the normal after dinner conversation suddenly dr putnam had asked wally do you know a student in the department of theater arts by the name of joel climenhaga
7793889 and wally boyle told him he told me that i was one of the best students in the department of theater arts that all my teachers had high expectations for my career that they were certain i was going to be a teacher and active in theatre etc etc
7793890 after all this then dr putnam said according to wally boyle well i had him as a student several years ago in physical geology damndest student i ever met absolutely refused to cheat
7793891 im sure you can see what has lived with me through the years about all this
7793892 many other people in that class perhaps most of them would have cheated if they had been able to some undoubtedly did cheat but i hadnt chosen to do so and thats what had remained with dr putnam about me and that most likely was the reason he had passed me in that course
7793893 and most importantly as far as im concerned why he never forgot me why he always knew me i was a person in his eyes not just another statistic
7793894 it wasnt a matter of morality it was a matter of identity
7793895 i didnt cut off my right arm and try to substitute somebody elses arm there in order to throw a ball i didnt try to use somebody elses brain i used my own brain
7793896 now next week as you students start taking your final examinations i hope youll remember this series of columns about academic honesty
7793897 look personally i dont give a tiddley squat whether you cheat on your exams or not at least not in any moral sense but if you do just remember that youre no more than part of another statistic

7793905 the timid civilized world has found nothing with which to oppose the onslaught of a sudden revival of barefaced barbarity other than concessions and smiles
7793906 tilt of freedom in the direction of evil evidently born primarily out of a humanistic and benevolent concept according to which there is no evil inherent to human nature
7793907 allows us to pinpoint and eliminate the enemy unmanned drones that promise amazing advances in battlefield safety and effectiveness bunker buster weapons that penetrate deep into the caves in which remote terrorists hide and communications systems that allow lightning quick troop deployment and rescue missions
7793908 ultimately protect the lives and health of our troops just as they protect us
7793909 no people in history have ever survived who thought they could protect their freedom by making themselves inoffensive to their enemies
7793910 those who incurred the curse of allah and his wrath those of whom some he transformed into apes and swine those who worshipped evil
7793911 jews are the scum of the human race the rats of the world the violators of pacts and agreements the murderers of the prophets and the offspring of apes and pigs whom allah cursed and turned into apes and pigs
7793912 at abni schools i felt the urge to fulfill all the wild dreams of the little children studying there
7793913 at abni i saw happy children living with what they have
7793914 my internship has opened my eyes to the harsh realities of the world i know today that on the outside these children might look different from us but on the inside they all have similar dreams
7793915 hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
7793916 and as i tuck that little girl and her little sister into bed at night i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming
7793917 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really and not just because barack has done well but because i think people are hungry for change
7793918 i just wanted to make the statement that i have and always will be proud of my country
7793919 what i was clearly talking about was that im proud in how americans are engaging in the political process
7793920 who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and our sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7793921 whos never forgotten where he came from and never stopped fighting for folks who work long hours and face long odds and need someone on their side again
7793922 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
7793923 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7793924 the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans
7793925 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7793926 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7793927 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention

7793938 threat posed by iraqs refusal to end its wmd programs
7793939 every nation has to be either for us or against us those who harbor terrorists or who finance them are going to pay a price
7793940 iraq continues to be a safe haven transit point or operational node for groups and individuals who direct violence against the united states saddams intelligence service supported financially ansar al islam whose members were being trained in al qaeda camps in afghanistan
7793941 husseins vigorous pursuit of biological chemical and nuclear weapons and his present and potential future support for terrorist acts and organizations make him a terrible danger to the people of the united states
7793942 my position is very clear the time has come for decisive action to eliminate the threat posed by saddam husseins wmds
7793943 every day saddam gets closer to his long term goal of nuclear capability
7793944 theres no question that saddam hussein is a threat to the u s and our allies
7793945 to defend the national security of the united states against the continuing threat posed by iraq
7793946 saddam is in material breach the legitimacy of the security council is at stake and if the security council does not call for the use of force i think we have little option but to act with a larger group of willing nations if possible and alone if we must
7793947 yes saddam has chemical weapons he has biological weapons he is trying to get nuclear weapons
7793948 the world is far safer with the removal of saddam
7793949 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative

7793955 ein bisschen traurig ist es schon ich habe die entscheidenden punkte einfach nicht gemacht die m glichkeiten waren da
7793956 ich habe gesehen dass ich mit den besten mithalten kann dieses spiel wird bei mir im r ckblick immer ganz oben rangieren so etwas bleibt in erinnerung
7793957 ousia in the truest and primary and most definite sense of the word is that which is neither predicable of a subject nor present in a subject for instance the individual man or horse sokrates or bukephalus
7793958 it is impossible for the same thing at the same time to belong and not belong to the same thing at the same time and in the same respect
7793959 a state of productive capacity involving a true course of reasoning
7793960 none of the people you think he would seem a strange person to you
7793961 but the facts are contrary to these theories platonic and pythagorean and the accounts they give are not reasonable for they hold that the same material can produce many things but that a form has only one embodiment whereas what we observe is that every table has its own material and that one artificer using a single form or design may make many tables formal and material factors are related as male to female for the female becomes pregnant from a single impregnation whereas the male impregnates many females so sex is an analogue of matter and form
7793962 plato is like a man who unable to count with a small number thinks that he will find it easier to do so if he doubles the number
7793963 is it not obvious that a state may at length attain such a degree of unity as to be no longer a state since the nature of the state is to be a plurality and in tending to greater unity from being a state it becomes a family an individual for the family may be said to be more than the state and the individual more than the family so that we ought not to attain this greatest unity even if we could for it would be the destruction of the state again a state is not made up only of so many men but of different kinds of men for similars do not constitute a state again in another point of view the extreme unification of the state is clearly not good for a family is more self sufficing than an individual and a city than a family and a city only comes into being when the community is large enough to be self sufficing if self sufficiency is to be desired the lesser degree of unity is more desirable than the greater
7793964 that all persons call the same thing mine in the sense in which each does so may be a fine thing but it is impracticable or if the words are taken in the other sense such a unity in no way conduces to harmony and there is another objection to the proposal for that which is common to the greatest number has the least care bestowed upon it everyone thinks chiefly of his own hardly at all of the common interest and only when he is himself concerned as an individual every citizen will have a thousand sons which will not be his individually but anybody will be equally the son of anybody and will therefore be neglected by all alike further upon this principle everyone will use the word mine of one who is prospering or the reverse however small a fraction he may himself be of the whole number the same boy will be my son so and sos son the son of each of the thousand or whatever be the number of citizens and even about this he will not be positive for it is impossible to know who chanced to have a child or whether if one came into existence it has survived but which is better for each to say mine in this way making a man the same relation to two thousand or ten thousand citizens or to use the word mine in the ordinary and more restricted sense for usually the same person is called by one man his own son whom another calls his own brother or cousin or kinsman blood relation or connexion by marriage either of himself or of some relation of his and how much better it is to be the real cousin of somebody than to be a son after platos fashion as a little sweet wine mingled with a great deal of water is imperceptible in the mixture so in this sort of community the idea of relationship which is based upon these names will be lost there is no reason why the so called father should care about the son or son about the father or the brothers about one another of the two qualities which chiefly inspire regard and affection that a thing is your own and that it is your only one neither can exist such a state as this
7793965 we can say goodbye to the forms for they are idle chatter
7793966 hi non viderunt ut ad cursum equum ad arandum bovem ad indagandum canem sic hominem ad duas res us ait aristoteles ad intellegendum et ad addendum esse natum quasi mortalem deum
7793967 cicero de finibus book 2 13 40 they failed to see that just as the horse is designed by nature for running the ox for ploughing and the dog for hunting so man as aristotle observes is born for two purposes thought and action he is as it were a mortal god rhet rhetoric is relatively sparse in contrast poet commentary on the poetics has destroyed forests

7793975 this book is an excellent learning tool like any other tool you get out of it exactly what you put in my advice is to spend as much time with each section as you need if you do that you will walk away with every bit of the knowledge an industry thought leader can provide

7793986 this is about giving consumers something new that the supermarket chains wont tell them who is the cheapest overall in their area
7793987 this is a government who actually believes that greater competition and transparency will benefit the consumer and thats where we are focused
7793988 the sad reality is that this website could have a detrimental impact on the supermarket sector by providing free promotion to the major supermarket retailers
7793989 the website does not take into account the consumer savings from the convenience of independent stores and it does not take into account the price variations which exist within the independent sector and at different coles and woolworths stores

7793992 during his recent debate with the cultural jihadist tariq ramadan ibn warraq elucidated what is at stake should such islamic supremacism prevail the great ideas of the west rationalism self criticism the disinterested search for truth the separation of church and state the rule of law and equality under the law freedom of thought and expression human rights and liberal democracy are superior to any others devised by humankind it was the west that took steps to abolish slavery the calls for abolition did not resonate even in africa where rival tribes sold black prisoners into slavery the west has secured freedoms for women and racial and other minorities to an extent unimaginable 60 years ago the west recognizes and defends the rights of the individual we are free to think what we want to read what we want to practice our religion to live lives of our choosing nor does the west need lectures on the superior virtue of societies in which women are kept in subjection under sharia endure genital mutilation are stoned to death for alleged adultery and are married off against their will at the age of nine societies that deny the rights of supposedly lower castes societies that execute homosexuals and apostates the west has no use for sanctimonious homilies from societies that cannot provide clean drinking water or sewage systems that make no provisions for the handicapped and that leave 40 to 50 percent of their citizens illiterate
7793993 i loved him very much we got married on may 10 but we had been together for five years it was love at first sight when we met he was the love of my life
7793994 im grieving but im trying to be strong david hated me crying and on some level i think hes probably helping me through this i try to think about his smile thats how everyone will remember him
7793995 i left him off at the site at 6 30am
7793996 he was in fantastic form before he got out of the car he kissed me on the ear he always did that for fun because i didnt like it and he told me he loved me
7793997 it was so long and agonising when he was missing
7793998 we were all hoping and praying he would walk around the corner and ask what all the fuss was about
7793999 the hardest thing is that ill never see him again well never get to have children he couldnt wait to be a daddy we were thinking about having a family
7794000 i have no bad memories the last time i saw him was so good ill hold that with me forever but its hard for me and hard for his family
7794001 we dont have the results of the post mortem yet because we couldnt identify the body
7794002 his teeth were too good so they couldnt use dental records to say its him until they can prove its david we wont get the body back so we dont know when the funeral will be
7794003 after david went missing 50 trucks dropped around 500 tons of rubbish on him the police moved over 100 tons to find him
7794004 its absolute hell on earth i cant sleep i cant close my eyes because all the images come flashing back
7794005 we will play a few clips of david so people can understand why he was so loved he was always having a laugh with people
7794006 there are very big questions about when he went missing exactly and why nobody noticed

7794079 the hospitality hall of honor provides a vehicle for all of us to remember the icons of our industry and to allow our memories of them and their accomplishments to live on
7794080 it also provides the college with national and international exposure and an opportunity to establish relationships with industry leaders
7794081 i think the unique aspect of hall of honor is that it brings a number of the top leaders from the various sectors of the industry together in one place to have a dialogue with our students
7794082 the other exciting thing is that our students are running the event

7794108 4 hourly billing will no longer be the norm as lawyers develop a more systematic approach to law practice hourly billing will be less common more firms will develop task based fee structures and clients wanting to comparison shop will begin to demand that lawyers price their services in this way or at least offer it as an alternative further to the extent that this prediction comes to pass a number of other significant changes are very likely to occur lawyer productivity will no longer be measured in billable hours and entirely new models of firm organization professional development and advancement will be adopted
7794109 everybody that weve talked to has been enthusiastic everybody wishes that the legal profession as a whole would adopt it we havent had anybody resist
7794110 when i talk to any client i talk about alternative billing right up front
7794111 what i dislike about billing by the hour is that it immediately puts you at odds with your client
7794112 then i can really focus on being a better service provider
7794113 then were kind of stuck weve got to do the work
7794114 those are the assumptions if any of the assumptions turn out to be incorrect then we requote it
7794115 the only way large law firms can make more money is to hire more lawyers to bill more hours or raise rates
7794116 a lot of the alternative billing pressure is on the firms in the mega firm category that are increasingly finding theyre pricing themselves out of the market
7794117 if you can deliver on that level most clients will pay reasonable rates and prefer to do it on an hourly basis
7794118 theres a business acceptance of the hourly rate in the mind of the purchaser its still a sensible way to do it
7794119 how to create a life within the firm that permits lawyers particularly younger lawyers to lead lives in which there is time for family for career and for the community
7794120 you can have happier clients and happier lawyers if you abandon hourly billing
7794121 its easier administratively too have you ever tried to track your time
7794122 everybody likes the idea its a question of how do you make it work
7794123 now that the u s breached the agreed points the north is compelled to take
7794124 we urge north korea to resume disablement measures at an early date
7794125 i think this represents the biggest crisis to the denuclearization process since the feb 13 agreement
7794126 the norths kim jong il may have decided that he wont negotiate with the bush administration any more
7794127 based on the following simple reasoning you cant make a profit on fixed fees unless you know what your costs are you cant know what your costs are unless you know how much time and other dollars are consumed by the matter and there is no way to know how much time is being spent on matters if you dont keep track of hours

7794130 the germans had fantastic oil i think they change it every day
7794131 but most people wanted to help the environment and were happy to help
7794132 the oil gets very hot and so it gets very thin and then it goes into the centrifuge where it spins around and because it is very thin it separates all the water and all the food remains and all the clean oil comes out the bottom
7794133 i want my big cars to run on this system
7794134 i think it is very nice for our children the earth is telling us to do something i think it is the best thing to do
7794135 hopefully it will give people a bit of confidence to try alternative fuels maybe using bio diesel or converting their cars to vegetable oil
7794136 when i first did it i was really nervous that i was going to wreck my car but i am now confident that it is a really viable alternative as far as my driving life is concerned i really cant see why i would want to buy any fossil fuel ever again

7794142 we made it a point not to announce products here this is not our platform to announce products this is a platform for the ecosystem
7794143 we dont know what larrabee is because it hasnt shipped yet so we cant really talk about it
7794144 also by the time that larrabee ships nvidias technology will be so much more advanced
7794145 the reason why larrabee is so important to intel is because gpu computing is really important our gpus today are completely programmable completely general purpose and they support c the modern computing language
7794146 x86 is all about binary compatibility nobody ever said that if i built a new computer architecture the one i would create is x86 unless i wanted binary compatibility
7794147 is larrabee binary compatible with windows is larrabee binary compatible with x86 and 64 bit x86 is larrabee binary compatible with sse 3 4 5 6
7794148 it has tools and so does every other cpu arm powerpc cell they all have tools the reason why these tools exist is because most of them are high level language tools therefore i think that part of is a bit of a distraction and a bit of a smokescreen
7794149 we believe in heterogeneous computing the cpu and gpu should work together and the cpu is x86 so im x86 as well

7794170 rising fees and the cost of buying legal advice is the key concern among clients with over half 55 percent believing that the current growth in law firm fees was not sustainable
7794171 the study highlighted the ambivalence lawyers and their clients have to the hourly rate while most partners 82 and clients 86 believe the hourly rate will be alive and well in ten years time most acknowledged that it was not the most advantageous billing process for clients a third of clients 32 in turn expressed their deep dislike for the billable hour
7794172 we do refer to it as the st pete times forum that is our style we use forum on second reference and i suspect it shows up that way online in more informal useage
7794173 the problem occurs when the public has embraced the corporate name so that lincoln financial field in philadelphia is the linc in st petersburg tropicana field is called the trop so the media sounds at least awkward when they refuse to call it by the name that has become publicly accepted
7794174 at the inquirer we refused to use corporate names when naming rights were sold to bowl games nobody called it the fed ex orange bowl they called it the orange bowl
7794175 as it pertains to the pepsi center its the name of the convention center therefore we say it this is the reality we are now in sponsorships are everywhere and its hard to avoid it especially when the companys name is a part of the actual name of the building
7794176 wrigley field is common parlance nobody questions it its quaint for gosh sakes yet when you parse it wrigley field is about chewing gum so this is a wall that was breached 100 years ago my view americans get it that they live in a commercial culture and if you dont call it the pepsi center what do you call it its the pepsi center thats what we should call it
7794177 we will name a company when it is the only name of the place i
7794178 so we refer to the fiesta bowl not the tostitos fiesta bowl the sugar bowl not the allstate sugar bowl the austin city limits music festival not the at amp t austin city limits music festival the austin marathon not the at amp t austin marathon but we also have to refer to the pepsi center
7794179 i should add its important to make sure everyone on staff is aware of the guideline consistency is the key to making this work because you will get calls from big companies asking why you didnt say the name of their facility or event we get these calls all the time usually from the pr reps for the company
7794180 this has only come up once before when they were moving from mile high stadium to invesco field at mile high see reference above in this article kmgh did make a point to make sure we referred to it by using the entire name this was more about making sure the mile high fans didnt complain rather than the use of a commercial name ive never known the pepsi center to be called anything other than that we also have coors field where the rockies play these stadiums have no other name so im not sure what you would call them i dont see any issue for journalists in using these names in their reporting its not an endorsement for the product just a name for a venue
7794181 we use the official reference however in the second or third reference we may refer to the facility name only i e orange bowl versus the gatorade orange bowl
7794182 i didnt hear anything the first i heard was voices on the front so i opened my curtains and there was about five police cars an ambulance and they were giving attention to a gentleman lay out on a stretcher
7794183 the police chap said hed taken ill at the wheel
7794184 since the market sees that government actions are now useless everybody is on the dollar bid side
7794185 cpi is so high but they havent done anything to contain the inflation while other central banks in asia are hiking rates
7794186 and there is the anwar election today a lot of event risk
7794187 there is a lot of talk that the authorities may change the policy in october and bids are coming in heavy at 1 4180 per us dollar from those who think the singapore dollar should weaken further
7794188 we decided to immediately halt disablement work that had been underway in accordance with the october 3rd agreement
7794189 i really cant thats what this is all about i want to see that i can play i havent made my decision yet but i am going to do everything i can to play thats what this is all about
7794190 i have to go make this last trip and then get back with the team and figure it all out
7794191 this is all about me playing thats all i want to do
7794192 it could be career threatening if i did play its a possibility that possibility is still open

7794215 imagine a life where each hour was measured exactly the same it sounds like communism to me it doesnt matter how hard you work or the quality of your work you get paid the same if capitalism is all about incentives then we cannot help but pose the most fundamental question of all what is the incentive of the billable hour
7794216 the average american consumes 11 pounds of regular chocolate a year
7794217 so all that to say that if we are going to continue to eat chocolate it may as well be the healthiest chocolate not milk chocolate which is high in saturated fats but healthy dark chocolate that produces serotonen to makes you feel better and relaxed the same dark chocolate that opens your blood vessels and relieves pressure on your heart

7794222 when he got out he just cruised past the leader he knew he had the pace but he was surprised with the ease of it
7794223 im very happy with him he just keeps stepping up all the time
7794224 he had a chip in the knee done in his fifth start at ballina
7794225 i had it operated on and he was out for nine months it was not a matter of how long it takes for his recovery youve got to give them the time they need hes proving the point now the chip was almost like a blessing in disguise the horse has matured and grown since
7794226 were looking to step up were probably limited if we just field reserve grade and it has been decided to step up and go to a grade
7794227 we entered the nrrrl reserve grade comp in round seven last season when the second division competition folded
7794228 this year with a bit more time to organise ourselves we have qualified equal fourth in the nrrrl reserve grade competition
7794229 if we werent doing any good i think wed be looking at it and saying were not ready for the step up
7794230 but we believe we are and there are enough players in the area for both grades
7794231 weve certainly made that decision were talking with some sponsors and really its a matter of getting a coach early and getting credibility that were fair dinkum about it
7794232 im very confident that if we can front up with first grade and reserve grade well get in
7794233 theyve been pretty good to us letting us field a reserve grade side but we feel we need to step up
7794234 we get a very good following in terms of people coming to games about 300 for home games
7794235 we take a bus to every away game most of the clubs are p retty happy with us in that were a bit old school and tend to patronise other teams home games

7794258 i have always believed that the basic decency within this nation could one day enable us to lift the veil from our eyes and see each other for what we are as people not black or white not rich or poor not attending one church or another but as people standing equally together free of hate or suspicion

7794261 the parramatta rep side dominated the state cups for years and years and had a very big local competition
7794262 the juniors here are massive and we are now trying to rebuild the senior level and get the juniors to stay on to make the state side particularly strong because now we have the coach captain and two nsw players
7794263 when i first joined it was played by league and union players before training
7794264 in those 26 years it has been introduced to schools so now there are kids coming to me saying touch is their sport not league or union
7794265 i played at a state level for 16 years so it is different because i am still playing against a lot of these guys on a friday night at a club level
7794266 ive never really coached before so its a challenge because there are different styles from club to club and we need to find the style to best represent the state side
7794267 our goal is to remind americans not just republicans but the millions of democrats and independents who voted for sen clinton as well that while barack obama may be ready for his close up he is not ready to lead our country
7794268 even though im a democrat and dont always agree with john mccain i support him because he is willing to put his country first
7794269 we believe that many of sen clintons voters share the view that sen clinton herself expressed in the democratic primary that there were two candidates who were prepared for the presidency sen mccain and sen clinton and one who was not sen obama and we are telling those voters we appreciate and welcome their support

7794333 lenders have been trying to stay out of the best rate tables now they are competing again on price however lenders are still hedging against the future probability of default with stricter criteria

7794336 some people just dont have the time the finances or the family support to be able to travel up to brisbane for treatment every day
7794337 i was lucky i had all three a lot of support from my son and my wife robyn who drove me to treatment most days

7794381 i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming
7794382 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
7794383 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
7794384 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree

7794546 we zijn er zeker van dat de situatie op dit moment niet dreigend is voor de presidentskandidaat en alle mensen die momenteel aanwezig zijn bij de democratische conventie
7794547 whether we supported hillary or not we are one party
7794548 i find it perplexing that they make us feel like outliers or rogues because at the convention we plan to vote for the candidate we were elected to vote for
7794549 if he said clinton was on the shortlist and did not vet her at all what does that say about the veracity of his words my intent was to come to denver with an open mind how all of us would be treated is a measure of how inclusive obamas campaign and presidency would be his campaign is all about post partisan washington but if he cant even do it with his own party how can he do it as president
7794550 there are still some people around the country who are disappointed with obama but most everyone i talk to will come together
7794551 when it comes to supporting the next president in the fall i have no doubt they will do the right thing
7794552 i was a little apprehensive at first but everyone has the same goal defeat the republicans
7794553 i immediately talked to elijah cummings and the governor and said im on board
7794554 im trying to make sure we talk to clinton voters and listen to the issues that matter to them and we want to let them know that the same issues womens issues health care the economy that made them vote for hillary are the same issues barack obama will be strong on
7794555 its important that obama show respect not just for the candidate but for those who voted for the candidate

7794566 the fear is given our track record that the sailing will not be so smooth
7794567 we may return to the hoary days of the past which discredited the political class as a whole and prepared the ground for an extra constitutional intervention
7794568 this is a threat that looms over our heads permanently
7794569 beside a worsening of the economic situation the political instability could encourage the

7794578 at the moment weve got a chance of winning the league but that may peter out as the season goes on it depends on how we play
7794579 i had my only 19 fit players against bolton at the weekend and one of those obafemi martins has picked up a groin strain
7794580 he hurt himself in cheltenham at the back of his knee and was lame afterwards so we thought about retiring him
7794581 thankfully though he responded well to the treatment and is sound as a bell now he has come back fin very fresh and he seems to have really enjoyed his summer break
7794582 one of the great things about this week is that i can sneak in under the radar and let the boys who are still fighting it out for places worry about the ryder cup

7794601 so weve just got to get the appropriate medical data and speak to the afl and see where all of that sits
7794602 we speak to our doctors on a daily basis about how hes going and where hes at but until you sort of speak to the specialists about what that actually means its a pretty cloudy picture still at the moment
7794603 the polak scenario confuses the issue about where we are with key forwards and we need cleve to be able to get some sort of run without stopping with injury every third or fourth week so theres some question mark on our key forwards
7794604 we reckon that was developing along well but were obviously now one short on that

7794606 toen ik hoorde van de moord op benazir ben ik in huilen uitgebarsten en ik heb veertig dagen gerouwd
7794607 we hebben allemaal van benazir gehouden en daarvoor van haar vader
7794608 hij heeft zijn positie alleen maar te danken aan het feit dat hij met benazir was getrouwd zelf is hij niets hij is niet zoals de bhuttos daarom hebben we niet zo veel vertrouwen
7794609 benazir heeft vorig jaar gezegd dat opperrechter chaudhry haar rechter was en dat ze alle rechters in functie zou herstellen als ze aan de macht zou komen we kunnen nu niet beoordelen waar de aarzeling van zardari vandaan komt we kunnen het grote geheel niet overzien
7794610 we hopen dat de nieuwe regering ons banen gaat geven dat is het belangrijkste

7794617 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities
7794618 this measure has been effective on august 14 and related parties have been notified of it
7794619 north korea is trying to muddle through and delay as much as possible
7794620 at the same time this is a last ditch effort trying to somehow influence u s presidential politics
7794621 i see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the u s to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible
7794622 russia should have recognized the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia long ago and should have followed it up with defense cooperation and assistance treaties long ago too
7794623 we are having great difficulties with our water system and the lines are crumbling we have limited treatment of the water we dont have bad water we have two wells but we need more treatment than what we are currently doing so we are looking forward to having clean water in war that will not cause any problems
7794624 the west virginia public service commission ruled in our favor and the city purchased the war water works from the private firm in charleston
7794625 so immediately we started to apply for grants and loans for the water system through the infrastructure council and other available sources for grants
7794626 the city is providing water to more than just the individuals who live in the corporate limits of the city
7794627 we have water service to yukon and there are some sections of war that we hope to add into the system but i think phase two covers a section of excelsior bottom and yukon that includes in phase one and phase two the replacement of storage tanks we are putting in two new storage tanks one in phase one and one in phase two those storage tanks are more than 80 years old they are in terrible condition

7794634 in middle school your parents do more for you but in high school its all on you
7794635 to go from being big man on campus in middle school to little man on campus in high school is traumatic
7794636 at 14 students are right on the cusp some of them are still children you see girls carrying around stuffed animals and a lot of kids still watch cartoons but they are also in puberty and part of that means trying to assert themselves and forge an identity
7794637 theres a lot of pressure to figure out not only who you are but where you want to go in life
7794638 any point of transition in our lives is a major challenge if you think of marriage or divorce or having children going to college starting a new job any time we reach a point of transition we need support
7794639 the key to high school success is a strong ninth grade foundation
7794640 students who get off to a weak start easily get discouraged and have a lot of trouble in 10th and 11th grade its all about engagement and connection kids need to feel connected to school
7794641 they probably do like you but they are being tough on you because they want you to pass

7794651 at this point investigators are looking as this incident as self defense
7794652 quattlebaum approached another man and attempted to assault him and the man fearing for his safety stabbed him
7794653 it apparently hit one of the main arteries and he died of his injuries
7794654 i feel that he did act in self defense but he did have a weapon and my son did not
7794655 any way you look at it he took my childs life
7794656 this was not a person who is going to be disregarded by this family
7794657 i hope hes not going to be disregarded by the police
7794658 on the surface it appears clearly an ethics law has not been adhered to
7794659 regardless of what the federal government does this will be an issue taken up by the joint committee on legislative ethics
7794660 until hes charged he continues to be a trusted member of the maryland senate
7794661 im quite confident that before he would allow people to think less of the maryland senate he would take whatever measures are appropriate without me asking him to
7794662 i cant remember when somewhere around 70 miles per hour was the average speed of traffic on 95
7794663 there are certainly many drivers out there who have taken some steps to reduce the amount of gas they are burning that is one of the few good sides to very high gas prices that if people drive less were going to save lives

7794698 but they leaving for wicca so youre just as much to blame as buffy is
7794699 i would think it would have had the opposite effect considering christianity had been at the forefront of battling vampires for centuries
7794700 see the female empowering messages in the show have made women question their places in the hierarchies of various christian denominations
7794701 and the show portrayed wicca as a religion that encourages women in positions of leadership and greater participation
7794702 so theyre abandoning the christian faith and jumping to wicca
7794703 well maybe if the christian faiths treated women as equals instead of just subservient babymakers maybe theyd be more willing to stay
7794704 i have yet to bear a child onto the world

7794706 what with all the gays and terrorists and atheists running around
7794707 i just dont see why women should tolerate being second class citizens in an organization that is irrelevant to their modern needs
7794708 look if our judeo christian god wanted women in positions of power in his church he would have sent his only daughter to die for the sins of the world not his only son jesus
7794709 well what if god did send his only daughter except that the society at the time didnt want to hear her message and killed her for blasphemy and not knowing a womans place before she reached the popularity of jesus
7794710 then thats one more thing we can blame the jews for
7794711 but that doesnt absolve you or buffy for chipping away at our congregations females
7794712 so could you and sarah michelle gellar do us all a favor and stop luring christian women to your demonic way of life

7794721 trentanni fa la parabola di giovanni paolo i mostrato piuttosto che dato
7794722 ecco la sfida che il papa lancia ai partecipanti al meeting
7794723 io stesso condurr le mie pecore al pascolo e io le far riposare
7794724 se dovessi camminare in una valle oscura non temerei alcun male perch tu sei con me
7794725 il concilio desidera mite obbedienza ed umilt se non si umili impossibile obbedire noi dobbiamo avere i sentimenti di cristo il quale dice san paolo non cerc di piacere a se stesso ed ha obbedito fino alla morte
7794726 io ricordo come uno dei punti solenni della mia esistenza il momento in cui messe le mani in quelle del mio vescovo ho detto
7794727 io ho descritto il buon pastore ma non lo sono io ho mostrato la spiaggia della perfezione cui arrivare ma personalmente mi trovo ancora nei marosi dei miei difetti delle mie mancanze e allora per piacere perch non abbia a naufragare gettatemi una tavola di salvezza con le vostre preghiere
7794728 alla triplice negazione di pietro fa riscontro la triplice confessione damore in modo che la sua parola non obbedisca allamore meno di quanto ha obbedito al timore sia dunque prova del suo amore pascere il gregge del signore come rinnegare il pastore costitu la prova del suo timore
7794729 lamore per cristo deve tanto crescere in colui che pasce le sue pecore sino a giungere a quellardore spirituale che gli far vincere anche il naturale timore della morte in modo che egli sapr morire proprio perch vuole vivere con cristo
7794730 egli consacra loro la sua persona nellesercizio dellautorit e della carit si esigono tutte e due le cose che gli ubbidiscano e che le ami infatti la prima senza la seconda non sufficiente
7794731 di questa unit noi sappiamo di essere stati costituiti segno e strumento ed nostro proposito di dedicare ogni energia alla sua difesa ed al suo incremento

7794763 zc has been sending walter on secondment with various teams outside the country and he has attended some high level courses both at home and abroad over the years as we prepared him for this role
7794764 he is currently a holder of an international level 3 coaching course which is the highest qualification for anyone to coach a countrys national team it is unwarranted and unfortunate for people to disown their own and all this speculation that zc are looking at employing a foreign coach is totally unfounded and baseless
7794765 a foreign coach is not going to solve whatever problems we might be experiencing and zimbabwe has had foreign coaches in the past with very limited success and not just in cricket for that matter but football for instance

7794789 the definitive guide to the only business questions that matter
7794790 being successful in business is not a matter of being clever clever but plain and simple smart unfortunately being clever clever is much easier than plain and simple smart and that is what most business books focus on so what is different it gets you to ask yourself and your colleagues those questions that get to smart answers and helps you turn them into smart habits and smart actions oh and its a pleasure to read too
7794791 i sit in meetings discussing businesses almost every day sadly much of the talking just doesnt move anything forward kevin makes observations that are so sharp that it could save you months of wasted time if you really want to get straight to the point and sort your business out right now read this book as soon as possible
7794792 a refreshingly different kind of business book full of the straight talking no nonsense and practical advice we have come to expect from kevin duncan also lots of useful quotes throughout and a very handy at a glance collection of summaries from the works of other business gurus
7794793 far too much business analysis ends up in serving to over complicate the issues the bigger the company the more opinions on the table kevins clinical style cuts through all this static so you know exactly where you are with so much on at any given moment thats a really valuable quality these days for people who value their time and need to move forwards quickly then i strongly recommend you read this book
7794794 there are far too many so called business gurus who have too much to say about nothing but kevin duncan has proved that there is much we have yet to ask of business and ourselves his book so what really is the indispensable book for business we have searched for all these years if you only ever carry one book with you through your business life it really needs to be this one

7794826 the methods in this study can be used to forecast future costs and will provide important additional means for validating program evaluations that previously did not exist

7794902 i was talking to his manager who said he never got a chance to see it
7794903 thats a tragedy because its one of the best things hes ever done its the bernie we know and its the bernie we love
7794904 bernie was thinner because hed been sick off and on for a while so he wasnt that american football looking guy that i used to know
7794905 when the discussions were made about his decision to go part time last year he said it was only going to be for a short time and then he would let us know production was aware that it would be coming

7794910 i think its no secret and i have said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think that settlement activity is helpful
7794911 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7794912 the role of the leaders is to try to find a way to live in peace in the future and not to let any kind of noises that relate to the situation on the ground these days to enter the negotiation room
7794913 but at the end of the day the israeli governments policy is not to expand settlements not to build new settlements and not to confiscate palestinian land
7794914 despite the israeli governments renewed commitment during the annapolis summit to freeze all settlement activity the construction has continued and almost doubled in all of the settlements and outposts on both sides of the separation barrier
7794915 this construction undermines the palestinian partners creating facts on the ground that might prevent the possibility of a peace agreement

7794919 explosive harpoons and a large calibre rifle in the event that death was not instantaneous
7794920 lots of dead bodies will provide robust data so if you kill lots of whales then you will be able to get some information the question is whether the benefits outweigh the number of whales killed and how they were killed scientific whaling is not about science and there is no pressing conservation need that requires it to be done

7794932 employers need to take some responsibility for the impact that overwork can have on their employees health with our research showing that a significant amount of it workers find it difficult to maintain relationships or suffer ill health the uks culture of working long hours needs to be addressed as businesses look to derive as much value from their people assets as possible during lean times it is going to be imperative that we dont drive employees to burnout
7794933 despite the predicted downturn we are still suffering a skills crisis so it is essential that we dont disillusion our skilled workers at a time when we need them most

7794948 we felt it was a sound business decision to encourage the match as it helped us to illustrate the importance of the relationship foster an attitude of business collaboration and fortify the bond between the two cities this is crucial for our enterprise and others like us in the uk or the us it means that we can do anything together sell uk made cbrn suits throughout america or play against each other in a friendly rugby match
7794949 the inaugural mayors cup challenge match was a resounding success regardless of the final score of the match we had a fabulous experience in our sister city of dundee and a very successful trip on behalf of both alexandrias rugby team and its business community we feel that remploy frontlines support of alexandria rugby and the twinned cities programme will prove to be just as beneficial to our hometown as it is for dundee we look forward to building on what weve started over the years to come
7794950 remploy frontline is very proud to have been a part of this unique twinned city event we hope that our involvement in this programme encourages more businesses and organisations in both cities to look more closely at ways they can support the business and cultural exchanges based on remploy frontlines mission it would be great if alexandria and dundee can create more opportunities for otherwise disabled people and help further enrich their lives

7794971 considering the current economic downturn its surprising that the worth of the average family is set to rise over the next two decades

7794973 in the current housing market it has become increasingly difficult to sell property and unfortunately a worrying number of desperate sellers are resorting to hiding problems rather than paying money to have these problems rectified
7794974 buyers should thoroughly inspect the property before making an offer ask sellers to move furniture lift floor coverings and check that heating water and electricity is in working order
7794975 over time the mortgage market should continue to improve from its current position the number of products will steadily increase and rates will lower with increased competition between lenders regain a healthy appetite to lend with the maximum ltvs on offer largely determined by the future decline in property values

7794978 this was a surprising and exciting finding our direct observations appear to totally undermine a key rule that has withstood the test of time for over a century we will now make observations with a range of other chemicals and with other techniques to further elucidate the molecular basis for our observations text books will have to be rewritten to revise a rule that has been relied on for over a century advanced techniques such as the one we have developed should give much clearer insight into the action of a wide range of drug molecules which will be of significant interest to drug developers

7794987 despite finding that an increasing number of uk pr professionals are on the ball when it comes to online pr this survey confirms our experience that a high proportion are still more focussed on traditional media however given that this is most probably a reflection of client budget and resource allocations perhaps what we should be asking ourselves is what this says about uk business attitude towards online communications
7794988 after two seasons out of the game the physical and mental demands will be incredible but i know i still have some very good netball left in me
7794989 the program jane woodlands and her management crew have in place at adelaide is clearly world class and with that support i think i will be able to contribute a lot to the side
7794990 i have been keeping fit since 2006 but my fitness is now on a fast track so i can look the rest of the squad in the eyes when pre season starts in november
7794991 people will probably wonder why i have made the decision but netball has been increasingly on my mind over the past two seasons and as they always say you are a long time retired and i now know thats not where i want to be yet
7794992 the girls in the goal circle at the thunderbirds particularly kate beveridge and nat medhurst were red hot at the business end of the season just finished and breaking onto the court will be tough i know that but i am hungry to get back into the game
7794993 jane was a player i saw from an early age being in the sa programs and i thought she had a lot of ability and obviously at her height a lot of advantages over defenders
7794994 she is also very athletic for a tall player but she is aware she has a lot of hard work in front of her to become a regular on court and i think she will give it a very good go
7794995 having her bob up when she was not even on the radar will add some serious depth to our squad for the pre season and make things very competitive and that has to be good for everyone
7794996 despite the police initiatives to sensitise the community on how to be safe ignorance still remains the prime reason for the occurrence of this crime
7794997 the allegations are under investigation and will hopefully result in arrests in due course
7794998 the saps will not tolerate fraudulent cases to be reported through police systems i shall research each and every individual case until i am sure that a real crime is being committed
7794999 this is a flagrant abuse of the provisions of the prevention of organised crimes act

7795007 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
7795008 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
7795009 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
7795010 their big challenge is convincing people that they will continue to be active in politics and theyre going to continue to have a voice
7795011 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported
7795012 an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections and was seeking to redeem himself to those closest to him yes that is who i supported
7795013 she knew she should not have participated in him running for president with this bomb waiting to go off she did she kinda loses my sympathy
7795014 i believe we are all owed a huge apology not self serving claims for pity by both john and elizabeth edwards who both knew about the affair and both decided to go forward and seek the democratic candidacy regardless of the titanic risk
7795015 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
7795016 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
7795017 i thought it was very naive on both their parts
7795018 it would be very sad if he were the nominee of our party right now
7795019 we get a lot of emails from people living with diabetes who tell us that healthy balance is the only fruit juice theyve found that fits their diet
7795020 we want to eliminate the guesswork by placing nutrition information up front and at the same time create a peer to peer space online for those seeking healthier food choices outside of the juice category
7795021 we want to eliminate the guesswork by placing nutrition information up front
7795022 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
7795023 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
7795024 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
7795025 their big challenge is convincing people that they will continue to be active in politics and theyre going to continue to have a voice
7795026 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported

7795029 i believe we are all owed a huge apology not self serving claims for pity by both john and elizabeth edwards who both knew about the affair and both decided to go forward and seek the democratic candidacy regardless of the titanic risk
7795030 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this

7795035 we are seeing fewer first time buyers looking to purchase properties while sellers are becoming increasingly reluctant to buy first then sell there has also been slowdown in sales of entry level properties caused by the typical first time buyer who cant get a mortgage and this will have dire consequences for the scottish economy if the situation continues
7795036 as an edinburgh mp and homeowner we would hope you are listening to the concerns of your constituents about the fragile state of the citys property market and the difficulty that first time buyers are having in the current conditions we therefore urge you to temporarily suspend stamp duty levels to help kickstart our property market before it stagnates further
7795037 even just increasing the minimum threshold of stamp duty would have a huge effect by giving first time buyers access to extra funding to make their first purchase less of a financial burden it will release owners of entry level properties to move up the property ladder
7795038 and if properties in this sector start moving again it will help to get things moving again up all levels of the property ladder
7795039 its likely that the only major central bank to lower rates will be the bank of england and that gives the market something to focus on and i think thats whats hurt sterling
7795040 a lot of what bean had to say was what we already knew but he sounded very downbeat in general so i dont think its helped sterlings cause

7795044 his family friends neighbors business colleagues and all those who had the privilege of meeting him shall always recall his sincere warm nature and welcoming smile
7795045 we had to tell him where we came from who our parents were we had to pass the test fortunately mary was obviously italian and i got in when i told him my maiden name was severola and my father grew up at 13th and wharton
7795046 he was a charming courtly old fashioned gentleman he had wonderful explanations for everything he sold
7795047 he was an excellent role model he and my mother raised us with the best values he always encouraged the family to stay close

7795053 its not clear cut that he either will or he wont be able to play again
7795054 so weve just got to get the appropriate medical data and speak to the afl and see where all of that sits
7795055 we speak to our doctors on a daily basis about how hes going and where hes at but until you sort of speak to the specialists about what that actually means its a pretty cloudy picture still at the moment
7795056 the polak scenario confuses the issue about where we are with key forwards and we need cleve to be able to get some sort of run without stopping with injury every third or fourth week so theres some question mark on our key forwards
7795057 we reckon that was developing along well but were obviously now one short on that
7795058 the six weeks on crutches just felt like an eternity

7795060 at the moment im not pushing myself the plan would be to come back for super 14 next year and be fit and healthy by the time that comes around
7795061 its so nerve racking because i know how important these games are and i look back and think god i wish i could be out there and playing with them
7795062 im just so proud theyre doing so well and so proud robbies been able to bring them together and turn australian rugby from being so nervous and worried about the way we were playing into just passionate carefree players
7795063 if it was the first time i had done it i would have tried to get back for the wallaby tour which is only five six weeks away but im not going to try to rush it for that
7795064 im probably just going to take it a bit slower this time
7795065 last time i had the operation during the super 14 season i tried to really rush back and get back into playing football
7795066 this time im just gong to take it slowly and try to get it right for next year

7795068 we denken hier al zes maanden over na als mijn zonen de volgende stap willen zetten moet er meer geld en technologie tegenaan gegooid worden men kan van hen niet verwachten dat ze 44 00 lopen als ze een ganse winter moeten trainen in een zaal waar het vriest de infrastructuur in belgi is werkelijk ontoereikend en dus moeten we naar het buitenland trekken in de verenigde staten vinden we wat we zoeken
7795069 nog niet alles ligt vast maar er zijn verschillende opties florida alabama of texas na een proefperiode van vijf maanden zullen we de balans opmaken in het begin zal ik nog de helft van de tijd bij hen zijn we moeten nu enkel nog een oplossing uitdokteren met de universiteit van louvain la neuve zodat ze hun studies in de verenigde staten kunnen verderzetten in november zouden we graag vertrekken

7795073 two major factors were apparent to us when chris and the journeymaker 5 team approached us for support
7795074 first remploy frontline develops and manufactures world class flotation jackets ideally suited for champions like the journeymaker 5 and the waters in which they were racing second chris and his team are helping the uks many disabled children through enriching life experiences one of remploys precepts for helping disabled adults via employment opportunities
7795075 we were confident in our skills as experienced sailors and competitors but we knew we would need some excellent kit on board to help give us a leading edge
7795076 having a life jacket around me from our sister company remploy frontline made me feel safe and secure because i know what level of dedicated workmanship and quality went into producing this dependable deep water life jacket
7795077 we completed the challenge with the second fastest time ever
7795078 we beat the boats team with the previous record and they even brought in two top uk professional ultra endurance runners this year for the footrace part of the challenge
7795079 as time goes on there are always new needs for the trust to keep it going the need for more funding to continue to exist so that more disabled children across britain can have more enriched lives the trust gives kids an opportunity to do things and accomplish physical feats that they normally could not the trust like remploy helps encourage people with disabilities who are too often told what they cannot do instead of shown what they can do
7795080 although the workforce is primarily disabled we have some of the most highly skilled and motivated manufacturing experts in the world
7795081 we wanted to make buddybackup completely free for everyone to use and to remove the limitations that previously were only unlocked in the paid version we didnt think it was fair to do this when so many users had already bought the software so we decided to offer a refund to everyone who has paid and upgrade all current users to the full version of the software
7795082 we are contacting all users through their registration email to let them know they are entitled to a refund any unclaimed money will be donated to a multiple sclerosis charity and save the children because buddybackup is used by people from all over the world we wanted to give to global charities as well as the united kingdom and u s a we have large user bases in china vietnam india and many other eastern and european countries so we thought it right to find charities that would be relevant to all our users
7795083 whilst the deadline has passed for miners to lodge claims there are still many claims awaiting settlement some of which may take up to two years before a successful conclusion is reached therefore the site is still critical for solicitors to continue to track the progress of any outstanding claims it is now updated by capita who administer the services for berr providing information such as requests for more health information for each miner progress on claims and the details of the claims settlements
7795084 the big challenge for the team here at wtg was that we were dealing with a service coming close to the end of its lifecycle we had to deal with end users of the site who were used to the way it works but were migrating from entering claims to their management through the process of settlement the fact that we are able to ensure that the servers and software are supported and maintained for the life of the project while ensuring that solicitors can still access the information for their clients means that we were able to deliver against objective and budget
7795085 then the king will say to those on his right hand come you blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for i was hungry and you gave me food i was thirsty and you gave me drink i was a stranger and you took me in i was naked and you clothed me i was sick and you visited me i was in prison and you came to me
7795086 then the righteous will answer him saying lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you drink
7795087 and the king will answer and say to them assuredly i say to you inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren you did it to me matthew 25 34 39

7795109 this is a big change in blubber and if it continues it could make it more difficult for the whales to survive it indicates there have been some big changes in their ecosystem
7795110 i dont think you could measure this by other non lethal means
7795111 this is the first time a long term decline in energy storage in minke whales has been demonstrated
7795112 explosive harpoons and a large calibre rifle in the event that death was not instantaneous
7795113 lots of dead bodies will provide robust data so if you kill lots of whales then you will be able to get some information the question is whether the benefits outweigh the number of whales killed and how they were killed scientific whaling is not about science and there is no pressing conservation need that requires it to be done

7795128 one of the more depressing aspects of political discourse in britain over the past decade is the lack of memorable insults the late robin cook was the last politician willing and able to dish out really inventive invective and even he was mild compared with his more malicious predecessors in ten years tony blair has not delivered a single one line public insult worth remembering even the insults aimed at mr blair seem pallid thatchers reign left her festooned with nasty labels rhoda the rhino attila the hen virago intacta petain in petticoats and la pasionara of privilege poodle blair just doesnt have the same bite
7795129 this upfront payment allows the companys owners an early opportunity to parlay their equity stakes into cash if their companys stock falls after the public offering they already have benefited from some of their holdings potentially mitigating their losses often top executives in companies are prohibited from selling for a certain period after a public offering so an early dividend frees up some money beforehand a bit like getting a bonus before the year starts reducing the risk of a lower bonus if your performance tanks

7795140 of all the many masterpieces that could have been used this was the most regrettable and the least inspired choice
7795141 it was in very poor taste and brought about by those who have no regard for people in my constituency who have suffered

7795144 the video is not for general public use and has been used many times over the last few years to show to the tourism trade

7795176 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
7795177 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
7795178 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
7795179 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported

7795182 he said ive got to go home and cut the bumper off
7795183 he bought a case of peaches and a case of tomatoes
7795184 he brought some canned hams for every meal wed have sliced ham and peaches or sliced ham and tomatoes we did that until we ran out of ham or it turned green

7795195 strategy maps bilden oft den emotionalen ankerpunkt f r die balanced scorecard

7795199 zwar haben huber und ministerpr sident g nther beckstein am montag im kampf gegen die linkspartei wieder einmal einigkeit demonstriert aber es war nicht zu berh ren dass beckstein die kreuzzug losung seines tandempartners f r einen auf gut bayerisch ausgemachten schmarrn h lt und zum herunterstufen des themas linke mahnt denn offensichtlich ist mit dem kreuzritter erwin der fr here generalsekret r und wadenbei er durchgegangen wenn man sich einmal in etwas hineingesteigert hat wird oft bersehen dass die probleme und anliegen der menschen ganz woanders liegen schlie lich d rften selbst gl hende csu anh nger schwierigkeiten haben zu glauben dass der kommunismus ausgerechnet im freistaat vor der t r steht
7795200 in bayern wird die csu auch ohne die spd regieren k nnen was aber wenn die bundestagswahl 2009 nur eine wiederauflage der gro en koalition zulie e das b ndnis w rde angesichts der aufgerissenen gr ben keine weitere legislaturperiode berleben aber auch die bayerischen christsozialen m ssen sich fragen ob die sozialdemokraten tats chlich nur n tzliche idioten f r die lafontaine und gysi j nger sind wie es ihre generalsekret rin behauptet es ist ja nicht so dass die spd wegen der linkspartei nicht mehr gebraucht w rde im gegenteil sie ist eine zwar wackelnde aber wichtige demokratische bastion gegen den sich breit machenden linken populismus
7795201 die warnung vor einem linksruck z hlt seit eh und je zum wahlkampfrepertoire der csu auch liefert der hessische wortbruch der spd ja jede menge stoff um die gefahr eines langfristigen rot roten b ndnisses an die wand malen zu k nnen die csu w re t richt wenn sie dieses megathema links liegen lie e dar ber muss auch in einem landtagswahlkampf gesprochen werden wer wei vielleicht geht die taktische rechnung hubers auf nur je h rter die csu austeilt je mehr sie sich auf dieses eine thema st rzt desto deutlicher kommen auch ihre nervosit t und der mangel an einer inhaltlichen wahlkampfbotschaft zum vorschein

7795206 parents must keep open communication with their children look for signs school administrators across the country have been sweeping this issue under the rug for too long students should be educated about the harmful effects of bullying every school should declare no bullying begins today
7795207 helping your children cope with either being a bully or being a victim often requires outside assistance such as from your childs school or the community school is the most likely place for bullying to occur so discuss your concerns with your childs teachers and counselor and ask what they can do to help school personnel can be influential in helping a child modify his behavior take advantage of any psychological counseling services that may be offered at your childs school or in your community

7795210 not just about themselves but about the direction of the country as a whole and theyve got good reason to be worried the fact is the economy is not working for ordinary americans
7795211 when you say the fundamentals of the economy are sound and your top economic adviser is saying youve become a nation of whiners then you dont get it
7795212 youre out of touch and youre not hearing the stories of ordinary americans who are working hard every day but feel like theyre just treading water and in some cases sinking
7795213 john mccain has a compelling biography he served america with bravery and distinction and he deserves respect for that
7795214 but his policies dont deserve respect his ideas dont deserve respect because theyre the same old ideas weve seen out of george bush for the past eight years
7795215 the most important issues for me are affordable health care and getting out of the war
7795216 it is just to let people know there are people in town who like sen mccain
7795217 there was a period when we talked about men and women doing the same things as the basis for equality and i dont think its ever as easy as that
7795218 what were actually seeing now is a different kind of equality that comes out of complementarity and a more complex set of negotiations based on peoples different circumstances
7795219 the indications are very strong that theres a much greater sense of convergence between men and women now in the work that theyre doing

7795233 satellite radio for example charging a subscription makes about 118 per year per consumer over the air radio they generate about 80 per year per consumer pandora by their own testimony last year at a hearing its generating about 1 70 per listener per year there are no ads how are they generating money
7795234 it is their fault but on the flip side the reason why its their fault theyre not making as much as terrestrial radio
7795235 theyre not buying into the sleaze that terrestrial radio does and its very much the same kind of problem that an independent band faces when it needs to either do something that would potentially involve selling out or not being able to make music anymore
7795236 you have to take into account the audience size and you have to take into account customizability
7795237 and you have to take into account that you can almost create radio stations on the fly none of those things have been taken into account

7795245 we sent the transcript of the youtube audio posting to gsis vice president for public affairs elia valencerina and asked her to comment
7795246 the youtube video was uploaded on august 18 2008 a day before the 8th day of the supreme court panel investigation on the ca handling of the meralco case
7795247 in the accountholders profile page it says he or she is from the philippines is 47 years old and joined the networking site last august 8 2008
7795248 meralco officials confirmed to abs cbnnews com newsbreak that their board meetings are always recorded the minutes of the meeting however do not contain all the details and comments mentioned by the board members but the audio recordings are kept and filed
7795249 our courts are the most corrupt at any point in time and i have been in practice for several years today its worse than five years ago its worst at its worst stage and if its the most corrupt right now at this stage then meralco can also take advantage of that take advantage of this misfortune of this country if you want to survive i think thats to be blunt about it its not a question anymore of whats the legal issue its a question of how to take advantage of this corrupt system your enemies our enemies have been taking advantage of this corrupt judicial system we have lets open up our eyes
7795250 during everyday life we constantly evaluate social behaviour and this largely affects how we feel about ourselves and other people but the way we store and use information about our own and other peoples social behaviour are not well understood
7795251 this latest study used functional brain imaging to identify the circuits in the brain that underpin our ability to differentiate social behaviour that conforms to our values from behaviour that does not
7795252 the most distinctive feature of depressive disorders is an exaggerated negative attitude to oneself which is typically accompanied by feelings of guilt
7795253 now that we understand how the brains of healthy individuals respond to feelings of guilt we hope to be able to better understand why and where there are differences in brain activity in people suffering from or prone to depression
7795254 the brain region we have identified to be associated with proneness to guilt has been shown to be abnormally active in patients with severe depression in several previous studies but until now its involvement in guilt had been unknown
7795255 by translating these basic cognitive neuroscience insights into clinical research we now have the potential to discover new key functional anatomical characteristics of the brain that may lie behind depressive disorders
7795256 the results will hopefully make an important contribution to our understanding of the causes of depression that will ultimately allow new approaches to find better treatments and prevention
7795257 siempre hablamos de la dificultad de las primeras rondas pero al final casi nunca se pierde para m lo realmente dif cil es jugar bien estos partidos porque aunque vengas con confianza cuando llegas a un torneo nuevo necesitas un periodo de adaptaci n porque las condiciones son distintas
7795258 en algunos momentos he jugado de manera correcta el saque ha estado bien pero creo que me ha faltado esa intensidad que es la manera en la que me gusta jugar

7795260 ummm we dont know whats going on they were supposed to show up an hour ago but no ones here they should get here in about 10 15 minutes
7795261 look if we give a pass to every writer who wants to cover this we wouldnt make any money off of it
7795262 no but it should be open in about 10 15 minutes

7795266 but he proved us wrong with some sterling performances for the team he stood with the team during its tough times especially when we got relegated in 1994 because of his commitment and that of other teammates they ensured that chiefs bounced back immediately maybe if it was not for his input things could be different because maybe the team could be playing in the lower divisions
7795267 an oyster card wont tell you if someone has been cheating on his wife but it will show if hes been in one part of town when hes supposed to be somewhere else its an easy thing to confront your partner with it doesnt look like youve been snooping around too much
7795268 while starting to cheat might be simple keeping an affair going has become almost impossible i would regularly counsel couples where an affair had lasted more than three years today he or she will first get proof and confront the result is that the length of affairs has dropped dramatically looking at all the evidence it seems that the end of the secret affair is in sight
7795269 adulterers are neither kind nor good people so what sort of sympathy are we supposed to give them a good person doesnt betray their loved ones

7795290 the united states will continue to stand with the people of georgia and their democracy and to support its sovereignty and territorial integrity
7795291 we have more political legal grounds than kosovo to have our independence recognized
7795292 when i say we i mean both south ossetia and abkhazia
7795293 it is unjustified it is against the norms of international law and poses a challenge to the world community
7795294 theyre a matter for the international community through the mechanisms at the united nations
7795295 those two regions are part of u n resolutions resolutions by the way that russia has supported in the past

7795299 i am not an egoist we are ready to formulate a package for those affected by the project
7795300 with six people that escaped i would have to surmise there was some planning involved in this and thats what i want to have the investigation look into did staff miss signals did they miss signs that there was something going on did the actual day to day operations contribute to this in some shape or form
7795301 this money will help you meet your infrastructure priorities it will strengthen the ontario economy and it will create up to 11 000 jobs
7795302 we have too many priority projects there is much more to be done
7795303 as for the result of our provincial municipal review i can safely say from our end we wont be able to move as quickly as we first thought we could when it comes to taking on new financial obligations
7795304 its about fairness i believe ontarians need to know where all the federal parties stand on fairness for ontario
7795305 i tried to not fight but they were calling it on
7795306 theyre a really good team and theyre a lot bigger than our guys but were a team that wont back down
7795307 he crossed the line with that hit he tried to take the kids head off and he did a pretty good job of it
7795308 that might have played a part in setting the tone of the game
7795309 theres a lot of teams that are a lot bigger and tougher than them back east
7795310 with the success theyve had theres no selfish guys on this team
7795311 i had the opportunity to work with the first group on offence completed some throws and threw three touchdown passes its a good situation to be in but i know i have to go out and not press too much but getting this opportunity says a lot about the coaching staff and my new teammates
7795312 because of the injury situation we had to alter our offence
7795313 when we traded kerry joseph to toronto in march we felt wed have a good offensive line and a receiving corps equal to the better groups in the league but who couldve predicted losing half our offence to injury
7795314 so weve had to change our strategy and need an athletic quarterback to give us pass rush options and open things up for running back wes cates
7795315 any time you make a change of this magnitude with a person as highly respected as marcus theres going to be emotion
7795316 in the big picture you understand that players are people who wear jerseys for a living they have strong relationships and theres going to be a reaction
7795317 but we have a strong group and theyll bounce back and you could see that yesterday
7795318 we are confident they will strengthen township rollers this season

7795338 although we would have loved to ship this service in the end the android team decided to pull the api instead of exposing users to risk and breaking compatibility with a future more secure version of the feature

7795344 haunting melodies and bittersweet lyrics that are soulful and insightful
7795345 the new survey clearly shows that town halls hugely resent having to pass the electoral roll to direct marketing companies
7795346 most people hate junk mail and cold calling and councils dont want to be a part of the process that generates money for junk mail companies in this way
7795347 selling the electoral roll undermines democracy dissuades people from voting and gives people the impression that the council is profiting from selling their personal information ministers must change the law to ban junk mail firms from getting their information through the electoral roll
7795348 keeping two separate electoral rolls is fiddly costly and frankly a pain in the backside for councils a change in the law would cut down on the junk mail that can infuriate homeowners and would also be a way of boosting the number of people who register to vote at a time when turnout is at an all time low
7795349 we have constantly argued that the electoral register should be used for one purpose only namely the conduct of elections
7795350 other uses compromise the registers democratic legitimacy and clearly act as a significant deterrent to the aim of persuading all eligible electors to register the results of this survey are therefore not at all surprising
7795351 what is surprising is that despite these and similar findings and the clear recommendation from the data sharing review there is still no real indication that the government will act to remove the need for an edited register and the use of electoral registration information for such purposes
7795352 this is a great way of saving energy and saving our tenants some money on their bills

7795354 the monthly numbers of approvals for house purchase which have fallen by some two thirds over the last year levelled off in july

7795369 this curriculum respects a students right to choose whether or not to sign an organ donor card
7795370 but were convinced that if we present the information fairly most people decide yes
7795371 its reality look at us were both teenagers and organ donations saved our lives
7795372 but how to help students become civically engaged enough to want to become their brothers keeper
7795373 were trying to promote awareness among students who are at least 16 old enough to sign an organ donor card but its not as if they have to sign one to get an a in the course
7795374 we want to explode a number of the myths about organ donation that its against certain religions or that it interferes with funeral preparations or that doctors wont work as hard to save you if youve signed a donor card

7795389 esta semana trataremos de corregir los errores que hemos tenido y mejorar para afrontar un partido complicado como el que vamos a jugar en pamplona
7795390 lo de la pretemporada esta ah pero tambi n hay muchos equipos que pierden partidos en la pretemporada y eso te obliga a mejorar pero ahora lo importante es como he dicho antes es el partido del domingo
7795391 estuvimos muy cerca llevarnos el t tulo ante un equipo que jugaron a un grand simo nivel durante todo el campeonato y estamos satisfechos de la entrega del resultado y de las situaciones
7795392 hemos sufrido con el equipo para llegar hasta ah y al final hemos podido tener un resultado muy positivo y acabar con muy buenas sensaciones

7795401 if we could prevent these infections in the first place or detect them sooner we might one day be able to prevent some of these premature births
7795402 to find that this amniotic compartment which we have traditionally viewed as somewhat sacrosanct is infected significantly more often than we thought is a little shocking
7795403 weve become very good at growing some bacterial species what might be called the weeds of the microbial world
7795404 but many other species cant be cultured by current methods
7795405 although we know now that humans should respect and even cherish their microbial symbionts
7795406 this type of infection reflects a situation in which our microbial companions have overstepped their bounds something has gone awry with this balance
7795407 these abnormal features of tumor vessels impair delivery of circulating chemotherapeutic drugs to the actual tumor site
7795408 because high cell density increases contractility across the entire cell layer these findings suggested that tumor capillary cells are inherently hyper contractile
7795409 in this study weve uncovered a previously unrecognized role for tumor capillary cell mechanosensing and contractility in the formation of irregular tumor vessels and have identified potential new targets for vascular normalization therapy that might be implemented in the clinic someday
7795410 we are pleased to have acquired sareums structure based drug discovery assets and welcome their team and their clients to biofocus dpi
7795411 the assets and expertise acquired from sareum strengthen our drug discovery adding a novel technology that our customers are expressing interest in we look forward to extending and expanding this business within the biofocus dpi client base
7795412 i am confident that the acquisition of sareums expertise in structure based drug discovery services will further enhance biofocus dpis leading position in global drug discovery service provision
7795413 who say that taking away consumers right to sue would also take away a strong incentive for the fda and the pharmaceutical industry to be open about a drugs potential for causing harm
7795414 havent always been completely open or correct in their labeling even when the risk of lawsuits has been present
7795415 preserving the right of consumers to sue will keep federal agencies and manufacturers more honest and the public more protected
7795416 risks significant misuse of funds in this 39 billion program

7795419 orally instructed auditors to deviate from written policies by making determinations based primarily on the limited medical records available from equipment suppliers
7795420 i want to know what happened whos responsible who will be held accountable and what hhs secretary mike leavitt will do about it
7795421 if people cooked the books manipulated the methodology or told the contractor to ignore the rules those individuals need to take the heat
7795422 if this is true this is an outrageous and unforgivable stunt cracking down on fraud should be a top priority for medicare not fixing numbers to make an agency look better
7795423 i expect hearings and i expect answers truthful answers from medicare about this report
7795424 an unsupported extrapolation at this time because the report only cited percentages
7795425 we have far exceeded our expectations having reduced the error rate beyond the 2006 goal of 5
7795426 exceeded only by a staggering lack of oversight by congress and by medicares own failure to protect the program against open thievery
7795427 cooking the books proves true heads should roll at cms
7795428 adequately fund investigations and after medical industry lobbyists complained about a new law requiring competitive bidding congress reneged on the deal
7795429 politicos lingering around washington can barely keep a straight face as they claim to be shocked
7795430 his ilk consistently claim that medicare is a model for government run universal health care because it spends less on overhead than the private sector
7795431 insurance companies spend money to screen their claims for fraud
7795432 medicare automatically pays more than 95 of the bills it receives
7795433 this lack of scrutiny reduces overhead but it makes the program highly vulnerable to abuse
7795434 the real reason liberals like mr stark are outraged is because they want to claim one of medicares vices as a virtue to help along their health care ambitions
7795435 shows that taxpayers will be literally poorer if stark gets his way

7795444 this is about giving consumers something new that the supermarket chains wont tell them who is the cheapest overall in their area
7795445 this is a government who actually believes that greater competition and transparency will benefit the consumer and thats where we are focused
7795446 the sad reality is that this website could have a detrimental impact on the supermarket sector by providing free promotion to the major supermarket retailers
7795447 the website does not take into account the consumer savings from the convenience of independent stores and it does not take into account the price variations which exist within the independent sector and at different coles and woolworths stores
7795448 while the website figures will move around youd expect the level of interest to spike at the beginning of each month when the new monthly survey information is uploaded by the accc

7795517 one example is to use the browser as a very simple photoshop

7795521 theres still a lot of room for improvement to benchmark javascript
7795522 but as an application developer the only benchmark you care about is how your application runs
7795523 theres no theoretical reason why it cant be as sharp and approach native code speeds in two to four years
7795524 all browsers have improved their javascript speed we focused on our tests
7795525 if you do the aggregate speedup which is the speedup for each test divided by the number of tests it is about 2 4 x faster

7795560 first and foremost telecom carriers need to differentiate their approach to the advertising market
7795561 this is particularly important given the fact that advertising money is being pursued by their immediate telecom competitors consumer device manufacturers such as nokia and internet related companies like google yahoo myspace and microsoft
7795562 if a carrier can execute its advertising strategy well and overcome the key challenges it could move quickly to reap the benefits
7795563 carriers can expect to become an integral part of consumers lifestyles when they can reliably deliver relevant advertisements to them this will require closer cooperation and partnerships with other businesses such as retailers restaurants and cinemas

7795748 la ca da del precio de este mes no ha venido acompa ada de un aumento de las cifras de ventas lo que demuestra que el problema no se encuentra fundamentalmente en el precio del litro de combustible sino en ciertas circunstancias coyunturales
7795749 we are very excited about integrating this technology into our software and product offering
7795750 it gives our customers the extremely useful options they have been asking for in secure access control and presents club sentry with a number of new opportunities for introducing its software to new market segments
7795751 the rfid proximity sensor and key fobs are a more secure alternative to a bar code reader and bar coded id cards at the check in desk in that it cannot be copied and re printed like a bar coded id card

7795753 we are very optimistic about the prospects for this functionality in the residential market
7795754 with the addition of the proximity technology we can handle entry to the residential club as well as entry to the property whether unlocking a door or opening a gate the club sentry billing module allows monthly fees common charges and fines to be assessed and collected by invoice credit card or eft

7795785 we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew deploy their oxygen masks and they cant be making pa announcements while they have their oxygen masks on

7795844 as an example tomato production in the us consumes four times as many calories as the calorific value of the tomatoes created casava production in tanzania where 23 times the calorific value is gained for each calorie of human energy input

7795859 this potent new immunomodulator which is in the same class as thalidomide and lenalidomide will hopefully be successful in treating patients who have relapsed or who dont respond to currently available treatment options we are excited to be testing pomalidomide in this context and are optimistic that it will meaningfully add to our therapeutic options for our patients
7795860 this new clinical trial brings the total number of studies that the mmrc has initiated to fourteen we are thrilled to advance this study in our mission to identify and prioritize the most promising treatments for patients with multiple myeloma

7795862 the strain of listeria bacteria which is linked to the illness and death of several consumers matches the listeria strain identified in some maple leaf food products in two cases
7795863 if there is any question in the consumers mind about any product from that plant then the onus is on us and the cfia to act decisively and swiftly to restore consumer confidence
7795864 from our standpoint this is the right thing to do our actions are guided by putting public health first
7795865 the chronic features of tuberculosis in these patients suggest that extensively drug resistant tuberculosis may be acquired through previous treatments that include second line drugs aggressive management of this infectious disease is feasible and can prevent high mortality rates and further transmission of drug resistant strains
7795866 48 per cent of patients with xdr tuberculosis often termed untreatable in press reports responded favourably to treatment
7795867 keshavjee and colleagues have shown that both mdr and xdr tuberculosis can be cured with aggressive treatment with use of the most effective antituberculosis drugs available
7795868 although we should be cautious in our hope to attain such success rates in settings with a high prevalence of hiv aggressive treatment is the logical strategy to provide the best chance of cure while avoiding the creation of additional drug resistance
7795869 treatment of extensively drug resistant tuberculosis in tomsk russia a retrospective cohort study
7795870 we are very pleased with the outcome of this exploratory study
7795871 we are particularly interested in the responses around skin quality as this is the first time we have assessed the isolagen therapy for these important skin characteristics
7795872 as the principal investigator in the isolagen it r 007 trial i am optimistic about the study results which show improvement in patients facial appearance
7795873 the results suggest that improvements in both skin texture and contour may be achieved following isolagen treatment i believe this outcome is a unique finding in the cosmetic injectable treatment market utilizing the subjects own living cells to provide the basis for improvement
7795874 in spite of the early termination of the study ati 7505 achieved statistical significance at the studys primary endpoint in the 80 mg twice daily dose in addition all doses tested demonstrated a clinically meaningful increase in spontaneous bowel movements over baseline compared to placebo after one week of treatment
7795875 from a tolerability perspective ati 7505 improved patients ability to experience spontaneous bowel movements with virtually no reports of diarrhea or nausea from the patients in this trial
7795876 as gratifying as these results are particularly when coupled to the recently announced results of the thorough qt study conducted on ati 7505 aryx remains committed to focusing our primary efforts on producing the clinical trial results necessary to partner our other two phase 2 clinical candidates our oral anticoagulant agent ati 5923 and our oral anti arrhythmic agent ati 2042
7795877 while we will seek a new development partner for ati 7505 our partnering efforts will remain focused on maximizing the value of ati 5923 and ati 2042 in the meantime we will continue to analyze the results of this chronic constipation study so they may be presented to potential partners along with the rest of the substantial data supporting ati 7505
7795878 the sheer amount of diversity the students discovered surprised everybody
7795879 we have only just begun to tap the potential of these microorganisms

7795882 the most common form plaque psoriasis appears as raised red patches or lesions covered with a silvery white buildup of dead skin cells called scale
7795883 it seems that psoriasis is most common in caucasians and slightly less common in african americans worldwide psoriasis is most common in scandinavia and other parts of northern europe it appears to be far less common among asians and is rare in native americans
7795884 no special blood tests or diagnostic tools exist to diagnose psoriasis the physician or other health care provider usually examines the affected skin and decides if it is from psoriasis less often the physician examines a piece of skin biopsy under the microscope
7795885 the growing number of lupus clinical trials and the rising level of interest among people with lupus about clinical research led us to the decision to create this new center
7795886 we have already seen an increase in demand for people with lupus to serve as study volunteers at the same time people with lupus have voiced frustration in finding trusted information to make informed decisions about joining a trial the ccte will help meet those needs
7795887 whether to participate in a clinical trial at a given time is a very personal decision
7795888 sometimes it makes sense to participate if current treatments arent working if there are side effects of the treatments a person is taking or just because its clear that without clinical trials there wont be progress in treating lupus but not everyone is a candidate for a clinical trial people need to talk to their doctor but also do their homework to learn as much as they can about whats involved before they volunteer for a clinical trial the lupus foundation of americas ccte provides a way for them to get that information from a source they trust

7795899 from the loftiest figure to ordinary people he met everybody at the same level it is a rare skill but davy had it in spadefuls
7795900 i remember david for his smile his singing the general sense of well being he brought into meetings and the wonderful sense of balance and ease he brought to our discussions and various efforts throughout the 12 or 13 years in our work in field day
7795901 he had an idea of to use the term of his friend seamus heaney a republic of conscience an idea of a freedom of spirit in speech that would be insulted by the kinds of sectarian boundaries which distinguished northern ireland particularly at that time
7795902 he was wonderful company he sang as naturally as he breathed he had stories and anecdotes galore and he simply was a golden presence in the room when he was there
7795903 he was a great example for the rest of us singers artists writers and listeners there was something about davy hammond that was very special

7795907 is that it violates a lot of classic principles yet it succeeds in delivering the necessary functions in a contextual and compact way
7795908 when the user mouses over a book a contextual popup comes up containing information about the book and a set of associated actions part of the popup is a button menu sort of like a button and combo box widget that allows the user to provide information about what he or she did with the book the first thing to note is that combination of a button in a menu is not standard yet it makes sense because it saves a click for the most important action secondly the menu is effectively a popup within a popup which is a big no no in the classic world but works well in this context the elements of the menu are not buttons but check boxes which allow multiple selection another violation of classic user interface elements but which works very well in this context what is remarkable is how intuitive this gadget is you are interacting with it in the context of a book and each choice is simple and clear such clarity and simplicity was never present in the old interfaces clearly this new approach to uis is great and early adopters are loving it but will it cross over to the mainstream
7795909 amazon can make shelfari the choice of casual book lovers who see a button on amazon com and click on it
7795910 it is unfortunate that a major film studio would choose to exploit an ethnic slur as a sensational promotion for a movie mainstreaming a bigoted term in this manner will only serve to legitimise and normalise anti muslim prejudice in our society
7795911 not to force the artist to alter her work but instead to use the occasion of that work as an entry point for meaningful debate and discussion

7795918 it is ludicrous to say that the good people of lyme regis need to be protected from seeing my nipples
7795919 a few people on the organising committee told me that my painting could not be shown because my nipples were too erect
7795920 it is not as if i am knocking things off shelves with them when i go shopping
7795921 i use myself as the model in front of a mirror because it saves paying someone else and i paint late at night when i cannot expect another model to pose for me
7795922 i cannot apologise for my nipples being erect because luckily they have always looked this way
7795923 this is not hard or even soft porn it is just a beautiful sensual painting with a lot of feeling in it
7795924 nudes have been exhibited in galleries for hundreds of years the paintings in londons national gallery are far more explicit than this do they want to close that down too
7795925 i cannot imagine anyone being offended in this day and age when we have page 3 girls in newspapers
7795926 i am well known for my work in town and everyone who has seen the painting in my gallery thinks it is harmless and that the ban is ridiculous noone has ever objected to any of my work before
7795927 they should be promoting local artists rather than squashing them this is how i earn a living and i am very passionate about my art
7795928 the painting is called possession it is a serious work and shows a man holding his lover tightly as if he owns her while she appears lovey dovey
7795929 this might be small town prudery but it is just a storm in a teacup
7795930 at this time of year the majority of our visitors are not artists they are holidaymakers families with young children who come off the beach and see the gallery

7795954 there was no assurance we were going to win the war
7795955 it changed the balance of power for all the years since then it changed science energy physics medicine environmental science the way nations conduct peace and war and even the way we live our everyday lives
7795956 we at the department are very committed to preserving the significance of the reactor and making it more accessible

7795982 the second is a declaration on a strategic cooperation between the united states and poland
7795983 this capability will be very important to our nato allies for their security just as its very important for the united states and poland
7795984 as if on cue the iranians just in the last couple of weeks have launched a space launch vehicle which again demonstrates additional capabilities and underscores the concerns we have about the growing missile threat from countries like iran
7795985 not limited to iran i should hasten to add but its certainly an additional matter
7795986 its a pretty broad coverage in terms of the subject matter in that document and i think its befitting of the fact that this is going to be a substantially changed relationship between the united states and poland in that you will have a much greater level of defense cooperation

7796003 in 1995 we scored 75 the figure dropped to 69 in 2001 and then 59 in 2006 i dont think a 70 year old person who voted for museveni in 1995 changed his mind in 2006 because old people are so resistant to change the fact is that more youth have overtime reached voting age and their issues are not being addressed
7796004 in government policies and plans rural youth is also being included so that every section of the society can get equal opportunity for higher education
7796005 this early investment in higher education is paying off today as we move higher and higher up the value chain in the global knowledge economy our tasks and challenges are daunting but so are the opportunities
7796006 we are one of youngest nations in the world and according to observers india has the potential to create over 500 million trained people by the year 2020 that would be over a fourth of the global workforce this big and unique opportunity for india will come from an education revolution that we must undertake as our most important national endeavour
7796007 our governments effort has been to create the next big wave of investment in higher education and the 11th five year plan now under implementation is basically a knowledge investment plan we have significantly increased allocations to the education sector with a five fold increase to an unprecedented rs 2 75 000 crore
7796008 we are putting in place an integrated national knowledge network that would have nodes to all major institutions of higher education and learning this network would help our institutions of higher learning to connect with each other and carry on the relevant interdisciplinary dialogue
7796009 as we near what we originally expected to be the full length of the mission we are all thrilled with how well the mission is going

7796011 the appeal of stone soup is that this deep area may collect and concentrate different kinds of materials
7796012 the trough between polygons is sort of a trap where things can accumulate
7796013 over a long timescale there may even be circulation of material sinking at the margins and rising at the center
7796014 we had a shootout between stone soup and white stuff in a trench called upper cupboard
7796015 if we had been able to confirm that the white material was a salt rich deposit we would have analyzed that but we were unable to confirm that with various methods

7796022 during times when economic conditions are volatile companies step up efforts to stress the importance of purchasing tickets in advance in order to use discount tickets in a negotiated travel program
7796023 our data shows that during the second quarter of 2008 89 percent of tickets purchased were domestic discount coach fares this shows that more travelers purchased tickets in advance these subtle changes can translate into significant savings 17 percent or more in some cases looking at the first six months of 2008 the companies that had travelers purchase 8 14 days in advance rather than 0 7 days in advance saved an average of 49 per segment
7796024 the flight attendant has to deal with a bunch of surly passengers its a nasty work environment

7796096 this is about giving consumers something new that the supermarket chains wont tell them who is the cheapest overall in their area
7796097 this is a government who actually believes that greater competition and transparency will benefit the consumer and thats where we are focused
7796098 the sad reality is that this website could have a detrimental impact on the supermarket sector by providing free promotion to the major supermarket retailers
7796099 the website does not take into account the consumer savings from the convenience of independent stores and it does not take into account the price variations which exist within the independent sector and at different coles and woolworths stores

7796111 the presence of the international community in afghanistan must be reviewed through a mutual agreement
7796112 the authorities and responsibilities of the international forces in afghanistan must be regulated through a status of force agreement consistent with both international and afghan laws
7796113 air strikes on civilian targets unco ordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians must be stopped
7796114 in afghanistan on the basis of a united nations mandate and has been invited there by the government of afghanistan
7796115 the united nations has always made clear that civilian casualties are unacceptable they undermine the trust and confidence of the afghan people
7796116 any civilian casualty killed is one civilian casualty too many and every effort that can be made must be made to ensure the safety and welfare of the civilian population
7796117 with either good or bad intelligence the most important lesson to learn is that we need to rely more on ground troops
7796118 since nato and the coalition dont have these troops the reliance on air support is greater so if they can increase their ground operations it would probably alleviate some of these problems
7796119 regretfully when a bombing takes place an aerial bombing or any kind of smart bombing definitely you will have regretful casualities
7796120 unfortunately our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids
7796121 consumers will not all adopt social media in the same way nor will their social media habits stay consistent the onus will be on each business to understand the expectations and interactions of their particular audiences with respect to social media

7796128 dr nelsons doing a good job under difficult circumstances and the last thing we want to do is develop a tradition of knifing our leaders
7796129 i took him at his word at that and my presumption is that he will indeed be leaving politics
7796130 but he will make his position clear i suspect in the next two or three weeks
7796131 its a careless act but it amounts to a criminal offence
7796132 it seems to me this person has escaped from the country from being dealt with by law its very unfortunate
7796133 if one of their citizens has committed an offence to show they australia are good people that they are law abiding citizens a law enforcing country they must demonstrate it is true that they live by their words

7796135 two or three months ago the body was starting to not recover as well as it has in the past and it took me a lot longer to get up throughout the week
7796136 ive never had the quickest legs and theyre slowly starting to go as well
7796137 ive always pretty much wanted to go out on my own terms i dont think theres anything worse than going that extra year or two and end up running around in the vfl thats something i didnt want to do
7796138 i think when you get to this stage of your career you know deep down when the right time is to retire
7796139 its such a strong quick game these days and youve really got to be on your toes
7796140 from a personal point of view i still feel like ive got some time left
7796141 im not hanging my hat on getting a spot on at an afl club next year but im definitely putting my hand up to say look my mind feels good my body feels good i want to continue playing
7796142 i certainly think there is a huge amount of risk involved in this now
7796143 were talking a matter of weeks the whole situation has very much swung in the opposite direction
7796144 we are saying that between six weeks and six months after the child is born then a parenting order will be worked out by the family court that takes into account all of the factors in the initial contract
7796145 police will use all means to restore normalcy as soon as possible
7796146 police will take decisive action against the protesters government restraint is almost over
7796147 i ask all the protesters who have been blockading or occupying government offices that you still have a chance to withdraw and go back to your homes
7796148 i will not resign i will stay to protect this country
7796149 the military will not allow the protesters to take control of the country however it is not the time yet for military force
7796150 today is judgement day i am ready if they want to arrest me
7796151 the easiest way to restore normalcy is for prime minister samak to quit
7796152 if we do not receive a clear and positive response we will prolong the rally to the next day and mobilise more protesters
7796153 the military will not stage a coup detat the public must not panic and must carry on their daily lives the army will not get involved in politics
7796154 it has been fully established that between august 7 and 12 georgias armed forces invaded the territory of the unrecognised republic with the aim of fully annihilating the ossetian ethnic group living in south ossetia
7796155 they spared no one we found a woman who had been killed with a shot to the head she was eight months pregnant her unborn child died too
7796156 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia

7796170 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by the time of christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7796171 its fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7796172 some people have said its as big a financial shock as the great depression of the thirties and as far as the oil shock goes the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal in the 1970s
7796173 its going to be a tricky period household real income is very low that will make it difficult for households and there are difficult social issues that will arise
7796174 there are periods when markets look like they are getting better then another grenade explodes another bout of fear of sustainability of some financial institutions maybe intervention by the authorities
7796175 it has been very much ebb and flow and the mood here is very much one of financial caution as regards the next year we have our fingers crossed but there is the recognition there is still quite a long way to go yet
7796176 one would hope that the conditions in credit markets should gradually start to improve and those two factors will help to ensure growth will start to pick up as we go through next year
7796177 its going to be a tricky period household real income is very low that will make it difficult for households and there are difficult social issues that will arise
7796178 but the important thing is people realise this is just a transitory period of subdued of growth and we will get through the other side and growth will resume to more normal levels

7796217 from birth i was compassionate and always had great care for animals after seeing love amp mercy i could no longer eat meat now i have been vegetarian for more than three years
7796218 in this life we get a good opportunity to follow buddhism so we should use this life to do something for others
7796219 this is my first time ever ordering veg chowmein always before i had chicken or buff
7796220 i cant even think of meat anymore now my body feels much lighter and my mind is more clear
7796221 if i take non veg my mind can be very crazy i have more mental peace being vegetarian if you stop the killing it would be nice for the animals if you take non veg you cant get a peaceful life you cant get a good feeling inside your heart
7796222 some friends are using non veg but i suggested they stop this this way we can change society and the world
7796223 its very difficult in china we have to support each other so zhangzan opened a vegetarian restaurant in beijing

7796290 to measure the potential growth associated with hedging weather risk we first quantified the weather sensitivity of several countries around the world
7796291 the united states economy has a total weather sensitivity of roughly 2 5 trillion 23 percent of the national economy

7796293 with weather coverage brazils economy is estimated to grow by 16 billion or 2 3 percent
7796294 indias economy could grow by as much as 2 billion or 2 2 percent if all of the countries included in the study hedged all of their weather risk global output would grow by an estimated 258 billion

7796305 part of the money raised should be used to immediately help those struggling with rising fuel bills and should be particularly targeted at families in or facing fuel poverty
7796306 however the best strategy to eliminate fuel poverty forever is to ensure every home is insulated and energy efficient to the highest standards
7796307 therefore much of the money raised should be used to kickstart a national programme of home energy efficiency and installing renewable energy starting with the homes of the fuel poor

7796319 on average profits are up 1 per cent and earnings per share are up 3 per cent

7796321 a lot of companies are basically clearing the decks getting the writedowns out of the way the outlook statements are reasonably positive
7796322 is that it violates a lot of classic principles yet it succeeds in delivering the necessary functions in a contextual and compact way
7796323 when the user mouses over a book a contextual popup comes up containing information about the book and a set of associated actions part of the popup is a button menu sort of like a button and combo box widget that allows the user to provide information about what he or she did with the book the first thing to note is that combination of a button in a menu is not standard yet it makes sense because it saves a click for the most important action secondly the menu is effectively a popup within a popup which is a big no no in the classic world but works well in this context the elements of the menu are not buttons but check boxes which allow multiple selection another violation of classic user interface elements but which works very well in this context what is remarkable is how intuitive this gadget is you are interacting with it in the context of a book and each choice is simple and clear such clarity and simplicity was never present in the old interfaces clearly this new approach to uis is great and early adopters are loving it but will it cross over to the mainstream

7796331 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger

7796337 the camp was really nice i got a chance to visit all over china and to meet people from all over the world
7796338 a special part of the camp that i enjoyed was that we got to share our future goals with the other members of the camp
7796339 my favourite part of the games was the opening ceremony it was the greatest display that i had ever seen and from the other opening ceremonies of the other olympics that i watched on television i think that this was the greatest
7796340 nothing compared to when i saw michael phelps and ronaldinho and even though i had seen usain bolt before i was still excited to see him again

7796344 north korea is trying to muddle through and delay as much as possible
7796345 at the same time this is a last ditch effort trying to somehow influence u s presidential politics
7796346 i think the timing of the hu jintao visit to south korea was very depressing to the north koreans
7796347 i see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the u s to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible
7796348 such action by north korea will surely hurt foreign investor sentiment towards south korean shares even further i expect foreign exchange markets in particular to be vulnerable to the news
7796349 i think its no secret and i have said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think that settlement activity is helpful
7796350 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7796351 the peace process is not and should not be affected by any kind of settlement activities
7796352 i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together
7796353 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7796354 an open time limit is not acceptable in any security deal that governs the presence of the international forces
7796355 go through a number of levers in the iraqi political system before we actually have an agreement from the iraqi side
7796356 until we have a deal we dont have a deal
7796357 we will not accept to put the lives of our sons on the line by guaranteeing absolute immunity for anybody whether iraqis or foreigners
7796358 without the approval of the iraqi government and american forces
7796359 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
7796360 i welcome the growing convergence around this pragmatic and responsible position

7796383 we do not assure property buyers residence visas for freehold property buyers across dubai the grant of residence visas is subject to the rules requirements and procedures of the department of naturalisation and residency not the developer
7796384 upon the purchase of a nakheel property we will provide customers the basis for sponsorship although the grant of a residence visa is still subject to the rules requirements and procedures of the department of naturalisation and residency
7796385 never assured any visa and was just acting as a facilitator

7796421 i like all these schools and all the coaches and i want to go and see them in person
7796422 they have a real aggressive defense and they said that i could play as a freshman there they need linebackers and i could really help them its a pretty good team every year and they always seem to go to bowl games
7796423 that it doesnt get any better and that they are all about tradition
7796424 hes really excited about the new coaches and expects them to be competing for the national championship within a few years
7796425 i know coach rich rodriguez is a great coach and i like the changes they are making but this year will definitely be a building season
7796426 theyve got the speed and the athletes i dont think anyone will be able to match up with their wide receivers

7796453 jamaine was a pleasant and mannerly son any mother would love to have he was so good and always willing to go that extra mile when asked even when it was approaching the hour for him to go and practice
7796454 i would say that there were two things he loved the most soccer which was am important part in his life and his belly he always loved to know that when he returns home from training or even work at times there is food in the pot
7796455 there were times when his brother troy would question him on whether he would ever take off his hat after his shoes before he goes looking into the pot for food when he gets in from work
7796456 jamaine would be in here listening to music and unless someone comes and ask for him or it is near time for him to train one would not know that he was home he loved to listen to culture and reggae music saying how much it would set his mind for practice or a game and when there are sports on the television he would not move unless he has to leave to train or play a game
7796457 prior to his death he was sitting right here with mommy looking at the 2008 olympics in beijing before he took in and died on arrival at the phg he was the brother i would pay anything to bring back to life if ever such was a possibility he was looked up to in the area especially when it came to football
7796458 i want to maintain that we have always denounced torture as a means of extracting information
7796459 when you finish with one allegation there will be another i am not expected in my life time at the ministry to dispense with all these allegations
7796460 we did have a general discussion the investigation was done and there is a report but the report itself was not circulated that is where we are
7796461 the guyana defence force gdf was accused of physically abusing two of its own soldiers during an interrogation related to the search for a missing weapon the gdf promised a full investigation some senior officials in the government publicly dismissed all such abuse allegations despite physical evidence that appeared to corroborate some of the claims
7796462 when torture begins to take root anywhere it is one of the first indicators that the forces of ideological fanaticism and corruption are in the ascendant that the boundary between order and chaos is dissolving
7796463 the tournament had a good build up and it was one of the most competitive competitions witnessed

7796476 the southeast has a chronic shortage of drug addiction counsellors and has just a single methadone clinic for the entire region
7796477 sufficient funding to secure frontline services must be a priority deliverable from the governments national drugs strategy
7796478 government and the hse are hindering the delivery of the curre 160 7 9
7796479 by its own admission the hse are short more than 350 detox and rehab beds they have less than half the beds currently required there is a lack of treatment services across the board in the southeast
7796480 under budget 2008 finance to the drugs initiative young peoples facilities and services fund which includes the nds is to be 64 million
7796481 the regional drugs taskforce is under resourced while the waterford city task force receives no funding at all it is crucial that adequate funding is provided for community drug based initiatives and programmes and for increased community garda
7796482 the new national drugs strategy must ensure that funding to frontline services is sufficient and secure
7796483 it is not surprising that this latest hse report shows that 64 of those seeking treatment for addiction were treated for alcohol problems
7796484 while there are obvious advantages for the treatment of poly drug users involvin 160 total 31 12 g alcohol there is a real danger that illicit drugs would get lost alongside the nations mammoth and culturally entrenched problems with the legal drug of alcohol
7796485 successful pilot schemes must be mainstreamed without undue delay and with the necessary additional funding
7796486 under the new national drugs strategy communities and joint policing committees should have a role informing the allocati2005 1 5 6 31 12 2007 amp on of garda resources and garda operations in particular those of the national and local drugs squads i have made the case directly to chief superintendent mr pat murphy for a doubling of the local drugs unit this unit currently stands at 8 and in my view are not sufficient to deal with the growing drugs problem i have made a detailed submission to the local garda division plan suggesting positive changes in many areas
7796487 for any new drug strategy to be successful it is absolutely essential that the government recognises the gravity of the drugs crisis and matches it with the adequate resources to combat it this has not been the case heretofore as evidenced by the pitiful resources put into the current national drugs strategy

7796518 in recent years the practice has crept in of pronouncing the god of israels proper name
7796519 as an expression of the infinite greatness and majesty of god the name was held to be unpronounceable and hence was replaced during the reading of sacred scripture by means of the use of an alternate name adonai which means lord

7796522 to offer consumers more choice and flexibility in how they purchase channels
7796523 the inescapable logic is that by 2011 satellite radio subscribers will face monopoly price hikes by a company with the incentive and ability to impose them
7796524 i dont think there will be any downside for consumers
7796525 consumers who may have been interested in the prospect of satellite radio but were put off with the lack of alternative pricing plans
7796526 the satellite radio industry has a history of promising things and then letting it go by the wayside
7796527 is good news for strategic planners in the automotive business that have spent the last 18 months on hold pending this merger
7796528 that sirius xm will be a slam dunk success is far from certain but idc does believe the merged sirius xm is in a far stronger position to compete effectively in the u s than were two separate satellite radio providers
7796529 that route would involve mountains and country music which im not a fan of

7796544 it started on august the first when rodney provoked me into cracking a joke everyone laughed and i liked it and people liked me it was all such fun and i wanted more of it
7796545 i realised then it wasnt going to happen with labour in power you see were not allowed to laugh helen says so and heather makes sure we do what were told but i liked laughing im sick of being the bossy one no one likes its lonely
7796546 thats when i made the decision to help rodneys election campaign and thats why
7796547 i kept saying i was sorry but i wasnt really because i knew that if i didnt let rodney ask his question and then sent him out hed get all that wonderful publicity and act would get more votes and join national in government and then well all have so much more fun in the next parliament
7796548 it was going to be our little secret but i had to come out about it because
7796549 of course i wasnt letting winston peters get away with anything fishy or hide behind standing orders or parliamentary privilege and it had nothing at all to do with needing his votes to pass legislation for the emissions trading scheme and i definitely wasnt being unfair to rodney
7796550 that would be showing bias it would bring the house into disrepute goodness me it might even prompt people to suggest i was incompetent and cast aspersions on my impartiality then theyd start going on about freedom of speech and democracy and we couldnt have that just because they didnt realise i was joking

7796561 the dominant paradigm within which social scientists assess natural resource issues

7796563 the rational herdsman concludes that the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd

7796580 this was a surprising and exciting finding our direct observations appear to totally undermine a key rule that has withstood the test of time for over a century we will now make observations with a range of other chemicals and with other techniques to further elucidate the molecular basis for our observations text books will have to be rewritten to revise a rule that has been relied on for over a century advanced techniques such as the one we have developed should give much clearer insight into the action of a wide range of drug molecules which will be of significant interest to drug developers

7796630 especially for someone who isnt a politician she is a really great speaker
7796631 you get to play in front of so many people
7796632 im sure both sides will be fired up to do very well weve got to just play our game and do our best
7796633 so far so good but you get out there in front of all those fans and well see how it goes i hope theyll react like they have so far but well see
7796634 the attitudes been good theyve worked hard theyve seemed to be coming together pretty good as a team weve had good silent leaders and thats what im looking forward to seeing to see if that continues on
7796635 hopefully our senior players can get younger teammates to think just play your best dont worry about anything else thats a big key going into this game
7796636 you never know because they had some inexperience in the backfield but i was impressed with them christiansburg never stopped them all their players played hard
7796637 they came back if they had had a little more time they could very easily have won that game and i think christiansburg is an excellent ballclub
7796638 mistakes were there but the effort was good and now i think graham is better than any of the scrimmage teams we played so weve got to up it a notch to be successful to even have a chance
7796639 it doesnt matter to me that theyve got a game under their belt
7796640 i could look out there and give you a couple of advantages i think that we had by them opening up ahead of us i always try to look at things in a positive way
7796641 but again the attitude is good i dont think you can ever be satisfied with where you are but i think the efforts been good and hopefully by this friday well have prepared the best we can and be ready to go
7796642 right now i think were pretty good but weve got a lot of things to work on weve just got to keep getting better this whole week
7796643 i wouldnt say im satisfied but im real comfortable with whats going on when i get up to the line i dont have to think i just play i know what to do now
7796644 i like playing defense i dont think ive played defense since my ninth grade year and didnt get to play a whole lot then
7796645 but this year i cant wait to play defense its going to be fun
7796646 i played soccer for about 12 years i think it comes natural to me its good
7796647 real young and inexperienced but theyre out here busting their butts every day just trying to get better
7796648 ill probably talk to them before the game and tell them that the whole teams behind them and that well need them this game well need them the whole season
7796649 and that theres not a lot to be nervous about just go out and know your assignments and know what youre going to do i think theyll be fine
7796650 its a little bit sad but im wanting to go out with a bang and have a really good game and win and see our team do well as a whole
7796651 i just remember they had a lot of smart defenders they were set up good and they had a lot of experience and theyll come after you and theyll hit you
7796652 once you get out on the field and the balls ready to be kicked off and the whistle blows and everything you kind of just block out the crowd and the hype and you go out and play football
7796653 thanks for allowing me to be a part of this
7796654 its really fantastic and it doesnt happen in high school very often thats what i would say its something youll never forget
7796655 out the 20 players we have on the team only six are from last year and there are probably five or six that have never played before
7796656 weve got a lot of young players but they put out a good effort well just go from here
7796657 as long as we keep improving every game its going to be a successful season
7796658 my goalie is not here today so i had to use two other girls and i promised them they would only get a half each
7796659 one of them is a midfielder and the other one is one of my strikers you have to be creative when youre dealing with high school kids
7796660 weve never played them before and we didnt know what to expect
7796661 i thought we had a good effort today and well do it again tomorrow
7796662 weve got a good core of juniors and weve got some sophomores that are learning and weve got a real good freshmen core that is just going to get better and better
7796663 as long as we can improve every game well be ok but our won loss record were not worried about
7796664 we just want to make sure this team keeps improving every game with a young team like this you just want to keep getting better every game and hopefully the girls keep learning something every game

7796668 for a first game i dont think west virginia is going to take a whole lot of chances
7796669 i think theyre just bigger faster and stronger and they think theyll dominate the game so i dont think theyre terribly excited about villanova
7796670 oh my gosh im very excited and im very very loose
7796671 i want to be the same guy as a head coach as i was an assistant coach
7796672 im going to try to be the same old me but ill be loose ive got to be able to think ive got to be able to stay cool calm and im not going to get all hyped up and run over a helmet and trip and fall or stumble and bruise myself
7796673 we are very mature football team really and our fans understand we are in harms way in this game
7796674 it is a david and goliath game we know we are a big underdog but its one of those things that we face year in and year out when we play these kind of games
7796675 were just going to play our gameplan and hopefully it will go like we like it to
7796676 we had all the tape from last year so we were able to evaluate what they did last year
7796677 even though they have a new coaching staff you would think they would stick with a winning formula
7796678 ive heard it mentioned that they plan to throw the ball a little more also and maybe move pat white out to wide receiver but were not real sure
7796679 we run quite similar offenses really to what west virginia and wake forest run
7796680 i think in terms of a first game for west virginia i would doubt they would come out and do anything other than run the ball down our throats
7796681 im sure there will be kinks and bugs in our offense and our defense so well looking very forward to playing this game
7796682 i dont care who were playing all i care about is how do we play
7796683 i know what we are capable of and how we act and how we are supposed to play i want to see if we block do we tackle do we run to the ball and do we make plays if we do that in any of the 12 games that were supposed to play then well be ok thats all i want to see

7796705 for sure there has been interest from various parties within the gulf there is a precedent in the cases of aston martin ferrari or daimler and those kinds of solutions could be very realistic solutions
7796706 apparently we have had two separate investors raise their hand as being interested but i dont know whats happened since then
7796707 at this special moment i want to send a message to the chelsea fans who have always made me feel their support a heartfelt thank you for that
7796708 it was unfortunate i suffered a number of injuries during my time here but i always gave my all whatever the circumstances

7796715 rio tinto alcans large source of secure hydro based power supply is a major competitive advantage given emerging energy shortages around the world including china
7796716 our boards rejected this offer on the basis that it undervalued the company and its prospects and we now await the outcome of the e u and other important regulatory reviews
7796717 in the meantime the groups performance in the first half together with our growth potential supports the boards view that rio tinto presents a very strong standalone value proposition for shareholders
7796718 we note that rios underlying earnings grew 55 in the period while bhp billitons grew around 25 in the same period
7796719 while rio acquired alcan in the second half 2007 this is not the explanation we estimate that rio tintos underlying earnings would have grown in the order of 50 without acquiring alcan

7796722 the government of afghanistan has repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
7796723 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids

7796902 for this reason im announcing that the government will introduce legislation that will punish criminals who commit violence against pregnant women but do so in a way that leaves no room for the introduction of fetal rights

7796949 smart meters make a real difference in the energy sector
7796950 consumers gain control over surging energy costs governments get chance to promote energy conservation and the energy industry players are able to become more efficient
7796951 germany did not go all the way with the recent energy and climate act an unclear regulatory framework and uncertainty about the future threaten to further delay adoption of smart metering in the country
7796952 if the british government is honest about its commitment to reducing carbon emissions it really has no other alternative than to push ahead with smart metering for all energy customers

7796958 wat er ook gebeurt die derde helft is altijd belangrijk geweest wsc is dan ook een verschrikkelijk gezellige club
7796959 want we hebben zon beetje alle gymzalen in waalwijk van binnen gezien om maar aan voldoende trainingsuren te komen
7796960 in die van de pater van der geld was het echt oppassen geblazen tussen basket en muur zat maar amper een meter als je te veel snelheid maakte voor een lay up zat je er al tegenaan
7796961 perfecte zaal met drie volwaardige velden beter kun je het niet hebben
7796962 het is er lang niet zo gezellig de bar is groot en hoog het doet kil aan het gaat er ook allemaal erg formeel aan toe bij een toernooi een ploeg laten overnachten in een kleedkamer wat in de tax aan de taxandriaweg is gebeurd dat is nu ondenkbaar
7796963 en dat heb je wel nodig om de jeugd goed op te kunnen vangen
7796964 voor n wedstrijd heb je twee scheidsrechters nodig drie mensen aan de tafel voor de score en een coach
7796965 we zitten toch een beetje in een dal zeker met de mannen die presteren niet best we willen de club opkrikken dat is nodig om gezond te blijven
7796966 ik gooi zeventig tot tachtig procent van de ballen in het net
7796967 ik ben gescout door een amerikaanse coach die heeft me ingeschreven voor een college
7796968 normaal ga ja van de selectie over naar het rayon dan misschien een uitnodiging voor oranje ik heb het rayon overgeslagen
7796969 want tijdens die trainingen leer je ook veel op mentaal vlak dat je altijd voor elkaar moet strijden in het veld om te slagen moet je ook discipline hebben honderd procent je best doen niet zeuren maar alles geven

7796980 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
7796981 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
7796982 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
7796983 their big challenge is convincing people that they will continue to be active in politics and theyre going to continue to have a voice
7796984 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported
7796985 an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections and was seeking to redeem himself to those closest to him yes that is who i supported
7796986 she knew she should not have participated in him running for president with this bomb waiting to go off she did she kinda loses my sympathy
7796987 i believe we are all owed a huge apology not self serving claims for pity by both john and elizabeth edwards who both knew about the affair and both decided to go forward and seek the democratic candidacy regardless of the titanic risk
7796988 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
7796989 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt

7796994 when he struck me in the game i knew that it was with his head but did not know at the time if it was an accident
7796995 the first time he had come at me i had seen him coming and before the second occasion i started to back away because the referee told me to release the ball so luckily it was more of a glancing blow than a direct strike
7796996 but there was not a lot of that stuff while you had the impression that the boks were very anxious to win the game was more physical as opposed to foul than anything else the breakdowns were very physical it was very much the sort of test you expect in south africa whether they are on a losing streak or a winning one
7796997 because of our positions gits fly half matt giteau and i do a fair amount of directing people around and with the team looking to us continually we need to stay composed and ensure we do not lose our heads
7796998 it is going to be another great occasion to play in front of these huge crowds in these famous stadiums is an honour

7797006 we have had some very complex scenarios where the clashes were between members of our church
7797007 they cant look into my eye for they know what they did i feel i am betraying my friend by letting them roam around
7797008 upon all our supporters and members and any organs and structures under the direction and control of our respective parties to stop the perpetration of violence in any form
7797009 in some areas the situation is still very tense and some people are still coming to our offices looking for their missing relatives and friends

7797020 in australia adsl has been riding on top of analogue voice services for years which severely hampers the distance that adsl can operate at
7797021 this has led to a general belief that at about 4km from an exchange adsl will stop working but thats just not the case at all
7797022 its a large potential market for us so were more than happy to be first off the rank to offer this service

7797030 the local market is quite resistant in terms of reacting to interest rate increases
7797031 and botswana has a long history of high interest rates
7797032 the impact of this growth was not fully felt as draw downs were experienced in the latter part of the year
7797033 margin squeeze was experienced as a result of competition as well as lower returns from the bank of botswana certificates bobcs which grew by 30 percent
7797034 this growth was largely attributed to new customer accounts and increased product offerings
7797035 service delivery channels particularly electronic banking points of sale and breakthrough channels such as cell phone banking are performing above expectations
7797036 this expansion programme together with the full impact of planned prior year initiatives and continued rises in costs as a result of inflation resulted in rising operating expenses during the period
7797037 however this growth in operating expenses is in line with managements expectations as it provides access to new revenue streams

7797072 one of the assumptions that people make is that if they buy virus protecting software that will protect them from all known viruses
7797073 that may well be true but theres an awful lot out there that we dont know about
7797074 so designing more effective systems and designing security models to ensure that we dont have these problems is what the course is based around
7797075 in the industry we refer to people with white hats and black hats which comes from the old westerns
7797076 but realistically were very careful about the people we take onto the program
7797077 we have a strong vetting procedure in the uk we use things like disclosure scotland to ensure that people that were taking on arent coming from a criminal background

7797080 the first lesson is you dont necessarily do everything the fans want you to do
7797081 i am a fan too and i would love to have a squad that is much better than everyone elses
7797082 we are very nearly there but not quite i think we are quite happy we are not going to buy somebody who doesnt improve the squad
7797083 i keep saying money is available but i am not going to say how much but it is enough to buy an experienced international player
7797084 we have won one match and lost one in the league and hopefully we will be in the draw for the champions league
7797085 we didnt play well at fulham on saturday but i think all this stuff about us having to buy a complete lot of new players is rubbish
7797086 guarantee appropriate sex and relationship education in every primary and secondary school by putting personal social and health education on a statutory basis as part of the national curriculum
7797087 international evidence suggests that high quality sex and relationship education that puts sex in its proper context that starts early enough to make a difference and that gives youngsters the confidence and ability to make well informed decisions helps young people delay their first sexual experience and leads to lower teenage pregnancy levels

7797089 the new survey clearly shows that town halls hugely resent having to pass the electoral roll to direct marketing companies
7797090 most people hate junk mail and cold calling and councils dont want to be part of the process that generates money for junk mail companies in this way
7797091 selling the electoral roll undermines democracy dissuades people from voting and gives people the impression that the council is profiteering from selling their personal information
7797092 he is a different player so he will establish himself in a different way
7797093 jonas has got it in him to be thought of as much as david ginola but in a different way definitely
7797094 it is the comeback i dreamed of i am very proud to have returned to real madrid and to have played in both super cup games and also to have scored a goal that i can dedicate to the fans
7797095 i have always valued being a player for this club but on previous occasions i was called up to the first team from the b side
7797096 last season i played a lot of games in the first division and i grew with getafe then to be able to play with the spanish national team in a prestigious tournament like the european championships was great
7797097 since i came back i have been made to feel like just one more player and have the same responsibilities as any other player
7797098 i think i have begun the campaign well and i hope to continue playing like in order to help madrid win more trophies
7797099 i think that we have a very good squad right now but there are people that must decide if robinho stays or is sold and whether more players are signed or not
7797100 robinho is still an important player for us and he has shown in pre season what quality he has i think he is doing well and he was with us celebrating at the end of the game
7797101 i am going to be very attentive towards my players we are playing for too much to go there and take things easy
7797102 we are going into the game with caution if we have to play this game it is because we are not yet in the champions league if we had qualified we would all be now back in barcelona
7797103 before the game it appears to be the most difficult match of the year we won by four goals in the first game but we have to keep wisla at bay
7797104 they are a team that deserves a lot of respect because they know how to play and they have some good players at the back
7797105 being league champions means that they deserve all the respect but we have come to win the game not just to make it through to the next stage
7797106 right information to the right person at the right time
7797107 the right to request flexible working has worked well because it helps employees to balance their home and work lives but at the same time gives employers the right to say no where there are legitimate business concerns
7797108 parenting requirements dont end as children get older we think it is right to extend this successful scheme and help parents of older children access the flexibility they need

7797137 a man who lives in a box for five years can do whatever he wants
7797138 people need to be able to access finance to buy property and anything we can do to assist people getting on the housing ladder must be good
7797139 while cost saving measures for instance a stamp duty holiday would be very welcome and would allow the cost of moving house to be reduced if you cant get a mortgage to support your transaction youre not going to get off the starting blocks
7797140 the monthly numbers of approvals for house purchase which have fallen by some two thirds over the last year levelled off in july it would however be premature to think that the housing market will now start to recover because overall approval activity continues to be very low
7797141 with no sign of credit conditions easing and house prices continuing to fall we expect delinquencies to continue rising and losses to increase over the coming quarters
7797142 renewablegenerations will build on the solargenerations program and develop new elements for wind and hydro including a network of electrical contractors to help recruit customers
7797143 these projects deliver benefits on many levels they reduce energy bills provide learning opportunities help the environment and increase our energy independence by taking advantage of abundant natural energy sources right in our own backyard
7797144 were fortunate in nevada because of the strong support for renewable energy shown by the state legislature and the public utilities commission of nevada as a result of their efforts nevada has one of the nations most progressive programs to encourage customer installed renewable energy
7797145 my work is the result of homemaking skills gone awry i have always embraced femininity and domesticity in spirit but not in action my life as an artist puts housekeeping last while instead i cook arrange and sew glass my work embraces the domestic act of sewing in an unexpected medium i enjoy combining text with nostalgic imagery to create pieces that explore the complex dichotomy of womens roles within the household
7797146 the idea came from an existing series of my work about the bluebird of happiness in that series i combined images of bluebirds and housewives and paid homage to the feminine nesting instinct i wanted to explore that thought further and set that bird free with an installation representing growth and shelter
7797147 if youre in the street and a dog bites a kid if you know who the dog is and its tagged theres a lot less anxiety
7797148 i put that up right after last year but its something i believe we can easily do
7797149 i think if you asked the players theyd tell you they werent very happy with the way they played in the final four
7797150 but as a team i think we were closer than we had ever been we worked for each other harder than we ever had
7797151 its a totally different idea this year no one knew who we were last year or thought we were that good
7797152 now we have a target on our backs everyone is going to play their hardest game against us
7797153 i think we have options at every position now it makes our training sessions more competitive that to me is a huge part of building a program
7797154 we need to talk more and figure things out at the beginning of the game so we dont have to wait til halftime
7797155 we have speed but we need to work on our shape because there are a lot of fast forwards out there
7797156 the goal for this year is to score 30 more goals than we did last year
7797157 its a big step but we can do it we just need to work on our final pass we struggle a little with our final pass and we just need to put away our chances
7797158 honestly she was at the olympics games she is representing us every time she plays it is great for all of us here for the program and for her
7797159 i had a loving husband i had a loving son and they loved each other they were friends they were buddies its just this horrible illness i dont know what goes through peoples heads
7797160 he had degenerative disc disease so they were giving him pain medication for that
7797161 those are the last two on board and theyre the most powerful
7797162 they tell you dont drive a motor vehicle but you can go shoot a machine gun on percocet
7797163 they think ive developed a seizure disorder in my left hand where it does what it wants to when it wants to from my fingertips all the way up to my shoulder it bounces all over the place
7797164 i dont feel like an active person i could care less about actually leaving the house now
7797165 he looked older he was drinking at night he told me horrific stories then hed go to bed and id just sit there and cry
7797166 i think that was the catalyst that threw chad over the edge body parts of friends the women and the kids he killed that got him
7797167 i believe he had been lying there for three days
7797168 the normal maximum dose would be about 800 milligrams a day
7797169 paxil and seroquel he had been taking klonopin he was taking pain medicines you should not die from taking pain medicine with ptsd
7797170 he was physically fit he had a clear head he was calm he was easygoing he was funny everyone wanted to be around him
7797171 it got to the point where he wouldnt even pick up the phone when they called
7797172 everything from slurred speech to excessive weight gain inability to urinate he would shake developed tremors in his hands every weekend he came home it was something more noticeable
7797173 a tendency of young returning veterans to self medicate using nonprescribed prescription medication obtained from friends family members and co workers
7797174 there is no question that overdoses of the combination of multiple medications often combined with narcotics alcohol or illegal drugs can result in death
7797175 some of the deaths have been ruled suicides and others accidental overdoses we are not aware of deaths that have occurred when soldiers were taking their medicines as prescribed
7797176 i felt like they treated him like he was a malingerer that there was nothing wrong with him that he was just a pain in their ass to be honest with you
7797177 ive been working with jimmy and john paul and trying to do some new material and some writing i dont know what it will be but it will be something
7797178 the possibility of doing something is in the cards i really felt it was on the cards from the moment we walked offstage at the o2
7797179 at the moment all i know is i have the great pleasure to go and jam with the two guys and start work on some material when i get there i never ask any questions if i get a phone call to go and play i enjoy every moment of it whatever it ends up as to get a chance to jam with two people like that it is a phenomenal thing for me its my life its what ive dreamed about doing
7797180 russia should have recognized the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia long ago and should have followed it up with defense cooperation and assistance treaties long ago too
7797181 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7797182 currently it is important for us that south ossetia should gain independence legally from the point of view of the world community
7797183 after this we shall be able to seek accession into the russian federation but this issue will be postponed for the future
7797184 only the international recognition of independence and sovereignty will give reliable international guarantees of security and free development rights improve the situation and ensure stability in the caucasian region
7797185 the situation in the caucasus will get much worse against the background of a most serious crisis in relations between russia and the united states and western europe
7797186 it is nato not russia that is primarily interested in nato russian cooperation
7797187 if they choose to break off this relationship even the whole of it nothing terrible will happen

7797226 this is so that we keep the cast and crew in employment and the soap running
7797227 we at zbh would like to have studio 263 back on air however this will depend on the outcome of a meeting we are scheduled to have with the soaps executive producer mr godwin mawuru very soon
7797228 some members of the cast are now cross border traders while some do various other money generating projects but they all want the soap to continue who in zimbabwe is relying on work only nowadays so the media should not be alarmists by saying we no longer have a cast
7797229 everybody says they are still holding on but you can tell some want out and they feel their patience has been stretched too far

7797271 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7797272 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7797273 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7797274 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7797275 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7797276 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7797277 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7797278 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7797279 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7797280 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7797281 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7797282 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7797283 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7797284 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7797285 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7797286 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7797287 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7797288 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7797289 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7797290 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7797291 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7797292 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7797293 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7797294 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7797295 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7797296 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7797297 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7797298 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
7797299 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
7797300 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
7797301 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
7797302 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7797303 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7797304 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7797305 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7797306 no one works for someone we all just work together
7797307 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
7797308 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
7797309 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7797310 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7797311 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7797312 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7797313 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7797314 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7797315 this senator biden correctly says israel could not suppress hizbullah in lebanon so how can the u s stand face to face with a nation of 70 million this is the blessing of the guardianship of the jurists the theocracy which plants such thoughts in the hearts of u s senators and forces them to make such confessions
7797316 the dialogue has not been completed it is arrogant and reckless for anybody to come and address parliament mugabe is not mandated by anyone to address parliament nobody has the right to address parliament before talks are completed
7797317 they are gathering outside we think they will try to come in again
7797318 we now know 46 persons have died and 118 were injured
7797319 met with strong resistance from the instigated and mobilized displaced citizens who were incited to put barricades and to move in the streets
7797320 there is no one going in or out the situation is very bad with the rains and food is running out they are surrounding the camp
7797321 they infiltrated kalma to provoke the residents and justify their own atrocities
7797322 the koshi river has changed its course and nearly 20 25 lakh 2 2 5 million people of the areas have been affected
7797323 their anger is natural since they never thought that floods would leave them stranded in this way and they were not prepared to face the floods which happened suddenly
7797324 in this study weather sensitivity is defined as the relative potential impact of the weather on a countrys economy
7797325 to measure the potential growth associated with hedging weather risk we first quantified the weather sensitivity of several countries around the world
7797326 the united states economy has a total weather sensitivity of roughly 2 5 trillion 23 percent of the national economy
7797327 in contrast bolivia has a total weather sensitivity of just over 2 billion thats 31 percent of the bolivian economy
7797328 with weather coverage brazils economy is estimated to grow by 16 billion or 2 3 percent
7797329 indias economy could grow by as much as 2 billion or 2 2 percent if all of the countries included in the study hedged all of their weather risk global output would grow by an estimated 258 billion
7797330 as a mom i was constantly searching for quality baby blankets that could not only provide comfort for my baby but also made in fashionable fabrics
7797331 after we made the first run of blankets we couldnt keep them in stock and this only resulted from word of mouth that is when we knew we were onto something big
7797332 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
7797333 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
7797334 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
7797335 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7797336 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7797337 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7797338 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7797339 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7797340 in australia adsl has been riding on top of analogue voice services for years which severely hampers the distance that adsl can operate at
7797341 this has led to a general belief that at about 4km from an exchange adsl will stop working but thats just not the case at all
7797342 its a large potential market for us so were more than happy to be first off the rank to offer this service
7797343 not getting a break from that high pressure environment can lead to burnout
7797344 theres been a big shift in philosophy theres much more year round hockey taking place
7797345 that certainly lends itself to kids dropping out of the game earlier than historically they would have they might be getting a lifetimes worth of hockey in a shorter period of time
7797346 its never been my favourite thing to do in the world
7797347 were a hockey family so its definitely not a good thing to tell your dad youre quitting hockey
7797348 the bars been raised but it hasnt its been accelerated
7797349 the kids with the most potential are still the kids with the most potential some kids are getting to their peak at a very quick pace a lot of parents dont understand this
7797350 some of the data we have shows they spent a lot more time playing at their sport in an unorganized way
7797351 we see a lot of kids who play the same way
7797352 were getting into structure so early were sucking the life out of the game in a lot of ways
7797353 were getting them on the elite treadmill too soon and were setting them up for disappointment

7797356 as the resource owner the government of alberta is entitled to take its royalty share of bitumen production in kind in lieu of cash
7797357 were trying to hear from those companies that would be interested in taking our bitumen in kind to benefit albertans
7797358 albertans have said they want upgrading within the province and long term sustainable jobs and this is one of the tools we have of making those happen

7797362 once men were simply men but then feminists decided they were chauvinist pigs who didnt spend enough time doing the dishes
7797363 no meal or coffee break was complete without a breathless conversation with a lithe long jumper from cuba or an amazonian badminton player from sweden the mutual longing so evident it was almost comical

7797365 people sometimes say when you are in a good position you need to go to a better team
7797366 but i have something to pay back to the club when the club have done something good for you you have to do something good for the club
7797367 the monthly numbers of approvals for house purchase levelled off in july it would however be premature to think that the housing market will now start to recover because overall approval activity continues to be very low
7797368 while there was a small month on month increase in activity it represented a notable decline from a year ago
7797369 bad saag muss f r die ffentlichkeit frei zug nglich und voll und ganz erhalten bleiben
7797370 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7797371 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7797372 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7797373 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7797374 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7797375 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7797376 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
7797377 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
7797378 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
7797379 we have a great ability here to adjust the electorate
7797380 much of my research is about tree rings and forest change in an effort to understand landscapes
7797381 in both projects im interested in how the surrounding forests have changed over time which is largely in response to how jefferson and washington used the environment two centuries ago
7797382 there are lots of woods you can look at in virginia but its fun to get to work at mount vernon and monticello
7797383 its not only environmental history but the history of our country
7797384 hopefully this research will help to shed some light on the timing of the field clearing since the foundation wants to reconstruct the appearance to that of thomas jeffersons retirement years
7797385 the goal of his work is to reconstruct the history of the development of the forested areas about 60 to 70 percent of the estate
7797386 those results will be significant in terms of adding to historical evidence that we have available to interpret the site but they will have management applications as well we are committed to preserving all of mount vernons significant cultural and natural resources
7797387 and this is just the first of three summers we are going to spend up there
7797388 cross sections are nice because they are great visible features but we would fill up that lab pretty fast
7797389 were learning there are 200 year old trees at these settlements today which is exciting
7797390 there are trees that remain from early in the lives of these presidents
7797391 you can find some old trees but you can also tell the story of how people have interacted with the woods with the forests and how these forests have responded to environmental change how people have used the trees and used the land going back to the colonial period
7797392 instead of saying this tree is 210 years old we can say ah this tree grew really well this period not so well that period why is that and that is really a science question
7797393 its not just about the speaker but mugabe has lost control of parliament which makes it very difficult to govern
7797394 the majority of people in zimbabwe are saying if you are not in control of the security forces dont sign because it means mugabe can unleash violence whenever he likes
7797395 i am looking forward to working with an up and coming team and sharing my experience in developing and delivering high performance programs to enable them to improve their success on court
7797396 west coast fever has lots of potential and i am looking forward to making them a team to be reckoned with in the anz championship next season
7797397 the six weeks on crutches just felt like an eternity
7797398 i couldnt do anything i couldnt carry anything and life got a bit grim but im out of that now walking around and definitely looking forward to seeing a bit of improvement
7797399 at the moment im not pushing myself the plan would be to come back for super 14 next year and be fit and healthy by the time that comes around
7797400 its so nerve racking because i know how important these games are and i look back and think god i wish i could be out there and playing with them
7797401 im just so proud theyre doing so well and so proud robbies been able to bring them together and turn australian rugby from being so nervous and worried about the way we were playing into just passionate carefree players
7797402 if it was the first time i had done it i would have tried to get back for the wallaby tour which is only five six weeks away but im not going to try to rush it for that
7797403 im probably just going to take it a bit slower this time
7797404 last time i had the operation during the super 14 season i tried to really rush back and get back into playing football
7797405 this time im just gong to take it slowly and try to get it right for next year
7797406 after two seasons out of the game the physical and mental demands will be incredible but i know i still have some very good netball left in me
7797407 the program jane woodlands and her management crew have in place at adelaide is clearly world class and with that support i think i will be able to contribute a lot to the side
7797408 i have been keeping fit since 2006 but my fitness is now on a fast track so i can look the rest of the squad in the eyes when pre season starts in november
7797409 people will probably wonder why i have made the decision but netball has been increasingly on my mind over the past two seasons and as they always say you are a long time retired and i now know thats not where i want to be yet
7797410 the girls in the goal circle at the thunderbirds particularly kate beveridge and nat medhurst were red hot at the business end of the season just finished and breaking onto the court will be tough i know that but i am hungry to get back into the game
7797411 jane was a player i saw from an early age being in the sa programs and i thought she had a lot of ability and obviously at her height a lot of advantages over defenders
7797412 she is also very athletic for a tall player but she is aware she has a lot of hard work in front of her to become a regular on court and i think she will give it a very good go
7797413 having her bob up when she was not even on the radar will add some serious depth to our squad for the pre season and make things very competitive and that has to be good for everyone
7797414 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
7797415 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
7797416 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
7797417 we will not attend the clear message is that the dialogue is still under way and we dont expect any member of the executive to address us until that dialogue has been concluded

7797425 vaatan m ngudele tagasi m ningase kurbusega kogu hiina tegeles mitu aastat ettevalmistustega ja n d on see k ik l bi osalesin elu olulisimal turniiril mis edasi saab
7797426 mustale merele saadetud nato ksused kuhu on praeguseks saadetud heksa v rast laeva ei saa tekitada muud kui muret

7797428 you can see behind me were in the nursery right now were getting more and more newborns every day because we brought in a lot of expecting mothers
7797429 these dogs have never set foot on grass theyve received very little attention theyve lived in their own exrement
7797430 theres no way humanly possible that these animals could have been appropriately taken care of and not in overcrowded conditions
7797431 were pretty much equivalent to the red cross for animals
7797432 the community support has been amongst the best ive ever seen
7797433 the nurses and the staff at saint jos we knew we had to help
7797434 veterinarians from throughout the community closed their private practice to come in here and volunteer their time
7797435 we have looked at other building societies but it seems to me that upfront arrangement fees have gone through the roof since last time i saw one with a 3 per cent fee and thought that was crazy principality building society had a deal with a 1 000 fee it just doesnt seem worth it
7797436 the impression i am getting is that jims employment status would be even more of a problem if we were moving house
7797437 we have decided to leave the buy to let loan where it is it works out cheaper than remortgaging because the standard variable rate is much better than the fixes on offer especially once you have added arrangement fees
7797438 we have spoken to a couple of lenders about the residential loan and had some quotes from hsbc but were put off by the high fees they really have crept up in the past two years the best so far seems to be a 5 98 per cent two year fix or tracker with nationwide with a 599 fee
7797439 we plan to book a rate as soon as possible then if rates come down further we can switch to a better rate sort of hedging our bets
7797440 we are quite close to our remortgage date in mid september the best deal we have been offered so far is a 6 09 per cent seven year fixed rate with cheltenham amp gloucester c amp g
7797441 we just missed out on its lowest rate of 5
7797442 i have no problem with fixing for seven years as we have no plans to move and can afford the 1 015 it would cost each month which is 150 more than we are currently paying
7797443 we havent heard anything about it so we cannot confirm these rumours as we have no contact with her at all
7797444 we are trying to know more the only person who has seen her is the doctor
7797445 we have an unwavering commitment to keeping your food safe with standards well beyond regulatory requirements but this week our best efforts failed and we are deeply sorry
7797446 there were no injuries and minimal damage to the vehicle
7797447 we are co ordinating with pakistani authorities in investigating the incident
7797448 we will not rest until the prisoners are freed and the jails are empty
7797449 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards meters
7797450 were aware of the matter discussed tonight by the aurora police department
7797451 federal law enforcement is working hand in glove with the aurora police department because this matter is currently under investigation there is little we can say right now
7797452 we can say this were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7797453 i have become more physically settled in my sixties liking to be home or toggling from one home to the next routine which i used to scorn as next door to incarceration holds new appeal for me but one must not sit and think and ruminate all day
7797454 our sixties give us the chance to get out not only from a job but from much else that we have been doing unquestioningly for a long time
7797455 it is our very presence that is important to the young they want us to be there not in their homes perhaps not watching them with a baleful eye as they go about their daily work but there we reassure them that life continues and if we listen we assure them that it matters to us that it continues
7797456 aging particularly in the later decades is a drawing in encounters with the outside world diminish for many reasons the solitude of old age is often pleasurable there is peace a sense of the present
7797457 ronni bennett does a great job of demystifying the later years of life
7797458 insistir en la moderaci n salarial puede generar m s conflictividad
7797459 anton is up today for a medical and we hope to get that tied up today
7797460 i met him last week and it went well he will be a good addition to our squad and it will keep people on their toes
7797461 hes had a slight hamstring strain so it would be unfair to throw him straight in
7797462 there is an international break coming up so it would give him a chance to train with us for two weeks
7797463 thousands of patients have been starving in beds because the nurses do not have time to feed them
7797464 that used to be a major part of the nursing process now they just dont have time because they have to spend all their time doing reports and management work
7797465 an enormous amount of money has been put in but it has been wasted on excessive management
7797466 doctors dont dare speak out the staff dont dare speak up because they will get sacked
7797467 i think the general public know what im talking about if i say the nhs is going into meltdown
7797468 you cant get dental care your elderly patients what happens to them you have to pay to have them looked after
7797469 to get ahead of the game and not wait until the variance is actually up
7797470 certainly this will give them a couple of weeks to decide and we certainly hope that they will grant the variance
7797471 the water levels in all of our major reservoirs have dropped pretty markedly over the last month
7797472 there is just simply a documented lack of coverage along those roads
7797473 i didnt move down here to have a cell tower put in my backyard
7797474 theres plenty other places to put it its all about money
7797475 we need the tower for communication in case of accidents
7797476 im looking at the welfare of my family and other peoples families
7797477 one of the things we found was the analysis that the department of environmental quality had done used the 1950s as the worst drought of record and that gave us some very different results
7797478 it became obvious that you have to do your own calculations rather than depend on state agencies
7797479 because of the economic hardships you dont want to go either into voluntary or mandatory conservation unless it is truly needed
7797480 that expansion will put us in good shape until somewhere in the vicinity of 2055
7797481 in all water planning projects you can do a pretty good job of whats going to happen in the next 3 5 years
7797482 its important to do long range planning 50 60 years out but the farther out you go the fuzzier the crystal ball is and the harder it gets to predict what the growth rate will be
7797483 but reservoirs are increasingly more difficult to get permits for their construction so at this point the replacement of the u s 29 line appears to be the most economically viable and most useful for us
7797484 a lot of people learned water conservation techniques during that time
7797485 thats the thing thats most likely to walk out of your room
7797486 its all new and exciting and fresh freshmen lose themselves they get drunk on freedom
7797487 these little skills might not seem like much but they help you survive
7797488 there is agreement between the two sides that there will not be any foreign soldiers in iraq after 2011
7797489 any decisions on troops will be based on the conditions on the ground in iraq that has always been our position it continues to be our position
7797490 seeing her love and affection with those three i know shell be an amazing mum
7797491 look at the substance of the bill look at what it does for illinois and taxpayers
7797492 im not trying to say this lightly look at the program dont look at the person
7797493 what were doing is right and there is power in this
7797494 i hope the general assembly sees it that way and they approve them
7797495 if i signed the bill and then tried to add these things on in a different way ill come up against the same resistance ive had to deal with for the past 31 2 years when i asked them to do these things when i said i wanted to rock the system
7797496 oficina de envigado cuando el presidente uribe ordena en un consejo de seguridad acabar con la mencionada oficina uno de los grupos delincuenciales m s peligrosos
7797497 lo que se demuestra es la estrategia montada de un sector del gobierno contra la corte suprema de justica para deslegitimar sus decisiones para desacreditar a los magistrados
7797498 hingga kini belum ada konfirmasi apa apa mengenai kemungkinan kedepannya kami belum bisa berspekulasi

7797500 the same speech hes been giving for months why didnt he give the germans something more
7797501 it was a tent in the desert 100 degree heat off and on for what seemed like forever
7797502 why was i held by the united states like that when i was their ally
7797503 if theyre exaggerating and distorting this much in august what will october be like
7797504 coming into the semis there are going to be teams that play the 80 minutes the melbournes and the manlys so youve really got to work for 80 minutes against those teams
7797505 its fair to say the last couple of weeks weve clocked off for periods of time so its certainly in our minds not to do that
7797506 benny wayne bennett has upped the ante with two weeks to go to the semis
7797507 were not playing great guns at the moment and weve got a lot of things to prove
7797508 the dogs are fighting to keep away from the wooden spoon and newcastle are in good form
7797509 oftentimes one brings in celebrity for a sense of making a campaign look like its young and vibrant and visionary and all the rest of it you give it a bit of that showbiz juice the problem is that the last thing that barack obama needs is showbiz juice
7797510 hes got all the charisma hes got the speaking the whole idea of this rock star candidate is now to some extent being reframed to become a liability the democratic party has to be really careful that they dont paint themselves as a hollywood presidency kind of thing
7797511 a lot of people are beginning to realize that celebrity endorsements are doing a lot more to get you to change your mind about the celebrity than they do to get you to change your mind about a candidate
7797512 most people come to candidates with pretty set ideas of what their party is and who they like and who they dont
7797513 just because one of their favourite actors endorses someone or speaks for one of them i think its more likely that the average voter is going to say oh i used to like that celebrity but they like candidate x so i dont like that celebrity anymore
7797514 if the youth vote turns out as it did with the primaries for obama i think youre going to see a president obama
7797515 if the youth vote does as it has done in the past and that is that it always promises and looks like its going to be behind john kerry or al gore then what youre going to see is president mccain
7797516 i think it cuts both ways the candidates want celebrities there because it brings media attention but they dont want them around too much because they dont want to bring negative attention as though it is just a celebrity kind of endorsement
7797517 depending on the celebrity you might be able to register three votes but you might lose three votes there are people in hollywood who are very divisive in terms of their politics
7797518 the celebrities use it as a means of getting themselves back into the limelight
7797519 its what i would call a synergistic relationship where both sides probably benefit in a celebrity spectacle culture
7797520 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
7797521 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
7797522 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
7797523 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
7797524 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
7797525 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
7797526 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7797527 when ted kennedy comes here to ask us all to pull together as a party not many people in this hall are not going to take that next step
7797528 it never stopped him he didnt go in a corner and weep he just started something else and now here he is tonight so tenacious
7797529 anyone whos advanced for him knows he likes a stool
7797530 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7797531 i have a headache from the altitude today i cant imagine what its like for someone whos got radiation chemotherapy and has to take a battery of drugs
7797532 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7797533 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7797534 id heard it from a pretty good source last night but everyone was thrilled to hear about it at our breakfast this is the kind of moment that sen kennedy lives for
7797535 id heard something over the weekend but his health is such an issue it wasnt clear if hed be able to come
7797536 im a cancer survivor and i know how draining this kind of thing can be
7797537 it pushes the focus back on the challenge ahead and on obama and the race it gives people something positive to talk about
7797538 this may be ted kennedys final gift to the party
7797539 this says that he feels this is the democrats year and the party is not as unified as hed like it to be his appearance takes the headlines away from the clinton faction
7797540 happens to be somebody who i love to death hes just a good man and obviously hes going through a difficult time but im glad that we can use this convention to remind people of the contributions hes made to this country
7797541 just charges the atmosphere here the emotion is enormous its just what you want to start off the convention
7797542 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
7797543 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
7797544 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
7797545 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
7797546 im a property owner we own a lot of property but we live in one or two
7797547 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
7797548 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
7797549 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
7797550 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
7797551 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
7797552 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
7797553 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them
7797554 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
7797555 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
7797556 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
7797557 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
7797558 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
7797559 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
7797560 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable

7797571 the computer was removed from our secure storage facility in essex and sold on ebay
7797572 we know which employee took the server and sold it but we believe it was an honest mistake and it was not intentional to sell it without the server being cleared
7797573 we want to stress that this is an isolated incident and we are investigating how the server was removed and sold the security we have in place is what we are known for
7797574 this is a very unfortunate incident and we are taking measures to ensure it will never happen again
7797575 graphic data has confirmed to us that one of their machines appears to have been inappropriately sold on via a third party
7797576 as a result historical data relating to credit card applications from some of our customers and data from other banks were not removed
7797577 we take this issue extremely seriously and are working to resolve this regrettable loss with graphic data as a matter of urgency
7797578 clearly such details should never have been included in the hard drive of the computer offered for sale on ebay we fully expect mr chapman to hand it back to graphic data as soon as possible
7797579 we will of course work with graphic data to establish how it came to be available for sale on our site

7797584 although the cockroaches will always be fine humans may not
7797585 what people are really looking for is hope if people knew what to do they would do it we need the science to tell us what to do
7797586 tests for perfect pitch have always demanded that subjects already have some musical training or at least familiarity with a particular piece of music which really limits the pool of candidates you can test
7797587 that means nobody really knew how prevalent perfect pitch is in humans in general

7797600 it is unfortunate that a major film studio would choose to exploit an ethnic slur as a sensational promotion for a movie mainstreaming a bigoted term in this manner will only serve to legitimise and normalise anti muslim prejudice in our society
7797601 not to force the artist to alter her work but instead to use the occasion of that work as an entry point for meaningful debate and discussion

7797608 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7797609 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7797610 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7797611 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7797612 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7797613 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7797614 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7797615 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7797616 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7797617 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7797618 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7797619 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7797620 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
7797621 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
7797622 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
7797623 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
7797624 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
7797625 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
7797626 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
7797627 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
7797628 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
7797629 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
7797630 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
7797631 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
7797632 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
7797633 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
7797634 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
7797635 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
7797636 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
7797637 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
7797638 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
7797639 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
7797640 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
7797641 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
7797642 f or joe biden to talk about qualifications hes never run a city hes never run a state hes never run a business
7797643 i dont have to debate you because everyone already knows im right

7797645 we receive inquiries from all over the world there is enormous interest in current
7797646 according to our observations germany is a market that could soon be ripe for current
7797647 tv and the web amount to the same thing to us
7797648 unlike most broadcasters we do not only use television to attract people to the internet on the contrary people go to current com swap thoughts concerns and videos and then we bring the best of it to the tv screen
7797649 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7797650 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
7797651 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
7797652 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual

7797659 we dont understand the purpose of sleep but it must be important because all animals do it
7797660 the very fact that dolphins have developed the remarkable specialization rather than merely getting rid of sleep altogether should count as evidence that sleep must serve some essential function and cannot be eliminated
7797661 sleep may be the price you pay so your brain can be plastic the next day

7797667 ninth street will be closed to all through traffic including emergency vehicles for approximately one half a block between main street and commerce street in both directions
7797668 the street closure will start at commerce street and extend about 50 feet towards main street local traffic will be able to enter ninth street from main street and access all businesses and parking lots between main and commerce streets up to and including the midtown deck level d parking entrance the wachovia drive thru windows and the ninth street parlor
7797669 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7797670 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7797671 this is a planning took where all things are going
7797672 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7797673 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7797674 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7797675 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7797676 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7797677 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7797678 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7797679 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7797680 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7797681 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7797682 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7797683 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7797684 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7797685 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7797686 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7797687 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7797688 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7797689 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7797690 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7797691 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7797692 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7797693 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7797694 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7797695 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7797696 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7797697 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7797698 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7797699 solo negli ultimi due mesi ne abbiamo vendute tra le 600 e le 800 copie

7797701 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7797702 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7797703 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7797704 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7797705 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7797706 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7797707 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7797708 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7797709 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7797710 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7797711 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7797712 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7797713 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7797714 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
7797715 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
7797716 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
7797717 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
7797718 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off
7797719 i have to put everything on the table i dont think its a good alternative but if they can prove that it is and they want to pay royalties to the taxpayer let us use those royalties to invest in renewable energy resources then we have something to talk about
7797720 oh were going to have elections were going to have them by october theyre going to be inclusive theyre going to be transparent theyre going to be fair and this or that
7797721 were not staying around for ever for you to get around to this you have to do it now overdue
7797722 help me out here madame speaker when does life begin
7797723 the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose roe v wade talks about very clear definitions of when the child first trimester certain considerations second trimester not so third trimester theres very clear distinctions
7797724 and if that in fact is a a a a good alternative then that is something that we should do
7797725 we believe that coal use will increase under any foreseeable scenario because it is cheap and abundant
7797726 should and will take actions to reduce the emissions of co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions
7797727 coal will continue to play a large and indispensable role in a greenhouse gas constrained world
7797728 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7797729 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7797730 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7797731 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7797732 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7797733 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
7797734 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
7797735 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7797736 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7797737 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7797738 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7797739 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7797740 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7797741 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7797742 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7797743 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7797744 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7797745 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7797746 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7797747 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7797748 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7797749 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7797750 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7797751 i keep saying that money is available but i am not going to say how much but it is enough to buy an experienced international player
7797752 weve had a smooth beginning to the 2008 2009 school year
7797753 it builds a relationship between teachers and students coming in
7797754 with the additions that are coming theyre without a lunchroom right now
7797755 theyre going to have a beautiful lunchroom with lots of glass and great views
7797756 some of its just getting to know what they need
7797757 everythings going great we couldnt ask for a smoother transition
7797758 the students are excited and the teachers are enthusiastic were looking forward to a great year
7797759 lets get through high school first in two years im hoping a college will pay attention to her

7797771 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7797772 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7797773 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7797774 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7797775 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7797776 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste

7797778 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7797779 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7797780 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7797781 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7797782 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7797783 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7797784 it could be good for the nation if other corporate companies could emulate what standard bank has done to work with undp on an issue that is of national and global concern
7797785 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7797786 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way

7797789 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7797790 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7797791 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7797792 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7797793 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7797794 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7797795 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7797796 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7797797 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7797798 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7797799 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7797800 his name and what he achieved its so far out of any players reach in his time or any player who has played since its almost like he played a different game to what were playing
7797801 he would have been the stand out player whatever generation he played in
7797802 the worlds spiritual home of cricket don being by far the best cricketer of all time
7797803 it will not only be the bradman museum but it will be the international cricket hall of fame whose captain will be don bradman and the team will be obviously the best
7797804 the initial team of 12 people will be from all over the world i dont know exactly who they will be but they will include people like sachin tendulkar from india
7797805 as the hall of the fame is implemented we will be setting up to embrace the other cricket nations like india and pakistan
7797806 he gave australia pride and hope at a time when through the depression and wwii we really needed it
7797807 we had a tiny population then and the fact that he could go out and be the worlds best gave a lot of hope to australia
7797808 i think its one of the reasons why australia does so well in sport now we can approach any sport and challenge the worlds best we dont feel diffident we dont feel that we cant win at any sport that we do
7797809 the wonderful values that cricket has and how it helps society helps young people learn fairness and competition
7797810 i actually have a letter from him where he talks about fame being his unsought companion all his years and thats how he felt a very modest man
7797811 saya harap kami bisa menjalani akhir pekan yang lebih baik di misano walau musim lalu saya sial pembalap lain membuat saya jatuh di tikungan pertama
7797812 dari sudut pandang pengaturan motor yang terpenting di misano adalah memiliki kemampuang pengereman yang baik dan stabilitas bagus saat berakselerasi di tikungan itu adalah tipe lintasan yang membutuhkan anda melaju dengan agresif
7797813 bagian favorit saya adalah di bagian akhir tapi bagian terpenting untuk waktu lap yang bagus adalah di awal atmosfernya bagus dan itu bisa jadi sedemikian intens anda menghadapi banyak fans valentino rossi di sana karena kampung halamannya tidak jauh
7797814 if we could prevent these infections in the first place or detect them sooner we might one day be able to prevent some of these premature births
7797815 to find that this amniotic compartment which we have traditionally viewed as somewhat sacrosanct is infected significantly more often than we thought is a little shocking
7797816 weve become very good at growing some bacterial species what might be called the weeds of the microbial world
7797817 but many other species cant be cultured by current methods
7797818 although we know now that humans should respect and even cherish their microbial symbionts
7797819 this type of infection reflects a situation in which our microbial companions have overstepped their bounds something has gone awry with this balance
7797820 this is a story the world needs to see personally i think its moving ive found hundreds if not thousands of people who believe it and couldnt find anyone who didnt it blew my mind when i saw it
7797821 i dont want to steer the documentary in any direction at all id rather present all the evidence and let people make up their own minds
7797822 this bridge is nothing short of a disaster right now
7797823 the lines have been painted and the street lights have been fixed the roadway signage has been improved
7797824 we want a total safety inspection of the signs bridge security and safety
7797825 what we are looking to have are speed limit signs that are more visible and additional signs to help drivers navigate their way across the bridge
7797826 we want to have arrows that indicate sharp curves on the bridge and that the area is heavily monitored for speeders
7797827 there is a police cruiser parked on the weymouth side of the bridge a few times each week that watches for speeders and im happy to see that
7797828 the last thing you want to see is 20 different signs because they would lost their visibility and prominence
7797829 lenders are able to use arrangement fees as a hidden way of boosting the overall cost of the mortgage
7797830 its worrying that some of the lenders taking the most business have introduced the biggest fee increases
7797831 lenders are clearly still intent on improving margins this situation is unlikely to change in the near future
7797832 hes this scrappy irish catholic and he has a long and powerful record of speaking his mind
7797833 you cant find a more regular guy than joe biden he would be the kind of guy you would expect to find in the parish hall in the neighborhood
7797834 getting devean back in a mavs uniform has been a goal of ours all summer
7797835 his experience and ability to run the floor and play and defend multiple positions will be a great asset for us this season
7797836 who do you trust more to be commander in chief
7797837 young people are hungry for something other than how to triage the outcome of an election
7797838 you are the reason we are here i told him
7797839 winning it on the ground is asking to make it personal having all those conversations we were trained not to have remember how you were not supposed to talk about politics
7797840 grassroots happens in many ways under the radar screen its why im skeptical about polling
7797841 i think what that reflects is that nobody is buying 100 percent of what either party is selling
7797842 theres an appetite out there for saying we dont have to agree on everything to work together on some things
7797843 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7797844 we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7797845 bill clinton knows a little bit about trying to yank the economy out of the doldrums
7797846 it wouldnt make sense for me to want to edit his remarks
7797847 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7797848 i have a very honorable opponent there are stark differences between us
7797849 hes been a fighter for the hispanic community hes been a fighter for the immigration issue
7797850 when he came back my father was a mentor for him
7797851 im sure we can work out a compromise that will satisfy the commonwealth and miss tuckers family
7797852 could i just mention to you jay that in a moment of seriousness i spent five and a half years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair
7797853 i spent those five and half years not because i wanted to get a house when i got back home
7797854 and my friends im proud of my record of service to this country and it has nothing to do with houses
7797855 he told me he was mad at his ex girlfriend and he was going to take it out on someone
7797856 he told me the only way youre going to leave here is im going to kill you and then im going to kill myself
7797857 well over 80 per cent of people on that flight knew they were going to die
7797858 from where i was sitting i could see about 20 masks and only a few of them were inflating
7797859 it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
7797860 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
7797861 sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air
7797862 you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like somebody had opened a door in the back of the aircraft it was incredibly cold
7797863 we zijn verbluft we zijn onder de indruk we zijn ondersteboven maar we zijn niet ge ntimideerd
7797864 wie herinnert zich nog de openingsceremonies van athene atlanta sydney of seoul

7797867 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities
7797868 this measure has been effective on august 14 and related parties have been notified of it
7797869 north korea is trying to muddle through and delay as much as possible
7797870 at the same time this is a last ditch effort trying to somehow influence u s presidential politics
7797871 they went apparently with the intent to conduct a cordon and search because of allegations there may have been weapons in the camp
7797872 the government has been waiting for an opportunity to close the camp down
7797873 if people start to have the feeling that the war has been taken to the camps then youre talking about a tinderbox
7797874 the government wants to evacuate the camp by any means peacefully or by force
7797875 kalma is seen as a stronghold and thats why the government targeted this camp
7797876 its been an amazing ride but there seemed to be too many moments when the compromises seemed too huge
7797877 im an old man i really need to sit down

7797880 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7797881 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7797882 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7797883 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7797884 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7797885 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7797886 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7797887 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7797888 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7797889 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7797890 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7797891 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7797892 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7797893 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7797894 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7797895 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7797896 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7797897 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7797898 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7797899 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7797900 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7797901 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7797902 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7797903 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7797904 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7797905 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7797906 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7797907 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7797908 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7797909 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7797910 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7797911 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7797912 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7797913 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7797914 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7797915 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7797916 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7797917 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7797918 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7797919 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7797920 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7797921 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7797922 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7797923 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7797924 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7797925 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7797926 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7797927 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7797928 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7797929 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7797930 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7797931 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7797932 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7797933 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7797934 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7797935 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7797936 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7797937 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7797938 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7797939 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7797940 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7797941 al qaeda in britain will target all the political leaders especially tony blair and gordan sic brown
7797942 this is a very sensitive time for all our communities and we are working hard to ensure everyone is kept up to date with as much information as we can give
7797943 i certainly think there is a huge amount of risk involved in this now
7797944 were talking a matter of weeks the whole situation has very much swung in the opposite direction
7797945 anton is up this morning for a medical were looking to tie it up
7797946 i will be delighted if i can get him and another one and then we can concentrate on the season
7797947 hes has a slight hamstring strain so it would be unfair to throw him straight in
7797948 there is an international break coming up so it would give him a chance to train with us for two weeks
7797949 the monthly numbers of approvals for house purchase which have fallen by some two thirds over the last year levelled off in july it would however be premature to think that the housing market will now start to recover because overall approval activity continues to be very low
7797950 were a triumph of the will for a people and a government determined to show their skill and confidence

7797957 they were a triumph of the will for a people and a government determined to show their skill and confidence as both athletes and organizers to a world that once treated china as a weak servile nation
7797958 china won the most gold medals hardly a surprise when a country of 1 3 billion people decides such a goal is important and commits enormous resources to achieving it
7797959 china also built sports venues that combined gargantuan scale and striking architecture in a way no previous olympic host could afford
7797960 i used to have one tiny rack i shared with my ex so i used to put my shoes all over the house they were displayed lik
7797961 i used to have one tiny rack i shared with my ex so i used to put my shoes all over the house they were displayed lik
7797962 oh theres nothing wrong with me im just an introvert
7797963 is yoga really all that effective in helping one to lose weight
7797964 dormant forces are awakened and you find yourself to be a better person than you ever imagined
7797965 i have attended many olympic games since helsinki 1952 finland and the ones of beijing 2008 have been the best i have ever seen
7797966 good organization and facilities and it has presented to the world the best stadium and swimming pool of the world
7797967 china achieved very good results they are the first at the gold medal table
7797968 were a triumph of the will for a people and a government determined to show their skill and confidence

7797974 millions of americans suffer from problem or pathological gambling that can destroy families we support legislation prohibiting gambling over the internet or in student athletics by student athletes who are participating in competitive sports
7797975 this shouldnt be a partisan issue it should be a personal freedom issue
7797976 my point is simple is the republican party no longer the party of personal freedom and individual responsibility
7797977 why has this party that used to protect my rights now become the party that wants to create a nanny state
7797978 should republicans adopt a party plank at the upcoming national convention to rescind the ban on internet gambling
7797979 go to the republican partys web site and start scrolling through the responses to the platform you will see an army of poker players arguing it is time for republicans to end their opposition to gambling online
7797980 a lot of republicans have a love hate relationship with the poker community
7797981 a lot of republicans play poker but the christian right wants to ban poker playing
7797982 even the most ambitious gamblers know getting republicans to publicly support them is not a safe bet
7797983 while i would support a nod to internet gaming in the platform i cannot imagine that such language would be added at this late date
7797984 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7797985 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7797986 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7797987 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7797988 at the end of every public outreach each individual will be given the opportunity to decide whether he or she supports the charter or otherwise
7797989 this will be undertaken without coercion or any undue pressure and the decision will safely be the prerogative of each individual
7797990 in the short term government aims to first tackle urgent challenges confronting the domestic economy particularly the need to cushion the impact of rising world food and crude oil prices
7797991 for medium to long term government aims to gradually reduce budget deficits to a sustainable debt level in order to promote economic growth and fund essential public services
7797992 over the medium term government aims to grow its savings by confining operating expenditures at or below growth in operating revenue
7797993 im lucky that my boss gives me some pretty great storylines
7797994 i like the fact that just when you think youve got billy figured out hell do something that will totally surprise you
7797995 billy has always had this dark side to him its only recently that he has become a family man and thats down to honey
7797996 even though hes the runt in the mitchell litter hes always had this huge chip on his shoulder which i think makes him more dangerous than phil or grant
7797997 despite what they thought i honestly felt there was more mileage for her but seeing as they havent killed her off i guess there is still a chance she could wander back one day
7797998 those scenes were some of my last on the show and i can honestly say that the tears are real
7797999 i cant say im looking forward to the best mans speech he has a long list of things hes not allowed to talk about but im sure there will be something about the rosie storyline ill have to grin and bear it
7798000 i hope i dont have a swollen face for the wedding corrie make up department and make sure the bruises are covered up for the pictures ive found out jennie has a very good right hook
7798001 at the heart of the whole story are these two people who love each other very much but too many things get in their way
7798002 its not going to be them back together all nice and happy there will be quite a few bridges to cross
7798003 i feel dehydrated i feel like im going crazy juju i feel like im living in a dream you know
7798004 you know how many times ive pinched my self trying to wake up from this nightmare am i crazy tell me im crazy jawhara tell me im crazy
7798005 7abeebti i told lita to make you some soup she told me you havent eaten for days
7798006 you have to its not a question its an order
7798007 ummm i just left to go get something from sultan centre o rada el bait
7798008 aha interesting you do realise its 1 15 am right
7798009 well im not gonna sit with you in the car this late at night mala da3y thats just asking for trouble
7798010 ok then come over we can sit in the garden
7798011 i dont know if this is the last time im gonna look into your eyes i dont know if youre gonna leave me again the last time i sat with you i thought i was gonna see you the next day but you left me flan you left me but for what for who flan i went crazy do you know that this is the first time in a week that i have not only left my house but left my room do you know how much effort it takes me to get up and go to the bathroom do you know how much ive cried in the past week flan i understand youre angry i understand you lost your mother i understand i swear i do but i need you to understand this 7abeebi that i wanna be here for you i really do you just need to give me a chance
7798012 i wanted to tell you ive missed you and i really dont think i can live without you thats why im calling your father as soon as i get the chance
7798013 our love is the greatest story never told part 13
7798014 it appears that significant comprehensive reform would not begin until september 2010
7798015 further studies should target underlying biologic and socioeconomic factors to explain these differences
7798016 numbers have been creeping up for several years especially among young children
7798017 the bottom line is that we dont have enough information
7798018 we know that more children are diagnosed today than in the past
7798019 a lot of it is the change in what we call autism but we cant say that explains all of it
7798020 we certainly get indications that autism exists in other communities of the world but whether it exists to the same degree as common its not quite as clear
7798021 some perspective on the policy arguments between the mccain and obama camps
7798022 want the federal government making decisions for consumers or for providers
7798023 like other democrats he was pushing for a big government program to deal with what he saw as market failures in health care and to bring down the price of insurance
7798024 program was in place though he trusted a market of individuals to make its own decisions once the government had subsidized health insurance he thought the vast majority of the uninsured would sign up
7798025 find traction in the presidential race where health care remains a large issue
7798026 give both candidates a spring board to tout their very different health care plans
7798027 move some money from here to there cut some government waste no one apparently ever noticed and then fund an unattainable promise with an outlandish price tag
7798028 totes up dubious savings to fund his ultimate goal of making health insurance affordable to everyone
7798029 obamas own web site points out that health insurance premiums have risen six times faster than wages in the last four years
7798030 to be sure there are many laudable goals in obamas plan
7798031 improve the nations health and may moderate if not lower long term health care costs
7798032 near term price tag is clearly being underestimated to make the medicine go down a little easier
7798033 promises to provide every american access to affordable comprehensive health care and to achieve long overdue mental health and addiction treatment parity
7798034 thats right the dems will expand the number of people who receive subsidized health care provide better benefits and you apparently dont have to worry about costs going up
7798035 dems are going to eliminate waste in the medical system they will save the typical family up to 2 500 per year
7798036 how to pay for all these bright packages chances are that you wont have to give but only will get get get
7798037 then the platform promises a return to fiscal responsibility really
7798038 suggestion that mr obama is all rhetorical fluff is mistaken
7798039 place him at almost any point on the democratic political spectrum
7798040 era of big government would not be over in an obama administration
7798041 stigma associated with hiv aids is very very strong here
7798042 remains idle because the local community believe they cannot contract the disease
7798043 we need an aggressive awareness campaign in these remote areas
7798044 we have no picture or poster of a condom here we cannot take the risk
7798045 culture does not allow me to advise or discuss any sexual matter with a woman who is older than me
7798046 it may be possible to slow the rise of xdr tb deaths
7798047 by ensuring that patients are correctly diagnosed as early as possible and put on appropriate treatment for the correct length of time
7798048 extremely labor and resource intensive and has to be done within extremely well structured tb programs
7798049 the reason we have the problem is inadequate control of tb
7798050 aggressive treatment of xdr tb is the logical strategy to provide the best chance of treatment success while avoiding the creation of additional drug resistance
7798051 should be cautious in their hope to attain such success rates in settings with a high prevalence of hiv
7798052 relies upon existing statutes and existing court decisions as to the meaning of the word abortion
7798053 it focuses on abortion and focuses on physicians conscience in relation to that
7798054 dat betekent dat hij geen korpschef meer kan zijn en dus heb ik hem met buitengewoon verlof gestuurd het vervelende is dat de aivd verder over de bewijslast geen mededelingen doet ook naar de korpschef zelf niet dat maakt de aantijgingen lastig te weerleggen
7798055 klachten na drugsgebruik verminderen niet altijd vanzelf medische behandeling is dan noodzakelijk
7798056 na behandeling van een verslavingsarts verdwijnen de klachten of verminderen zij in veel gevallen sterk
7798057 i would say some people thought we were going to die that is how frightening it was the woman sitting in the seats in front of us was whimpering
7798058 there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft it was incredibly cold
7798059 the next thing the oxygen masks were dropping my highest priority was to get a mask onto my son who was sitting next to me in a bemused and frightened state
7798060 we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft as we landed we saw fire engines every quarter of a mile down the runway
7798061 it was obvious to me that there was depressurisation in the cabin but there was no announcement and no evidence of the cabin crew for most of this experience
7798062 our engineers have inspected the aircraft overnight and have confirmed that the oxygen masks which deployed were working properly
7798063 in accordance with ryanairs safety procedure during this de pressurisation incident the pilots and cabin crew also deployed their oxygen masks until the aircraft made a controlled descent to 8 000ft at which stage it was safe for the pilot to make a public address announcement advising all passengers that they would be diverting as a safety precaution to limoges airport where ryanair were arranging for a replacement aircraft to take them onwards to their destination in barcelona girona
7798064 ryanair will this morning be in contact with all the passengers on board the aircraft to communicate our sincere apologies for any distress or delay the passengers on board may have suffered due to this depressurisation incident
7798065 vasto conflicto ocurrido 20 a os antes de la trilog a original y que decidi el destino de la galaxia la rep blica se convertir a en un imperio la orden jedi ser a exterminada y la oscuridad se impondr a a la luz
7798066 now the old king is dead long live the king
7798067 door een gereformeerde ouderling in de kerkenraad werd ook gereformeerde predikanten gevraagd voor te gaan de gemeente groeide van acht naar zestig leden
7798068 kijk naar het nieuwe liedboek dat in 2012 af moet zijn zijn we blij als we bereikt hebben dat de 150 psalmen er nog in staan of zeggen we er ook wat van als zon 20 procent van de liederen geen gereformeerde inhoud heeft
7798069 de heilige geest is als ik het zo zeggen mag een laatkomer dat verzin ik niet dat kun je vinden in johannes 7 39 de geest was er nog niet omdat jezus nog niet verheerlijkt was hier wordt vooruitgegrepen op wat later over de parakleet gezegd wordt als ik niet heenga zegt jezus kan de parakleet niet komen 16 7 de komst van de geest komt na kruis en opstanding
7798070 de heerlijkheid die christenen te wachten staat kunnen ze zelf niet begrijpen ook al verlangen ze ernaar dieper kun je het nog niet niet peilen de heilige geest geeft geen direct antwoord maar neemt met de gelovige die zwakheid op zich god die de harten doorzoekt vindt daar de geest die zucht die onder woorden brengt wat de gelovige niet kan verwoorden tegelijkertijd is de geest de grote steun in het leven bij matthe s neemt de geest het over van gelovigen bij lukas is hij de persoon die leert wat je moet zeggen de gelovige is niet puur een instrument maar wordt ook ingeschakeld de geest als leermeester is te vinden bij johannes het verabsoluteren van je eigen ervaringen en de heilige geest gaan dus nooit samen
7798071 ambitie is een van de gevaren die je bedreigen in theologenland
7798072 als predikant sta je voor de gemeente maar je moet ook wachtlopen voor je eigen hart als centrum van het leven moet je zorg dragen voor je hart
7798073 now that the u s breached the agreed points the north is compelled to take
7798074 we urge north korea to resume disablement measures at an early date
7798075 i think this represents the biggest crisis to the denuclearization process since the feb 13 agreement
7798076 the norths kim jong il may have decided that he wont negotiate with the bush administration any more

7798088 they should take a low profile their movements should be restricted during this period
7798089 there were no injuries and minimal damage to the vehicle
7798090 we are coordinating with pakistani authorities in investigating the incident
7798091 i think that it is no secret and ive said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think the settlement activity is helpful to the process
7798092 what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7798093 in the end of the day the role of the leaders is to try to find a way to live in peace in the future and not to let any kind of noises that relate to the situation on the ground these days to enter the negotiation room
7798094 use it as an excuse and i know they are not using it as an excuse but i understand their frustration sometimes
7798095 will continue our efforts to reach a historic agreement before the end of the bush administration

7798100 i do work hard but it has given me a new life and i feel very grateful i love acting it is what i do and its sad that so many people today just want to be famous for being famous
7798101 i love them so much they are two wonderful boys and i really want to give them a normal childhood glastonbury this year and i did not want him to go but we have a very democratic system and his father jim felt he was ready
7798102 i was over ruled by it and he went i wasnt happy but i later found out that he was well looked after and he came back looking great we had a wonderful chat about how much he enjoyed it and i am really glad he went now
7798103 he is such a great boy as is lennon who i love reading stories to at night when i get home from holby
7798104 these abnormal features of tumor vessels impair delivery of circulating chemotherapeutic drugs to the actual tumor site
7798105 because high cell density increases contractility across the entire cell layer these findings suggested that tumor capillary cells are inherently hyper contractile
7798106 in this study weve uncovered a previously unrecognized role for tumor capillary cell mechanosensing and contractility in the formation of irregular tumor vessels and have identified potential new targets for vascular normalization therapy that might be implemented in the clinic someday

7798164 recently marines in iraq wrote to starbucks because they wanted to let them know how much they liked their coffees and to request that they send some of it to the troops there starbucks replied telling the marines thank you for their support of their business but that starbucks does not support the war nor anyone in it and that they would not send the troops their brand of coffee so as not to offend starbucks maybe we should not support them by buying any of their products i feel we should get this out in the open i know this war might not be very popular with some folks but that doesnt mean we dont support the boys on the ground fighting street to street and house to house
7798165 also dont forget that when the twin trade towers were hit the fire fighters and rescue workers went to starbucks because it was close by for water for the survivors and workers and starbucks charged them

7798170 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7798171 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7798172 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together

7798209 what we have witnessed in beijing is a truly spectacular olympic games
7798210 we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on this moment
7798211 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7798212 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7798213 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7798214 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7798215 no it was just really great to meet him and people that you usually see on tv like rafael nadal and roger federer

7798221 to look at congress and look at the american people and say that we made a huge mistake and were sorry thats hard thats very hard
7798222 native people have always provided in the last 40 to 50 years though we taught our children differently now with the cost of everything they cant afford it you have to change the way we look at food the way it used to be isnt the way it is anymore
7798223 were facing hard times and by all indications its going to get even harder
7798224 our people weve always been the consumptive part of society
7798225 we have to start thinking about production we also need to see the spirituality and we shouldnt be afraid to try new things
7798226 these animals were put here for us and kept our ancestors alive
7798227 theres that kinship and respect in our way when you dont respect something its going to go away

7798229 were trying to reinforce that theres a lot more to comprehensive education than just reading writing and math
7798230 and thats whats happening around the country the social sciences the social studies the arts if you will the humanities are being given short shrift just because of the pressure of no child left behind
7798231 i just see this as an opportunity for teachers to integrate some of this into what they are teaching
7798232 so as other or similar matters confront us we will be guided by that unless or until the commission changes that or a court or congress changes it

7798241 sort of like us he obama comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care
7798242 the reception is an opportunity for sen clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for sen obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7798243 in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
7798244 this campaign is not about barack obama and hillary clinton
7798245 his campaign is about george bush and four more years of george bush under john mccain
7798246 that message is going to echo clearly from this platform
7798247 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7798248 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature

7798264 so with barack obama and for you and for me our country will be committed to his cause the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7798265 barack obama has often been compared to a young jfk so for me this is the passing of the torch
7798266 my fellow americans i am so glad to be here and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7798267 if he can come here after what hes been through he shows the american people how important this election is and that no sacrifice is too great

7798269 our people answered his call and rose to the challenge and today an american flag still marks the surface of the moon yes we are americans we reach for the moon i know it ive seen it ive lived it and we can do it again

7798484 with the continuing decline of the ogallala aquifer water level and increasing cost of pumping water the use of drought tolerant and high yield corn hybrids is a key for sustainable corn production under limited irrigation
7798485 we hope to reduce the amount of water mandatory for corn by at least 10 percent
7798486 the new multiple stress tolerant corn lines can be used to produce corn hybrids adapted to texas and other southern states
7798487 they can be a powerful tool to save water and produce crops with yield and grain quality under stressful environments
7798488 most of our breeding efforts start by crossing tropical corn with temperate elite lines
7798489 then we select for desirable traits to broaden genetic diversity and introduce useful genes from exotic corn to improve stress tolerance agronomic productivity disease resistance insect resistance and value added grain characteristics

7798644 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7798645 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7798646 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7798647 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7798648 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7798649 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7798650 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7798651 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7798652 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7798653 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7798654 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7798655 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7798656 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7798657 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7798658 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7798659 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7798660 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7798661 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7798662 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7798663 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7798664 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7798665 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7798666 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7798667 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7798668 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7798669 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7798670 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7798671 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7798672 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

7798705 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7798706 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7798707 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7798708 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7798709 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7798710 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7798711 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7798712 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7798713 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7798714 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7798715 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7798716 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7798717 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7798718 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7798719 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7798720 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7798721 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7798722 who are open to doing something on the production side
7798723 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7798724 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7798725 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7798726 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7798727 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7798728 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7798729 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7798730 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7798731 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7798732 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7798733 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

7798755 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7798756 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

7798961 vor allem nieder sterreich muss h chstes interesse haben dass die fl chendeckende versorgung mit postdienstleistungen gesichert bleibt dies ist nicht nur f r die bev lkerung wichtig sondern auch f r den wirtschaftsstandort in vielen l ndlichen gemeinden bestehen keine postfilialen mehr was zahlreiche bewohner dazu zwingt viele kilometer zu fahren um etwa ein paket aufzugeben vor allem f r die ltere generation oder nicht so mobile mitb rgerinnen eine gro e belastung die notwendige infrastruktur im l ndlichen raum muss aufrechterhalten werden nicht vergessen werden darf der massive verlust an arbeitspl tzen bei einer neuen schlie ungswelle in vielen gemeinden hat sich sogar herauskristallisiert dass die postfiliale wieder aufgesperrt werden m sste denn viele postpartner haben bereits wieder aufgegeben bzw denken ans aufgeben
7798962 wenn sie das n chste mal an einem wahlplakat der sp vorbeigehen denken sie sich zum grinsenden faymann gesicht diesen slogan ich habe ihre 7 euro seniorenaktion der bb abgeschafft vielleicht hilft das um zu verstehen wie unsozial er in wahrheit handelt
7798963 bei der ver ffentlichung dieser antwort in faymanns leibblatt d rfte auch onkel hans entgangen sein dass faymann selbst f r diese ungeheuerlichkeit verantwortlich ist sonst h tte die krone das wohl gar nicht gedruckt
7798964 die seniorinnen und senioren z hlen zu den treusten bb kunden und haben in den letzten jahren dieses spezielle senioren ticket um 7 euro zahlreich genutzt um an wochenenden in sterreich zu reisen faymann bem ht sich auch hier nicht den ffentlichen verkehr leistbarer zu machen diese vorgangsweise faymanns ist nicht akzeptabel
7798965 grinsen ist f r einen verantwortungsvollen politiker einfach zu wenig es zeigt sich immer deutlicher machtmensch faymann predigt wasser und trinkt wein na dann prost f r sterreichs zukunft
7798966 langj hrige forderungen des bz wie die erh hung des pflegegeldes die verl ngerung der hacklerregelung die halbierung der mehrwertsteuer auf lebensmittel oder eine h here familienbeihilfe die noch vor wenigen wochen von sp obmann regierungskoordinator werner faymann vehement abgelehnt wurden finden sich jetzt pl tzlich im forderungskatalog der sp wieder es stellt sich hier die frage ob krone herausgeber hans dichand mit seinem untr glichen gesp r f r die sorgen der menschen faymann geraten hat die langj hrigen forderungen und initiativen j rg haiders einfach zu bernehmen
7798967 dort wo sich unsere initiativen wie die erh hung des pflegegeldes die verl ngerung der hacklerregelung die halbierung der mehrwertsteuer auf lebensmittel oder eine h here familienbeihilfe wir diese im neuen freien spiel der kr fte unterst tzen werden
7798968 1 amtlicher preisstopp und h chstpreis f r diesel und benzin 2 senkung der mineral lsteuer 3 r cknahme der steuererh hung auf heiz l 4 halbierung der steuern auf lebensmittel medikamente und mieten 5 teuerungs ausgleich nach k rntner vorbild 6 billigdieseltankstellen nach k rntner vorbild 7 steuerentlastung f r den mittelstand 8 gerechte erh hung der pensionen 9 robin hood steuer f r mineral lkonzerne 10 keine erh hung von gaspreis und strompreis
7798969 hier wird sich zeigen ob faymann ber die parteigrenzen im sinne der menschen handelt oder ob sein sozialschwenk rein wahltaktische motive hat
7798970 eine senkung ist eine richtige und wichtige soforthilfe im kampf gegen die teuerung die allen zu gute kommt wenn sie streng kontrolliert und an die konsumentinnen weiter gegeben wird

7798979 wer unsere jugend schlecht macht macht unserer zukunft schlecht tausende jugendliche leisten beispielsweise in vereinen einen wertvollen beitrag zu unserer gesellschaft wegen einiger schwarzen schafe eine jugendhatz zu inszenieren lehnt das bz massiv ab
7798980 hier denke ich an eine ffnung und somit die nutzung der sportlichen infrastruktur von vereinen mit gebietsk rperschaften f r sch ler auch an nachmittagen und an den wochenenden damit k nnte man ihnen ein entsprechendes angebot zur k rperlichen ert chtigung auch unter professioneller anleitung durch trainer dieser vereine erm glichen

7799015 we continue to find the way to reach an agreement between israel and the palestinians
7799016 very heartened by the fact that the negotiations are serious and they are intensive
7799017 in fact i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together over this period of time
7799018 construction in the settlements has increased by a factor of 1 8 by comparison to the same period last year
7799019 the housing ministry initiated 433 new housing units during the period of january to may 2008 compared to just 240 units during the period january to may 2007
7799020 i would like to suggest to my partners not to use it as an excuse and i know they are not using it as an excuse but i understand their frustration sometimes
7799021 but at the end of the day the israeli governments policy is not to expand settlements not to build new settlements and not to confiscate palestinian land
7799022 there were some small activities but they will not influence the ability to negotiate nor the future of the future borders of the palestinian state
7799023 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and that anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7799024 and we will continue to press ahead to get agreement so that we know what is in israel and what is palestinian
7799025 bartenstein verschleppt und verschleppt wen will er damit decken auch in der gestrigen preiskommissionssitzung stellte sich wieder einmal heraus dass der preisminister seinen aufgaben nicht nachkommen will um transparenz hinsichtlich der in ster reich stark steigenden lebensmittelpreise herzustellen

7799043 lenders have been trying to stay out of the best rate tables now they are competing again on price however lenders are still hedging against the future probability of default with stricter criteria

7799050 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
7799051 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
7799052 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
7799053 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
7799054 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
7799055 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
7799056 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
7799057 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
7799058 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
7799059 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
7799060 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
7799061 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
7799062 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
7799063 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
7799064 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
7799065 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
7799066 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
7799067 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
7799068 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
7799069 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
7799070 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
7799071 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
7799072 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
7799073 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
7799074 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
7799075 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
7799076 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
7799077 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
7799078 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
7799079 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
7799080 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
7799081 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
7799082 these companies have gotten used to making money by cutting corners
7799083 unfortunately whats at stake is the lives of their passengers
7799084 i dont want a relationship i just want to have fun with other guys
7799085 en kan ik het niet laten in gedachten begin ik zo iemand te dissecteren
7799086 natuurlijk het raakt het onderwerp van leven en dood aan en dat ligt voor veel mensen gevoelig ik zit er niet mee ik sta graag in de controverse en de dood zelf heeft me nooit afgeschrikt ik was als kleine jongen al menselijke schedels aan het afkoken en als zeventienjarige werkte ik als hulpverpleger toen heb ik mijn eerste lijken gezien en heb ik geleerd het is iets heel normaals de dood is er voor ons en zal er na ons zijn het leven is een wimperknip in tijd en ruimte
7799087 dat hangt ervan af wat je onder kunst verstaat ik noem het anatomische kunst een esthetisch didactische presentatie van het innerlijke lichaam ik zoek in mijn specimens elegantie en schoonheid maar ik wil mensen ook doen beseffen dat hun lichaam sterfelijk is op de tentoonstelling zie je rooklongen zieke levers lichamen met overgewicht dat doet nadenken
7799088 anytime you got a team like minnesota thats right there and were getting close to september that kind of enhances it
7799089 weve talked about it anytime you can tie or move ahead of the greats that played the game its very humbling its something you look back and feel very honored you cherish that for sure
7799090 i dont try to hit homers i try to just keep the ball in the gap and in the center of the field
7799091 you wouldnt know if it was his first or his 30th in a low scoring ballgame he set the tone thats what he does he does it from a spot in the order that can give us a lot of energy
7799092 if we put on a run here theres no question we can make it
7799093 theres no question with the number of games we have left its possible
7799094 were finding ways to win right now and thats what you want
7799095 ive been having some good games in the late innings
7799096 i tried to run it in on him but he got a good swing

7799103 now that we are friends it is not something i have to worry about
7799104 for me michael phelps is a huge inspiration and someone i really look up to
7799105 to win a silver medal is certainly more than i ever dreamed of as a kid and im very proud of what i did over there
7799106 but missing out on gold yeah that will definitely be inspiring me now motivating me just knowing that i have those big swims those big achievements still within me
7799107 we are enjoying being good friends we have spent two years together you don amp squo t lose that

7799117 revolutie in het gekkenhuis is een wending in de nederlandse letteren het bevat korte verhalen die geschreven zijn in een verfrissend proza lichtvoetig en direkt zo helder en simpel dat gesproken kan worden van een breuk met de heersende literatuuropvattingen die er volgens de auteur op zijn gericht de lezer in te lijven in een burgermanswereld waarin slechts plaats is voor oppervlakkigheid levensangst of oeverloos gezeur de verhalen vari ren van bizar tot regelrecht ontroerend met n duidelijke lijn het gevecht van het individu met de verstikkende maatschappelijke krachten

7799130 ik leef in een wereld met andere mensen van alle soorten rassen godsdiensten volkeren talen doorbreek de ban van een ingestelde orde dat alleen deze godsdienst goed is of die kerk is juist of dit ras is beter doorbreek dat krijg een gevoel voor de mensheid voor iedereen en dan blijf je wat je bent je mag jood blijven je mag iets anders blijven zoals iemand die kleur haren en die kleur ogen heeft maar de mens is een mens naar het beeld van god gemaakt en krijg een gevoel van verantwoordelijkheid voor de mens berhaupt waar die ook is een ding zou ik positief kunnen zeggen dat is dit dat misschien in dit tijdperk de barri res weggebroken worden dat men niet meer dat heeft wat ik dan nog voel als een soort nacht in de wereld waar men nog volkeren barri res heeft en rassen en godsdiensten en kerken en sekten maar dat dit doorbroken wordt een soort universaliteit komt over de mens en wat hij is is punt 1 hij is een mens of hij nou katholiek is of jood of wat hij is een mens zo heb je ook joden en arabieren het zijn mensen aan beide kanten dat moet men ook beginnen te beseffen dat je zegt ik moet hier kiezen ik durf het er is een grote waarheid en er is een gemaakte en de mens weet drommels goed bij zichzelf waar de echte waarheid is en wat er gemaakt is hij wil het feitelijk niet weten maar hij moet wel eens wakker geschud worden dat doen de omstandigheden wel en dan moet hij weten hoe hij kiest die verantwoordelijkheid moet hij beseffen en zich dit realiseren ik l f in een wereld niet ons vaderland gaat goed deze vlag wappert fier dat is ook een deel van het spel ik heb niets tegen een vlag maar dat symbool mag niet iets dwaas gaan worden het mag je herinneren aan je omgeving en die naaste omgeving dat zeer zeker maar je moet niet je naaste omgeving meer lief hebben dan je verdere omgeving je moet de mens lief hebben je mag jezelf natuurlijk niet negeren stel je voor dat zou toch een dwaas leven zijn je bent het centrum toch van de wereld ieder mens voor zichzelf is weer het middelpunt en hij moet natuurlijk aan zichzelf denken maar niet in de zin van ik moet carri re maken of ik moet een auto kopen of ik moet dit kopen of een reis maken maar ik moet in terreinen komen met mijn benen ik moet wakker zijn dat is n van de dingen die ik verlang w s wakker en als je gewekt bent dan zul je wel eens met veel dingen ernstig in aanraking kunnen komen

7799144 no im not going to support this position until you provide a compelling argument for how rhetoric of violence has any advantages
7799145 the more extreme anti religious rhetoric calling all religious believers either stupid or deluded
7799146 the only thing it does is undermine our position and make it more difficult to argue for it by wasting our time having to explain away such hyperbolic rhetoric we are better off without it

7799151 rude is a nebulous concept which standards is pz violating and why are they appropriate in his context
7799152 they tune us out not just pz and his ilk but every atheist who they feel comfortable lumping in with him and further more it makes it more likely that theyll listen instead to the nutcases who do discriminate against us

7799178 wie dit commentaar leest denkt natuurlijk dat een krant die zich z fel afzet tegen het maatschappijontwrichtende tribalisme er zelf alles aan doet om deze hardnekkige splijtzwam ook in de eigen gelederen en kolommen te bestrijden het tegendeel blijkt vaak het geval er is juist geen onafhankelijke krant die zo veel tribale binding en belangenbehartiging stopt in haar columns en recensies en zelfs in haar verslaggeving en commentaar afgelopen zondag zou vk columnist en commentator die combinatie deugt niet en isra l lobbyist paul brill tijdens een vk forum in de balie de socioloog en publicist abram de swaan ondervragen over het toenemende anti isra l enthousiasme het moet gezegd dat martin sommer hierover echter met geen woord repte in zijn verslag het kan natuurlijk zijn dat de interne strijd tegen sektarische bedreiging van journalistieke onafhankelijkheid zijn vruchten begint af te werpen dat goede nieuws mag van mij best in de krant u laat uw zich als onafhankelijk afficherende krant misbruiken voor belangenbehartiging en zelfs pure agitprop
7799179 als er een wet openbaarheid media zou bestaan had u moeten antwoorden op de vraag wie mijn reactie zonder waarschuwing en mogelijkheid van bezwaar verweer en zelfs zonder mogelijkheid van eventuele correctie heeft verwijderd en waarom zon wet bestaat helaas nog niet maar het lijkt daartoe wel hoog tijd te worden
7799180 iemand zal deze willekeur en rechteloosheid toch eens openlijk aan de kaak moeten stellen
7799181 ik ken de zaak niet maar laat nu uitzoeken wie dit besluit heeft genomen n waarom op het eerste gezicht lijkt het me dat u in de ogen van de eindredacteur mogelijk te veel op de persoon hebt gespeeld en dat is in strijd met de regels maar ik wacht even af wat de exacte reden is overigens is de webbeheerder met vakantie dat zou kunnen verklaren waarom u niet bent gewaarschuwd
7799182 als het in het publieke debat niet toegestaan is om man en paard te noemen moet de volkskrant daar ook meteen mee stoppen mij is althans geen regel bekend op grond waarvan journalisten een grotere vrijheid van meningsuiting zouden hebben dan burgers dat zij daartoe meer mogelijkheden hebben staat wel vast in het publieke debat mogen man en paard worden genoemd zolang niemand wordt bedreigd als iemand zich beschadigd voelt kan hij altijd naar de rechter stappen dit is slechts n van de vele redenen waarom wij onze democratische rechtsstaat moeten laten koesteren dit kan een interessante procedure worden er staat veel op het spel en belangrijke vragen hebben al veel te lang op een antwoord moeten wachten wat is bijvoorbeeld de status van de reactieruimte onder het hoofdredactioneel commentaar volgens mij is dat een openbaar discussieforum waarvoor geen beperkingen gelden mbt de vrijheid van meningsuiting gelet op de dubbelfunctie van paul brill columnist n commentator vraag ik mij ook af of het wel juist is dat hij onder de dekmantel van anonimiteit zijn politieke activisme mag bedrijven in een zich als ongebonden en onafhankelijk aficherende krant is er iemand die wil en kan volhouden dat paul brill g n isra l lobbyist is en zijn alter ego john vinocur ik hoef maar de dikke map met hun columns er bij te pakken om deze aanduiding te rechtvaardigen met een overdaad aan citaten de vorige keer dat een bijdrage van mij werd verwijderd uit de reactieruimte onder het commentaar had ik trouwens de naam van paul brill in het geheel niet genoemd ik had alleen bezwaar gemaakt tegen de voortdurende oorlogshitserij door de volkskrant tegen iran misschien vond brill dat die schoen hem paste het belooft spannend te worden en daarom is het mij al die moeite wel waard
7799183 ik heb inmiddels antwoord u bent verwijderd omdat u paul bril een lobbyist noemt de redactie vindt het beledigend om een journalist die kwalificatie aan te smeren bovendien is het in strijd met de gebruiksvoorwaarden schelden en beledigen mag niet dat u niet gewaarschuwd bent heeft een andere reden u vraagt zoveel tijd van de forumredactie dat ze aan ander werk niet meer toe komt als ze al uw e mails moet beantwoorden naar mijn mening had u wel gewaarschuwd moeten worden en had u de gelegnheid moeten krijgen dit verwijt weg te halen u kennende zou u dat niet hebben gedaan en die inschatting heeft forum ook gemaakt mede daarom bent u niet gewaarschuwd ten slotte in de vizie van de redactie bent u gast op de site van de volkskrant zij mag haar eigen regels stellen ook als ze de gasten onwelgevallig zijn u hoeft zich niet in het debat te mengen u doet het vrijwillig dat betekent dat u zich wel zult moeten neerleggen bij de spelregels die er zijn ik denk dat die redenering standhoudt bij de raad voor de journalistiek
7799184 ook spelregels mogen niet willekeurig worden gehanteerd lees die spelregels nu eens goed door en vertel mij welke waarde heb ik geschonden welke wets regel heb ik overtreden wiens persoonlijke levenssfeer heb ik aangetast welk persoon heb ik bedreigd en welk belang heb ik geschaad door mijn persoonlijk mening te geven over een mijns inziens onmiskenbare waarheid dat zijn de vragen die de raad moet stellen de reactieruimte is wel degelijk een publiek discussieforum iedereen kan er immers aan deelnemen mits hij zij zich maar aan de spelregels houdt de redactie van de volkskrant hanteert een wel erg beperkte opvatting van de vrijheid van meningsuiting voor een krant is het ook wel een wonderlijke en zelfs beschamende opvatting en in ieder geval n waaraan zij zich zelf gelukkig niet houdt dat paul brill een lobbyist is blijkt duidelijk uit al zijn publicaties inclusief zijn recensies met name als die weer eens gaan over isra l iran irak het midden oosten het islamitisch gevaar en de vs zelfs als hij een forum over het humeur van nederland organiseert wil hij het over het isra l hebben het zal mij niet veel moeite kosten om mijn opvatting aannemelijk te maken ik wist trouwens niet dat lobbyist een scheldwoord was
7799185 nou in de ogen van de redactie kennelijk het journalistieke belang van paul bril een journalist een lobbyist noemen is natuurlijk fnuikend voor zijn naam maar het zijn leuke vragen voor de raad al weet ik niet zeker of de raad wel bevoegdheid heeft te oordelen over het weblog van de krant maar ook dat is interessant om te weten te komen
7799186 niemand heeft voorafgaand verlof nodig om door de drukpers gedachten of gevoelens te openbaren behoudens ieders verantwoordelijkheid volgens de wet
7799187 een ieder heeft recht op vrijheid van mening en meningsuiting dit recht omvat de vrijheid om zonder inmenging een mening te koesteren en om door alle middelen en ongeacht grenzen inlichtingen en denkbeelden op te sporen te ontvangen en door te geven
7799188 zo is zonder overleg of waarschuwing een bijdrage verwijderd waarin een columnist van de krant uitvoerig gemotiveerd een lobbyist werd genoemd ik weet niet hoe valide de motivering was maar mag een lezer dat niet opschrijven volgens de redactie niet beledigend het moet weg luidde de redenering hier greep de redactie wel zelf in is iemand een lobbyist noemen erger dan iemand zonder aanleiding een domme lul noemen ik zou het toejuichen als hierin meer duidelijkheid komt liefst nadat iemand die zich beledigd voelt op het blog en in de kou gelaten door de redactie naar de rechter stapt dan weten we echt waar de grenzen liggen van het blog en de verantwoordelijkheid van de redactie tot het zo ver is lijkt het alsof de willekeur regeert
7799189 meneer van waning ik heb het al eerder gezegd en ik doe het nu opnieuw ik vind u een ongelooflijke zeurpiet stapt u alstublieft snel naar de raad voor de journalistiek om uw gelijk te halen van mij krijgt u het niet als u doorgaat met de redactie van de volkskrant lastig te vallen met uw volstrekt onnozele besognes verwijder ik u helemaal van dit weblog dan zoekt u uw heil maar elders
7799190 beste g j bogaerts bedoelt dat u overweegt om mijn eigen weblog te verwijderen omdat u niet gediend bent van mijn kritiek op uw willekeur uw partijdigheid en uw lange tenen dat gaat wel h l ver zijn daar regels voor of verzint u die desnoods ter plekke moet u uw beslissing nog motiveren of mag u gewoon uw gang gaan krijg ik eerst nog een waarschuwing
7799191 dit is mijn weblog ik heb hier minstens dezelfde rechten als bijvoorbeeld de huurder van een woning of bedrijfsruimte en verder gewoon ook alle rechten van een nederlands staatsburger daartoe behoort de vrijheid om mijn mening te uiten jullie hebben die rechten ook je mag schrijven wat je wilt je mag schimpen schelden beledigen onzin verkopen wat je maar wilt jouw mening en jouw uitingen vallen onder jouw verantwoordelijkheid niet het mijne ik ben alleen verantwoordelijk voor de uitingen van mijn eigen mening als het schelden te grof wordt houdt de discussie vanzelf op volgende keer beter hopelijk of niet ik mag hier dus schrijven wat ik wil zolang ik geen regels van wet of betamelijkheid schend de volkskrant heeft verder geen eisen of voorwaarden gesteld zoals bijvoorbeeld het niet mogen bekritiseren van journalisten en redacteuren ik val hier niemand lastig als theodora bij voorbeeld niet ter zake doende opmerkingen wil maken dan laat ik die staan zodat iedereen ze steeds zal kunnen blijven lezen en daarop desgewenst reageren dat is de enige sanctie die dit weblog kent je eigen mening en ja beperking van de vrijheid van meningsuiting raakt aan de essentie van onze democratische rechtsstaat ook hier
7799192 iemand die zeurt domme opmerkingen maakt beledigt of onredelijk is diskwalificeert inderdaad zichzelf zulke bijdragen moet je dus gewoon laten staan het enige nadeel daarvan is dat een lopende discussie moeilijker te volgen is met een blokkade van critici cre er je echter een irre el beeld van de reacties op je weblog je maakt er een applausmachine van met alleen maar instemming en loftuitingen sommige mensen hebben dat nodig we verbieden kranten radio en tv toch ook niet om kritiek te publiceren op politiek bestuur en cultuuruitingen de journalistiek heeft niet het alleenrecht op kritiek en het zou niet goed zijn als er geen kritiek op de journalistiek geleverd mocht worden redacties hebben toch al de neiging om onwelgevallige brieven niet te publiceren met al die blokkades en verwijderingen van kritiek wordt het wel erg eentonig in blogland en een beetje dictatoriaal in nederland hoeft niemand ooit afstand te doen van zijn grondrechten dus ook niet op het weblog van de volkskrant zolang ik geen onbehoorlijke of opruiende taal uitsla vieze plaatjes toon niemand persoonlijk beledig of kwets en zolang ik geen wetten overtreed mag ik hier net als bert wagendorp op z jn weblog schrijven wat k wil en niet wat jij g j theodora petrus drammen of wie dan ook wil de volkskrant heeft mij ettelijke malen uitgenodigd de ombudsman zelfs persoonlijk om mee te doen aan dit weblog en dat is precies wat ik nu doe niet meer en zeker niet minder
7799193 weblogs zijn niet per definitie een objectieve mediabron en zijn ook geen algemene spreekstoel voor vrijheid van meningsuiting niemand kan jou je grondrechten wat dat betreft afnemen wat de vk wel mag is jou zeggen dat je voor bepaalde onderwerpen een ander medium moet zoeken dan het vk weblog systeem zij hebben dus het recht van censuur op de door henzelf verzorgde spreekbuis
7799194 een eenzijdig verhaal vol fouten van het soort waarvoor martijn van calmthout zich verleden week voor de raad voor de journalistiek moest verantwoorden wat je in de ene pcm krant leest blijkt in de andere gewoon niet waar te zijn prof vdh had zelf die gretta passage e a al geschrapt op aanraden van zijn secretaresse de volkskrant is zelf allergisch voor stekelige lezers met onwelgevallige standpunten dus dit commentaar is niet alleen tendentieus maar ook hypocriet 500 tekens is te weinig
7799195 die vrijheid betekent dat ook plaats moet zijn voor excentrieke of stekelige persoonlijkheden die onwelgevallige standpunten verkondigen
7799196 ja enig aandringen van mij bracht de dader boven water ik heb hem gezegd dat ik het niet nodig vond die reactie te verwijderen maar daar kun je kennelijk over van mening verschillen en toen was het al gebeurd als hij inderdaad een vendetta tegen u voert is er voor mij alle reden daar iets aan te doen maar daarvan ben ik nog niet overtuigd temeer omdat hij uw andere reacties wel heeft laten staan ik had die eerste ook laten staan maar begrijp zijn standpunt wel het ging over van calmthout en uw zaak bij de raad en daar ging het commentaar niet over aan de andere kant beide zaken gaan in uw ogen over hetzelfde verkeerd citeren dan wel halve waarheden schrijven dat er nu ineens niet meer kan worden gediscussieerd over oude zaken lijkt me stug wel is het zo dat we vandaag alweer problemen hadden met het systeem dus het kan ook daaraan liggen
7799197 waarom vraagt kneepkens wel aan de politiek maar niet aan de volkskrant of men voor of tegen de doodstraf is waarom blijft de journalistiek altijd buiten schot en wordt zij nooit ter verantwoording geroepen voor foute opinies publicisten als kaplan brill en elshout die destijds de geesten rijp maakten voor de invasie in irak krijgen nu de gelegenheid om het vervolg daarvan uit te stippelen en tussen de regels de volgende oorlog voor te bereiden namelijk tegen iran nog voordat wij weten wat onze politieke leiders vinden hebben de journalistieke opinieleiders onze mening al be nvloed wij weten echter niets over hun achtergronden en loyaliteiten en dus ook niet over hun beweegredenen en doelstellingen foute journalistieke opinies moeten k worden bestreden of het nu gaat om oorlogshitserij vergoelijking van schendingen van mensen en burgerrechten of de weigering om zelf mee te doen aan afwending van ecologische en klimatologische rampen
7799198 het is bovendien goed te weten dat de koningin het vrije woord verdedigt zeker aan het einde van een jaar waarin justitie twee journalisten enkele dagen in gijzeling nam
7799199 de volkskrant toetst zelf de vrijheid van meningsuiting achteraf niet alleen aan wet aan de spelregels en aan normen van moraal en beschaving maar ook aan welgevalligheid
7799200 waarom blijft de journalistiek altijd buiten schot en wordt zij nooit ter verantwoording geroepen voor foute opinies
7799201 ik ken de zaak niet maar laat nu uitzoeken wie dit besluit heeft genomen n waarom op het eerste gezicht lijkt het me dat u in de ogen van de eindredacteur mogelijk te veel op de persoon hebt gespeeld en dat is in strijd met de regels
7799202 u bent verwijderd omdat u paul brill een lobbyist noemt
7799203 het recht om niet gekwetst te worden bestaat nu eenmaal niet in een rechtsstaat als de onze
7799204 je hoort de woorden klip en klaar nog maar zelden tegenwoordig houden politici meer van de term transparantie de politiek en de overheid moeten vooral transparant zijn
7799205 een onderbouwing van die kwalificaties ontbreekt in het interview zodat de lezer zelf moet invullen of uitzoeken waarom de voogd volgens de verslaggever eigengereid is en de universiteit weinig goeds heeft gebracht wie zo hard en ongemotiveerd uithaalt is bewust of onbewust bezig iemands reputatie te beschadigen daarvoor zou in de krant in deze vorm geen ruimte moeten zijn
7799206 naar aanleiding van dat publieke debat heeft columnist kennelijk zijn mening gevormd en deze in zijn column op satirische wijze weergegeven aan columnist kan onder deze omstandigheden niet de eis worden gesteld zijn op het publieke debat gebaseerde mening met feiten te onderbouwen en een voorbeeld te noemen van een door eiser in de wereld gebrachte leugen dit zou de vrijheid van columnist om zich in zijn column te beperken tot het door hem gekozen onderwerp te zeer aantasten
7799207 meneer die tekst zal mij worst wezen zolang er maar geen muren mee zijn beschadigd
7799208 volgens de rechter in arnhem had de krant ten tijde van de oorspronkelijke publicatie voldoende aanwijzingen voor de aantijgingen tegen janssen althans voor het deel dat niet is gerectificeerd
7799209 om te beslissen dat een publicatie onrechtmatig is is niet vereist dat de geuite beschuldigingen boven redelijke twijfel vaststaat voldoende is dat zij steun vindt in het ten tijde van de publicatie beschikbare feitenmateriaal naarmate de misstand ernstiger is en het beschikbare feitenmateriaal de beschuldigingen steunt is openbaarmaking eerder rechtmatig
7799210 het heet met een treffende term propaganda discipline en het is de grote frustratie van elke chinese journalist die zijn werk serieus wil nemen past een feit niet in het beeld dat chinas censuurapparaat van de werkelijkheid wil schetsen dan dient dat feit geschrapt of op zn minst flink bijgeschaafd
7799211 wij blijven een katholieke krant en zullen dat niet camoufleren
7799212 tot ver in de jaren vijftig werd de journalistiek in verzuilde kringen graag afgeschilderd als een politieke of religieuze roeping en veel katholieke journalisten ook die van de volkskrant waren innerlijk diep overtuigd van het apostolische karakter van hun beroep
7799213 tenslotte raakte de krant door de persoon van henri faas rechtstreeks betrokken bij de scheuring in de kvp en de oprichting van de ppr als uitgesproken voorstander van een doorbraak naar links en als tegenstander van een christelijke centrumpartij speelde faas een sleutelrol ook als auteur en journalist vervulde faas een rol als politiek makelaar met de volkskrant leidde hij de oppositie tegen de kvp alle goede voornemens ten spijt zou faas zich na de scheuring in de kvp in zijn artikelen nadrukkelijk als een partijganger manifesteren
7799214 heel gek toen de knaw eerder in den haag aan de bel trok over de risicos van al te nauwe betrokkenheid voor de onafhankelijkheid van de wetenschap wuifde men het weg het probleem was niet zo groot terwijl wij het als wetenschappers het over onszelf zeiden en dan komt de volkskrant er groot mee en is het ineens een onderwerp
7799215 de vermenging van wetenschap en commercie brengt het gevaar met zich mee dat bedrijfsberichten als academische kennis in het publieke domein terecht komen zo hield een door melkproducent campina gefinancierde bijzonder hoogleraar vorig jaar een oratie hoe gezond melk was de opmars van extern gefinancierde hoogleraren en het gebrek aan openheid over wie hen betaalt schaadt het aanzien van de wetenschap dat zegt vu hoogleraar martijn katan lid van de commissie van de knaw die strenge regels bepleit om belangenverstrengeling tegen te gaan
7799216 dat het niet gemakkelijk zal zijn de politieke dynamiek tot stand te brengen die nodig is om een militaire aanval in te zetten als dat de enig overgebleven optie zou blijken waar het werkelijk op neer komt is dat de marges voor de optie om n et in iran in te grijpen volgend jaar spectaculair smaller zullen worden
7799217 wat je zou hopen en verwachten is dat heilbrunn een stap verder zet en onderzoekt hoe een betrekkelijk kleine groep intellectuelen zo veel invloed kon verwerven in de regering bush
7799218 de burger blijft terecht invloed op macht eisen de burger vraagt om meer directe invloed vooral op de uitvoerende macht daar moet ruimte voor komen bijvoorbeeld door meer gezagsdragers rechtstreeks te laten kiezen de kamer mag ook het burgerinitiatief niet laten verlopen bestuurlijke vernieuwing blijft ook politiek aan de orde
7799219 mijn stelling is ophouden met dat gezeur over de toon van het debat geen emancipatie zonder polarisatie de emancipatie van de arbeider de vrouw en de en de homoseksueel is alleen gelukt door strijd door confrontatie het is klassiek marxistisch these antithese synthese
7799220 het negeren van kritiek of het attaqueren van de boodschapper is geen teken van kracht maar van zwakte
7799221 persvrijheid is bij het cda niet in goede handen stond op de forum pagina van de volkskrant van 22 05 200 een artikel van paul de beer henri polak hoogleraar voor arbeids verhoudingen aan de universiteit van amsterdam
7799222 het cda deinst er niet voor terug mensen die een naar zijn inzicht al te vrijmoedig gebruik van de persvrijheid maken de mond te snoeren betoogt paul de beer
7799223 het zijn voorbeelden van breideling van de persvrijheid die we geneigd zijn te associ ren met regimes als die in rusland indonesi of birma wie had ooit gedacht dat dergelijke aanvallen op de persvrijheid zich anno 2008 zouden voordoen in een land dat er zo graag prat op gaat ooit het toevluchtsoord te zijn geweest voor vrijdenkers als ren descartes en john locke nederland die ontwikkeling vormt een veel grotere bedreiging voor onze democratische rechtsstaat dan alle artikelen cartoons en films waar het cda zich aan stoort bij elkaar

7799225 wie pret wil hebben met dit raspaardje zoekt dus de kronkelweggetjes op
7799226 een weblog of reactie op een artikel column commentaar of programma is aanvaardbaar en mag dus niet worden verwijderd of bestraft als die niet n g kritischer grover onaangenamer of onredelijker is dan wat columnisten commentatoren redacteuren en analisten van de volkskrant hebben geschreven over minister rita verdonk
7799227 reverend wright has this liberation theology taught by you and many others during the last 25 years been successful in effecting change in the black community the theology encourages the african american to take responsibility for his own destiny but in my opinion still contradicts itself by encouraging blame on the white man for keeping the black man down may i ask what is the high school dropout rate of young black men what is the percentage of unmarried mothers in the black community what percentage of black men have children from different mothers and have neither a desire nor a sense of responsibility to take care of these children what is the percentage of black men in prison as opposed to the percentage black men represented in the general population what is the percentage of crimes committed by blacks is it greater than 15 the current percentage of blacks in america is the percentage of crime in all black neighborhoods higher than that of white neighborhoods what is the percentage of blacks on well fare as opposed to the general population

7799249 a constructive response to the power crisis from the mining and metallurgical industry
7799250 furthermore the emergency identified improvements needed to industry codes and standards and created an awareness of future electricity prices
7799251 the only response eskom had available to the emergency was to introduce load shedding despite the devastating effect it had on the sa economy and on the sadc but eskom acted correctly
7799252 it was the voluntary load reduction of the public and industry that allowed eskom to get its coal stocks under control
7799253 it must now build power stations it must keep the lights burning and it must return the situation to normality

7799284 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7799285 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation

7799287 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7799288 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans

7799292 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7799293 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7799294 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7799295 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

7799313 we only have one rule here in heaven dont step on the ducks
7799314 your punishment for stepping on a duck is to spend eternity chained to this ugly man
7799315 i wonder what i did to deserve being chained to you for all of eternity
7799316 i dont know about you but i stepped on a duck
7799317 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no
7799318 listen i want you guys to look after the girls look after mommy before i get there and ill see you guys on thursday all right
7799319 she was unbelievable but im not surprised when she does something she does it well
7799320 she told her story its a story that a lot of families can relate to her dad struggled worked hard and here his daughter is addressing the nation
7799321 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
7799322 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
7799323 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
7799324 their big challenge is convincing people that they will continue to be active in politics and theyre going to continue to have a voice
7799325 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported
7799326 an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections and was seeking to redeem himself to those closest to him yes that is who i supported
7799327 she knew she should not have participated in him running for president with this bomb waiting to go off she did she kinda loses my sympathy
7799328 i believe we are all owed a huge apology not self serving claims for pity by both john and elizabeth edwards who both knew about the affair and both decided to go forward and seek the democratic candidacy regardless of the titanic risk
7799329 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
7799330 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
7799331 i thought it was very naive on both their parts
7799332 it would be very sad if he were the nominee of our party right now
7799333 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7799334 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7799335 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7799336 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7799337 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7799338 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7799339 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7799340 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7799341 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba

7799343 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7799344 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7799345 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7799346 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7799347 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7799348 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

7799351 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7799352 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7799353 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7799354 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7799355 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7799356 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7799357 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7799358 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7799359 turcilor o s le treac optimismul dup jocul de m ine
7799360 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7799361 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7799362 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7799363 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7799364 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7799365 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7799366 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7799367 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7799368 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7799369 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7799370 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7799371 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7799372 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7799373 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7799374 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7799375 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7799376 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7799377 no ser facil por los numerosos compromisos del primer ministro
7799378 were monitoring the track of gustav and reviewing our destructive weather plans and procedures
7799379 mention subprime mortgages and the connotation is so negative that just the sound of them makes people cringe
7799380 it will pay interest significantly longer than the price of the distressed debt indicates
7799381 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7799382 clearly we found there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified them
7799383 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7799384 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7799385 the dialogue has not been completed it is arrogant and reckless for anybody to come and address parliament mugabe is not mandated by anyone to address parliament nobody has the right to address parliament before talks are completed
7799386 we are also in a difficult position because our national chairman lovemore moyo is now the speaker and we have to decide how to proceed
7799387 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
7799388 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
7799389 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
7799390 the negotiators have taken this very very far but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
7799391 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
7799392 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty
7799393 but the goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
7799394 that is the goal and that has been the goal from the beginning
7799395 we are making progress together in the defeat of iraqs enemies of all stripes
7799396 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
7799397 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
7799398 really we are very very close to closing this agreement
7799399 and as we said from the begininng there is no hidden agenda here
7799400 but really we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a successful conclusion
7799401 they are both going to do what they have to do
7799402 there is a lot obama could have done to unify the party and basically he hasnt lifted a finger
7799403 feels like the obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments
7799404 and he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process sen obama would go a long way towards healing these wounds if he were to specifically praise the accomplishments of the clinton presidency in a line or two during his speech on thursday
7799405 yes theres some scabs but sometimes underneath a scab theres a little bit of pus but we have to put some disinfectant on it so we that can heal the wound and move forward thats what the convention is about
7799406 there is a group of hillary people who are very angry very upset
7799407 some of its directed at the media very disappointed you cant control all those people these are ceos some of them major rich people
7799408 you cant call them and tell them what to do there is no question there is that category of people but i dont think people can blame her for their behavior i think thats probably unfair
7799409 her challenge is to make the most of the emotion without popping the roof off
7799410 she wants to reassert her relevance and introduce a new political identity
7799411 i think she understands that if she runs again she has to run a different style of campaign
7799412 and shes got a huge opening right now for the first time in her career she actually has a base to invigorate at the beginning of the 08 campaign she was the issue she had to explain herself her celebrity now shes got a base the working class and she needs to speak to them
7799413 hillary is very goal oriented and so the goal shifted from ive got to win to baracks got to win
7799414 with bill clinton the transition was harder because he wasnt the candidate its difficult when the candidate and the target of obamas primary campaign is his wife
7799415 maybe a little experience came through for me at 4 all in the last set
7799416 i have just come from south africa where my business is doing well i hope when the economy of this country returns to normal my brands will be seen in shops again
7799417 all these motherfuckers been patiently waitin since the west coast fell off the streets been watching the west coast never fell off i was sleep in compton
7799418 out here they call me all star game and every nigga with a gun is waiting on the 04 all star game so while you in the staples parking lot im watchin the corners with the safety on like ronnie lott
7799419 yet it is the unapologetic effort to rep his city and coast the dope aspects of his rhyming skills and some ability to exhibit perseverance that allowed the game to excel and reach a certain level of super stardom in the music scene
7799420 nachdem ich einige zeit in den usa gelebt habe und dort rennen gefahren bin kehre ich nach europa zur ck brands hatch ist mein heimrennen und es ist die n chstgelegene strecke zum haus meiner eltern in surrey in der formel ford stand ich in brands hatch schon auf startplatz eins ich fahre zum ersten mal seit vier jahren wieder ein rennen in england
7799421 ich kenne aus meiner bisherigen karriere beide streckenvarianten die dtm f hrt auf der extrem kurzen indy strecke das durchschnittstempo ist recht hoch woraus sich bei der kurzen streckendistanz die hohe zahl von 82 rennrunden ergibt und ich finde es immer sehr spannend auf strecken mit h henunterschieden zu fahren
7799422 auf schnellen kursen ist das berholen grunds tzlich schwieriger als auf langsameren au erdem ist die strecke sehr kurz ich bin mir sicher dass die druids haarnadelkurve nach der bergaufpassage ein idealer punkt ist um ein man ver zu wagen
7799423 wohin sollten sich die zuschauer setzen um m glichst viel zu erleben
7799424 das sch ne f r die zuschauer ist dass sie von vielen stellen einen gro teil der strecke sehen die erste kurve von der au enseite zu beobachten ist bestimmt spektakul r ebenso das tempo der autos in der bergaufpassage hin zur kehre und in der letzten kurve sind die fans relativ dicht an den rennwagen was ein sch nes gef hl von geschwindigkeit vermittelt

7799428 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7799429 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7799430 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7799431 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7799432 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7799433 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7799434 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7799435 the blame game and the cost shifting between different levels of government along with wasteful duplication of resources and the wide range of border anomalies we encounter make me at least open to considering a better way of governing australia

7799482 we are putting in place an integrated national knowledge network that would have nodes to all major institutions of higher education and learning
7799483 this network would help our institutions of higher learning to connect with each other and carry on the relevant interdisciplinary dialogue
7799484 collaboration and co creation are becoming the hallmark of higher education today in an increasingly democratizing and globalised world
7799485 academic resources can then flow from institutions like iits iims national research institutions and universities into each other enriching every participating institution
7799486 the first phase of the network will become functional before the end of this year and this iit at guwahati will be part of it

7799494 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite u
7799495 ending the war in iraq responsibly is in the broader strategic interests of the united states its long past time to drawdown our troop presence and to stop spending 10 billion a month in iraq so that we can increase resources for the mission in afghanistan rebuild our military and invest in our struggling economy at home
7799496 it became obvious to me 18 months to two years ago that with the retreat of the multiyear polar sea ice the coast guard was going to have to do more than it had in the past to provide maritime safety and security to northern and western alaska the arctic ocean and the beaufort sea
7799497 through the spring and summer weve been conducting a test bed for moving various coast guard units into the arctic environment and determining their suitability for service in northern alaska
7799498 the biggest hazard frankly is ensuring that we avoid sea ice
7799499 and the second issue is that helicopter operations will be constrained because in the arctic we have a concern with the ability to self rescue
7799500 so when you start launching helicopters and sending boats over the horizon you now have to worry about how do you get them back
7799501 for example if i have a ship of a certain size with a certain crew and a certain cargo inbound to new york at ambrose we understand what that means because we know the infrastructure
7799502 we know the traffic patterns we know past history with the company we know all the surrounding information for a vessel contact in much of the world
7799503 in order to project a surface presence in that part of the world for any extended period of time we very quickly realize that because of the weather conditions meaning that even though its more ice free than ever theres still ice much of the year and the distances involved these places are very far away
7799504 the issue of the full function operations the requirement to do everything we do in southern alaska in northern alaska at least seasonally will take several years perhaps up to five years to ramp up to a capability
7799505 and thats why were pushing forward to be positioned and to be prepared to ensure that we dont have a titanic of the north like the motor vessel explorer in antarctica last november
7799506 breaking our oil addiction requires helping our auto industry re tool to make fuel efficient cars and trucks which is why my energy plan includes 4 billion in the first year for this purpose as i have said repeatedly i also support providing additional assistance to the companies in future years to ensure that advanced fuel efficient vehicles will be made here in the us unfortunately john mccain has shown how out of touch he is with the struggles of everyday people and the needs of autoworkers by consistently saying no to loan guarantees for our domestic automakers why would auto workers trust john mccain to protect their jobs and provide much needed help for americas auto industry
7799507 i am deeply concerned by todays appeal to president medvedev by russias federation council and duma the upper and lower houses of russias parliament to recognize the georgian regions of abkhazia and south ossetia as independent countries

7799509 we get a lot of emails from people living with diabetes who tell us that healthy balance is the only fruit juice theyve found that fits their diet

7799644 my parents have shown me the value of hard work and understanding that i have to do this on my own dad always said people may think that because im your dad things will happen automatically but it will only happen if its right
7799645 my dad introduced me to a lot of things musically and politically and always encouraged me to read the papers and watch the news to take notice of whats going on around me i learned about a lot of things kids my age werent aware of
7799646 obviously im going to be biased but what i admire about her the most is that shes really done it her own way
7799647 she wouldnt do anything against her principles the way i put it is that i talk the talk but she walks the walk if theres any justice in this business she deserves great success
7799648 we are all alright and that is the main thing we got all the cattle out as well so none of them were hurt either weve got no idea at the moment what the cause was there was a lot of straw in there and machinery

7799651 as soon as it hit that its spent most of the time falling
7799652 in terms of falling this far this quickly it would easily be in the top three fastest falls no doubt about that
7799653 its been one hell of a fall for the aussie
7799654 we think the market is going to be surprised about the resilience of the australian economy so we think that the aussie will find some support
7799655 we like to think that were innovative and original so you cannot figure out what our next move is and you cant really define our ability or what you think the expectations are
7799656 i am delighted to hear that the valuable work done in the area of infectious diseases in animals can now move on to the next phase due to the bella moss foundations new status as a charity
7799657 over the last three years we have helped hundreds of pet owners as bacterial diseases like mrsa and clostridium difficile emerge to affect animals
7799658 unfortunately there is still no central register of known cases so it is difficult to say exactly how many pets are being infected in britain
7799659 this is something the foundation has been calling for as a matter of urgency because although reported numbers are still low compared to human infection rates we have no idea how many are missed or unreported each year
7799660 this is marvellous news for the foundation as we are now in a position to raise funds for academic research and educational events that will increase vets knowledge of mrsa in animals
7799661 i am delighted to hear that the valuable work done in the area of infectious diseases in animals can now move on to the next phase due to the bella moss foundations new status as a charity the extent of mrsa and other diseases in dogs is not really known only the fact that the numbers are rising vets will welcome the support and information provided by the charity i can see nothing but good coming from this
7799662 the work done by the bella moss foundation is exactly what vets and pet owners have needed the foundation has made the profession sit up and take notice of mrsa when it probably didnt want to and its fantastic that it now has charity status vets and owners have to work together with the same information to make sure that pets have the very best of care as a profession we have to be more focused on the best way to deal with mrsa and other serious infections and jill and the bella moss foundation is helping us do just that
7799663 ive never really got over the loss of bella she was my life companion maybe one day i will be ready again who knows in the meantime i have my work with the foundation to keep me busy and also to keep her memory alive
7799664 to be the founder and president of a charity in bellas name that has helped so many people across the world the foundation is going from strength to strength and is now a global point of reference and support for veterinarians and pet owners
7799665 we can think of no better way to neither conclude 2007 nor embark upon a truly new beginning of 2008 than with all the many meaningful blessings bestowed upon us by the best thing that has happened to our cat momo in this past year by discovering the bella moss foundation

7799672 he is not injured he got taken off because i wasnt happy with his performance and he has to do better in training this week to get a place in the team next week
7799673 i think it is a whole new ball game for wes hoolahan at norwich where it is a much bigger club than blackpool
7799674 i think at blackpool he was the star of the show and i think he was allowed to basically do what he wants
7799675 well no not here he will play my way or he wont play
7799676 it was a bad goal to give away from our point of view wes hoolahan will be very disappointed and he got told that at half time
7799677 i knew what he was trying to do he was trying to lift the ball away from the defender and jump at the same time you cant do that it is a 50 50 tackle you have to win the ball you have to make the tackle
7799678 he almost looks like he is jumping out of the way not to get injured and thats totally unacceptable and wes has been told that he understands that
7799679 ugh why would you want to stay up at school any longer

7799688 by tradition the stamps during a vacant see should be printed as soon as possible the rest has to do with an event that takes place solely in the vatican
7799689 during a vacant see period the power to authorize the issuing of new stamps or coins falls as with any other activity of the state into the hands of the cardinal camerlengo the head of the papal household for a brief period during which it is nevertheless necessary to reaffirm the continuity of the life of the state without interruption through the issuance of new stamps and printing of new coins
7799690 the announcement of the passing of john paul ii filled me and my collaborators not only with sorrow but also with a certain anxiety because we would need to make these stamps three in total very quickly but 26 years had passed since the last vacant see i vaguely remembered it my collaborators were just kids and many had never lived through one at all so there was a generational gap we had to overcome we had clear difficulties in beginning to design these stamps
7799691 finally some frescos from the apostolic room which one of our collaborators just happened to see one day came to our rescue
7799692 should be immediately pulled out of circulation they are no longer valid they can later be collected but they can no longer be used as postage

7799766 no one in world rugby is playing the way their coach is talking about not successfully anyway
7799767 everyone has discipline policies and a procedure in their game the way he is talking is nonsense you cant just play an expansive wide game
7799768 this is still a very good squad of players most are even at their peak or approaching it so there is plenty of talent but what they need is the organisation and discipline
7799769 the hard thing for peter is that he has never coached professionally and this is one of the most difficult teams to coach
7799770 he has to change his philosophy because it doesnt fit these players its not credible
7799771 the first lesson is that you dont necessarily do everything the fans want you to do
7799772 i am a fan too and i would love to have a squad that is much better than everyone elses
7799773 we are very nearly there but not quite i think we are quite happy we are not going to buy somebody who doesnt improve the squad
7799774 i keep saying there is money available but i am not going to say how much but it is enough to buy an experienced international player
7799775 we have won one match and lost one in the league and hopefully we will be in the draw for the champions league

7799777 you are all old and dont represent the future of horncastle what right have you to cling to the things of the past when the young people of horncastle want big things made of glass and interactive whiteboards
7799778 mr clark representing the young people of horncastle bugger off and leave our hall alone you dont know what you want and your half arsed attempts at being down and hip with the kids sending pointless surveys to kids incapable of seriousness and with no real hopes of ever being actually listened to are pointless
7799779 the sad truth is none of us on earth are completely obedient to god none of us can truly say we have never sinned

7799786 it was different for michael bisping i kind of feel i have passed that by a couple of years ago it would have been perfect but the kind of guys they pick now i could not be in the house with them for six weeks i would end up killing one of them ive paid my dues staying in nasty little hotels to train in florida gyms and to go back now and do that again would be a step backwards
7799787 now i have a contract with the ufc my views are different no doubt some of the guys who go on the ultimate fighter want to be noticed on tv and are guys who dont want to be fighters they seem to pick guys who are more entertaining for the show rather than the octagon mac danzig who won the last tuf series is a good friend of mine but in terms of the occupants of the house it was the worst so far ive not got the patience for that it wouldnt be a good place for me
7799788 i have been watching gono my whole career he has an interesting style and has fought some of the best in the world i think it will make for a very technical and exciting fight and definitely the toughest of my career so far to be given a fighter like gono in my debut is a gift it also shows that the ufc knows i can deal with top level fighters which is a huge compliment
7799789 rather than using all the new screens as simply additional distribution platforms we are building an entirely new interactive experience that makes connections between the audience and content more meaningful

7799853 the way african countries feel is that we need a fairer more equitable deal that is sensitive to the looming consequences of climate change on africa

7799930 det var en g ng en sn vit bj rn
7799931 qui n es esta mina flaco le veo cara conocida
7799932 muchas gracias qu verg enza es que estoy de festejo
7799933 no soy la persona ideal para decir si mi nueva pel cula completa o no una trilog a cuando termin de escribirla sent que algo hab a terminado fue previo a la decisi n de hacer el eternauta tuve la sensaci n de que mi cine empezar a a ir para otro lado
7799934 hubo incluso un director de una cultura muy diferente a la nuestra que me escribi despu s de cannes conmovido con la pel cula no me voy a poner a indagar qu le vio de fant stico mejor si fue as pero me extra porque a m me parece que no se puede entender sin ciertos c digos a alguien como pedro almod var en cambio le gusta y hace una lectura cercana pero con l compartimos una lengua una formaci n religiosa una dictadura tiene una mirada entra able sobre mi cine por muchas razones
7799935 hay una vida que tiene la pel cula en la discusi n de las personas que me parece interesante que si la pel cula satisface o conforma no ocurre las diferencias de opini n son algo propio de la naturaleza humana igualmente me gustar a hacer una pel cula en la que haya m s coincidencias
7799936 de alg n modo contin a la maldad no necesita la escena del represor con la picana el ctrica no necesita la escena aterradora y sangrienta justamente lo que tiene de incre ble el sistema es que con mucha delicadeza y elegancia uno puede matar gente sin ensuciarse las manos ni enterrar a nadie en la noche lo parad jico es que no hace falta el detective la polic a y el gran crimen para los mecanismos del ocultamiento todos esos mecanismos del policial est n disueltos en la familia de una manera muy interesante
7799937 hay a os de educaci n de fiestas de cumplea os en los que uno va aprendiendo qui nes importan y qui nes no importan es como si en la sociedad actual la familia se hubiera transformado en algo que tiene que ver con la propiedad la econom a y la sangre
7799938 en las tres pel culas la ciudad es la ci naga porque a m trabajar sobre un espacio inventado me da la posibilidad de escapar del realismo y el costumbrismo y de tener que ce irme a cierta documentaci n ganando en libertad narrativa
7799939 en parte de lo que se trata la pel cula es de mi sensaci n de que ese mundo se acaba que este mundo tal como lo hemos percibido y que en salta tiene unas formas narrativas muy claras con gente que te habla de usted y uno les habla de vos sin pensarlo esas formas de dominio naturalizadas llega a su fin en esta pel cula lo que intentaba era transmitir que esto no se sostiene m s la nica manera de sostener ese mundo es destruir la educaci n p blica y que la brecha entre poder y no poder sea abismal pero tal como est n las cosas ahora este mundo sigue inexplicablemente rodeado de fantasmas sin registro del servicio del humano que tiene a la vuelta hay algo del servicio personal que ejercen las personas que trabajan como empleados dom sticos en el norte que es esclavo y aferrarse a eso es de otro mundo
7799940 la primera circunstancia extraordinaria que propone un g nero fant stico como el de el eternauta es la idea de aunar algo totalmente heterog neo como la especie humana y ponerla frente a un equis invasor ajeno a la especie
7799941 otra cosa que me fascina contin a y una de las tentaciones para aceptar el proyecto fue la posibilidad de filmar buenos aires una ciudad donde estoy viviendo hace 20 a os desde una situaci n de tanta extranjeridad
7799942 va a ser la primera de una serie me parece que se trata de una historieta que va a generar una o varias versiones a lo largo de la historia y mi pel cula va ser una de tantas porque hay tantos caminos posibles para llevar esta historia al cine como personas que se decidan a filmarla
7799943 seit teva pharmaceuticals den konkurrenten barr pharmaceuticals schlucken will gibt es immer wieder spekulationen dass auch ein interesse an stada besteht

7799950 i would think that both of them have gotten to the point where we feel confident we can win with both of them
7799951 ive got four tailbacks there we may start two at one time
7799952 i know its important who takes the first snap to a lot of people but for us its more important to play the guys we feel we can win with
7799953 this is all new now but i feel a lot more comfortable now than i did last year
7799954 weve been putting the offense in and i cant wait to finally put it on the field and see what we can do
7799955 theres five or six on offense weve got eight nine maybe 10 true freshmen that will play for the first time this weekend thats why im a little nervous but im also excited for them
7799956 we kind of deal with a spread offense every day
7799957 its an advantage practicing against the spread we feel well be ready for an up tempo pace
7799958 theyre solid theres really no weak spots and theyre a veteran team
7799959 its not like were opening up against somebody we can mess around and play awful and win
7799960 time warner cable and the big ten network announced that they have reached an agreement in principle on terms of carriage for the big ten network and its high definition and video on demand programming on time warner cables lineups throughout the big ten territory including ohio and wisconsin
7799961 the pending agreement will ensure that time warner cables customers across these big ten states will have access to this saturdays big ten college football season openers and all future big ten network programming on an expanded basic level of service
7799962 we worked hard to ensure an agreement that was in the best interest of our customers and we believe its a fair deal
7799963 it will take effect in time for everyone to catch the big ten action saturday
7799964 i think time warner was doing the best it could for those who wanted the big ten network
7799965 the biggest difference from last year to this year is just very simply you can see the confidence he has
7799966 todds the leader his confidence running the offense is obvious and you can see the rest of the offense feeding off of that
7799967 todd boeckman has great command of what were trying to do
7799968 he has a thorough understanding of what were doing he can sit there and talk with joe bauserman and terrelle pryor about this and that
7799969 it is great to have that kind of comfort zone at the quarterback position you always love going into a season with a veteran quarterback
7799970 then as the recruiting unfolded and brady went to notre dame we kind of were unsure whether we wanted to bring in a quarterback with that class
7799971 so we started talking to him about gray shirting not enrolling full time in fall 2003 so he could still take five years to play four seasons and he didnt blink because he wanted to play at ohio state and he had every bit of confidence he could
7799972 what i remember about him is he had a tunnel vision about what he wanted to accomplish and not much hoopla
7799973 he was never one to moan or groan but he was going to do what he wanted to do
7799974 i always wanted to be the quarterback i knew i could throw it around a little bit when i was younger
7799975 then just watching bobby hoying joe germaine steve bellisari i always wanted to be in that situation and ive been fortunate enough to get to be here
7799976 he has overcome a lot of things to get to this point
7799977 going through a year as a starter and being able to deal with the press the weekly grind the game day and so forth i can just see a much more relaxed person he has realized the leadership role he needs to play
7799978 he always says the best player is going to play
7799979 with me being comfortable with the system knowing how to handle myself and knowing where all the guys are going to be and should be out there on the field that helps out even more
7799980 he is going to lay it on the line for ohio state he did it as an 18 year old and hes doing it now as a 35 year old or whatever it is

7799984 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7799985 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7799986 inconsistent with unanimously approved united nations security resolutions that russia has consistently voted for in the past
7799987 the vice president will be delivering the word of americas support and also consulting on how these leaders in the region see the future playing out
7799988 we dont see or feel advantages from the membership if they exist at all but we are carrying the burden
7799989 with heavy heart and sorrow we have decided to quit the ppp led coalition
7799990 under the agreement the judges should have been restored on august 19
7799991 there was a need of patience and tolerance we wish he should not break the coalition
7799992 my party joined the coalition with full sincerity and commitment to steer pakistan towards full restoration of democracy independence of judiciary and constitutional governance
7799993 but unfortunately all promises made with us were not honoured
7799994 we therefore feel that these repeated defaults and violations have forced us to withdraw our support to the coalition government and sit in the opposition benches
7799995 the war against terrorism is elsewhere and thats where the war should go
7799996 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids
