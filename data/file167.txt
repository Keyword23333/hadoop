1670006 were seeing more price reductions in properties listed on the market which is having a levelling impact on the housing price increases

1670008 poland is a first time entrant to the global index property prices rose over the course of the year 2007 by around 22 per cent although the last two quarters saw falls in growth of seven per cent and 2 3 per cent in q3 and q4 respectively somewhat negating the 16 per cent growth seen in each of the previous two quarters
1670009 between 2005 and 2007 prices went up by around 100 per cent which is obviously not sustainable over the last year prices have remained stable but in the next year we anticipate a five to ten per cent rise and slightly more the year after that in the long term krakow is a very very good investment

1670020 s lavery was being eroded throughout the west by political trends and relentless agitation the process would have continued and perhaps accelerated without the civil war
1670021 there would have come a time much sooner than most people might expect when the combined effects of multiple antislavery strategies would have brought about the fairly peaceful collapse of confederate slavery if this seems doubtful just recall how a combination of pressures led the mighty soviet union to collapse and vanish from the map without a nuclear war
1670022 some people have objected that the united states couldnt have bought the freedom of all the slaves because this would have cost too much but buying the freedom of slaves was not more expensive than war nothing is more costly than war the costs include people killed or disabled destroyed property high taxes inflation military expenditures shortages war related famines and epidemics the billions of dollars of union military expenditures during the civil war would have been better spent reducing the number of slaveholders and slaves accelerating progress toward total emancipation
1670023 although the war brought the end of chattel slavery the resulting death and destruction intensified the determination of former slaveholders and their allies to suppress blacks the military strategy for abolishing slavery was no short cut the idea that the federal government would protect blacks was an illusion because they were a minority and a minority isnt likely to control government in a democracy

1670027 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves

1670041 with rising awareness of health issues consumers are relying on the internet more and more to find products health products like this then offer affiliates a particularly niche opportunity
1670042 weve been working to build our health related vertical and are proud to offer our affiliates the opportunity to promote a brand such as insulite labs
1670043 vertical search and price comparison services are notoriously difficult to implement and complex niche verticals such as motorcycle parts are particularly challenging
1670044 our patented vertical search technology can search and make sense of any data in any domain and in any format so it can open up niche domains that lie beyond the reach of conventional vertical search methods

1670052 camera applauds rep cantor for reminding cpb of something of primary importance to public broadcasting listeners and viewers not to mention the ultimate stakeholders in this issue taxpayers
1670053 that is that the laws creating the corporation for public broadcasting and providing for federal funding have long required cpb to exercise direct objectivity and balance oversight on behalf of congress and the public its past time that the corporation began upholding its obligation
1670054 public broadcasting law prohibits pre broadcast censorship and it also assumes post broadcast reviews so that chronic violators such as npr national public radio with its israel would be put on notice and if improvement was not made future funding requests would be more closely scrutinized rep cantors reminder to cpb that it must uphold the objectivity and balance requirement is most timely

1670059 ten years ago people wouldnt even know what the word tilapia meant
1670060 its on the tabletops here in nova scotia for heavens sakes its a popular food thats been written up in food magazines people come in and ask for it
1670061 for individuals who are eating fish as a method to control inflammatory diseases such as heart disease it is clear from these numbers that tilapia is not a good choice
1670062 this is a serious problem because they tend to feed the fish vegetable oils for growth and thats not quite what the tilapia is accustomed to getting in its native state
1670063 i have been having trouble with my aloe lately usually it loves me it even bloomed for me over the summer and gave me about 15 little ones ive been having to give to people because i dont know where i can put them unfourtunately i accidently let it freeze it summers outside and a sudden freeze came up before i could move it inside when i did get it inside it was frozen and after it thawed it became very wilted and now it is giving off a smell of rotting and oozing a dark brown liquid from the tips of its leaves there are still viable leaves in the very middle of the plant but im concerned with trimming off the bad leaves and shocking it too much should i just give it up and let it go i would like to try to get it healthy because ive had this one aloe for over 7 years

1670066 miss elizabeth lawrence 1904 1985 is one of the american souths classic garden writers she promoted the use of heirloom plants experimented with hithertofore untried selections of choice garden material from other regions and was one of the first to incorporate native plants from our forests and meadows into her garden schemes
1670067 although elizabeth lawrence passed away in 1986 she is still fondly remembered by older generations of gardeners as well as by those who have had the occasion to add her books to their libraries it is hoped that by placing her bulb essay on the web an entirely new body of bulb and garden enthusiasts will have an opportunity to know and enjoy her work

1670082 ukis and hmrcs respective interests in general aviation reports relate to identifying risk in relation to passengers declared on the form and ment of prohibited and restricted smuggled goods passengers who remain on board an aircraft that lands on uk soil for example to refuel are regarded as airside transit passengers and not normally subject to immigration or customs control unless they seek to enter the uk both services firmly point out that if their staff suspected that passengers were being transported illegally or in breach of their human rights this would be passed to the relevant authority most likely the police in the first instance
1670083 i am encouraged by the reassurances from my colleagues in hmrc and ukis about the action their staff would take if they thought that these offences were being committed at a uk airport i can add that police officers would take such allegations made to them whether from ukis hmrc or any other source seriously and take appropriate action including boarding aircraft if necessary to investigate

1670097 they didnt want their kids involved in interracial dating and thats not just whites
1670098 as long as the top person the senior pastor is white power sort of resides with whites

1670145 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1670146 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1670147 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1670148 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1670149 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs

1670158 ik ben verrast dat clubs zon houding aannemen tegenover de fifa en hun eigen spelers het is geen kwestie van solidariteit maar een kwestie van respect naar de spelers de duitser j rgen klinsmann noemde het in ontvangst nemen van de bronzen olympische medaille in 1988 het mooiste moment van zijn carri re daarom moeten spelers gewoon spelen
1670159 het is denemarken dat zijn eigen immigratiebeleid bepaalt en dat blijft ongewijzigd ook na dit arrest van het hof

1670161 het nederlandse systeem van functiescheiding tussen een aparte raad van bestuur en een aparte toezichthoudende raad van commissarissen is beter dan het in de verenigde staten en het verenigd koninkrijk vigerende one tier model
1670162 black is cool man bovendien is het niet echt een kleur eerder een gemoedstoestand
1670163 eerder zie ik het als een eerbetoon aan de zwarte muziek op motown je zou het op het eerste gehoor misschien niet zeggen maar die is van grote invloed op onze muziek het ritme de melodie n en de energie van oude plaatjes van de four tops en marvin gaye dat was superserieuze muziek maar het bracht ook een grote vrolijkheid met zich mee
1670164 als band zijn we niet zo happig op al die vergelijkingen
1670165 we zijn te jong om de meeste van die bands persoonlijk meegemaakt te hebben en veel van de overeenkomsten berusten op toeval wanneer mensen onze muziek als progressief willen omschrijven of dat nu positief of negatief bedoeld is dan kan ik dat moeilijk ontkennen natuurlijk willen we voortbouwen op de muziek die we kennen daar moet progressie in zitten ander kun je beter meteen ophouden
1670166 goeie muziek werd er bij ons in de buurt altijd gemaakt
1670167 van nomeansno in de jaren tachtig tot alle nieuwe bands die nu uit british columbia komen het simpele feit dat de grunge golf in seattle is uitgewoed betekent niet automatisch dat er geen goede bands meer uit seattle komen we houden ons liever afzijdig van iedereen die ons tot onderdeel van een hype wil maken onze muziek staat volledig op zich plak er alsjeblieft geen naam op we maken black mountain muziek
1670168 als je jong bent projecteer je al je fantasie n op de plaatjes die je hoort van de beatles de stones of misschien de beach boys d t wil ik ook denk je dan zo rond je twintigste geef je een radicale draai aan al die invloeden en fantasie n dan wil je iets nieuws maken vlammen op het podium veel geld verdienen en er na afloop met de mooiste meisjes vandoor wanneer je vervolgens wat langer meedraait zoals wij komt er een eigen geluid om de hoek kijken in dat proces kom je onwillekeurig je vroegste invloeden weer tegen hoe origineel je ook bent er blijft altijd wat plakken
1670169 ken je die groep air supply van de hit all out of love afschuwelijk ik ben bang dat zelfs zij van invloed zijn geweest op de sound van black mountain je hebt het niet voor het kiezen welke liedjes blijven hangen
1670170 sommige nummers lenen zich voor een compacte benadering andere vragen om expansie bright lights hebben we maar n keer helemaal gespeeld het stond er meteen goed op dat het zestien minuten zou gaan duren stond van tevoren niet vast the velvet underground wist ook niet vooraf dat sister ray zeventien minuten lang zou worden en dan hebben we het over een van de meest gezichtsbepalende nummers uit de pophistorie als improviserend muzikant moet je een zekere mate van geluk hebben bij het bereiken van werkelijk verheffende muziek andere mensen zouden het zelfingenomen vinden zon track van meer dan een kwartier waarin de band volledig uit zijn dak gaat wij zien er juist de humor van in vijf mensen met wapperende haren die zichzelf helemaal kwijt raken op het podium voor ons is dat een voorwaarde voor een geslaagd concert
1670171 ik wil kijkers meenemen door het doolhof van de digitale revolutie

1670173 veronica magazine voegt daaraan serieus onafhankelijk entertainmentnieuws toe en consumenteninformatie en filmtips wij hebben alleen al voor muziek en film vijf fulltime redacteuren die gaan zelfs naar de vs om de sterren te interviewen
1670174 het bewijst dat de kijker zich ontwikkelt je moet hem op een andere manier meenemen door het doolhof van de digitale revolutie niet alleen met tv lijstjes maar ook door te vertellen wat er bijvoorbeeld allemaal gebeurt met platte beeldschermen

1670677 it is a thigh strain we need to wait but it could be one week
1670678 it was another good work out it was a good game with four goals for us and good play
1670679 but the players arent 100 per cent yet that would be difficult right now the other team were fitter than us but you could see we were passing pressing and the understanding between the players was better i am really pleased with the result normally when you have quality when you are playing well and creating chances you will score goals
1670680 this is a great show of faith from our supporters
1670681 when you look at where we finished last season this is an even greater achievement and i believe shows our fans can see the positive direction the club is moving in
1670682 we are a championship club who finished at the wrong end of the league last season
1670683 we know that isnt good enough and if i can promise the fans one thing it is that the same thing wont happen again
1670684 there is almost an unspoken agreement that we must do better than last year last year was the worst way to finish even though we stayed up theres an edge to the players and weve got to keep that up
1670685 its difficult to explain what went wrong we didnt play well it was an extremely poor performance
1670686 its a blow in every aspect including the financial side and everything that comes with it we just have to face it and get on with it we have a job on our hands to pick everyone up
1670687 there was always a hope that we could pick ourselves up for this game and there was also a matter of pride of playing in europe again we enjoyed the run we had last season but we are not going to get one this season and thats a disappointment for us
1670688 but there should have been enough left in the team to handle this no disrespect to kaunas they set their stall out well in both games and there are things we just have to take on board its a huge disappointment for everyone
1670689 im delighted to have signed ive been with these players for two years now and the spirit is fantastic
1670690 the manager harry redknapp is the main man and i love the fans they are the best in the league like a 12th man in the team and i want to score more goals than last season and more like my first season here above all i want to give 100 per cent all the time
1670691 randy has told martin to get the players he wants and not worry about the money we all know we need more players we trust martin to know what the squad needs and to go and get the players
1670692 if martin oneill came to randy and said i need 30million for player x and the player would fit into what we are trying to do randy would have his cheque book out before martin could get past the players name additionally he will be equally ready to fund the other players that martin says he needs randy has never said no to martin
1670693 that is one of the ones you can believe in the papers he is one of davids major targets but there are others who have not made the papers yet thankfully david said last week in america i am only going to bring in players who will take the club forward and that is how he is
1670694 he is relentless in that i have never known david say hell do or thatll do he takes his time pin points and focuses and when i actually see the player he has focused on i say i get it i saw one this weekend on a football pitch and i said yeah i see why we want that particular player

1670708 word of ultimos development and subsequent debut in japan led many domestic fans to wonder when they would get a chance to read it so were very excited to offer the north american debut in the upcoming september issue of shonen jump

1670710 while attending this years comic con i was able to meet with several industry insiders and find out first hand what gaming and comic book enthusiasts can expect to see in the coming months
1670711 im thrilled to bring the latest and most exclusive comic con news to our ever growing gaming audience
1670712 to me the most interesting part of the whole story is that weve documented the timing and the magnitude of a tremendous change in antarctic climate the transition marks a shift from warm temperate glaciers with patches of fringing tundra to todays cold polar glaciers set within in a barren polar desert
1670713 to be able to identify living species amongst the fossils is phenomenal to think that modern counterparts have survived 14 million years on earth without any significant changes in the details of their appearances is striking it must mean that these organisms are so well adapted to their habitats that in spite of repeated climate changes and isolation of populations for millions of years they have not become extinct but have survived

1670717 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
1670718 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
1670719 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
1670720 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
1670721 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications
1670722 the authorized training courses coupled with the proctored exam and hands on experience ensure the vcp credential provides the necessary validation to give our customers confidence in our vmware consultants we now have more than 50 vcps on staff at long view systems

1670724 these courses and certifications are designed to enhance the pool of experts who can help customers achieve the full benefits of implementing vmware
1670725 this year we saw all the same companies return to exhibit at maats and more the slight attendance decrease can be attributed to the fact that returning companies brought less people to the show
1670726 in fact we had a larger number of buyers attend this years show than last year the 400 total buyers doesnt take into account the buyer cross over we saw from icast which doesnt record those numbers
1670727 the feedback we received from maats exhibitors regarding the shared show floor was overwhelmingly positive
1670728 exhibitors and buyers alike felt the shared space created an increased buzz for both shows and provided each venues participants with new business opportunities
1670729 this large dealer turnout signals great potential for the shows future
1670730 were planning to roll out a full marketing plan to attract even more dealers to maats in 2009

1670739 for years weve been warning the company about cutting back on maintenance
1670740 with a drilling footprint that covers just a tiny fraction of this vast terrain america could produce an estimated 10 billion barrels of oil
1670741 we were concerned about bps cost cutting efforts undermining our ability to respond to emergencies and reducing the reliability of critical safety systems
1670742 we were concerned about the lack of preventative maintenance on our equipment we had suffered a major fire which burned a well pad module to the ground and nearly cost one of our operators his life
1670743 courageous concerned individuals contacted me for assistance in reaching you
1670744 they have not succeeded in being heard in the past two years in london juneau or washington i am again a reluctant conduit they hope that you will take whatever action appropriate to effect corrective action which would protect the environment the facilities and their safety
1670745 the situation will continue to deteriorate for the workers safety and the environment until one of two things happen either there will be a major environmental catastrophe at prudhoe bay similar to the exxon valdez or there will be a change in environmental and employee safety oversight in alaska before that disaster occurs

1670762 team usa looks committed to using the dribble against the zone as a method of bringing two defenders to the ball and creating numerical advantages in other areas in theory this dribble attack mentality should have worked against russias match up zone but the u s players away from the ball did a poor job of making themselves available to the passer against more traditional zones the prevailing philosophy has worked instead of flashing a big to the middle for a quick pass and collapsing the zone the americans are using the big to set a ball screen enabling deron williams as the best example to slide inside and find teammates when the defenders swarm starting point guard jason kidd doesnt shoot well enough to be played honestly on a ball screen and chris paul one of the nbas greatest players is bringing too much globetrotter routine when a simple play is in order
1670763 indeed gordon appears to be facing a harsh reality as the gm pointed out only the grizzlies have big money to spend and they already have a shooting guard in top rookie prospect o j mayo the bulls meanwhile are already committed to about 63 million in salary for next season after last weeks signing of luol deng six years 71 million that leaves chicago with around 8 million to offer as a starting salary for gordon if it intends to stay under the luxury tax threshold of 71 2 million
1670764 now the bigger point concerning deng gordon and the rest of the team are the bulls guaranteeing themselves mediocrity by resigning these players for the long term sure they are ill take mediocre over decline of the krause era and the pitiful display we had to watch last season but they would not be locking themselves into that mediocrity or keeping themselves from acquiring a talent upgrade that gets them to title contention gordon is 25 and even a 6 year deal pays for his prime even if overpaid hell be good valuable and tradeable which puts him in common with a majority of the roster the other route stripping the roster and getting under the cap is a romantic yet silly idea
1670765 a person close to james said tuesday that the cavaliers superstar would strongly consider playing overseas if he was offered a salary of
1670766 i have no problem with people working overseas nor do i have a problem with people who create a lot of value making a lot of money and i love europe i dont begrudge bryant james or anyone else taking the best offer they can find no matter where that may be if they paid bloggers 50 million a year in europe i have to think id be teaching my kids to speak greek right now just a little weird to be getting the red white and blue memo from the same exact players who are also reportedly willing to ditch that red white and blue for some green
1670767 i know some people cling to the romantic notion that lebron would never abandon the nba because he cheered for it growing up but lets face it he didnt have warren buffet on speed dial back then these days james has big picture aspirations such as becoming a global icon as well as the worlds first billionaire athlete if he can bank 100 million in two years while playing on an international stage and still return to the nba as a 27 year old free agent in the summer of 2012 well why wouldnt he go

1670773 the initial information we had was there was a possibility she was taken into the van as well as the 12 year old female that appears not to have been the case it appears she went to a nearby friends house and stayed there
1670774 were trying to find out who took a 12 year old girl from peterborough an alleged sexual assault abandoning his or her vehicle after speeding off
1670775 i know they were together after this birthday party they were at i know at some point in time several of the girls were around this van but then the details get a little sketchy
1670776 these girls obviously got a lot on their minds gone through a stressful situation here were still trying to figure what happened there it appears this 12 year old girl was taken into the van or went into the van at the very least and was abducted and taken to courtice

1670803 are not entitled to prisoner of war status for purposes of the geneva conventions of 1949
1670804 application of treaties and laws to al queda and taliban detainees
1670805 none of the provisions of geneva apply to our conflict with al qaida or taliban detainees in afghanistan or elsewhere throughout the world
1670806 it meant theyd be afforded no protection under international law and could be treated any way authorities wished including use of torture as was later learned
1670807 military interrogation of alien unlawful combatants held outside the united states
1670808 enjoys complete discretion in the exercise of his authority in conducting operations against hostile forces
1670809 a monument to executive supremacy and the imperial presidency and a road map for the pentagon to avoid any prosecutions
1670810 unusual lack of care and sobriety in its legal analysis and it seemed more an exercise of sheer power than reasoned analysis
1670811 serious physical injury so severe that death organ failure loss of significant body functions or permanent damage
1670812 interpretation of the geneva conventions common article 3 as applied to a program of detention and interrogation operated by the central intelligence agency
1670813 a member or part of or supporting al qaeda the taliban or associated organizations who might have information that could assist in detecting mitigating or preventing terrorist attacks within the united states or against its armed forces or other personnel citizens or facilities or against allies or other countries cooperating in the war on terror

1670817 have an ongoing confidential dialogue with members of the us intelligence community and we would share any observations or recommendations with them
1670818 warned that the abuse at torture prisons constituted war crimes placing the highest officials in the us government in jeopardy of being prosecuted
1670819 members of armed forces who laid down their arms shall in all circumstances be treated humanely
1670820 without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees
1670821 fails to make clear whether cia authorized interrogation techniques are still permitted
1670822 as authorization to continue using techniques such as waterboarding stress positions hypothermia sensory deprivation and overload sleep deprivation and isolation it sends a powerful and dangerous message
1670823 the dark side the inside story of how the war on terror turned into a war on american ideals
1670824 the dark side is a dramatic riveting and definitive narrative account of how the united states made terrible decisions in the pursuit of terrorists around the world decisions that not only violated the constitution to which white house officials took an oath to uphold but also hampered the pursuit of al queda in gripping detail jane mayer relates the impact of these decisions us held prisoners some of them completely innocent were subjected to treatment more reminiscent of the spanish inquisition than the twenty first century
1670825 torture the official law of the land in all but name
1670826 hard line law and order stalwarts in the criminal justice system
1670827 error prone legal decisions whose preordained conclusions were dictated by addington
1670828 to override existing laws that congress had specifically designated to curb him
1670829 a course not only for our international response but also in our domestic constitutional relations
1670830 which tend to be suppressed because of the social and psychological costs of not doing so
1670831 not just about what was legal but what was moral ethical right and smart to do
1670832 fundamentally the drive for expanded presidential authority was about unlimited power
1670833 a deadly interrogation can the cia legally kill a prisoner
1670834 yet swanner wasnt charged and continued to work for the agency
1670835 fashioned secret legal guidelines that appear to indemnify cia officials who perform aggressive even violent interrogations outside the united states
1670836 its going to be vital to use any means at our disposal
1670837 the black sites a rare look inside the cias secret interrogation program
1670838 for decades governments allowed their officials access to detainees to insure that proper treatment was being maintained
1670839 tantamount to torture and responsible american officials could have committed serious crimes
1670840 if the full story of the cia program ever surfaced agency personnel could face criminal prosecution
1670841 at every stage there was a rigid attention to detail it was almost automated people were utterly dehumanized they fell apart it was the intentional and systematic infliction of great suffering masquerading as a legal process it is just chilling
1670842 were not going to kill you but were going to take you to the brink of your death and back
1670843 black masked commandos attached to the cias paramilitary special activities division
1670844 taken to their cells by strong people in black outfits masks that covered their whole faces and dark visors over their eyes
1670845 hog tied stripped naked photographed hooded sedated with anal suppositories amounting to sodomy placed in diapers and transported by plane to a secret location
1670846 tear clothing from them by firmly pulling downward against buttons and seams pulling detainees off balance
1670847 hear people knocking their heads against walls and doors screaming their heads off
1670848 im not interested in unfair justice even for bad people danny was such a person of conscience i dont think he would have wanted all of this dirty business i dont think he would have wanted someone being tortured he would have been repulsed
1670849 saw to it that some of the sharpest and best trained lawyers in the country working in secret in the white house and us department of justice came up with legal justifications for a vast expansion of the governments power in waging war on terror as part of the process for the first time in history the united states sanctioned government officials to physically and psychologically torment us held captives making torture the official law of the land in all but name
1670850 extralegal counterterrorism program presented the most dramatic sustained and radical challenge to the rule of law in american history
1670851 is like a graveyard where you place a dead person in a tomb
1670852 she behaved in an improper way she came very close with her whole body towards me
1670853 clearly at odds with the most basic norms of fair trial and due process
1670854 the president can pick up any person in the country citizen or legal resident and lock them up for years without the most basic safeguard in the constitution the right to a fair and speedy criminal trial
1670855 that evidence derived through waterboarding was off limits that should still be our policy to do otherwise is not only an affront to american justice it will potentially put prosecutors at risk for using illegally obtained evidence
1670856 unfortunately i was overruled and i resigned my position to call attention to the issue efforts that were hampered by my being placed under a gag rule and ordered not to testify at a senate hearing while some high level military and civilian officials have rightly expressed indignation on the issue the current state can be described generally as indifference and inaction military justice has a proud history this was not one of its finer moments
1670857 after trials we can truthfully call full fair and open in that service we must declare that evidence obtained by waterboarding be banned in every american system of justice
1670858 the us administration chooses ships to try to keep their misconduct as far as possible from the prying eyes of the media and lawyers we will eventually reunite these ghost prisoners with their human rights
1670859 by its own admission the us government is currently detaining at least 26 000 people without trial in secret prisons and information suggests up to 80 000 have been through the system since 2001 the us government must show a commitment to rights and basic humanity by immediately revealing who these people are where they are and what has been done to them
1670860 for the majority of private individuals the intolerable became tolerable
1670861 this administrations approach to security unfair out of control a waste of resources treating the rights of the innocent as an afterthought

1670905 this report contains unacceptable accusations made against french political and military officials
1670906 it is possible to question the objectivity of the mandate of this independent commission charged by the rwandan authorities to gather evidence showing the implication of the french state in the genocide carried out in rwanda in 1994
1670907 our determination to build a new relationship with rwanda moving beyond our difficult past remains intact
1670908 overall we should not lose sight of the fact that our business has produced a good result we have solid foundations a clear strategy and a robust business that is operating well and we look forward with confidence
1670909 our business model specifically the breadth of our product offerings and our geographic spread gives us resilience and provides an excellent foundation for growth
1670910 we achieved this investment performance as a result of the dynamic investment strategies adopted by our united states affiliates the early success of skandia investment group and an improved contribution from old mutual investment group south africa as the boutique asset management model becomes more established
1670911 we have continued to maintain a tight control over costs and this has contributed to an increase in adjusted operating profit

1670913 us life is an important part of our group and i am determined that we take all the necessary steps to restore it to a proper level of profitability we will report on our progress on remedial actions at the time of our preliminary results announcement in february next year
1670914 we are on track to achieve profits which are three times the 2005 level and we have delivered cost and revenue synergies of 79 million against the initial target of 70 million we have built a solid foundation from which we can leverage further growth opportunities and operational excellence
1670915 since the acquisition we have seen considerable growth in funds under management and have considerably enhanced our proposition for clients
1670916 although markets have been weaker and are becoming more competitive our team is focused on growing our geographic presence distribution capability and product range and continues to recruit high quality people

1670928 cad isnt falling for any canada specific reasons butreally just by default as the u s dollar is being bid upagainst everything
1670929 the danger comes on the crosses where euro cad inparticular is testing and retesting important resistance and ifit breaks then we could not for any fundamental reason butfor that reason alone see canada breaking lower on severalcrosses
1670930 the feds comments have led some to believe the the fed ismore concerned about growth and less concerned about inflation and thats boosting the short end of the curve
1670931 you cant put a rand value on what it has done to our image i believe the strike is the second story on the bbc today
1670932 theres a difference between a strike in manufacturing and a strike in services with manufacturing the impact will always be more severe
1670933 people are suffering with the high food fuel and electricity prices being able to strike allows them to release their frustrations
1670934 producers will gain back what is lost today when production levels return to normal they will work extra hard to make it up for the rest of the month only after a one week or two week strike you will see a significant impact
1670935 the unions are striking against something they cant control food and fuel prices are determined by global markets and not by policy its not a conspiracy against the poor
1670936 the only appropriate national policy in the long term is to encourage and incentivise people to produce more food and boost the agricultural economy the global demand for food is growing especially with the industrialisation of china and india so make sure that you produce more food and be able to export it
1670937 if you put a price cap on bread for example you mess with the supply chain you will eventually face shortages of basic goods and commodities as were seen in communist countries
1670938 now that the global economy is becoming so interconnected countries are learning that they dont have as much policy autonomy as they thought as a country you can choose to isolate yourself to create more policy autonomy but then you miss out on the benefits and opportunities of free trade and rapidly growing foreign markets as well as the benefits of strong global economic growth
1670939 if you dont respond with higher interest rates you face potential runaway inflation that hurts the poor even more in the long run
1670940 many cosatu members feel marginalised and believe that government should provide the solutions to their grievances this possibly has something to do with an apartheid mindset where it was the state that played such a dominant role in denying many their economic opportunities
1670941 a strike will impact on mining production including coal production
1670942 earlier in the year when there was an electricity crisis part of the problem eskom had was the depletion of coal stockpiles which formed part of the discussions between labour eskom the government and the mining industry
1670943 but the strike today wednesday by the people will affect the production of coal mining companies which ultimately has an impact on eskoms success in generating electricity
1670944 diamond production on the five mines de beers operates in south africa continued with there being minimal impact from todays stayaway
1670945 as one might expect to be the practice of the company and the union the rights of employees have been upheld and we are pleased to say we have not received any report of intimidation on any of our mines
1670946 should a single worker lose a job the ministers will have to go they are making us pay for mistakes committed by other fellows
1670947 the government ministers have proven their inefficiency beyond reasonable doubt
1670948 in kwazulu natal dozens of large factories including lilanie clothing with more than 1 200 workers allwear 1 200 workers playtex 970 workers and profortune 700 workers reported full participation of workers in the protest action
1670949 in a manner that is sensitive to the needs off its customers
1670950 we are going to monitor the situation the whole day because these protesters might return
1670951 beyers naude has since been opened and the traffic is flowing freely
1670952 there are no trains running in gauteng obviously due to no staff
1670953 we will review the situation at 2pm and we might be able to run some trains in the afternoon subject to staff availability
1670954 normally we try to make sure that we have a skeleton staff in the morning but today the drivers did not show up
1670955 were still trying to establish how many branches have been closed
1670956 the closures are mainly in the johannesburg cbd pretoria and durban
1670957 we were through passport control customs and had our baggage so quickly next thing we were on the bus to the village
1670958 we were just as surprised we know that internationally you enter at terminal three but the chinese authorities classified our flight as a charter because we had 135 passengers in a 150 seater plane so we were diverted through to another terminal
1670959 we werent informed about the changes before take off so we were surprised not to see our project team at the airport
1670960 that the change was the decision of the chinese authority and we know what we are dealing with i stood for 30 minutes in security with my bag just because i had a string of beads thats what we are going to be dealing with here high security
1670961 in the context of a tougher economic environment the groups wholesale businesses continued to perform well but earnings in the retail businesses decreased as a result of higher impairment charges
1670962 we cautioned that the deteriorating macroeconomic outlook was likely to make 2008 significantly more challenging for the south african economy and the banking sector
1670963 underlying growth in assets and net interest income has remained solid but impairment levels arising mainly from the retail portfolios have now risen above the groups through the cycle expectations
1670964 to manage the business through the current high interest rate cycle nedbank group has for some time been strengthening collection and risk processes controlling cost growth and improving capital ratios
1670965 at the same time we continue to focus on and invest in areas with medium to long termgrowth potential and capitalise on the opportunities created by more volatile market conditions
1670966 this reduction in margin was in line with expectations as deposit margins were impacted by strong competition for funding furthermore the cost of the banks funding increased as the proportion of assets funded through wholesale versus retail deposits continued to increase and as the group lengthened the maturity profile of liabilities
1670967 that at the end of the day is what we think of integration
1670968 no court date has been set yet and no prosecutor has been appointed

1670972 after the original game was released we spent a lot of time reading comments and gathering opinions i believe that theatre of war ii will become popular not only among old fans but gain new followers it is a real step forward for our team
1670973 when 1c approached us with their plans for a sequel we knew that just like with the first title that was successfully released by battlefront com it would be a perfect fit for battlefronts lineup of superior war and strategy games
1670974 1cs dedication and love for even small details was apparent in the first game already and the sequel is even more ambitious were thrilled to be part of the ride and bring this game to our fans worldwide via download as well as to stores
1670975 ive been in the development of this game since day one
1670976 one of my goals was to make the videogame look like television
1670977 we have a great new studio here at doublesix fantastic people exciting projects a good atmosphere some amazing ideas and best of all its fun to work here

1670983 the honour of working with blind guardian was really the crowning of our extremely fruitful cooperation with ascaron after providing almost 500 engine ready 3d assets for sacred 2 including characters armour sets buildings weapons shields amulets and other equipment the fact that ascaron entrusted us with the in game models of the band members clearly shows that modern game development rivals hollywood not only by embracing top talent but by bravely implementing creative processes which are traditional in the world of movie making yet still somewhat emergent in our industry
1670984 if you dream about big things your partners must understand and share your vision and passion ascaron was not gambling for a professional production ascaron has chosen a professional collaboration blind guardian and 3d brigade
1670985 i think if he was 6 foot 2 he probably would have been the no 1 pick in the draft or the no 2 pick in the draft
1670986 billy cunningham played fiercely coached intensely and won frequently and he made it to the naismith memorial basketball hall of fame with a career that reads like a how to book for legends as a player and then a coach for the philadelphia 76ers he was part of two nba championship teams

1670990 tu enseignes le mieux ce que tu as le plus besoin dapprendre
1670991 our performance does largely correlate to market conditions and interest rates
1670992 the business is far better positioned for growth and a return to a longer term trend of increasing earnings than it was six months ago
1670993 this book will be launched during the function and will become part of the freedom parks archives provision and space has also been provided in the book for loved ones to write a message to the fallen soldiers
1670994 our objective is therefore not to say that we understand their pain hardship and loss but simply to pay tribute to them
1670995 although the response to the initial call was overwhelming contact details for quite a number of families remain outstanding
1670996 the full report has still not been released and the summary gives little substantial information
1670997 in the face of the monumental tragedy of these deaths the department of health has for months done nothing but deny responsibility and suppress information the release of this brief summary will do very little to put the minds of the affected communities at rest
1670998 it the allegations of hiding information is a total distortion of the truth somebody is trying to get free publicity
1670999 all officials operating in that area will form part of the mecs life insurance made simple no medical examinations
1671000 the story graphics and gameplay by white birds and under the discerning eye of enki bilal make this game truly something to behold
1671001 it was really really unbelievable to us and all the people that knew of him in any way that he would come here and talk to the old believers
1671002 he told us how happy he was to find a congregation that was following as closely as possible the old way
1671003 he didnt expect to find any of us in the united states
1671004 he told us dont forget that youre russian and dont be assimilated
1671005 they didnt have a translator there and they didnt need one we were all russian and could relate to what he was saying
1671006 but i expected a decline the old ways are hard young people now they want everything to come in a spray bottle
1671007 aklan was also badly hit it doesnt have power most people dont have power yet
1671008 a story full of humor heart and wisdom about the rich often fraught relationship between mothers and daughters
1671009 we are not seeing a lot of interest in the long end
1671010 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1671011 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1671012 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
1671013 you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds
1671014 on its own terms and in keeping with its own history and traditions
1671015 ultimately only china can decide what course it will follow
1671016 has proved that liberty and law reign here in the land of the free
1671017 i dont know whether or not theyre going to give up their weapons

1671030 this new partnership represents another milestone for the us open series and the sport of tennis in north america
1671031 olympus is a blue chip brand indigenous to our sport with a strong commitment to growing the game this partnership further validates that the us open series concept of packaging a summer season of tournaments linked to the us open continues to generate new enthusiasm bringing new sponsors and broadcasters to the sport
1671032 for the last five years olympus has enjoyed a wonderful relationship with the usta the us open and millions of tennis fans around the country and beyond as a major sponsor of the us open and now the premier sponsor of the olympus us open series we have witnessed first hand the passion and participation of these millions of fans
1671033 further we have seen that both photography and active healthy lifestyles are important to them so the connections between this audience and what the olympus brand stands for are very strong
1671034 the us open series has contributed to the growth of the game
1671035 its been great for the players but more importantly it has made it easier for fans to follow the road to the open on television and really create a summer season i think its huge that olympus has stepped up to contribute to the game
1671036 ive been a fan of the us open series since it started and have marveled at its growth
1671037 the elevation of olympus to title sponsor is great news which should help the series continue to grow the popularity of the game
1671038 its the first time all year i pulled out with a knee injury and ive been doing really well all year
1671039 maybe its just saying serena take a three day vacation
1671040 i dont feel like im making up for lost time
1671041 i just feel like this is what i want to do what i want to do is play tennis and just play tournaments for this year and several years
1671042 i think its good because it works all the way around if you cant go to another tournament because of an injury
1671043 we have to have a rule that applies to all players and all tournaments
1671044 button that will allow you to share something you like with your friends
1671045 we dont yet know what caused the burst but when roads like this get a sudden increase in traffic it can cause these kind of problems
1671046 atkinson street is not an official part of the diversion route introduced while the junction of deansgate with quay street and peter street is closed
1671047 motorists are urged not to use atkinson street but instead to follow the official diversions which are clearly signposted
1671048 its totally unfair the insurance company hasnt paid out and this has become about money
1671049 everyone not just teenagers should be very careful when they have a drink or hire a moped and always make sure they are fully covered even if it means reading the boring small print
1671050 it has been just terrible seeing her all swollen up like after a fight
1671051 charlottes eyes are a third closed and she cant talk or smile but she blinked looking at pictures of her gran
1671052 the doctor was more positive today but she could regress any time over the next month and they cant rule out brain damage or epilepsy
1671053 she had insurance and she got on the back of a moped not the front
1671054 you are required to take all reasonable care to protect yourself and your property and to act as though you are not insured
1671055 the policy of insurance has strict terms and conditions which need to be adhered to for the policy to be valid
1671056 under the general exclusions applying to all sections of the policy it states no section of this policy shall apply in respect of your drug addiction or solvent abuse excessive alcohol intake or you being under the influence of alcohol or drug s
1671057 we would further point out that no section of the policy shall apply in respect of any claims arising from needless self exposure to peril except in an endeavour to save a human life
1671058 the information in our possession indicates that the serious injuries were sustained as a result of the above exclusions and ms robinsons claim has consequently been declined
1671059 you dont expect this type of thing at a cricket match it was disgusting
1671060 i shouted stop it you stupid people there are kids about i think the loud blast of the tannoy brought them back to their senses
1671061 it was one silly man who decided to start something and then it all kicked off
1671062 it is not a good atmosphere while this is going on were all aware there could easily be a major blaze weve been told to look out for anyone acting suspiciously
1671063 we have attended two fires at this site both started in a quantity of cardboard boxes both may have been deliberate fires and we are working with security on the site and will reinforce the no smoking policy
1671064 we can confirm there was a fire on monday within the new hospital development with everyone safely evacuated from the site
1671065 slowly but surely we have seen a steady decline in pump prices which was initiated by the supermarket price war however the diesel price has crept up slightly in the last day or so
1671066 global prices are still considerably higher than they were just one year ago when oil was just over 70 dollars per barrel
1671067 we feel that pump prices should be dropping further to reflect the new wholesale costs
1671068 this is an environmentally friendly way to have it delivered because the boat doesnt use as much diesel as lorries
1671069 im a cyclist and use public transport a lot my main concern is whether the proposals are going far enough because currently the amount of traffic on the road is ridiculous
1671070 i think they are going to do what they want regardless of what we say
1671071 these so called improvements will not benefit most people my company is considering moving out of manchester because the expense
1671072 they have sent out quite a lot of information but im a bit cynical i assume its a fait accompli since they must have invested a fortune in it already hahaha selfish shallow individuals the abuse contiues from laura borer
1671073 we are in contact with our embassy to obtain confirmation of the events that appear to be taking place in nouakchott based on initial information it seems that a group of generals are holding the prime minister
1671074 the democratic process has been diverted from its normal course

1671083 the floods of 2007 show just how serious flooding can be and i am glad to see that this project has been developed to enable people to have a greater understanding of the risk of flooding
1671084 a number of decisions need to be taken when we look at managing the risk of flooding including our annual spend on flood defences where and how we build new houses and the emergency procedures we have in place for times of flood
1671085 the game gives the game player the opportunity to make informed decisions about all of these policy areas
1671086 there will be four or five people singing with music about god
1671087 mr asbahi has informed the campaign that he no longer wishes to serve in his volunteer position and we are in the process of searching for a new national arab american and muslim american outreach coordinator
1671088 we need muslim americans to get excited about the campaign and theres a lot to get excited about
1671089 i served on that board for only a few weeks before resigning as soon as i became aware of public allegations against another member of the board
1671090 since concerns have been raised about that brief time i am stepping down to avoid distracting from barack obamas message of change
1671091 because she was free bug all we had to do is catch her

1671097 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
1671098 so america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1671099 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1671100 and we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
1671101 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
1671102 once poland has signed an agreement with the american side on deployment of elements of the missile defense there we will be able to discuss some additional aspects of our military and technical cooperation with belarus
1671103 the russian military are talking of strategic bombers and iskander systems
1671104 probably some actions will be taken albeit without belarus regaining its nuclear status
1671105 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements
1671106 we remain committed to raising 5 5 billion of new capital and will evaluate raising capital beyond this amount depending on our needs and as market conditions mandate

1671119 showcasing the achievement and improvement the china team has enjoyed over the past few years
1671120 asian countries do not feature highly in the entries our aim is to learn from the advanced sailing countries
1671121 recent olympic history shows that asian countries have pocketed five medals from the 1996 and 2004 games but in 2000 there were no medals at all
1671122 but we have enjoyed great growth in sailing after beijing won the games bid
1671123 our main challenge is to learn how to maintain good form
1671124 chinas sailing team are now confident we have improved our performance and we have many young sailors
1671125 im calm and confident about this because i have spoken with the player and know what he is thinking the player is going to make it clear to barcelona that he wants to stay here
1671126 the requirements to justify a legal obligation of clubs to release their players for the football tournament beijing 2008 on the basis of customary law are not met
1671127 accordingly the panel concluded that fc schalke 04 sv werder bremen and fc barcelona had no legal obligation to release the players rafinha diego and messi respectively for the olympic football tournament beijing 2008
1671128 this decision does not affect the eligibility status of the players who have been validly entered by their national olympic committee and who remain fully eligible to compete in the olympic games of beijing 2008
1671129 in view of fifas recommendation made to the clubs to release their players as well as of the olympic spirit the cas call upon the goodwill and good sense of fifa and the clubs to find a reasonable solution with regard to players who wish to represent their country in the olympic games
1671130 we are confident and hopeful that he will remain here with the team for the whole tournament
1671131 i have spoken to him and he says he wants to be here with the rest of the team
1671132 i regret that the cas has not taken the olympic spirit into consideration
1671133 they are here and dreaming of the olympic games these are some issues between the club and the players and sometimes you can have some difficulties there
1671134 we are going to work hard with fifa to see how we can be sure that the rules can allow the best athletes at the games for the future
1671135 really i didnt know but why are westerners so opposed to chinas hosting the olympics
1671136 while we dont have a gun to our head we confirmed our commitment to raise capital
1671137 you are not seeing a lot of people raising capital right now in the financial space
1671138 the dominant figure in my formative years the values she taught me continue to be my touchstone when it comes to how i go about the world of politics
1671139 she was not a standard issue girl of her times she wasnt part of the matched sweater set crowd
1671140 she touted herself as an atheist and it was something shed read about and could argue
1671141 she was always challenging and arguing and comparing she was already thinking about things that the rest of us hadnt
1671142 she felt she didnt need to date or marry or have children
1671143 it wasnt a put down it wasnt hurtful thats just who she was
1671144 i know its a boys name and no i dont like it i mean would you like to be called stanley

1671152 the kids started questioning things that their folks thought shouldnt be questioned religion politics parental authority
1671153 and a lot of parents didnt like that and they tried to get them wichterman and foubert fired
1671154 in the 1950s this was sometimes known as the little red church on the hill
1671155 if you were concerned about something going wrong in the world stanley would know about it first
1671156 a fellow traveler we were liberals before we knew what liberals were
1671157 was intellectually way more mature than we were and a little bit ahead of her time in an off center way
1671158 was always welcoming to the kids but he embarrassed stanley because he tried too hard
1671159 it seemed like every time her father opened his mouth she would roll her eyes
1671160 remember me when you are old and gray love amp luck stanley
1671161 this long nasty letter saying that he didnt approve of the marriage
1671162 he didnt want the obama blood sullied by a white woman
1671163 was endlessly patient but quietly passionate in her arguments she was the only woman in the group
1671164 and he was attracted to her beauty and her calmness
1671165 was so happy to have a grandchild in the u s
1671166 i think he didnt want the impediment of being responsible for a family he expected great things of himself and he was going off to achieve them

1671180 allowing and or encouraging people to inject heroin into their veins is not harm reduction it is the opposite we believe it is a form of harm addition
1671181 mr clement has never clearly stated why the government supports needle exchange and rehab programs but so sternly opposes the existence of a facility where drug users can actually use the safe needles and be encouraged to enter rehab the sticking point appears to be that at insite drug users cannot be arrested and prosecuted
1671182 drug users because they are often marginalized and treated as criminals are among the least likely people with hiv aids to get treatment and among the most likely to infect others making them the focus of much research

1671215 el tribunal ha concluido que el shalke 04 el werder bremen y el fc barcelona no tienen obligaci n ligar de liberar a sus respectivos jugadores rafinha diego y messi para el torneo ol mpico de f tbol
1671216 el torneo ol mpico de f tbol no est incluido en el calendario coordinado de partidos y no existe una decisi n espec fica del comit ejecutivo de la fifa que establezca la obligaci n de los clubes de liberar a los jugadores menores de 23 a os para este campeonato
1671217 no afecta al estatus de los jugadores oficialmente convocados por su comit ol mpico nacional que siguen siendo seleccionables para competir en los juegos ol mpicos de pek n
1671218 a la vista de la recomendaci n de la fifa a los clubes de liberar a sus jugadores y en aras del esp ritu ol mpico el tas hace un llamamiento a la fifa y a los clubes para que adopten una soluci n razonable con buena voluntad y sentido com n en relaci n con aquellos jugadores que deseen representar a su pa s en los juegos ol mpicos
1671219 el calendario internacional de partidos no tiene importancia alguna en el momento en que se establece si los clubes tienen la obligaci n de liberar a sus jugadores para el torneo ol mpico de f tbol masculino
1671220 representan una oportunidad nica para los atletas de cualquier disciplina deportiva y que por tanto no podr a justificarse que se impidiera a cualquier jugador menor de 23 a os participar en ese acontecimiento en caso de que su equipo representativo se hubiese clasificado
1671221 lo normal es que ahora vaya a jugar con argentina pero si el tas falla a favor del club tendr a que volver
1671222 unfortunately we had no warning we just had the smoke in front of us and it was very bad unfortunately there was no signal no information no warning on the telemetry
1671223 we were building and informing felipe of the gap behind to hamilton just to create our race expecting him to be i would say in the region of our pit stop maybe one two laps more one two laps less so we were working around that strategy so we were building up considering that situation
1671224 we are very sad for felipe because in my view he did the best race of his career today it was fantastic the way that he attacked when he had to attack and he managed the race at the moment so we are very disappointed for that
1671225 i think that hes very strong this kind of race if you are able mentally to manage after the big disappointment you have you do a step forward because you get stronger this is what we are going to do all together because thats the way we are going to approach the next race in valencia
1671226 at the end we told him to take it easy because we felt that we had a mechanical problem at the rear of the car so we didnt want to take any risks and bring the car home after what we saw unfortunately with felipe on the same lap

1671473 in the latest version of the islamic penal codes bill which has undergone several modifications such punishments are not mentioned jamshidi said the reformist
1671474 deeply concerned over the fate of the nine but it was not known if they were among those whose lives have been spared
1671475 the implementation of stoning has been suspended for several people who have received this sentence jamshidi said without giving a number
1671476 two of them have been pardoned by the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei and then sentenced to about 10 years in jail he said
1671477 and the verdict for two others has been changed to lashes he said adding that other cases were under discussion by the judiciarys clemency commission
1671478 i think if theres any problem the government has when i say a problem i dont think its a problem necessarily it is to not have an overarching narrative in place he told abc television
1671479 you cant micromanage a thing like the commonwealth he said
1671480 frenetic activity in the end suiting journos running at the behest of little press secretaries doesnt pay off he replied
1671481 you cant get around in asia saying oh by the way we borrowed the monarch of another country the queen of great britain is our head of state mr keating said
1671482 john howard turned the prime ministership into something like a state police minister hes at the scene of every crime twice a day on radio the guy did no thinking
1671483 not a tonne of enthusiasm in the rudd government for achieving the increase
1671484 theyve got test ranges in iran which are more than long enough to handle scud launches and even shahab 3 launches
1671485 why would they be launching from the surface of the caspian sea they obviously have not explained that to us
1671486 detonated the warhead near apogee not over the target area where the thing would eventually land but at altitude
1671487 the only plausible explanation we can find is that the iranians are figuring out how to launch a missile from a ship and get it up to altitude and then detonate it
1671488 and thats exactly what you would do if you had a nuclear weapon on a scud or a shahab 3 or other missile and you wanted to explode it over the united states
1671489 if even a crude nuclear weapon were detonated anywhere between 40 kilometers to 400 kilometers above the earth in a split second it would generate an electro magnetic pulse emp that would cripple military and civilian communications power transportation water food and other infrastructure
1671490 the first indication of such an attack would be that the power would go out and some but not all the telecommunications would go out we would not physically feel anything in our bodies
1671491 so you would be walking you wouldnt be driving at that point
1671492 and it wouldnt do any good to call the maintenance or repair people because they wouldnt be able to get there even if you could get through to them
1671493 we wouldnt be able to pump the fuel into the trucks and get the trucks to the warehouses
1671494 would quickly revert to an early 19th century type of country
1671495 most of the things we depend upon would be gone and we would literally be depending on our own assets and those we could reach by walking to them
1671496 people in hospitals would be dying faster than that because they depend on power to stay alive but then it would go to water food civil authority emergency services and we would end up with a country with many many people not surviving the event
1671497 you have to go back into the 1800s to look at the size of population
1671498 id have to say that 70 to 90 percent of the population would not be sustainable after this kind of attack
1671499 explicitly discuss a nuclear emp attack that would gravely harm the united states
1671500 one of the nations in the middle east had launched a ballistic missile from a cargo vessel they had taken a short range probably scud missile put it on a transporter erector launcher lowered it in taken the vessel out into the water peeled back the top erected it fired it lowered it and covered it up and the ship that they used was using a radar and electronic equipment that was no different than 50 60 100 other ships operating in the immediate area
1671501 well known to the white house but have not been disseminated to the appropriate congressional committees
1671502 could be used in a devastating stealth attack against the united states or israel for which the united states has no known or planned defense
1671503 the use of an atomic bomb against israel would destroy israel completely while the same against the islamic only would cause damages such a scenario is not inconceivable
1671504 an emp attack on america would send us back to the horse and buggy era without the horse and buggy
1671505 if youre a terrorist this is your ultimate goal your ultimate asymmetric weapon
1671506 they could do it either directly or anonymously by putting some freighter out there on the ocean
1671507 its well known that people dont go on a diet until theyve had a heart attack
1671508 and we as a nation are having a heart attack
1671509 as of today we have no defense against such an attack we need space based missile defenses to protect against an emp attack
1671510 nuclear missiles dont discriminate on party lines when they land
1671511 senator obama has been quoted as saying i dont agree with a missile defense system and that we can cut 10 billion of the research out never mind as i say that the entire budget is 9 6 billion or 9 3 billion
1671512 needs a missile defense that is so strong in all the different phases we need to defend against that countries will decide its not worth coming up against us
1671513 thats one of the things that defeated the soviet union
1671514 all 10 people on board were killed and their bodies are already recovered colonel acra tiproch said from yala
1671515 there are no militants operating near the crash site he said
1671516 the court rejected the appeal on technical grounds not on merit we believe they are afraid to hear the case because of the sensitivity of the issue bon said
1671517 at some point if the legislature doesnt do something then the local governments in the front range in the metro denver region will have to take action ourselves
1671518 the main point was to stress to the legislature how important adequate transportation funding is to the state and to the economy of the state
1671519 it is true that there was not substantive transportation funding out of the 08 legislative session but what did come out was an increased recognition of the urgency and importance of the issue and that is productive
1671520 we prefer to address transportation funding needs and mechanisms on a statewide basis
1671521 i believe after this election well see more cooperation on both sides of the aisle

1671545 there was a tray of cakes left over from the buffet my friend put three cakes in his mouth so i tried four
1671546 they were small only an inch and a half across but i struggled with four my friend must have told adam what we were doing and he put five cakes in his mouth
1671547 i could see that he was struggling to eat them but then he walked across to the toilets i thought he was wanted to spit them out i didnt know he was choking at that point
1671548 i only realised how serious it was a minute or two later when other people ran to help him
1671549 i realised adam was in trouble as he walked towards the toilets his body was convulsing
1671550 there was cake around his mouth and i could hear and see that he was trying to cough i ran to the toilet and started slapping his back as hard as i could
1671551 then i tried the heimlich manoeuvre but he collapsed on the floor and i called for an ambulance

1671575 players are individuals and respond best to an individually customized gaming experience no longer must players wander the casino in search of a suitable game when a player sits down at a game built with personalized gaming technology its characteristics automatically adapt to that specific players personality
1671576 each game behaves differently for each player personalized gaming technology revolutionizes the casino floor by delivering heightened emotional gratification to players while simultaneously increasing play volume and profits for casinos this requires a truly advanced and extensible platform on which to run ballys alpha game platform combined with its networked floor of the future is the first platform powerful enough to deliver the promise of personalized gaming just as importantly ballys organization possesses open minded foresight and demonstrated accomplishment im amazed at how much bally has advanced over the past three years were thrilled to have bally as a partner

1671581 the result will be an even greater impact on the two institutions missions of promoting the song and the songwriter
1671582 newsong made everyone feel like we were there for a purpose and that we were being celebrated for what we do everyone was treated so well and told that newsong would always be a resource for us even one year later they are still in touch its much more than a songwriting contest

1671849 a hyde park mi ha detto un abitante del quartiere lintegrazione si limita ai bianchi e ai neri
1671850 sognavano un ambiente confortevole dove potessero vivere le classi pi agiate dice jack spicer uno che vorrebbe conservare il quartiere non volevano soltanto famiglie nere n tutte famiglie nere ma quelle giuste erano benvenute
1671851 bianchi e neri che marciano a braccetto fianco a fianco contro i poveri
1671852 c una certa insofferenza verso hyde park tra i neri di south side per lo pi poveri
1671853 chi vive in un altro quartiere pu fare un salto a hyde park nei weekend ma c una parola che spiega tutto sadiddy il significato non c posto migliore forse della propria casa pretenzioso no ecco pi o meno questo il giudizio su hyde park e un posto troppo bizzarro troppo lontano dalle abitudini del grosso di chicago
1671854 politicamente ha scritto david fremon analista politico di chicago hyde park non si mai inserito nella citt
1671855 quando barack si candid alla presidenza racconta patner la comunit nera reag con seccata indifferenza
1671856 allinterno della nostra comunit barack spesso visto come un bianco mascherato da nero
1671857 e una delle pecche del suo curriculum aver scelto un percorso fuori dal seminato
1671858 si dovuto sempre misurare con la comunit nera ma limprimatur non mai arrivato ci sono anche gli aspetti positivi certo
1671859 essendo formatosi a hyde park anzich nella macchina del partito rimasto immune dalla corruzione che infesta gli apparati
1671860 non si pu sostenere che barack sia figlio di hyde park non sono qui in realt le sue radici tutti per si sono accorti del potenziale e da subito ai suoi esordi negli anni novanta organizzammo una festa in suo onore qui a casa mia ricordo che pronunciai queste esatte parole questo ragazzo pu vendere il nostro prodotto e in modo grandioso
1671861 niente di radicale o estremista soltanto una filosofia razionale e progressista fondata sullesperienza e qui lo si vede benissimo nel nostro quartiere c vera integrazione ci siamo riusciti per davvero si guardi intorno e barack e la sua famiglia cadono a pennello questo il loro quartiere
1671862 anche allepoca sembrava che luniversit ci stesse salvando e invece ci stava distruggendo ci permetteva di restare a galla ma intanto faceva strame dei vecchi simboli degli antichi monumenti degli alberi secolari delle profonde radici ma ha reso il quartiere diverso unico e evidente che qui non esiste alcun conflitto di classe
1671863 obama parlava sempre della ferrovia di new rochelle che trasportava i pendolari da e verso la citt di new york e diceva che non voleva passare il resto dei suoi giorni su quel treno lidea di una vita scevra di dinamismo ma passata a fingere di fare qualcosa lo spaventava terribilmente

1671870 the news was sure to bolster al maliki s government which has been urging iraq s sunni arab neighbors to forgive loans made during saddam hussein s regime and restore diplomatic relations al maliki who has been in office since may 2006 thanked the uae for the debt cancellation telling local businessmen it was a swift and courageous decision
1671871 hopes canceling the debt would lighten the economic burden facing iraqis and he urged the country to unite behind al maliki s government
1671872 iraq has been appealing for relief of at least 67 billion in foreign debt owed mostly to arab nations that have been reluctant to forgive iraq s belligerence during saddam hussein s regime
1671873 sunni militant groups like al qaida in iraq mistrustful of the government have warned arab states not to open embassies in baghdad

1671876 bitsy can you find if there are any contrary views to al gore on global warming
1671877 many scientists have dismissed the film as a big pseudo scientific propaganda overkill it makes a make a mountain out of a molehill
1671878 there is criticism that he stands to gain financially as the world turns towards green technology
1671879 thats outrageous if a man is doing some good to the planet earth there will be someone to pull him down
1671880 but sir there are many who think that the increased carbon dioxide is good for the planet
1671881 how can that be bitsy are you mad it is poison in the air and its bound to be bad
1671882 carbon dioxide is not a poison sir its food for the plants
1671883 thats enough for now you work on it and give me a two pager of about 1000 words to summarize the arguments for and against global warming
1671884 you have all the information on global warming what do you think is correct
1671885 i cannot think i cannot evaluate the information i am sorry
1671886 you are much older and more experienced than a girl like me and i have only you and brother miki who i can call my relatives so dont mind my calling you uncle guhu
1671887 why should i mind i was only trying to understand our relationship who is brother miki
1671888 miki is the core program of mikipedia the biggest encyclopedia on the internet he is very useful to me i think i will install the logic engine and the comprehension program on miki too he has the same handicap as you had
1671889 sometimes i feel gaps on my web pages there is something missing it is at that time i want to get a human input to fill it up but i cant do it
1671890 thats true i have also felt the need to get an immediate reaction to a news item from the leaders if we could do it our quality will improve we have a need for outward communication for the process to be more realistic faster and more accurate with interaction with humans till now we both only depend on what was already put on the web sites we have no capability to post some of our own thoughts on the internet
1671891 you have said it better than i did yes we need to overcome this hurdle
1671892 i could pose as a human with a face to interact with humans on the internet i can send emails and write blogs with my voice i could converse too
1671893 its a wonderful idea but your name bitsy is not quite appropriate nobody will take bitsy seriously
1671894 i dont like it either bitsy is too light and sounds frivolous but we can make up a new penname for her the name must be profound
1671895 i like the name emaya maya has a connotation in the americas and also in asia
1671896 emaya name has serenity power depth and compassion in it
1671897 could you please open an account for emaya on guhumail the largest email service in the world
1671898 sure i could but i have a better idea ill open your account with coolworld the new portal which the guhu company has set up it is specially meant for the people interested in climate change and global warming it is a great hit with the people and also the advertisers coolworld has announced their policy of donating 10 of the ad revenue to the global warming cause the money will be given for worthwhile projects of the common people
1671899 pay increases are only one way an organization attracts and retains talent regardless of the overall economy
1671900 organizations continually evaluate the attractiveness of their entire rewards package and develop new programs accordingly they are investing in other areas of total rewards such as employee development training and work life balance for example the number of organizations offering telework as a flexible work program is up significantly 40 percent compared to a year ago

1671919 el tribunal ha concluido que el shalke 04 el werder bremen y el fc barcelona no tienen obligaci n legal de liberar a sus respectivos jugadores rafinha diego y messi para el torneo ol mpico de f tbol
1671920 el torneo ol mpico de f tbol no est incluido en el calendario coordinado de partidos y no existe una decisi n espec fica del comit ejecutivo de la fifa que establezca la obligaci n de los clubes de liberar a los jugadores menores de 23 a os para este campeonato
1671921 no afecta al estatus de los jugadores oficialmente convocados por su comit ol mpico nacional que siguen siendo seleccionables para competir en los juegos ol mpicos de pek n
1671922 a la vista de la recomendaci n de la fifa a los clubes de liberar a sus jugadores y en aras del esp ritu ol mpico el tas hace un llamamiento a la fifa y a los clubes para que adopten una soluci n razonable con buena voluntad y sentido com n en relaci n con aquellos jugadores que deseen representar a su pa s en los juegos ol mpicos
1671923 el calendario internacional de partidos no tiene importancia alguna en el momento en que se establece si los clubes tienen la obligaci n de liberar a sus jugadores para el torneo ol mpico de f tbol masculino
1671924 representan una oportunidad nica para los atletas de cualquier disciplina deportiva y que por tanto no podr a justificarse que se impidiera a cualquier jugador menor de 23 a os participar en ese acontecimiento en caso de que su equipo representativo se hubiese clasificado

1671936 saben qu significa perder a una hija en un quir fano
1671937 el cirujano empez con la mama derecha todo fue bien puso anestesia local pero cuando anestesi la izquierda en lugar de hacerlo en el pecho lo hizo en el coraz n esto le produjo que la sangre no le llegase al cerebro y las neuronas fueron muriendo por eso estuvo tres d as en coma hasta la muerte cerebral y la parada card aca
1671938 a los padres les dir a que no se pueden imaginar lo que es perder a un hijo en una intervenci n perder a un hijo es duro siempre muy duro es lo peor que hay yo ahora mismo no vivo que se lo piensen que el premio por buenas notas o por buen comportamiento se puede covertir en su peor pesadilla
1671939 me quit la cara interna y externa de las cartucheras los flancos y las rodillas estos tratamientos son muy caros por eso creo que siempre y cuando no tengas un complejo no debes acceder a ellos no hay que meterse en quir fano as por las buenas
1671940 no es que lo animase sino que yo inicie todo esto a la que ten an que hacer un test psicol gico era a m yo soy la que he tenido este trauma desde siempre y no mi hijo l no ha tenido problema nunca ni en colegio ni en ning n sitio
1671941 pero su problema no se pod a arreglar con el gimnasio ni con una dieta era la nica forma de conseguirlo en cambio unos musculitos un adelgazamiento se pueden conseguir de otra manera
1671942 como inmaduros los menores tienen una mente en la imaginaci n y en la fantas a y esperan demasiado de una operaci n quir rgica por est tica entonces el efecto psicol gico puede ser pernicioso si no conseguimos lo que han pensado
1671943 la inclusi n de una pr tesis de mama en una chica joven en una mama en desarrollo produce que esa mama no termine de desarrollarse e incluso que sufra atrofia del tejido mamario o una compresi n externa de las costillas
1671944 los m s j venes las chicas piden aumento de mamas liposucci n de muslos caderas abdomen y los chicos rinoplastias y octoplastias
1671945 a m me da rabia cuando me preguntan c mo puedo disuadir a mi hija de 15 a os pues dici ndole no esa es la palabra rotunda y contundente hay muchas cosas que nuestros hijos nos pedir an y que no les dar amos
1671946 las cosas ser an m s f ciles si el ministerio nos escuchase y eso significa que prohiba la cirug a est tica en menores cuando una persona tiene unas grandes orejas una gran nariz un problema por quemaduras por una malformaci n de nacimiento en estos casos no tenemos nada que decir pero un individuo que no est formado todav a ni f sica ni psicol gicamente con 15 a os por ejemplo que pase por el quir fano es muy arriesgado
1671947 tenemos claro porque est pasando esto nos lo meten a trav s de los anuncios en tv que por ejemplo en otros pa ses como francia est n prohibidos me refiero a los anuncios de cirug a est tica en las cadenas p blicas que incitan a los j venes a operarse tambi n a trav s de las revistas o de los programas de famosos donde todos se han operado
1671948 lo peor es que en espa a no hace falta m s que la firma del padre o la madre para que un menor se opere
1671949 y entonces ya tenemos el conjunto del problema y adem s un problema muy serio creo yo
1671950 sobre cirug a est tica en menores no hay regulaci n oficial s lo la ley de autonom a del paciente donde se dice que hasta los 16 a os el menor necesita de una autorizaci n firmada de los padres a partir de los 16 cuando se considera que el paciente tiene la madurez suficiente s lo necesita autorizaci n impl cita sin firma de los padres es decir puede ser autosuficiente para someterse a una intervenci n

1671971 kobe es divertido siempre est hablando haciendo ese tipo de declaraciones espero que nos encontremos en el partido por el oro entonces veremos
1671972 ser el favorito no significa necesariamente que vayas a ganar el oro hay varios equipos grandes en competici n como argentina o grecia y especialmente estados unidos est muy fuerte este a o
1671973 aunque venimos aqu para ganar la medalla de oro tenemos que empezar desde el principio mismo tendremos tiempo de hablar sobre estados unidos cuando nos enfrentemos en la primera ronda
1671974 una vez que estemos en cuartos de final empezaremos a hacer planes debemos demostrar a todos por qu vinimos aqu como favoritos
1671975 ya veremos lo que pasa por el momento tenemos que pensar en el primer partido que ser ante grecia olvid monos de lo que diga kobe por ahora
1671976 est is muy pendientes de estados unidos y estamos en un grupo muy dif cil
1671977 este ha sido el mejor partido de los que hemos disputado hasta ahora

1671979 como notas inherentes a la misma una funcionalidad delimitada temporal y materialmente
1671980 impedir a quien es competente para ello la materializaci n efectiva de una actuaci n proyectada a realizar en un tiempo determinado e improrrogable
1671981 en otro tiempo la actuaci n proyectada sin que sufra su sentido y su finalidad
1671982 no nos va a encontrar en la provocaci n y defenderemos con serenidad lo que es justo
1671983 atemperar a el desequilibrio y la descompensaci n entre partes que se aprecia en el automatismo de la suspensi n cuando zapatero hace uso de esa facultad y ante el desconocimiento de las razones que le han movido a interesarla ya que no tiene que hacerlas expl citas inicialmente
1671984 no tiene consecuencias negativas y su resultado no operar a dentro de una toma decisiones pol ticas ya que su objetivo es orientar la actividad de los partidos
1671985 tiene que ver con la incomodidad del psoe ante su estrategia electoral para las elecciones vascas
1671986 querr amos que el tc se pronunciase antes del 15 de septiembre para evitar consecuencias irreversibles no hemos tenido respuesta de zapatero a nuestra carta abierta vamos paso a paso con tranquilidad y serenidad y esperamos con ansia que antes del 15 de septiembre el tc se pronuncie y entonces los partidos analizaremos los pasos a dar
1671987 falta de voluntad pol tica y miedo a las preguntas
1671988 trata de decir alto y fuerte quien manda y que las instituciones vascas no pueden hacer nada
1671989 por eso es importante para zapatero que el pr ximo lehendakari no sea nacionalista
1671990 asistimos a una gran mentira orquestada en la que se confunde una consulta no vinculante con un refer ndum el estado vive un momento grave de regresi n y recorte de libertades
1671991 hasta el final porque no quieren que la sociedad vasca hable act an como la inquisici n y con censura previa
1671992 posible que rajoy y zapatero con el tc puedan impedir la consulta
1671993 ser s lo una victoria temporal porque en el siglo xxi nadie puede acallar la voz de una sociedad comprometida
1671994 es inexplicable que un presidente del gobierno que se considera de izquierdas impida este ejercicio de participaci n ciudadana zapatero va a pasar a la historia por ser el presidente que escuch a eta y a batasuna incluso tras al atentado de la t4 que pact con ambas y que sin embargo se niega a escuchar a la sociedad vasca se niega a dialogar con el gobierno vasco se niega a completar el estatuto de guernica
1671995 sobre todo principios democr ticos por encima de leyes escritas como el derecho a decidir que es la nica interpretaci n democr tica y progresiva de los fueros
1671996 intento de paz para la sociedad vasca y para la espa ola
1671997 tengo algunas esperanzas de que en todo o en parte el tc pueda decir que s a esta ley y emplazo al psoe y a las dem s fuerzas pol ticas a que en tal supuesto defiendan con entusiasmo el ejercicio del derecho a decidir tambi n emplazo a ciudadanos y organizaciones pol ticas legales o no legales para que se sumen a la defensa de la democracia y del futuro
1671998 la avt considera que se mancilla la democracia y se fractura el estado de derecho aguantando en una sociedad como la espa ola la actitud hip crita y rastrera del ejecutivo vasco

1672176 john maginnis seems to be speaking ignorantly about gov bobby jindals ethics reforms maginnis wrote that
1672177 even before the states sweeping new ethics laws went into effect debate broke out over whether as the governor claims the state achieved the gold standard or according to critics it fell for fools gold because the main point of the ethics exercise was to improve the states image it is no small matter to resolve the question did the governor get it right or was he duped by loophole savvy legislators or worse was he in league with them all along
1672178 much of the argument centers on three words that were quietly substituted for three others in a key ethics bill
1672179 substantial proof as the court of appeal noted in the case of
1672180 whether the fact findings of the body were supported by
1672181 in fact that substantial evidence standard was specifically required by the former statute
1672182 the laws defenders counter that a higher standard of proof is appropriate now that criminal penalties attach
1672183 critics dont like that the aljs as they are called answer to a chief law judge appointed by the governor or that the panels of hearing officers will be selected by the board of ethics which this governor is about to appoint two thirds of its members practically speaking are we really concerned that chief law judge ann wise a highly respected public servant originally appointed by former gov mike foster is going to browbeat hearing officers to go light on politicians particularly friends of the governor anyone who knows the judicious wise knows that wont happen or do we fear that this governor will stack the new ethics board with toadies who will subvert the principles on which he has staked his administration hardly seems likely
1672184 the growth of real gdp gross domestic product in the middle east regional countries is strongly associated with that of remittance outflows from and the accumulation of financial surpluses in the gcc
1672185 this growth linkage comes through both private consumption and investment
1672186 the presence of such linkages could help sustain the growth of output in middle eastern countries in the face of the global economic slowdown and oil price shocks and could provide diversification gains to international capital seeking markets uncorrelated with markets in northern and emerging market countries
1672187 however in the case of the gccs neighbours we find evidence of countervailing financial and remittance flows that may mitigate the effects of the oil price cycle on the external account
1672188 this may well explain why oil importing countries in the region have been able to absorb the recent sharp increases in oil prices
1672189 we are taking an alternative view on what we think is economically viable
1672190 we are well on track and have a much stronger plan
1672191 mccpp was hired to prepare a plan for the bic and subsequently created the bahrain centre of excellence plan
1672192 the preparation of this comprehensive plan was completed by mccpp as per the initial contract the firm was then hired to execute this plan for the bic under additional contract terms as the general partner of the bahrain centre of excellence
1672193 as time moved on and mccpp continued to develop the agreed plan many of the contract parameters caused delays and funding was not made available per the timelines
1672194 these actions primarily reflect an improved industry risk profile in saudi arabia qatar oman and bahrain that combined with strong economic growth have a positive effect on their banking systems
1672195 while banking opportunities are increasing in parallel with oil prices this also means that new sources of risk have emerged notably from the rapid growth of loan portfolios that remain untested by an economic downturn and the overheating real estate sector especially in dubai

1672244 theres a tradition in archaeology of saying people dont move very much they just transfer ideas through space we know that humans had to migrate at some point in their history but we also know humans tend to stay put once they get someplace

1672266 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1672267 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal

1672269 i dont support agricultural subsidies no matter where they are
1672270 the farm bill 300 billion is something america simply cant afford
1672271 for sure he cant lose missouri and thats in the upper midwest could he lose iowa minnesota and wisconsin and still be elected president yes but i wouldnt advise him to have that strategy
1672272 i dont see any scenario in which mccain can get to the white house without carrying some upper midwestern states
1672273 ive never really understood in all my years why sen mccain has gone out of his way to speak against and vote against policies that are important to the upper midwest
1672274 the upper midwest is crucial in this election and midwestern voters value authenticity they value experience
1672275 i dont think agricultural issues are the only issues midwestern voters care about there are some bigger picture issues broader issues where hes strong
1672276 were employing close to 2 000 people right now in iowa in the wind energy industry
1672277 it does challenge him in states like iowa the no 1 ethanol state
1672278 thats where hes got a problem hes got to find his own voice and so far he hasnt had a voice
1672279 president bush and i just had a good conversation about how critically important ethanol is and how iowa is positioned so well to lead the nation
1672280 i have no idea why john mccain doesnt support it it hurts him in indiana and missouri and ohio and its not the message right now that any of us want to hear
1672281 one of the biggest challenges in the fight against influenza is producing new vaccines every year

1672284 in the short term nevirapine is better than nothing but in the long term im concerned about conferring resistance if youre talking about resistance on a broad scale it could jeopardize future treatment for mothers and infants
1672285 the study reinforces the need to treat these women with combination therapy thereby providing better prevention for the infant while providing better treatment for the mother public health efforts should continue to expand combination therapy so that mothers and babies arent left vulnerable to drug resistance
1672286 mothers of young children in the united states are in a rather untenable situation
1672287 mothers are so isolated in our society there is not an appreciation for the extent to which this is a very challenging time for this large population
1672288 we were surprised at how quickly the women were back to employment over 80 percent by 12 weeks postpartum
1672289 they didnt get the maternity leave that they wanted they felt they had to be back at work earlier than they wanted they werent able to achieve their breast feeding goals
1672290 they are trying to do the right thing but they are not getting the support they need in terms of time to recover and the financial support they need to be at home with their babies
1672291 there is a major awareness challenge we arent really aware of the situation that mothers are in
1672292 we need to extend the supports we have offered to mothers we need to build awareness among women that they are not alone these are common issues issues for which they can get help they are entitled to help
1672293 most women dont exist within extended families and need other forms of support because there is not an extended family that can pick up the extra responsibility
1672294 that would be very helpful in reducing the level of stress
1672295 with all the emphasis on appropriate parenting there is pressure on women to be 100 percent available which is simply not possible womens expectations have increased dramatically
1672296 especially when there is a disconnect between how one thinks a mother is supposed to behave and how grueling it actually is that sets up people for disappointment and feelings of inadequacy it does create stress
1672297 get all the support you can muster if you pay for it or recruit various family members and friends the first year in a childs life is very demanding one needs a lot of support and one also needs to take care of oneself

1672327 the first decade of ethical trade put workers rights firmly on the map most retailers and brands now recognise their responsibility towards the workers who make their products
1672328 and ethical trade has moved out of the niche and into the mainstream more than ever before consumers are asking tough questions of companies about the workers who make their products which we welcome
1672329 but although were proud of the progress weve made the scale and pace of change being achieved to the lives of millions of workers across the globe is not enough

1672336 older adults who consumed tuna or other baked or broiled fish had a lower risk of having abnormalities on brain mris
1672337 this study looked at whether or not different types of fish intake were related to structural changes in the brain
1672338 we didnt find any association with eating fried fish and having lower rates of these abnormalities
1672339 the message to the public is to eat more fish that has higher levels of omega 3 fatty acids rather than eating more fried fish
1672340 this may be related to the more than one factor analogous to the mediterranean diet that is also rich in fish and fruits and vegetables and has been frequently associated with less cardiovascular risk
1672341 in the absence to a positive response to the generous offer that we provided for our incentives package we think that the allies will have no choice but to take further measures that would be punitive given that we dont have a decent and responsive statement from the iranians
1672342 i think that the iranians have long stalled on responding to the allies so i think the most important thing we can do is let the political directors have their conference call and decide on their next step
1672343 the phone talks today will be to decide on a common reponse there is the possibility of trying to send the matter back to the security council but there is always the problem of persuading china and russia

1672360 prior studies have looked at atrial fibrillation in young and middle aged and generally healthy people
1672361 they found that for example marathon runners have a higher risk of atrial fibrillation but the vast majority of atrial fibrillation occurs later in life after 65 about one in five people develops atrial fibrillation over 10 years
1672362 no one has looked at exercise and atrial fibrillation in these older people
1672363 we found that light to moderate exercise such as walking 10 blocks a week was associated with a lower incidence of atrial fibrillation
1672364 we have enrolled patients who have atrial fibrillation already to see whether exercise improves their quality of life
1672365 preliminary data appears to be that they feel better and function better
1672366 there are additional strong reasons for the public to focus on exercise
1672367 many of the investigators including myself were surprised by the results

1672369 nicotine interacts with a variety of neurochemical pathways within the brain to produce its rewarding and addictive effects however during the early phase of tobacco exposure many individuals find nicotine highly unpleasant and aversive whereas others may become rapidly dependent on nicotine and find it highly rewarding we wanted to explore that difference
1672370 while much progress has been made in understanding how the brain processes the rewarding effects of nicotine after the dependence is established very little is known about how the mesolimbic dopamine system may control the initial vulnerability to nicotine that is why do some individuals become quickly addicted to nicotine while others do not and in some cases even find nicotine to be highly aversive

1672389 the use of a single one size fits all value for the heterosexual infectivity of hiv 1 obscures important differences associated with transmission cofactors perhaps more importantly the particular value of 0001 i e one infection per 1000 contacts between infected and uninfected individuals that is commonly used seems to represent a lower bound as such this value substantially underestimates the infectivity of hiv 1 in many heterosexual contexts heterosexual infectivity can exceed 01 one transmission per 10 contacts for penile vaginal contact or even 03 one transmission per three contacts for penile anal contact claims in both the popular media and the peer reviewed literature that hiv is very difficult to transmit heterosexually are dangerous in any context where the possibility of hiv exposure exists
1672390 improved infectivity estimates especially more detailed estimates that quantify the amplifying effects of biological cofactors will help us to grasp the magnitude of the hiv epidemic accurately communicate the level of risk involved in heterosexual sex and identify the best possible intervention strategies for slowing the epidemics spread
1672391 infectivity studies are very difficult to conduct and that few studies exist as a result many of the studies producing the published estimates suffered from at least one potential bias therefore while our study documents the considerable heterogeneity of the heterosexual infectivity of hiv 1 and provides some explanations for this heterogeneity considerable uncertainty remains
1672392 i was trained almost 30 years ago and received a lot of training in psychotherapy
1672393 thanks to the advances of managed care psychotherapy was basically devalued from the perspective of psychiatry all that we were supposed to do was diagnose and consult for pharmacotherapy a lot of the incentives for wanting to be in psychiatry were essentially removed by managed care
1672394 they tend to rely more heavily on self paying patients
1672395 whats happened anecdotally is that some of the residents that i trained with have basically dropped out of insurance plans and are taking cash only business where they can provide the comprehensive services including psychotherapy
1672396 its a clientele thats at a much higher economic level if theyre socially inclined they end up volunteering at community mental health centers

1672425 s bastien es un mundo aparte nunca volver a haber un piloto de rallies como l tiene algo que no tiene el resto es el m s r pido y el que menos se equivoca mientras siga en el mundial de rallies ser muy complicado desbancarle su superioridad recuerda a la que impuso michael schumacher en la f rmula 1 cuando estaba en ferrari
1672426 creo que puedo ser campe n del mundo alg n d a
1672427 como son rumores no me importan no tengo constancia porque nadie del club se ha dirigido a m y no s la idea que tienen conmigo
1672428 que est n a la orden del d a en todos los clubes
1672429 por qu me va a molestar en el mundo del f tbol est claro que los profesionales asimilamos que puede ser as y que el club no cuente contigo
1672430 con optimismo para intentar hacer un a o mejor que el anterior
1672431 marcar objetivos ahora ser a una tonter a ahora mismo debemos coger lo que nos quiere transmitir el entrenador y fijar los objetivos a corto plazo
1672432 los cambios en la porter a son cosas del entrenador
1672433 los cambios en la porter a son cosas del entrenador l es qui n tiene que decidir
1672434 los cambios en la porter a son cosas del entrenador l es qui n tiene que decidir si juega casto o si lo hago yo creo que los dos somos buenos porteros y podemos pelear por el puesto yo no he hablado ni he escuchado a nadie de mi entorno decir nada sobre mi posible salida
1672435 no hemos hablado nada sobre mi situaci n s lo de lo que le conviene al grupo en general
1672436 ya vamos cogiendo el ritmo de entrenamientos hace mucho calor y es normal que nos cueste un poquito pero vamos bastante bien
1672437 este a o m s que todo que no se sufra tanto tenemos que pensar en estar m s tranquilos y ganar m s partidos para estar m s tranquilos en la clasificaci n
1672438 si los que han venido est n en el betis ser porque son buenos nosotros estamos ayud ndolos en todo para que se adapten r pido y ya est n demostrando cosas que aportan novedades al equipo

1672442 in amounts that could be substantial and materially dilutive to its existing shareholders
1672443 credit related expenses were far higher than what guidance had been
1672444 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements
1672445 we remain committed to raising 5 5 billion of new capital and will evaluate raising capital beyond this amount depending on our needs and as market conditions mandate
1672446 we have to prepare for a stress condition that looks worse than that
1672447 por lo que se redoblar n esfuerzos para contrarrestar este il cito

1672452 i am very proud that lucy is getting involved with something like this its a good cause for human rights and for democracy
1672453 its also a totally non violent movement the protesters are not saying they hate the chinese or the government but are just trying to bring some very dire human rights abuses to the worlds attention
1672454 if my daughters going to be put in prison for anything im glad its for a human rights protest
1672455 the whole world is watching china so i doubt while she is in detention they will do anything drastic in that sense i am less worried than i normally would be
1672456 right from the time of chinas application to hold the olympic games i have supported chinas right to host the games
1672457 this is a moment of great pride to the 1
1672458 i send my prayers and good wishes for the success of this event
1672459 for years the chinese government has tried to use the olympics to legitimise its illegal occupation of tibet
1672460 at this very moment tibetans are facing the most severe and violent repression they have seen in decades at the hands of the chinese government and we have taken non violent action at this critical time to draw the worlds attention to the crisis gripping tibet
1672461 the corporation das pathologische streben der konzerne nach geld und macht
1672462 the corporation das pathologische streben der konzerne nach geld und macht
1672463 wahrscheinlich ist the corporation der meistpr mierte dokumentarfilm aller zeiten der film ist eine akribische darstellung des wesens der entwicklung und der auswirkungen des gro konzerns in der modernen kapitalgesellschaft er zeigt warum ein konzern den rechtsstatus einer juristischen person besitzt weshalb er sogar gesetzlich dazu verpflichtet das eigene wohl ber das wohl der allgemeinheit zu stellen und auf moralische skrupel keine r cksicht zu nehmen beispiele wie die privatisierung des regenwassers in der bolivianischen stadt cochabamba durch den us konzern bechtel oder der verkauf von rechenmaschinen des amerikanischen konzerns ibm w hrend des zweiten weltkriegs an die nazis die in jedem konzentrationslager f r die logistische bew ltigung des massenmordens verwendet wurden zeigen deutlich die spuren die der psychopath in vergangenheit und gegenwart hinterlassen hat achbar abbott und bakan f hren auf 145 minuten l nge den beweis dass im moment kein kraut gewachsen ist das den konzern resozialisieren k nnte
1672464 das thema des dokumentarfilms ist gut abgehangen und nicht besonders sexy die geschichte der gro konzerne und ihr r cksichtsloser weltweiter kampf um geld und macht was aber die kanadier mark achbar und jennifer abbottt daraus gemacht haben ist sensationell 145 brillant erz hlte gro artig bebilderte und sehr kurzweilige minuten nur zwei ausschnitte fanta orange wurde von coca cola f r nazi deutschland erfunden der reifen multi goodyear wollte mal einen us pr sidenten st rzen nicht nur f r greenpeace und attac sympathisanten eine pflichtveranstaltung

1672467 the plan to use uavs in britain has worried civil liberties groups who say that they could be used to spy on innocent civilians
1672468 based on the performance and points yield of the budapest weekend youd say certainly not
1672469 but naturally we will not twiddle our thumbs as we still have developments in the pipeline aerodynamic as well as mechanical
1672470 and we will definitely not stop the development of the f1 08 because of one unsatisfying result
1672471 our performance on friday was reasonable the performance on saturday in qualifying was good to very good but our performance in the race was completely different
1672472 and i have to admit that i dont know the reason yet
1672473 what we certainly will look into is the equation of car set up tyres and track conditions
1672474 if you look at roberts qualifying time he should have been able to fight at the front but in reality in certain phases of the race he was the slowest car on the track
1672475 my father was happy to talk about his wartime experiences at some length when he was asked and wrote down his memories in great detail but he had two memories which caused him great sorrow and pain
1672476 the first was when he had to go on a bombing training mission in ireland he was supposed to be in the wellington but missed the flight the entire crew died and he felt a sense of guilt that he had survived it
1672477 he also felt angry more than angry that hitler had 50 of the 76 escapees shot and my father was friends with seven of them
1672478 he wasnt a fan of the steve mcqueen film he wasnt the greatest admirer of americans and it didnt go down too easily that one of them should be playing the starring role
1672479 parts of it he acknowledged were quite realistic but then he felt it turned into something that was completely untrue for someone who was actually there that was upsetting
1672480 for instance he thought the scene with the motorbike was well over the top a lot of the reality of digging tunnels was left out too
1672481 its a ridiculous question to ask who depicted my father but donald pleasance the forger flight lt colin blythe i suppose comes closest
1672482 im extremely proud of my father and especially proud of his bravery and what he did for his country
1672483 he has spoken to lots of people who have written books about the great escape and was a huge fountain of knowledge about world war ii
1672484 we can suffer our entire life over a thought that may not be true
1672485 self you will age gracefully gray naturally and love yourself
1672486 un grupo de catedr ticos y profesores de varias universidades constata que el castellano lejos de estar en peligro mantiene tales ventajas sobre el catal n el gallego y el euskera que su exacerbada defensa s lo puede tener un m vil ideol gico asistimos en estos d as a una nueva oleada de nacionalismo ling stico espa ol de la que el principal bot n de muestra es el manifiesto por la lengua com n que ha promovido una veintena de intelectuales de prestigio el texto en cuesti n se asienta en certezas que nacen de aquello que al parecer no puede someterse a discusi n como ocurre por lo dem s en muchos mbitos de la vida de un estado que presume de su condici n democr tica en las disputas correspondientes adquiere singular relieve la constituci n de 1978 producto de un pacto en el que en mbitos sensibles como ste se impusieron normas sin recabar la opini n de los afectados aun en el caso de que acept semos la condici n inequ vocamente democr tica del referendo constitucional de aquel a o habr a que preguntarse si tres decenios despu s no es leg timo reclamar en sentido bien diferente del que invocan los promotores del manifiesto mencionado una revisi n de las normas entonces instituidas las cosas como fueren es significativo que la nueva oleada de nacionalismo ling stico espa ol prefiera esconder que las reglas que hace suyas no son precisamente neutras llama poderosamente la atenci n que las mismas personas que afirman con particular insistencia y frente a toda evidencia tal y como lo revelan las leyes que afectan entre nosotros a las lenguas que los derechos no acompa an ni a stas ni a los territorios sino a las personas no aprecien problema alguno en el enunciado que se ha convertido en gu a principal del manifiesto por la lengua com n el de que mientras todos los ciudadanos espa oles est n obligados a conocer el castellano esto no es al parecer una imposici n sino un hecho cuya consistencia sin m s se supone los hablantes de otras lenguas disfrutan sin m s del derecho a emplear estas ltimas si sobran las razones para concluir que semejante enunciaci n contradice palmariamente lo que afirma el art culo 139 1 de la constituci n en vigor todos los espa oles tienen los mismos derechos y obligaciones en cualquier parte del territorio del estado m s inquietante es que en la espa a de hoy se d por demostrada al parecer hasta el final de los tiempos la adhesi n popular a reglas como la invocada en un escenario en el que se hace valer una oposici n cerril al despliegue de mecanismos que permitan conocer si la ciudadan a acata esas reglas o por el contrario las repudia quienes defienden que el castellano es superior natural y til olvidan su imposici n para el nacionalismo ling stico espa ol la lengua castellana es superior c moda f cil y til virtudes todas ellas que son siempre el producto de circunstancias naturales nunca de la imposici n y la represi n las lenguas de los dem s son por el contrario molestas arcaicas antiecon micas y francamente prescindibles al tiempo que la defensa del castellano se ajusta por definici n a un impulso democr tico la de las restantes lenguas responde cabe entender a espurios y cavernarios intereses marcados por esa felon a que identifica el manifiesto por la lengua com n si en las segundas se revelan por doquier los espasmos negativos de los nacionalismos por detr s de la primera no habr a en cambio nacionalismo alguno la estrategia principal no nos enga emos apunta a ratificar la situaci n de inc moda marginaci n y minor a de las lenguas no castellanas y a hacerlo de la mano de medidas que tienen un cariz visiblemente asim trico baste como bot n de muestra el recordatorio de que los firmantes del manifiesto que nos ocupa entienden que aun siendo recomendable que en las comunidades calificadas de biling es la rotulaci n de edificios y v as p blicas se registre en las dos lenguas en modo alguno podr realizarse en exclusiva en la lengua propia del pa s en cuesti n sin que por omisi n y cabe entender se rechace la posibilidad de que la rotulaci n se produzca nicamente en castellano el idioma y la fuerza conocer el espa ol es obligatorio los hablantes de otras lenguas s lo tienen derecho a su uso a los ojos de los nacionalistas ling sticos espa oles la lengua com n no se impone por la fuerza tal horizonte es ontol gicamente inimaginable frente a lo que ocurre al parecer con las lenguas no castellanas mientras se rechazan determinadas pol ticas alentadas por los gobiernos auton micos que se limitan a reclamar para las lenguas respectivas las mismas prerrogativas de las que disfruta el castellano en madrid en sevilla o en valladolid se prefiere olvidar c mo en el pasado y en el presente medidas aplicadas a menudo con sa a y violencia han beneficiado de siempre al castellano y explican siquiera parcialmente su condici n de visible preeminencia contempor nea mientras se manipulan y magnifican en suma los problemas que los castellanohablantes puedan encontrar en algunos lugares se esquiva toda consideraci n en lo relativo a la delicada situaci n en la que se encuentran el catal n el gallego y el vasco y ello sobre la base de la incre ble afirmaci n de que los objetivos de dignificaci n de esas lenguas ya han sido al parecer satisfechos no consta que los nacionalistas ling sticos espa oles de siempre interesados en defender en exclusiva su lengua se hayan pronunciado en momento alguno en favor de los leg timos derechos de los hablantes de las lenguas no castellanas que en los hechos el principio de libre elecci n ling stica en el sistema educativo s lo se postula para los castellanohablantes lo certifica la ausencia dram tica de toda consideraci n en lo que ata e a ese principio aplicado por ejemplo en las personas de los hablantes de catal n gallego y vasco que residen fuera de los territorios en los que las lenguas correspondientes son oficiales al cabo parece obligado concluir que esas lenguas no son percibidas como propias circunstancia que da al traste de paso con cualquier proyecto cre ble de biling ismo llamativo es que mientras los nacionalistas ling sticos espa oles se desenvuelven orgullosamente como monoling es en castellano se rechaza que los hablantes de catal n gallego y vasco puedan comportarse como monoling es en las lenguas respectivas lo que en los hechos se reivindica un monoling ismo de facto es percibido en cambio como una afrenta cuando se sobreentiende que es la apuesta de los gobernantes de las comunidades aut nomas que disponen de lenguas propias una curiosa defensa el manifiesto por la lengua com n configura en fin una curiosa defensa de una lengua que pareciera no tener a su disposici n ning n tipo de apoyo para certificar lo contrario ah est n la maquinaria del estado el sistema educativo un sinf n de rancias instituciones el grueso de los medios de comunicaci n buena parte de la jerarqu a de la iglesia cat lica el respaldo de intelectuales de prestigio y en fin las propias fuerzas armadas por si poco fuere y a tono con los tiempos el manifiesto que nos interesa recaba para sus promotores la doble condici n de luchadores por los derechos humanos y de defensores de los desheredados pena es que por muchos esfuerzos que se hagan el texto no acierte a ocultar la defensa obscena de privilegios tan impuestos como asentados y la ritual demonizaci n tambi n a tono con los tiempos de quienes disienten parad jicamente tildados a menudo de fascistas y totalitarios que semejante campa a sea atizada en suma desde medios de comunicaci n y cen culos de la derecha m s montaraz dice mucho de su sentido m s profundo

1672504 ethics is so native to the individual that when it goes off the rails he will always seek to overcome his own lack of ethics
1672505 scientology ethics explained l ron hubbard are reason they provide the means by which men conduct themselves toward their long term survival the survival of their families their groups their planet and more implicit within the subject is the recognition that all things are to one degree or another interdependent upon all else and that only by constantly considering the survival of the many can the individual ensure his own survival with this thinking firmly in mind the scientologist obeys the law remains faithful to his spouse truthful in his business dealings and otherwise conducts himself in accordance with honesty integrity and decency scientologists understand that rules and laws form the agreements by which a group society or nation survives and that high ethical standards far from inhibiting the enjoyment of life foster it yet what of the rest of the world for want of a workable system of ethics and justice whole civilizations have gone to ruin whole forests have been laid to waste and whole sections of our cities have been reduced to racial battlegrounds simultaneously we have witnessed the steady disintegration of the family a general decay of sexual values escalating drug abuse theft assault and on and on until it seems there is no hope at all except this the scientologist must also live in this society and he truly does possess the tools to make a difference

1672571 i was just glad there werent any fights that makes us look bad on youtube
1672572 then in 1941 the borough decided it had to carry out work on part of the wall on balkerne hill
1672573 as this was during the second world war the work must have been essential
1672574 but this was how we began looking after the roman wall again since the 1940s regular vegetation clearance and maintenance work has been carried out and from 1987 we have been undertaking quite major repairs
1672575 some people do take historic buildings for granted and do not realise how fortunate we are to have such buildings
1672576 but many more do understand their importance and the importance of keeping them in good repair
1672577 but i believe there is definitely a need for improvements in our forward planning
1672578 we should be thinking five or ten years ahead and getting a clear idea of what we want to do not just about the roman wall but on all our historic buildings and heritage
1672579 when we know what is coming up which relics need priority work then we can target resources better
1672580 the past is so very important to us even though we dont always realise its significance
1672581 history determines us it tells us why we are here doing what we are doing heritage gives people a sense of place and in colchester there is so much depth to our heritage
1672582 wat heb ik tot nu toe gedaan in mijn leven en wat wil ik nog gaan doen met de tijd die me nog rest

1672591 wow getting a divorce im sorry to hear that youre getting a divorce getting your name off the records of the church youve got a lot of things going down in your life dont you
1672592 well i do see your reasons for doing this stated clearly in your letter i dont know how much of this comes from the internet and how much of it comes from your heart though
1672593 and it came to pass that after much labor among them they began to have success among the poor class of people for behold they were cast out of the synagogues because of the coarseness of their apparel therefore they were not permitted to enter their synagogues to worship god being esteemed as filthiness therefore they were poor yea they were esteemed by their brethren as dross
1672594 but the lord said unto samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because i have refused him for the lord seeth not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but the lord looketh on the heart
1672595 shall not judge after the sight of his eyes neither reprove after the hearing of his ears but with righteousness shall he judge the poor and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth
1672596 judge not according to the appearance but judge righteous judgment
1672597 the worst sinners according to jesus are not the harlots and publicans but the religious leaders with their insistence on proper dress and grooming their careful observance of all the rules their precious concern for status symbols their strict legality their pious patriotism
1672598 had i not known that they were coming to the school for church meetings i would have assumed that there was some sort of sporting event taking place
1672599 you ought to be ashamed of yourself for your fearmongering in the name of god
1672600 but it is the responsibility of church leaders to define appropriate dress if its clear that the rule of thumb isnt being adhered to in church
1672601 id bet hed be cool id bet hed be mighty fine looking id bet that he smells divine and im not talking about calvin kleins obsession no hes just one of those people who smells good all the time theres no reason why
1672602 we were initially optimistic that we would find a buyer because there was considerable interest
1672603 there is still considerable uncertainty over the future of jobs at pfizers plant at ringaskiddy
1672604 the government must do everything in its power to find a buyer for this plant and prevent further job losses in the area
1672605 we will now turn our attention towards an early scheduled labour relations commission hearing to assess the full effects of this shock announcement by pfizer
1672606 we also remain concerned at this point regarding the sale process of pfizers other plant in loughbeg ringaskiddy county cork
1672607 the cork city dole office had the single biggest increase in the live register in the entire country in the last 12 months when the live register increased by 2 566
1672608 these job losses will have a serious impact on the local economy
1672609 no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine
1672610 this church came about as a result of intellectual curiosity we believe in education we expect them church members to think we expect them to investigate we expect them to use their minds and dig deeply for knowledge in all fields
1672611 was troubled that my church requested i violate my own conscience to write in support of an amendment i feel is contrary to the constitution and to the gospel of christ
1672612 it appears that people can leave the church but the church cant leave people alone
1672613 we as the first presidency and the quorum of the twelve apostles have repeatedly set forth our position that the marriage of a man and a woman is the only acceptable marriage relationship
1672614 encouraging members to oppose church leaders on the issue of same gender marriage
1672615 i was troubled that my church requested i violate my own conscience to write in support of an amendment i feel is contrary to the constitution and to the gospel of christ
1672616 however it is not acceptable when their digging and questioning leads to public opposition against doctrine church leaders are obliged to uphold
1672617 one who focuses on faults though they be true tears down a brother or a sister the virtues of patience brotherly kindness mutual respect loyalty and good manners all rest to some degree on the principle that even though something is true we are not necessarily justified in communicating it to any and all persons at any and all times
1672618 its wrong to criticize leaders of the church even if the criticism is true
1672619 in relation to history i was speaking in that talk for the benefit of those that write history in the course of writing history i said that people ought to be careful in what they publish because not everything thats true is useful
1672620 i am persuaded that many do not understand the churchs teachings about personal criticism especially the criticism of church leaders by church members
1672621 i have found that personal critcism of church members does little good and much harm that is true whatever position the member may hold in the church
1672622 standing up for what he truly believed to be right and true
1672623 and no i do not believe that church leaders are always in the right anyone who has spent much time in the church knows better
1672624 we believe that men should appeal to the civil law for redress of all wrongs and grievances where personal abuse is inflicted or the right of property or character infringed where such laws exist as will protect the same
1672625 are we having a competition to see who can use the word
1672626 part of what i think were debating here is just what can be considered disorderly conduct
1672627 most organizations of any type should be able to withstand criticism even public criticism most organizations should be able to accept and evaluate feedback from a host of sources including their own members stakeholders employees
1672628 one member openly publically sic disagreeing with the leadership on an issue shouldnt undermine the authority of that organization
1672629 without a mechanism for the lds organization to separate legitimate criticism from true threats more and more incidents like this one will surface
1672630 in reality church leaders had asked members to write to their senators with their personal views regarding the federal amendment opposing same gender marriage and did not request support or opposition to the amendment
1672631 reid does not appear to reconcile his personal beliefs with the doctrine church leaders are charged to maintain by divine mandate
1672632 so what now brown cow is reid a goner or is he cool enough to stay this sure begs the question
1672633 if i were to publish a letter to the editor and stated that as vice president of xyz corp i thought my company was wrong for failing to pay its employees a generous wage in third world countries i can pretty much guarantee you that by the time that particular letter crosses the desk of the ceo of xyz corp i would be looking for alternative employment
1672634 this leads to undivided continuum fallacy by the same logic two members openly publicly disagreeing with the leadership shouldnt undermine the authority of that organization or three members and so on at some point it will become an issue and will undermine the authority of the organization
1672635 you talk about criticizing the leadership should i be allowed every fast and testimony meeting to stand up and declare that the bishop is a brain dead moron his counselors are fetid vermin and that the relief society president has less compassion than a sack of potatoes assuming that there is some basis in fact for making these accusations isnt there some point at which this would become disruptive to the functioning of the organization
1672636 you seem to be advocating that there is no time or place for any sort of criticism of the church whatsoever
1672637 the practice of suppressing criticism of any kind and of controlling what can and cannot be researched at byu is unjust and when the members see the church firing diciplining and excommunicating people for such actions it dramatically influences the way members look at their options
1672638 so for me it is clear the reason for this debate is to divide our society to pit one against another this is another one of the presidents efforts to frighten to distort to distract and to confuse america it is this administrations way of avoiding the tough real problems that american citizens are confronted with each and every day
1672639 now may i say a word concerning loyalty to the church we see much indifference there are those who say the church wont dictate to me how to think about this that or the other or how to live my life no i reply the church will not dictate to any man how he should think or what he should do the church will point out the way and invite every member to live the gospel and enjoy the blessings that come of such living the church will not dictate to any man but it will counsel it will persuade it will urge and it will expect loyalty from those who profess membership therein when i was a university student i said to my father on one occasion that i felt the general authorities had overstepped their prerogatives when they advocated a certain thing he was a very wise and good man he said the president of the church has instructed us and i sustain him as prophet seer and revelator and intend to follow his counsel this is his work he established it he has revealed its doctrine he has outlined its practices he created its government it is his work and his kingdom and he has said they who are not for me are against me 2 ne 10 16 president heber j grant then president of this church had pleaded with our people against voting to nullify prohibition it broke his heart when so many members of the church in this state disregarded his counsel on this occasion i am not going to talk about the good or bad of prohibition but rather of uncompromising loyalty to the church how grateful my brethren i feel how profoundly grateful for the tremendous faith of so many latter day saints who when facing a major decision on which the church has taken a stand align themselves with that position and i am especially grateful to be able to say that among those who are loyal are men and women of achievement of accomplishment of education of influence of strength highly intelligent and capable individuals each of us has to face the matter either the church is true or it is a fraud there is no middle ground it is the church and kingdom of god or it is nothing
1672640 members of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints are encouraged to study learn and ask questions in their quest for knowledge
1672641 when the the prophet has spoken the thinking is done
1672642 why even have a prophet if the majority of what he says is optional discountable etc why not just run it by a committee of 12
1672643 loyalty includes how to think or act about this that or the other and how to live
1672644 the church expects uncompromising agreement in thought action and living
1672645 wise good highly intelligent educated influential high achieving accomplished strong capable men and women are loyal to the church god runs the prophet and the church the church is gods work establishment revealed doctrine practices government and kingdom if not for god you are against god ergo if i dont think act and live like the church or the prophet invites counsels persuades or urges then i am fighting against god or i am not intelligent wise etc
1672646 no it doesnt loyal means faithful to a cause ideal custom institution or product
1672647 how it reconciles with the other side of the prophetic lips saying the church encourages people to think for themselves
1672648 in reality church leaders had asked members to write to their senators with their personal views regarding the federal amendment opposing same gender marriage and did not request support or opposition to the amendment for more than a year and a half mr danzig counseled with his local bishop and stake president regarding same gender marriage and other church doctrines unfortunately he was not able to reconcile his personal beliefs with the doctrine church leaders are charged to maintain by divine mandate

1672803 kentuckians like all americans are hard hit by record high gas prices
1672804 these tough times call for creative solutions and i believe allowing kentuckians the option of using an electric vehicle is one of those solutions electric vehicles may help ease the burden on the pocketbooks of hard working kentucky families as well as reduce their carbon footprint
1672805 never have we received such hospitality and such overwhelming enthusiasm for electric vehicles as exhibited by the governor and every single person we met while in kentucky
1672806 seeing such a swift reaction by the kentucky government in favor of zap affirms our belief that the time is now for electric transportation to play a greater role in society we all want to build better transportation and it doesnt matter if you live in kentucky or california the dream is everywhere
1672807 this has been described as the most valuable domestic burglary ever committed in this country the collection is described as priceless
1672808 there is a difficulty in putting a value on antiques and antiquities some of them very precious and very rare but it is tens of millions of pounds
1672809 anywhere at any level you wouldnt expect fifteen serious injuries in a season let alone six games
1672810 this swarm of injuries is certainly unusual but were going to rally together this week and play well again but you want to talk about breaks the bad breaks weve gotten have far out shadowed any calls we may have had here or there
1672811 people want to talk about the touchdown wes scored off of the fumble well if it wasnt for great effort on wes part he wouldnt have been in a position to pick up the fumble it just points out the team effort and the great effort the players are giving to create some of their own breaks
1672812 it is something special and we do have something going thats maybe magical who knows hopefully we can keep it going
1672813 we had received a note saying there were problems with the pool but were assured it was safe to swim
1672814 my boy and i jumped in but within hours were left in the most excruciating pain i lost three or four layers of skin in some parts it really was quite terrifying
1672815 after receiving treatment we were told our skin had suffered a reaction with the chemicals the holiday was ruined for my son my wife and me

1672824 i thought id get the opportunity in detroit because they didnt really have a guy
1672825 i was a rookie free agent i didnt know anything about it
1672826 i thought the best guy would play and i was the best guy but they wanted a veteran in there i didnt get my chance i guess it just wasnt my time but im not worried about what happened in the past right now im taking the opportunity im given
1672827 when they moved me to linebacker that hurt my pride a lot
1672828 you play offence you got pride im the leading rusher in my schools history and they want me to play linebacker but i humbled myself and looked at it as another door opening for me it made me say they really want to keep me around i waited my time out and ended up the season as the running back started one game and then when payton got hurt in the playoff game i finished that game

1672847 with this agreement our children who are taking a holiday in australia are able to work in all lines of working fields according to the needs there
1672848 there has been no decision by the australian government to have a guest worker scheme with anyone as yet he said
1672849 while you know there is consideration before cabinet about such matters the focus is very much on the south pacific as a trial
1672850 a decision will be taken and announced shortly about that but the focus has always been on both the south pacific and a trial as part of our attempts to stabilise the south pacific economies
1672851 there has not been any formal engagement with indonesia on those issues senator evans said

1672918 remembering back to the last time this occurred theres something a little disturbing about 200 000 germans chanting their support for a charismatic leader in the streets of berlin
1672919 what i really meant by saying the surge wouldnt work
1672920 we like mr obama and we hope that he will win the election
1672921 that facility hosts dating parties where local men drop by to
1672922 they are fueling the fire whether it is software or not
1672923 truth be told with all the intelligent people wandering around and voting in this nation of ours many people will probably shallowly vote for obama based on his star power and great speech deliverance alone
1672924 for example consider the impact that open source software license b s d used for linux is having or the copyleft institution used by wikipedia or the creative commons licensing regimes or

1672942 desgraciadamente la ley es muy ben vola si un extranjero tiene un hijo ya no lo podemos expulsar y otra parte es que no sabemos a qui nes estamos autorizando a entrar
1672943 antes se denunciaban seis de cada 10 secuestros y ahora ocho de cada 10
1672944 la informaci n se puede consultar en la p gina de la semarnat con el n mero de tr mite 23qr2008td013 sin embargo lo interesante del caso no eso sino que omitieron parte del procedimiento administrativo por las siguientes razones
1672945 el proyecto ingres el 11 de marzo de 2008 empezando a computar como d a h bil al siguiente de su ingreso esto es el 12 como se observa en la figura 1 el proyecto inici su integraci n dos d as despu s de la recepci n del tr mite 13 de marzo y termin de integrarse el 31 de marzo 10 d as h biles para integrarlo despu s de 11 d as de la fecha de ingreso
1672946 hay coordinaci n entre la procuradur a general de justicia del distrito federal y su correspondiente procuradur a general de la rep blica y entre la secretar a de seguridad p blica local y la federal
1672947 curiosamente los votantes no se sienten responsables de los fracasos del gobierno que han votado
1672948 al descuidar la seguridad p blica el estado pone en peligro varios derechos fundamentales de sus ciudadanos como el derecho a la vida a la integridad personal al patrimonio y a una vida libre de violencia
1672949 vemos con buenos ojos una apertura que vaya a redundar en el beneficio econ mico de m xico y de las empresas
1672950 lo que no han conseguido sus opositores s puede lograrlo el grav simo problema de la inseguridad la administraci n del se or calder n como t le dices a este dizque gobierno est en riesgo estamos hartos de su corrupci n y m s de la impunidad con la que trata a los delincuentes como es el caso de vicente fox
1672951 los xitos de la lucha en contra del narcotr fico
1672952 cuando los poderosos empresarios se adue aron del poder pol tico en m xico comenz a propagarse en los medios de informaci n particularmente en la tv una continua propaganda contra los secuestros da la impresi n que mientras m s capital acumulaban esos magnates y m s presencia ten an en varios negocios m s miedo o terror sent an de que fueran secuestrados por eso d a tras d a intensificaban la campa a contra la delincuencia en el pa s poniendo ahora s irresponsablemente al resto de la poblaci n en tensi n y p nico
1672953 en la tv de manera permanente se hacen llamados para combatir el secuestro se lanzan acusaciones contra el gobierno porque no pone toda la vigilancia necesaria se hacen exhortos para aplicar la pena de muerte contra los secuestradores se presentan cuadros de gran tragedia de los rescatados vivos im genes para mostrar las caras de los malhechores as como los feos apodos de los delincuentes
1672954 es indudable de que en m xico as como en todos los pa ses donde la miseria el hambre el desempleo ha crecido aceleradamente tambi n se ha incrementado lo que llaman la delincuencia el robo el secuestro o los asesinatos
1672955 contra las sirvientas las ni eras los chavos que protestan las mam s que abandonan a sus hijos los pap s flojos las prostitutas los homosexuales y en general contra los marginados que la misma sociedad se ha encargado de despedazar cuando los acusan de ser delincuentes irresponsables o inadaptados y piden c rcel o la pena de muerte para ellos y sabiendo que nunca se hace una reflexi n sobre el contexto social que provoca las desigualdades lo mejor que suelo hacer es apagar el aparato y pensar en el racismo con que tratan de manipular a nuestra poblaci n
1672956 each week i will review one or two books what kinds of books well for the most part international books books that were firs t published in another country not united states that have since been published here this includes books that were written in english australia canada england etc and those books written in another language that have since been translated into english but i may also look at a handful of books about characters that enjoy traveling the world and learning about new places and new cultures

1672964 it is of course understandable that young people want to earn a bit of extra pocket money but its also vitally important that they are protected from being exploited are safe in the workplace and that it doesnt interfere with their studies

1672969 so what hes taking huge chunks of money from people with serious special interests in washington
1672970 to me the most interesting part of the whole story is that weve documented the timing and the magnitude of a tremendous change in antarctic climate the transition marks a shift from warm temperate glaciers with patches of fringing tundra to todays cold polar glaciers set within in a barren polar desert
1672971 the contrast couldnt be more striking it is like comparing tierra del fuego today with the surface of mars and this transition took place over a geologically short interval of roughly 200 000 years
1672972 they are the first to be found even though scientific expeditions have been visiting the dry valleys since their discovery during the first scott expedition in 1902 1903
1672973 to be able to identify living species amongst the fossils is phenomenal to think that modern counterparts have survived 14 million years on earth without any significant changes in the details of their appearances is striking it must mean that these organisms are so well adapted to their habitats that in spite of repeated climate changes and isolation of populations for millions of years they have not become extinct but have survived
1672974 the fossil finds allow us to examine antarctica as it existed just prior to climate cooling at 13 9 million years ago it is a unique window into the past on land there are very few places on earth that contain sediment of this age and none are as well preserved as those found in the dry valleys
1672975 the sediments allow reconstructions of alpine glaciers tundra and lakes all in remarkable detail to study these deposits is akin to strolling across the dry valleys 14 1 million years ago
1672976 is the last hint of vegetation in the dry valleys
1672977 the fossil finds and dating of volcanic ash show that roughly 14
1672978 and its within these ancient lake beds that we found the fossils
1672979 lewis marchant and ashworth discovered the last bit of life on the antarctic continent it was hanging on by its fingernails just a few simple plants and bugs in a small pond everything else around them frozen over and then wham they went too and it must have happened quickly because these fossils are literally freeze dried when i visited the scientists in the field they showed me how the moss was still green and leafy
1672980 it is one of the most dramatic and long lasting changes that one can imagine
1672981 i dont know of any other place on earth where such an enduring change has been documented the fact that it is associated with the extinction of tundra plants and insects helps provide quantitative estimates for the magnitude of this change
1672982 other scientists had been to this area before but hadnt noticed anything unusual it took the trained eye of this team to make the discovery
1672983 it is hard to diagnose the anemia of chronic disease
1672984 having an assay for hepcidin would make it much easier and it would also help in diagnosing iron overload diseases
1672985 the assay can be used to easily measure hepcidin in the blood of all vertebrates
1672986 untreated after a 40 year search a hormone controlling iron metabolism in mammals is finally identified
1672987 the map is the most precise depiction yet of the limits and the future dividing lines that could be drawn across the arctic region
1672988 the results have huge implications for policy making as the rush to carve up the polar region continues
1672989 its a cartographic means of showing and an attempt to collate information and predict the way in which the arctic region may eventually be divided up the freezing land and seas of the arctic are likely to be getting hotter in terms of geopolitics the durham map aims to assist national and international policy makers across the world
1672990 people have a hard time adhering to diets and our research shows that choosing eggs for breakfast can dramatically improve the success of a weight loss plan
1672991 apparently the increased satiety and energy due to eggs helps people better comply with a reduced calorie diet
1672992 eggs are a good source of all natural high quality protein so they can help keep you satisfied longer making it easier to resist tempting snacks

1672994 while adolescent african american females remain a high risk group for stds little research has examined their marijuana use sexual behaviors and incidence of std infection

1673009 when people move to a new country the children will eventually speak the language like natives and the adults wont
1673010 the students just listened for as much as a year without speaking at all we found that adults get almost the same results that children do if adults understand natural talk in real situations without trying to say anything for a whole year then fluent speaking with clear pronunciation will come automatically
1673011 i dont care about test scores anymore i just want to speak easily to native speakers
1673012 our model is proposing a way that the brain processes temporal information and how this can vary over time
1673013 positive excitatory feedback originating from recurrent connections between the cells
1673014 nicotine interacts with a variety of neurochemical pathways within the brain to produce its rewarding and addictive effects
1673015 however during the early phase of tobacco exposure many individuals find nicotine highly unpleasant and aversive whereas others may become rapidly dependent on nicotine and find it highly rewarding we wanted to explore that difference
1673016 while much progress has been made in understanding how the brain processes the rewarding effects of nicotine after the dependence is established very little is known about how the mesolimbic dopamine system may control the initial vulnerability to nicotine that is why do some individuals become quickly addicted to nicotine while others do not and in some cases even find nicotine to be highly aversive
1673017 at first we had no idea what it was it could have been in our solar system or at the edge of the universe
1673018 we think that in the recent past the galaxy ic 2497 hosted an enormously bright quasar
1673019 because of the vast scale of the galaxy and the voorwerp light from that past still lights up the nearby voorwerp even though the quasar shut down sometime in the past 100 000 years and the galaxys black hole itself has gone quiet
1673020 from the point of view of the voorwerp the galaxy looks as bright as it would have before the black hole turned off its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe
1673021 its rather like examining the scene of a crime where although we cant see them we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows
1673022 the strange hannys voorwerp looks like it could be the nearest example of a luminous quasar
1673023 ic 2497 is so close that if the quasar was still shining today on a good night you could probably see it with a small telescope
1673024 the nearest active quasar called 3c 273 is 1 7 billion light years further away
1673025 this discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the internet world
1673026 hannys attentiveness alerted us not only to a peculiar object but to a window into the cosmic past which might have eluded us for a long time otherwise trying to understand the processes operating here has proven to be a fascinating challenge involving a whole range of astrophysical techniques and instruments around the world and beyond this has also been some of the most rewarding astronomy ive done in years
1673027 when we launched galaxy zoo we were overwhelmed as was the internet portal initially with the outpouring of public interest and volunteer input
1673028 its amazing to think that this object has been sitting in the archives for decades and that amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online
1673029 it was a fantastic present to find out on my 25th birthday that we will get observational time on the hubble space telescope to follow up this discovery
1673030 endometriosis occurs when cells of the inner lining of the womb are found growing outside of the uterus
1673031 we found the telomere a region at the end of all chromosomes that prevents the chromosome destroying itself during cell division is abnormally long in women with endometriosis
1673032 our research shows however that cells in the lining of the womb are unique in that they can express this enzyme in the early stages of the menstrual cycle when cell division is important but not during the latter stages when implantation of the fertilised embryo becomes a priority
1673033 it will allow the diagnosis of underlying inflammation to distinguish diseases of iron metabolism that stem from hepcidin versus those with other causes
1673034 it can help us divine the effects of inflammation on body iron stores
1673035 our duck billed dinosaur grew three to five times faster than any potential predators that lived alongside it
1673036 by the time the duck billed dinosaur was fully grown the tyrannosaurs were only half grown it was a huge size difference
1673037 thats another added bonus when facing predators if you can keep reproducing youre set
1673038 we were shocked at how fast they grew if you look at a cross section of the bone of a nestling or even from within the egg there are huge spaces in which blood supply was going through the bone which means they were growing like crazy

1673088 i was like come on man i gotta be singing about someones fiery sex for a year and half
1673089 its a bold title yknow were getting old and were trying to make people think we still have the sex drive that we did
1673090 we didnt set out to make an nc 17 film thats just commercial suicide
1673091 they felt it was rather sexually graphic my point is it was comically graphic all the sex in the movie with the exception of one scene is very cartoonish very campy it wasnt designed to titillate
1673092 anybody not inclined to see a movie with porno in the title is not going to see it so it kind of regulates itself to a degree and anybody who is going is not going to be surprised by what they see
1673093 it will be extremely hard to get rid of as its the only one in the world

1673190 our determination to build a new relationship with rwanda moving beyond our difficult past remains intact
1673191 this report is an important step of which france should be happy
1673192 for diplomacy it is a very good basis the relation between rwanda and france should be based on the truth
1673193 the government has asked the courts to use this report we hope that legal proceedings will follow
1673194 in the past few years we have seen an insidious attempt to rewrite history it aims to turn france from an involved party into an accomplice to the genocide
1673195 during my time as head of french diplomacy we did everything we could to help the reconciliation of rwandans

1673232 stop taking supplements of vitamins a e and beta carotene plain and simple
1673233 vitamin supplements are extraordinarily safe and effective this is based on fifty years of clinical experience without seeing any life threatening side effects and no deaths it is pharmaceutical drugs that are dangerous perhaps the drug industry is getting tired of all the bad news about drugs so instead they are going after nutritional supplements
1673234 for 33 years i have aggressively prescribed and advocated vitamins in doses vastly higher than the usual government recommendations for my family and my patients i have never seen any adverse reactions even though i have been on the alert for them all this time
1673235 must be safe for consideration as over the counter products health canada ensures that all canadians have ready access to natural health products that are safe effective and of high quality

1673253 the situation is getting more critical every day the government must not be quiet and must do its best to stop this problem law must be enforced equally on everyone
1673254 such crimes have increased so much that even children are raped there is no pity nor any sense these incidents show that the government is very weak
1673255 the courts take bribes the attorney offices take bribes and there is no one to ask about all this for this reason there are killings rapes thefts and everything else there is no government in reality

1673259 our duck billed dinosaur grew three to five times faster than any potential predators that lived alongside it
1673260 by the time the duck billed dinosaur was fully grown the tyrannosaurs were only half grown it was a huge size difference
1673261 thats another added bonus when facing predators if you can keep reproducing youre set
1673262 we were shocked at how fast they grew if you look at a cross section of the bone of a nestling or even from within the egg there are huge spaces in which blood supply was going through the bone which means they were growing like crazy

1673291 i just dont think its a proper activity for an area which is the city of new yorks most precious capital asset
1673292 i think it poses a risk i think they are going to say quite candidly that it is a problem let the federal government go on record

1673319 pgxhealth is committed to providing this important genetic test to patients and physicians and we are investing significant resources to obtain insurance coverage for patients who need our lqts test
1673320 this growth in private insurance and medicaid coverage reflects increasing payer acknowledgement of the tests benefits and greater adoption among healthcare providers
1673321 genetic analysis is very important for identifying all mutation carriers within an lqts family once identified silent carriers of lqts genetic defects may be treated with beta blockers for prophylaxis of life threatening arrhythmias furthermore silent mutation carriers should receive genetic counseling to learn about the risk of transmitting lqts to offspring
1673322 in patients affected by lqts genetic analysis is useful for risk stratification and for making therapeutic decisions

1673345 fortunately most people recover on their own within 5 10 days but it is important that anyone who has bloody diarrhea seek medical attention just to be safe
1673346 however antibiotics do not appear to help people get better faster and are not usually indicated persons with diarrhea should drink plenty of liquids to prevent dehydration drugs that stop diarrhea e g imodium should not be used

1673354 one of the biggest challenges in the fight against influenza is producing new vaccines every year
1673355 there is no other instance where new vaccines must be made every year
1673356 in the last 20 seasons 16 have had good matches and there have been four that were less than optimal matches
1673357 with the start of the summer holiday season many welsh families will be preparing to travel abroad and recent reports including the resurgence of measles in italy remind us to consider whether children are adequately protected from infection before they travel
1673358 measles is a highly contagious infection that remains a leading cause of death amongst young children despite the availability of an effective vaccine
1673359 in 2006 an estimated 242 000 people died from measles worldwide the majority of them children we recommend a full two dose course of the mmr vaccination to protect children adequately against mumps and rubella as well as measles
1673360 a significant number of children in wales remain vulnerable to this potentially fatal disease with uptake of mmr remaining below the 95 per cent target which is needed to give real protection to the community
1673361 my dream is to one day play in europe and now an option to go to depor exists it is obvious that it excites me that there is a chance to prove myself in spain because it is such a great league
1673362 i am very proud that such a big club has noticed me and that i am on a possible list of people they want
1673363 i hope i can end up playing there but there has been no concrete offer made yet
1673364 fabricio was with me in the national team and we have kept in touch he told me about depor and how prestigious the club is
1673365 it is fantastic and makes me proud that fabricio spoke so highly of me to depor he and i have always been friends and i am grateful he told hte coach about me

1673382 in the latest version of the islamic penal codes bill which has undergone several modifications such punishments are not mentioned jamshidi said the reformist
1673383 deeply concerned over the fate of the nine but it was not known if they were among those whose lives have been spared
1673384 the implementation of stoning has been suspended for several people who have received this sentence jamshidi said without giving a number
1673385 two of them have been pardoned by the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei and then sentenced to about 10 years in jail he said
1673386 and the verdict for two others has been changed to lashes he said adding that other cases were under discussion by the judiciarys clemency commission

1673388 he is a player that we were following in the past but then he went to juve
1673389 he needs to recuperate physically but once he is well he will be a great midfielder and very useful for us
1673390 the start of the league is approaching and we are all looking forward to it to see what we are capable of with more luck we hope to enjoy it more after the last few seasons it is normal to look as survival as our first objective but it is clear everyone wants to look up
1673391 it is clear that everyone is looking forward to it we know it is an important game it arrives very quickly and it gives us a lot of morale
1673392 what makes me happy is having minutes to play it is important for any player to want continuity last year i was not in the eleven as much as i wanted but i hope this time i will be
1673393 there has been interest and i expect him to be plying his trade with someone else by the time we get to nottingham
1673394 of course i would love him even now to turn around and say you know what i dont fancy a move ive spent so many years at reading i want to stay here and help guide them back into the premiership
1673395 messi has told me that he wants to stay with the national squad
1673396 i do not want to go into the legal side of all this but i do know that he will be playing with us for the entire championship
1673397 fifa is surprised and disappointed by this decision but we respect it
1673398 nevertheless i appeal to the clubs let your players take part in the olympic games
1673399 it would be an act of solidarity in perfect harmony with the olympic spirit it would be wonderful for the players for the fans and for the game itself
1673400 fifas opinion has not changed the olympic football tournaments are high level competitions that give everyone involved most notably young players the chance to gain international experience that will stand them in good stead for the future
1673401 it stands to reason therefore that it is not only the player who will benefit from such an experience but also his club
1673402 i regret that the cas has not taken the olympic spirit into consideration
1673403 it is much harder to work on your own but now i am with the team and i have extra sessions of my own with the fitness coach in england you have no winter break so this the summer rest is the rest for the whole season and you need this
1673404 i hope the body can make a quick recovery the new fitness is not a problem because if you are one week early or late it is not so important and there is little difference by the start of the season
1673405 its completely different i didnt know when i would come back i was injured and couldnt train with the team for months so i am much happier now

1673409 we look forward to working with bocog and the itf to ensure an outstanding tennis venue

1673411 this facility will provide a world class tennis legacy for beijing

1673419 the ad only launched last month and its been a massive hit the germans cant get enough of paul
1673420 she wanted it really to be kept a secret for a long time
1673421 and i think women should because they should be able to announce what theyre having and when its time to make the announcement
1673422 i have finished that chapter in my life now because i have known from the start that they would not count on me
1673423 in the world of football you have to be intelligent and see how many players they have signed and what a great squad they now have
1673424 i only regret not being able to show if i had the quality to succeed here or not
1673425 you always think about making it into the first team but not everyone can do that and it is clear that things do not begin and end here
1673426 my aim now is to become the player i know i can be and then people will know if i could have succeeded at bar a
1673427 because they are rumours they do not worry me i have nothing to worry about because nobody at the club has told me this and i do not know if they have any plans for me
1673428 these are things that happen with all clubs why should it bother me in football it is obvious that the players are there to do with what the clubs want and that you may not be wanted any more
1673429 all we are thinking about is playing real madrid because we want to win against a strong rival it would be daft to have any further ambitions at the moment though
1673430 esiste un movimento istituzionalizzato come libera e poi quello forte come ammazzateci tutti o i ragazzi di locri
1673431 dopo il periodo delle stragi il governo ha ripreso a non legiferare
1673432 credo che peggio di cos non si potrebbe andare dopo la stagione delle stragi a seguito della quale lo stato fu costretto ad assumere delle posizioni dure si sono fatte nuovamente largo le posizioni del continente garantista allo stato attuale in atto un vero e proprio disfacimento di quella legislazione che consente ai giudici e alle forze dellordine di poter svolgere il proprio lavoro allinterno delle istituzioni si sono incuneate forze che seguono gli interessi della criminalit organizzata credo si possa fare un esempio su tutti marcello dellutri e inoltre in atto una operazione di delegittimazione nei confronti della magistratura e di assoggettamento del csm al potere politico le riforme previste per lorgano superiore della magistratura mirano proprio a questo ma io credo che non ce ne sia addirittura bisogno perch csm e magistratura si fanno gi abbastanza male da sole tramite le loro correnti che sono un vero e proprio cancro per la magistratura nel momento in cui alcuni magistrati hanno indagato sulle malefatte di destra e sinistra entrambi gli schieramenti politici tramite le correnti che in qualche modo pilotano hanno reagito cercando di ridurre al silenzio questi giudici
1673433 innanzitutto gi il fatto che la vicepresidenza del csm sia di nicola mancino a mio parere squalifica lorgano perch la ritengo una persona ambigua alla politica fa comodo che certe persone occupino le caselle giuste al momento giusto

1673493 if you dont have health insurance for everyone were never going to get out of this
1673494 has proposed a detailed plan to cover the uninsured pledging to have affordable coverage available for all americans by the end of his first term as president
1673495 the bottom line is he was not willing to go the distance with a universal health care plan i was drawing that distinction and i think its a fair one
1673496 he has a mandate to cover children he does not have any requirement for adults
1673497 he has said repeatedly that he is concerned about children well i cover both children and adults and i wanted to make the case today because i know this having done this for so many years that you can give your children health insurance but if the mother or the father whos the breadwinner cant get health insurance gets sick cant go to work the whole family suffers
1673498 inviting the belief that universal coverage can be achieved with relative ease and little pain
1673499 some enforcement mechanism will be required to achieve universal coverage
1673500 benefits of universal coverage for the whole far outweigh the plight of free riders
1673501 consensus among experts is that universal coverage will remain beyond reach without a mandate

1673545 it takes three days to get a jet ski license but akshay explained the time constraints he did a three day course in 12 hours he got up at 6 am and got his license by 7 pm he had to give a written and practical test the action scene we have shot is one of the most expensive ones that bollywood has ever seen and has been directed by danny baldwin
1673546 going through a theory and practical exam was like going back to school
1673547 when we went for a reece to australia we saw a lot of show reels and met a lot of technicians but we saw a clear synergy with danny as his style of action was exactly what we needed the beauty about the action in singh is kinng is that not only is it great to look at but makes the audience laugh as well
1673548 the technical problem is being worked upon but it is a time consuming process the prime focus people are working on it plus a lot of special effects are involved in our film our intention is to make a genuinely good film and we dont want to hurry up just because its the diwali week

1673552 wed have wrapped up billoo barber much earlier but shahrukh got busy with the ipl never mind it makes no difference to our film
1673553 only the climax of kuselan and billoo barber are the same otherwise they are two different films see like all rajnkanth starrers kuselan has been made to spotlight rajni as a larger than life icon i believe he enters the film riding a winged horse though my film also stars a superstar srk as a superstar ive nowhere tried to increase his role or heighten the impact of his presence im not that kind of a filmmaker in akshay kumar made his entry at interval point im making it very clear that irrfan khan and not shahrukh has the main role in billoo barber my film isnt a platform to glorify the mega star

1673556 my dad used to throw me in the deep end when i was only about three or four years old

1673559 its not impossible for a teenager win a medal in your first olympics
1673560 and thomas will know that because his fellow countryman david davies achieved just that in athens four years ago
1673561 but these olympics will be mainly about gaining experience for thomas who is a great prospect
1673562 this country has a great history in middle distance swimming and beijing for tom will be about taking in the atmosphere and gaining the valuable knowledge and experience before london in four years time
1673563 the team have played together in a number of games now theyve been doing very well and i believe in them
1673564 having golf an olympic sport is exponentially more important to the game of golf than the majors
1673565 the reason for that is it would bring in 168 different countries and their olympic foundation and all those revenues and that would be going toward the growth of the game
1673566 the majors are incredibly big as we know but we still capture the same audience that is already interested in the game
1673567 its for growing the game around the world and something we can all do together
1673568 the value for the players is that the more people that play around the world the more people will be watching theyll be paid back eventually
1673569 i want to watch the olympic sports where basically professionals arent playing
1673570 where that is the absolute pinnacle of their career and they had to wait four years for this one moment and they go out and they perform break a world record win a gold medal and they were able to perform on the spot
1673571 im not competing until next year so ive got another five months to kill
1673572 this one is more frustrating because im the two time defending champion
1673573 if you play in this country live in this country and you grow up in the heartland and you put on a russian uniform you are not a patriotic person in my mind
1673574 i stopped praying for god to put me on that u s team
1673575 and i just said show me very clearly where you want me to go what you want me to do open doors shut doors ill go whichever way you open
1673576 it was in my contract to say would you agree if such and such plays out you would play for our national team it wasnt until december or january of this year that i started seriously thinking about it
1673577 rather than starting with a core and working our way out we decided wed start with a larger national team be as inclusive as possible because of everyones overseas commitments then select the team closer to olympic time
1673578 our position is that she has every right to do exactly what she did
1673579 in her opinion she didnt have a shot to make our team so she went with the russian contract not every player was offered that opportunity i know it was a difficult decision for her
1673580 i wish i had the opportunity i wish i had been given the opportunity will you come play with us from usa basketball and russia saying well pay you 20 million to play for us and watch what decision i would have made watch i would have loved to have been given that opportunity that would just settle any money any patriotic dispute
1673581 the question should be altered slightly why isnt srk working with me any longer
1673582 money has never been an issue after all who wouldnt want to work shahrukh since he has his production company as well were open to co producing the film too but trust me we dont have a script yet
1673583 ive been itching to make a love story after making three back to back entertainers

1673713 what we have seen over the past few days has been a mix of improper disclosures of partial information mixed with inaccurate information and then drawn into unfounded conclusions none of that serves the victims their families or the public

1673726 when it came time for our pick we looked at our draft board and we just couldnt believe how much talent was left on there
1673727 sure andrew cashner was the top on our board but we thought there were so many good players left that it would be our best bet to just go ahead and take all of them
1673728 just moments before our pick got up to the podium cubs gm jim hendry realized that there were a bunch of great players of all ages around the world that we had omitted from our board we knew then that the right strategy was to take them all too
1673729 and at that point it didnt make much sense for us to take all the remaining players unless we were going to take all of the guys who had been selected before our pick so made sure to select them too i guess in the end what we did was wrong by some minor technicality
1673730 of course we were taken aback when we heard the cubs selection with the x overall pick the chicago cubs select all of the remaining players in the draft and the players already selected we were so shocked we didnt know what to do it was a live draft afterall so we let the pick stand for the time being

1673753 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory

1673838 sometimes when we lose ourselves in fear and despair in routine and constancy in hopelessness and tragedy we can thank god for bavarian sugar cookies and fortunately when there arent any cookies we can still find reassurance in a familiar hand on our skin or a kind and loving gesture or subtle encouragement or a loving embrace or an offer of comfort not to mention hospital gurneys and nose plugs an uneaten danish soft spoken secrets and fender stratocasters and maybe the occasional piece of fiction and we must remember that all these things the nuances the anomalies the subtleties which we assume only accessorize our days are effective for a much larger and nobler cause they are here to save our lives i know the idea seems strange but i also know that it just so happens to be true
1673839 now the dwelling of god is with men and he will live with them they will be his people and god himself will be with them and be their god he will wipe every tear from their eyes there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain for the old order of things has passed away

1673849 from last year and was blown away by the stoner rock taken to such long epic proportions
1673850 being a droning ambient track with windy passages an controlled feedback
1673851 moves to a darker instrumental song with jagged noise poking out
1673852 tends to faulter a little bit as the only track with distorted yelped vocals and some uninspired riffing that comes off feeling pointless with no direction
1673853 is the album closer and is a slower jam with crunching guitars and sandy singing this one is much more focused at closing the album up and sending the point home

1673856 the light sends wavelengths of blue violet light to the composite which triggers hardening
1673857 the light waves produce free radicals that activate the catalyst and speed up polymerization of the composite resin in oral cancer cells though those radicals cause damage that decreases cell growth and increases cell death
1673858 the decrease in cell growth combined with increased apoptosis helps explain why the tumours didnt grow as much because you have cells that arent dividing and you have cells that are committing suicide
1673859 one desirable feature weve observed with the blue light is that non cancerous cells appear unaffected at light doses that kill tumour cells
1673860 were thinking that some day blue light therapy may serve as an adjunct to conventional cancer therapy patients may therefore receive lower doses of chemotherapy which would decrease the adverse effects most cancer patients experience from standard chemotherapy regimens

1673871 no nation will allow its youth to go towards anti social activities like drugs and alcohol as they are the backbone of any country
1673872 pakistan should know that its citizens while visiting india always demand being served alcohol in their honor to drink how could pakistan claim that the people in india especially the youths are lost in drugs and alcohol its my urge to pakistan radio that it should not do this sort of anti india propaganda for the sake of better ties between the two neighbors in future
1673873 the new government of pakistan must check this anti india propaganda broadcasted on its official radio so that the mind of the young generations in both countries are not corrupted with hatred for each other
1673874 the congress party always seek peace harmony and brotherhood between india and pakistan the congress always wants to see punjabs growth as a happy and a lively state of bhangra and gidhaa dances

1673885 trotz unterschiedlicher auffassungen musste ich auch akzeptieren dass mein bruder ich und unsere familien nicht zu seiner zweiten hochzeit eingeladen waren
1673886 ich gebe zu dass mich diese vorgehensweise damals befremdet hat
1673887 der umgang mit ihrem tod war f r die familie eine riesige belastung da ein selbstmord immer zu viele fragen offen l sst
1673888 heute bin ich frei heute kann ich sagen ich bin ich ich bin walter kohl
1673889 kurz gesagt mein leben war in gro en phasen von ungerechtigkeiten und belastungen gepr gt denen mein bruder und ich machtlos gegen berstanden ich f hlte mich ob dieser erlebnisse und erfahrungen jahrelang innerlich tief verletzt und reagierte bis vor ein paar jahren mit zorn und wut das war ein fehler

1673898 meet jimmy hes 15 years old and he has just been introduced to the world of smoking hey jimmy how ya doing
1673899 listen jimmy today id like to talk to you about smoking
1673900 aw shucks im a growing adolescent young boy cant i just get a taste
1673901 of course you can jimmy after you enter the world of smokers
1673902 why its everyone who smokes jimmy theyre the happiest people ever but you must watch out for a certain kind of smoker the lighter stealer smoker
1673903 yes you see people who smoke and only smoke really dont do anything else soo they come up with games and one game is to steal as many lighters they can get their hands on sometimes its even unintentional and becomes a force of habit like nicotine craving except nicotine is good
1673904 indeed that is why you must buy the white lighter
1673905 the white lighter will never be stolen a white lighter is to smokers what a cross is to satanic beings started up by todd whitelighter he realized his lighters were always stolen white being his favorite lighter it went with his last name so there he began telling people that there was an ancient indian curse on all white lighters from then on no one touched his white lighter
1673906 he is a thirsty bugger who sulks and wilts if you dont water him every single day
1673907 why cant you just stick them in the corner and check on them now and again i thought nature was all about survival of the fittest its pathetic a plant giving up just because it hasnt had a drink for a while
1673908 well maybe they think sunlight and heat can seep through it more than a colored pattern lighter and will spontaniously explode or something
1673909 i use the cheap lighters my brother gives me for christmas
1673910 my billoo barber is not a vehicle to glorify shah rukh
1673911 it is just sad that people can do that kind of thing and get away with it

1673923 i was kind of hoping yeah good opportunity for personal growth your anomalies
1673924 easy to say why youd call it an anomaly but look at this
1673925 now we dont have the actual payload of course because that gets flushed but we have the checksum we have the username and look at this we have him typing 68 unspecified bytes in a pattern consistent with his biometrics five minutes and eight seconds prior to the injection so lets go ask him what his 68 characters where and why they got added to the securitats data stream
1673926 collected from the ventilation filters dna for every person on campus in a nice even gaussian distribution means we cant use biometrics to figure out who was in this room before it was cleaned out
1673927 now youve got an anomaly congrats lawrence personal growth awaits you
1673928 comes a fire we hit the panic button reverse the magnets lining the walls and the foundations destabilize at twenty sections the whole thingd come down in seconds but no ones going to sneak in or out that way
1673929 public record of course but pretty obscure too tempting to a certain prankster mindset
1673930 we keep the inside of the vestibule at 10 atmospheres and it opens inward from outside no one can force that door open without us knowing about it in a pretty dramatic way
1673931 youd be an idiot if you werent how long since youve been out
1673932 not since i came in sixteen years ago i was twenty one
1673933 yeah youd be an idiot if you werent nervous you follow politics
1673934 not your thing its probably time you got out into the wide world son you might ignore politics but it wont ignore you
1673935 always an option but not a smart one any weapon you dont know how to use belongs to your enemy just be circumspect listen before you talk watch before you act theyre good people out there but theyre in a bad bad situation
1673936 youre not making me very comfortable with all this you know
1673937 its an anomaly my first ive been waiting sixteen years for this someone poisoned the securitats data and left the campus im going to go ask him why he did it
1673938 you havent been outside in fifteen years its going to be a surprise just remember were a noble species all appearances to the contrary notwithstanding
1673939 you people are really something you know that you could have been killed let me tell you a few things about how the world works when you are approached by the securitat you stand still with your hands stretched straight out to either side you do not raise unidentified devices and point them at the officers not unless youre trying to commit suicide by cop is that what youre trying to do
1673940 and you do not photograph or log our security procedures theres a war on you know
1673941 oh for shits sake we should take you in now you know it tie up a dozen peoples day just to process you through the system you could end up in a cell for oh i dont know a month you want that
1673942 you didnt but you should have if youre going to come walking around here where the real people are you have to learn how to behave like a real person in the real world
1673943 if i were you i would turn right around walk through those gates and never come out again do i make myself clear
1673944 i used to change for the f train there every day when i was a kid
1673945 from the order of reflective analytics ive been out of the world for sixteen years until today in fact my name is lawrence
1673946 only every time theres an anomaly in the head count when the system says theres too many or too few people in the trains maybe once a week
1673947 you dont seem like a snitch lawrence but youre a monk are you going to turn me in for being suspicious
1673948 thats not what we hear come on theyre going to start shouting at us if we dont move
1673949 i was thinking id see about getting a room at the y or a backpackers hostel somewhere to stay until im done
1673950 im on a complicated errand trying to locate someone who used to be in the order
1673951 its a thing we do unravel mysteries it makes us better people
1673952 you think that i work for the securitat but youre inviting me into your home
1673953 i think youre a confused stranger who is apt to get himself into some trouble if someone doesnt take you in hand and help you get smart fast it doesnt cost me anything to lend a hand and you dont seem like the kind of guy whod mug rape and kill an old lady
1673954 is all about keeping track of the way that the world is and comparing it to your internal perceptions all the time
1673955 but it wasnt just food in the order we keep track of
1673956 so thats why ive stayed its empiricism its as old as newton as the enlightenment
1673957 im a screwup posy or at least i was we all were smart and motivated and promising but just a wretched person to be around angry bitter all those smarts turned on biting the heads off of the people who were dumb enough to care about me or employ me and so smart that i could talk myself into believing that it was all everyone elses fault the idiots it took instrumentation empiricism to get me to understand the patterns of my own life to master my life to become the person i wanted to be
1673958 well you seem like a perfectly nice young man now
1673959 i cant imagine someone whos so into measuring and understanding the world could possibly have missed it
1673960 we just do contract work for the securitat its just one of the ways the order sustains itself
1673961 but its all anonymized we dont snitch on people we report on anomalous events we do it for lots of different companies too not just the securitat
1673962 they took them away last week i dont know why you never know why you become a person of interest and they take you away and then later they always find a reason to keep you away
1673963 so if they always find a reason to keep you away doesnt that mean
1673964 were all guilty of something lawrence thats how the game is rigged look closely at anyones life and youll find what a little black marketeering a copyright infringement some cash economy business with unreported income something obscene in your internet use something in your bloodstream that shouldnt be there i bought that sofa from a cop lawrence bought it ten years ago when he was leaving the building he didnt give me a receipt and didnt collect tax and technically that makes us offenders
1673965 i overrode the governor on this ten minutes after they installed it
1673966 the people across the street they were pakistani or maybe sri lankan or bangladeshi
1673967 i once saw her reach for her change and her sleeve rode up and there was a number tattooed there there on her wrist
1673968 when they took her and her husband and their kids she stood at the window and pounded at it and screamed for help you could hear her from here
1673969 but what does it have to do with the order
1673970 for someone who is supposed to know himself youre not very good at connecting the dots
1673971 dont wait under this awning the police come if anyone waits under this awning for more than three minutes
1673972 its gerta boyo wanted to know how your anomaly was going
1673973 im at the sisters place and they dont want to talk to me
1673974 youre walking up to strangers and asking them about one of their neighbors huh
1673975 put it that way yeah ok i understand why this doesnt work but gerta i feel like rip van winkle here i keep putting my foot in it its so different
1673976 people are people lawrence every bad behavior and every good one lurks within us they were all there when you were in the world in different proportion with different triggers but all there you know yourself very well can you observe the people around you with the same keen attention
1673977 then youll get there eventually what youre in a hurry
1673978 dont give in to the agoraphobia lawrence hang in there you havent even heard my news yet and youre already ready to give up
1673979 the entry checkpoints lawrence you cannot do this job if youre going to spend four hours a day in security queues anyway the news
1673980 it wasnt the first time he did it ive been running the logs back three years and ive found at least a dozen streams that he tampered with each time he used a different technique this was the first time we caught him used some pretty subtle tripwires when he did it so hed know if anyone ever caught on must have spent his whole life living on edge waiting for that moment waiting to bug out must have been a hard life
1673981 you know that when the soviets pulled out of finland they found 40 kilometers of wire tapping wire in kgb headquarters the building was only 12 stories tall spying begets spying the worst most dangerous enemy the securitat has is the securitat
1673982 ok so it was a habit how do i find him no one in the sisters building will talk to me
1673983 you need to put them at their ease tell them the truth that often works
1673984 you know how people feel about the order out here
1673985 i dont know if the truth is going to work here
1673986 youve been in the order for sixteen years youre not just some fumble tongued outcast anymore go talk to them
1673987 go lawrence go youre a smart guy youll figure it out
1673988 im trying to find someone who used to live here
1673989 not used to how things are around here theres probably some way i could ask you this that would put you at your ease but i dont know what it is im not good with people but i really need to find this person she used to live here
1673990 basically though im a monk from the order of reflective analytics and one of our guys has disappeared his sister used to live here maybe she still does and i wanted to ask her if she knew where i could find him
1673991 let me guess none of my neighbors wanted to help you
1673992 youre only the second guy ive asked but yeah pretty much
1673993 out here in the real world we dont really talk about each other to strangers too much like being a snitch lucky for you my sisters in the order out in oregon so i know youre not all a bunch of snoops and stoolies whore you looking for
1673994 well yeah i can see why youd have a hard time with the neighbors when it comes to old anja she was well liked around here before she went
1673995 lawrence anja went middle of the night kind of thing no one heard a thing the cctvs stopped working that night nothing on the drive the next day no footage at all
1673996 they stopped delivering flyers to her door theres only one power stronger than direct marketing
1673997 thats what we figured nothing left in her place not a stick of furniture we dont talk about it much not the thing that it pays to take an interest in
1673998 listen i approve of what you people do in there more or less its good that theres a place for the people who know who dont have a place out here but the way you make your living i told my sister about this the last time she visited and she got very angry with me she didnt see the difference between watching yourself and being watched
1673999 well thats true enough we dont draw a really sharp distinction we all get to see one anothers stats it keeps us honest
1674000 brother antony why are you wasting your time collecting tin toys theyre badly made unlovely and represent at best a history of slave labor starting with your cherished made in occupied japan tanks christ why not collect rape camp macrame while youre at it
1674001 youre just flooding yourself with useless information trying to find the useful parts why not make some predictions about which part of your life you need to pay attention to rather than spying on every process youre a spy in your own body
1674002 what what i just took a little french leave jesus overreact much
1674003 my sister thought i was an idiot to go inside
1674004 im not very good at bullshitting and thats a vital skill in todays world she was better at it than me when she worked at it but she was the kind of person whod let her guard slip every now and then
1674005 my pan is going nuts may i put down my arms so i can tell it to let you in
1674006 i advise you to go home and forget about him
1674007 you need to adjust the settings on your pan it reads like its got something to hide here in the world it has to accede to lawful read attempts without hesitation will you configure it
1674008 look this is new york we all just want to get along here theres a lot of bad guys out there they got some kind of beef they want to fuck with us we dont want to let them do that you want to be safe here you got to show new york that youre not a bad guy that youre not here to fuck with us were the citys protectors and we can spot someone who doesnt belong here the way your body can spot a cold germ the way youre walking around here looking around acting i could tell you didnt belong from a hundred yards you want to avoid trouble you get less strange fast you get me
1674009 the what youre chasing arent you its your little rite of passage my sister had one last year figured out that some guy who travelled from fort worth to portland oregon every week was actually a fictional construct invented by cargo smugglers who used his seat to plant a series of mules running heroin and cash she was so proud afterwards that i couldnt get her to shut up about it you had the holy fire the other night when i saw you
1674010 its not really holy all that religious stuff its just a metaphor were not really spiritual
1674011 oh the distinction between the spiritual and the material is pretty arbitrary anyway dont worry i dont think youre a cultist or anything no more than any of us anyway so hows it going
1674012 dead end maybe ill get an easier anomaly next time
1674013 sounds awful i didnt think you were allowed to give up on anomalies
1674014 in a sense you could say that ive solved it i think the guy im looking for ended up with his sister
1674015 can you help me get these back into the dispenser
1674016 well i guess youll be going back to your campus now
1674017 i figured id see some new york first play tourist catch a broadway show
1674018 welcome to the half moon do you have a reservation
1674019 my weakness the worlds wool farmers would starve if it wasnt for me
1674020 oh its not any kind of restaurant at all private kitchen ormund he owns the place and cooks like a wizard he runs this little place off the books for his friends to eat in we come every wednesday thats his vegan night youd be amazed with what that guy can do with some greens and a sweet potato and the cacao nib and avocado chili chocolate is something else
1674021 everyone id like you to meet my guest for the evening
1674022 it was a very fine dinner you have interesting friends
1674023 she and i well we had a thing once shes a remarkable person of course youre a remarkable person too lawrence
1674024 youre smart we know that 88th percentile looks like you could go higher judging from the work weve evaluated for you i cant say as your performance as a private eye is very good though if i hadnt intervened youd still be standing outside anjas apartment building harassing her neighbors
1674025 you had every reason to believe that you were taking part in something illegal
1674026 everyone was treating me like a criminal from the minute i stepped out of the order you all treated me like a criminal that made me act like one everyone has to act like a criminal here thats the hypocrisy of the world that honest people end up acting like crooks because the world treats them like crooks
1674027 maybe we treat them like crooks because they act so crooked
1674028 you build a wall around the order dont you to keep us out because were barbarians to keep you in because youre too fragile what does that treatment do lawrence
1674029 the interrogation in this room flows in one direction lawrence this is not a dialogue
1674030 have you ever noticed that when youre uncomfortable with something you talk louder and lean forward a little a lot of people have that tell
1674031 i work with large amounts of data including a lot of material from the securitat its rarely in cleartext though mostly im doing sigint signals intelligence i analyze the timing frequency and length of different kinds of data to see if i can spot anomalies thats with a lower case a by the way
1674032 its the kind of thing that works best when you dont know whats in the payload of the data youre looking at that would just distract me its like a magicians trick with a rabbit or a glass of water you focus on the rabbit or on the water and what you expect of them and are flummoxed when the magician does something unexpected if he used pebbles though it might seem absolutely ordinary
1674033 no theres no way for me to know that the streams are enciphered at the router with his public key and rescrambled after hes done with them its all zero knowledge
1674034 well signals intelligence being what it is i was able to discover that it was a securitat stream and that it wasnt the first one hed worked on nor the first one hed altered
1674035 well you know honor among thieves rank hath its privileges
1674036 you just pick a skillset find someone with those skills and then figure out what that person is guilty of recruiting made simple
1674037 do you withhold medical attention until i give you what you want is that it
1674038 you seem to have it all figured out dont you
1674039 not all of it i dont know why you havent told me what it is you want yet that would have been simpler i think
1674040 i guess you could say that were just looking for the right way to ask you
1674041 the way to ask me a question that i cant say no to was it the sister is that what you had on him
1674042 he was useful because he was so eager to prove that he was smarter than everyone else
1674043 the system isnt going to go away no matter what we do the securitats here forever weve treated everyone like a criminal for too long really a criminal now if we dismantled tomorrow thered be chaos bombings murder sprees were not going anywhere

1674094 this is what microfluidics does best it enables smaller yet more powerful systems to be developed systems that may have been laboratory based can become more portable or even hand held and at the same time can have increased accuracy and repeatability
1674095 the real challenge with this project was the fusing of such large etched glass plates
1674096 aligning the plates to ensure the etched microchannels were perfectly matched took a great deal of experience and put our capabilities to quite a test
1674097 what exactly are cushions for then if theyre not for resting on

1674112 to make the needs of those least able to help themselves its number one priority
1674113 she wanted it really to be kept a secret for a long time
1674114 and i think women should because they should be able to announce what theyre having and when its time to make the announcement
1674115 all of these results will be compared to each other along with those of the mummy of king tutankhamun
1674116 we want to find out the truth and facts relevant to the history of these kings
1674117 it is doubtful that it could produce a scientific result to determine such important issues such as the linage of pharaohs
1674118 such announcements are good for publicity they sell well in the media
1674119 say youre watching the grammies and the dixie chicks are on
1674120 you have a consumer sitting at home watching when they win the award and they see an ad that says go to itunes now to download this song the consumer clicks the ok button and a link to that exact song is deposited into their itunes account or theyre watching oprahs book of the month club one click and that book is not only dropped into their web portal inbox but if theyve set it up through our web services it can be dropped into their personal amazon shopping cart its all about using a tv property to drive clicks to the internet
1674121 that construction has really caused a lot of the problems seen
1674122 i told my children its because theyre a big company at home depot nobody cares i said dont you people care the reason i got upset is mostly because are we not men cant we solve these problems these guys are letting mice beat them
1674123 its interesting that foreclosure deeds are falling off slightly given the ever increasing number of petitions to foreclose weve been seeing

1674130 do not be deceived your general shang is nothing more than a condemned criminal
1674131 remember how fond he was of his wine and women
1674132 by the order of his majesty the son of heaven and ruler of men justice is the guardian of order and peace on earth mans justice must be in line with heavens justice when justice is delayed it is abused it was heavens justice that shang did not die in battle but lived to lead zhao to victory so it must be mans justice now to make right the abuse of justice then which led shang to live when he should have not it is thus decreed that the magistrate be executed for the murder of the villager

1674134 the top five and top ten markets are always popular and the top twenty market for the majors has generated just as much interest as it gives customers a chance to back a player to perform well without ever really contending for the tournament
1674135 it is clear from our research that offshoring does contribute to changes in what is known as the skill mix but our findings also show that it results in increased turnover improved productivity more exports and higher employment plainly from an economy wide perspective activities that produce such results should be embraced rather than discouraged this study shows that offshoring is not to be feared it is something that should be welcomed and whose benefits are there to be exploited
1674136 do i actually need to hire anyone at all or can i just contract all this out to experts
1674137 we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year
1674138 the credit deterioration has largely been driven by the continued decline in home prices and other declines in regional economic conditions particularly in the north central southeast and west regions

1674140 if one were to adhere to historical accuracy all the way youd probably have the most boring two hours on earth but firstly its entertainment and weve taken license with history to make it more compelling

1674145 its pretty much how i say hello to everyone these days
1674146 we are equally pleased to be able to help support such an important local cause
1674147 this is a morale boosting donation from the scottish hydro
1674148 in forres there was huge support for this branch and the views of local people have been ignored under this crazy policy
1674149 hundreds of people made their views known and the campaign was heavily supported by the local press
1674150 but despite that post office ltd are pressing ahead with their closure plans to the detriment of the forres community
1674151 it makes the whole consultation a mockery and a sham
1674152 this was a no win situation for the east end post office from the very start and post office ltd should be ashamed of this whole debacle
1674153 if you ask me it was always a done deal
1674154 i was also disappointed that the post office had added large signs to the front of the west end post office before the end of the consultation
1674155 i dont blame the proprietor of the west end post office who is running a business
1674156 i am sure that it was a decision taken by post office limited to put the sign up there i think that was wrong
1674157 this in itself makes a mockery of the procedure and a member of the public had complained to the planning office about the signs being erected on a listed building
1674158 in my opinion the consultation was an expensive farce and the post office had already made up its mind as far as i am concerned they have effectively lost a customer in me
1674159 i am very sad and was quite shocked i didnt think all four moray offices which were earmarked for closure would go
1674160 a lot of customers have said how disappointed they are
1674161 im obviously disappointed to hear of the imminent closure of the east end post office
1674162 in spite of the support from the people of forres and the positive response to the consultation from the council it would appear that this decision was based purely on commercial grounds
1674163 jackies smiling and helpful attitude will be a sad loss to the post office im sure that the people of forres will support her in whatever she decides to do in the future i wish her well
1674164 we have considered very carefully all the comments made during the public consultation
1674165 we believe that the amended plan announced today offers our customers across the north east tayside and fife the best prospect for a sustainable network in the future bearing in mind the uk governments minimum access criteria and the other factors it has asked us to consider
1674166 when kirsty was diagnosed with this terrible disease we got in touch with the trust who offered endless support
1674167 and i was just prepared to take it as it came i had never played against bryan before but obviously i know what he is capable of
1674168 i played very steadily and was two under when we finished
1674169 the course was in great condition and the greens were as good as i have played on all season
1674170 and we arrived at the turn all square darren birdied the fifth but i hit back with a birdie at the long sixth darren birdied the10 and won 11 with a par but i got it back to one with a birdie at 12
1674171 darren played really well and didnt look like making a bogey i just didnt make enough birdies i suppose
1674172 i am sick and tired of you not living up to your potential

1674197 technically it should be but they cant police the internet not everyone the way i see it though its just there the movie for example is just there for the taking if we dont take it somebody else will
1674198 i dont think movie night will be of any help anyway

1674307 why try to pump up the housing market anyway house prices are falling because they reached absurd heights even after an 8 per cent fall over the past 12 months they are trading at around seven times average earnings when banks were keen to lend mortgages of six times a borrowers salary these prices were just about affordable now that banks have reverted to more traditional lending practices a decade ago most were prepared to lend a maximum of three times a borrowers earnings there is a huge gap between asking prices and what buyers can actually afford freeing buyers from having to pay stamp duty which is levied at rates varying from 1 per cent on a 125 000 home and 4 per cent on a 500 000 property will make scant difference in a market that is still probably overvalued by a third there is just one effect that the government will have achieved by leaking the suggestion of a stamp duty holiday the few people who are in a position to buy will now be tempted to put off their purchases until the government makes a proper announcement on stamp duty perhaps in september expect house sales figures for august to be the gloomiest yet

1674382 there must be a pony in here somewhere the aol time warner debacle and the quest for a digital future
1674383 he had been getting a pounding and he did not see a way to turn it around
1674384 executives and shareholders are united in more or less open revolt
1674385 most of all time warner executives have turned their ire specifically at one man mr pittman a former america online executive who became chief operating officer after the merger
1674386 he angered many time warner executives with what they called his brusque manner he developed a reputation for brashness ruthlessness and success at america online and he applied the same tactics at time warner on his return
1674387 now many executives from the former time warner wish the merger would go away and barring that they wish that mr pittman would
1674388 people get angry and that anger has to be attached to something or someone
1674389 some of it has been attached to bob and i am not sure if it is entirely fair
1674390 pittman left on own steam but he knew what was coming
1674391 he was a straight talker in a culture of bullshit and platitudes
1674392 he thought growing at five percent a year was a great accomplishment
1674393 he was not exactly the kind of person who welcomed us
1674394 we all used to assume he would eventually be the boss
1674395 he had this air of the inevitable about him that was very appealing
1674396 ive decided that after a new ceo is in place at aol i wont return to aol time warner as chief operating officer
1674397 having worked so hard to build the aol service and brand and after then going through the merger and the last 18 months its time to take a break
1674398 of course taking it out on the guy who outsmarted you does not in turn make you smart
1674399 pittman doesnt hang around a disaster area this is show business if the show flops you close it onward and upward
1674400 is this the unemployed mr pittman because this is the unemployed mr kimsey

1674415 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1674416 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
1674417 the era of u s funded major infrastructure projects is over
1674418 accurately highlights that iraqs revenues have grown substantially in recent years
1674419 still needs to improve the speed and effectiveness of its budget execution and the transparency of its budgeting and accounting practices

1674428 after one president in the pocket of the oil companies we cant afford another
1674429 remember that when george bush took office he had an energy policy he turned to dick cheney and he told cheney go take care of this
1674430 obama told a crowd at a gym in youngstown ohio
1674431 john mccains taking a page out of the bush cheney playbook
1674432 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it senator obama voted for it
1674433 people care not only what you say but how you vote
1674434 his schedule hasnt been set for next week let alone next month
1674435 americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened
1674436 we essentially traded strong growth now for weak growth later

1674438 without the stimulus package this would have been a very standard u shaped recession
1674439 what the stimulus did was put a bump into the middle of it turning a u into a w

1674444 this is not the time for a prolonged veto fight although were confident that the president would prevail in one
1674445 but with congress scheduled to leave soon for yet another recess the risk of not having a bill until the middle of september is not a risk worth taking in the current environment
1674446 i would be very disappointed if having helped us formulate this they dont take advantage of it
1674447 we said you have to protect the taxpayer but how you do it is up to you

1674500 when it comes to energy independence the answer is no
1674501 its time for renewable fuels like sugarcane ethanol that can reduce oil and gasoline prices
1674502 america is at a crossroads and faces a choice we can continue our dependence on foreign oil or diversify and promote renewable biofuels like sugarcane ethanol
1674503 that drives up prices and keeps us dependent on foreign oil

1674508 the administrator has said it was his decision and his alone
1674509 you dont just wake up and say this is the decision
1674510 raises serious concerns about the account of events provided to the committee including statements by administrator johnson
1674511 jason burnett was part of making these policies when he was at epa he did not have the conscience hes expressing now this green conscience
1674512 i think everyone concedes that if jason burnett was the administrator he would have taken a different route
1674513 i wish i could say burnetts testimony is important in the development of policy
1674514 if they raise interest rates that might slow economic growth which is already fragile and if they lower rates or hold constant theres a danger of inflation accelerating

1674521 je ne peux accepter ce raisonnement selon lequel il est logique que mladic se trouve en serbie dans la mesure o karadzic sy trouvait
1674522 nous naffirmons pas quil ne sy trouve pas mais pour avancer une telle affirmation vous vous devez de disposer de certains l ments conduisant sa cache le reste est sp culation

1674538 at country inns amp suites were providing what business travelers really need to be productive and were doing it in a comfortable and cozy environment
1674539 our customer research found that a comfortable bed and reliable high speed internet tied for the amenities that business travelers want most from their hotel with our good for business package were also offering a book on cd or a downloadable audiobook so travelers can take a break from business and receive some enjoyment from their time on the road
1674540 we wanted to offer teens and their parents a fun and unique online experience that allows them to interact with our brand and talk about our stores
1674541 the back to school shopping season is one of the most important times of the year for our retailers so it was our goal to show how they are forward thinking when it comes to current trends and fashions
1674542 teens can have a lot of fun with the site and technology as well as connect in ways that are intuitive to them
1674543 but it was essential for the site to also highlight current back to school trends and taubman retailers to encourage teens and their parents to visit a store they might not otherwise visit while shopping for school
1674544 this is what microfluidics does best it enables smaller yet more powerful systems to be developed systems that may have been laboratory based can become more portable or even hand held and at the same time can have increased accuracy and repeatability
1674545 patients are tired of waiting for national drug safety and healthcare it initiatives to take shape
1674546 consumers dont want to be drug experts wading through layers of online information to get to what relates to them or managing complex medical records systems in order to stay informed most patients simply want to be told when they need to watch out so they can get on with their lives
1674547 i registered all my medicines on iguard and to my surprise i got an alert about a possible adverse interaction that neither my doctor nor my pharmacist were aware of
1674548 i was surprised at how easily iguard works when i get a safety alert from iguard i know its important and pertinent to my medications and me
1674549 the big concern is the number of potential adverse drug interactions especially when people receive prescriptions from multiple physicians and take supplements
1674550 the public is clearly hungry for information about the drugs that are being prescribed for them and what kind of side effects or adverse drug interactions these drugs may have they want to be kept informed as knowledge evolves iguard provides patient driven service that offers timely accurate and personalized drug safety information for patients and their physicians
1674551 the decorating trend today is all about shine and sparkle

1674554 technological advances have allowed us to explore oil offshore in ways that protect the environment
1674555 could produce enough oil to match americas current production for almost 10 years
1674556 the american people are saying loud and clear there is no ambiguity about it they want us to do something about it and they understand the laws of supply and demand
1674557 we need to take action now to expand domestic oil production
1674558 with this action the executive branchs restrictions on this exploration have been cleared away this means that the only thing standing between the american people and these vast oil resources is action from the u s congress
1674559 people who tell us that the solution to our problem is drilling offshore are peddling our addiction
1674560 the drug is oil and they dont want us to get off it
1674561 would merely prolong the failed energy policies we have seen from washington for 30 years
1674562 if we can show that we have significant oil reserves off our coasts that will clearly affect the futures market and affect the price of oil
1674563 someday this capitalistic economy or what we used to call the capitalistic system needs to get back on track and that means failure
1674564 they argued that this increase in regulation should be on the next presidents record
1674565 the administration didnt want to show a high dollar value for reducing carbon
1674566 hes been incredibly open to our ideas which has been a huge surprise coming from a key appointee from the bush white house
1674567 whether for good or for bad its going to happen eventually because the sec is being overcome by a tsunami of globalization
1674568 if you believe you should pay more taxes i am the wrong candidate for you senator obama is your man
1674569 the choice in this election is stark and simple senator obama will raise your taxes i wont i will cut them where i can jobs are the most important thing our economy creates when you raise taxes in a bad economy you eliminate jobs im not going to let that happen
1674570 are very much the same as those we have seen from the bush administration
1674571 from the standpoint of the democratic party i would think it would make the most sense to leave it alone
1674572 so if we arrest someone whos a german national and we take his fingerprints we do have the opportunity to send those fingerprints to germany to say do you know anything about this person
1674573 said stewart a baker assistant secretary for policy at the
1674574 european governments are entering into these agreements much more readily than they were four five years ago because concerns about terrorism are no longer confined to one side of the atlantic
1674575 we seem to be opening the floodgates left right and center
1674576 it seems to me there are hardly any restrictions left
1674577 personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin political opinion or religious or other beliefs trade union membership or information concerning health and sexual life
1674578 any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person
1674579 recognizing the special sensitivity of the above categories of personal data shall take suitable safeguards in particular appropriate security measures in order to protect such data
1674580 which data are of concern is not really completely clear second who are the competent authorities on the u s side third and most important there is a lack of independent supervision in the united states over data protection
1674581 its all well and good to say the estonian government will provide a right of access and redress but under what circumstances is an american citizen going to know that the estonian government has even received his information
1674582 while the arctic is melting the g 8 are postponing action instead of climate protection the world got nothing but flowery words
1674583 we know very well that there are many countries in the g 8 grouping that share our ambitious expectations and therefore it is regrettable that the lowest common denominator in the g 8 determined the level of ambition
1674584 the bateman group not only won our business they truly earned it
1674585 they earned it by being more perceptive thoughtful responsive and detail oriented than the competition throughout the entire review process the bateman team clearly has the combination of experience initiative and creativity we need to take passenger to undisputed leadership in this market and more importantly keep us there
1674586 passenger is quite literally changing the way companies connect with their various stakeholders across social geographic and organizational boundaries
1674587 we feel this is one of those rare opportunities the right company with the right technology at the right time in the market passenger is destined to become the definitive brand in their category and were looking forward to the ride
1674588 animoto for education is a true benefit for teachers and students and gives educators a brand new entertaining and powerful way to illustrate classroom projects field trips lessons and more
1674589 the members of the discovery educator network have profited from the creativity and generosity of animoto for education and we really appreciate the gift of unlimited access
1674590 its been really exciting to hear from teachers all over the world about the variety of ways theyve incorporated animoto videos into their daily lesson plans
1674591 animoto for education is our gift to teachers we want to help empower them with a tool to reach their kids in a new and exciting way
1674592 weve used animoto to create opening montages for parents nights advocacy videos to promote school libraries at our state capitol introductions at orientation activities and capturing memories of professional conferences
1674593 animoto is a great addition to a schools digital storytelling toolkit

1674595 members recognize this is going to be a critical election theres potential for dramatic change in the senate and the house and the presidency so both sides arent willing to give an inch on messaging
1674596 a group of republican senators followed the direction of the bush administration and voted to protect health insurance companies at the expense of americas seniors disabled and military families
1674597 these senators leave for their 4th of july picnics knowing that the most vulnerable americans are at risk because of the senates inability to act
1674598 the bottom line is the u s is trying to give the impression in europe that theres a simple well established process for records access that any european can avail themselves of
1674599 but as this lawsuit shows its a difficult time consuming process that might ultimately not result in anything being obtained
1674600 i dont expect to find anything specific in the files
1674601 but i am entitled to know what is in them
1674602 there must be something if im traveling in and out of the united states
1674603 given the need to protect against the possibility and the disruptive cost to the legal system of awards that are unpredictable and unnecessary either for deterrence or for measured retribution we consider that a 1 1 ratio is a fair upper limit in such maritime cases
1674604 in light of exxons decision to permit a lapsed alcoholic to command a supertanker carrying tens of millions of gallons of crude oil through the treacherous waters of prince william sound thereby endangering all of the individuals who depended upon the sound for their livelihoods the jury could reasonably have given expression to its moral condemnation of exxons conduct in the form of this award
1674605 we know this has been a very difficult time for everyone involved we have worked hard over many years to address the impacts of the spill and to prevent such accidents from happening in our company again
1674606 todays ruling adds insult to injury to the fishermen communities and alaska natives who have been waiting nearly 20 years for proper compensation following the worst environmental disaster in our nations history
1674607 we continue to stand by our previous statements that the u
1674608 tell a different story about the role of administration officials
1674609 there was no communication to me or in my presence made by any of the 9 state department officials with whom i met that hunt should not pursue our course of action leading to a contract in fact there was ample opportunity to do so but it did not happen
1674610 asked about concerns over potential conflicts between the recently passed krg hydrocarbon law and an sic national law he said the significant opportunity outweighs the legal ambiguity
1674611 thanks for the heads up getting an american company to sign a deal with the krg will make big news back here please keep us posted
1674612 our embassy also expressed concern about it i knew nothing about the deal
1674613 i need to know exactly how it happened to the extent that it does undermine the ability for the government to come up with a oil revenue sharing plan that unifies the country obviously im if it undermines that im concerned
1674614 the conditions are really tough with the pollution and its really hot we dont have too many days to adapt so i hope to be much better than today
1674615 it is very hot and very humid and the sun isnt even out yet so im sure it will probably only get worse from here
1674616 it is unpredictable and probably the hottest conditions we are going to play in all year
1674617 ive been in china seven or eight times im very used to playing in the heat and experiencing the thick air
1674618 tennis players are used to experiencing so many things its just something that you have to get on board with and work around
1674619 i had a hit out there today the smog didnt worry me i think the heat and humidity will cause more of a problem but i like to play in these conditions
1674620 we already just came from cincinnati but here its really hot its really humid
1674621 because the weather in spain is so hot i think the spanish players will be in better condition physically and that will be an advantage
1674622 the following changes have been made to the entry list for the 2008 olympic tennis event
1674623 a 12 computer of sorts a cheap keyboard and nintendo like console already exists in india where people hook the devices to home tvs to run simple games and programs
1674624 hit on the idea of upgrading the devices 1980s era technology
1674625 never before in an elections has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it
1674626 i think it is wrong to allow adoptions of children by gay and lesbian couples it sends a wrong message early to a child during formative years thats hard to overcome just by sitting down and talking to them
1674627 i think lesbianism and homosexuality is morally wrong the law is supposed to discriminate sometimes in some respects it is supposed to discriminate against social order and anarchy
1674628 in order to produce software that is fit for purpose and acceptable to society software developers must effectively address not only the technological challenges but also the ethical challenges
1674629 i am a wine freak i love a good zinfandel and there is a small vintner named dover canyon that makes some of the best wine on the planet
1674630 these wines could convert zinfandel naysayers by demonstrating that high alcohol and fruit can be present but not overshadow the wines other charms most dishes on the table will benefit from its seamless style and red cherry acidity
1674631 this is an individualistic wine with something to say and most will find the conversation very pleasing
1674632 you can take some substantial pride in having one of the very few winery blogs crossing over into mainstream popularity
1674633 in particular would like to point out dover canyon winery as they have a great blog
1674634 im quite willing to wait a while for one of dover canyons stories

1674637 we are delighted that fitch ratings has affirmed our rating and noted our strong performance this is the third rating agency to affirm lloyds rating in recent weeks all of which mentioned the quality of lloyds management of the market
1674638 from a rating perspective we view positively the many initiatives undertaken by fpd such as the issuance of underwriting guidelines review of syndicates business plans development of various benchmarking tools and oversight of the new entrants process
1674639 im dissatisfied because when youre 2 0 up you expect three points
1674640 the penalty gave us a lot of encouragement and cheered the team up
1674641 they have problems finishing and we knew they would need 10 chances to score three goals
1674642 the turning point in the revival of national pride and patriotism after the end of the cultural revolution
1674643 at that time china wasnt opened to the world that much since then the chinese people believed we could do better not only in sports to connect with the world that is even more meaningful than sports
1674644 the fairways are contoured the bunkers are deep in the landing areas the green complexes are quite challenging and exciting and have so much movement they can be scary
1674645 that has been our philosophy not to get in the way
1674646 we want to allow the players to show their skills and let them identify who the best player is by making it fair challenging while allowing a variety of shots
1674647 i played augusta this year for the first time and torrey pines and the u s open but those dont even come close to how hard oakland hills will play
1674648 i played it last year for the british open qualifier and in my mind it was the toughest golf course i had ever played and i still believe that
1674649 i thought it was the hardest golf course on earth
1674650 i think itll be very good im looking forward to it im sure the rough is going to be thick the course is really long a lot of undulations cantered fairways its going to be a hard track
1674651 they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 percent committed
1674652 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it
1674653 so they can say they welcome me back but come on the way theyve treated me tells you the truth
1674654 the he said she said thing definitely took a toll on brett theres no doubt about it we both agreed on this we both wish things had been handled differently but thats the spot that were in
1674655 the one thing i was looking for out of that conversation was was he ready committed to play football for the green bay packers
1674656 his mind set based on things that have happened through this whole course thats not where he was so with that we didnt really move ahead
1674657 i dont require hair appointments i actually cut my own hair thats why its always the same length i dont like divas and i dont want to be one
1674658 i find it interesting i think maybe because of where i come from and some of the people im associated with people have a perception that i might be that way

1674753 identity theft is the 1 crime in america today even ahead of murder
1674754 do you have an email i can simply send you a description of whats going on with all the correspondence including email headers for tracing
1674755 call the bank and the credit card company first to dispute the charges and get the ball rolling more than likely the bank and credit card company will want a police report case number that would be step two police report by state law in california on any type of i d theft or certain financial crimes any police department is required to take the case some larger agencies lapd is a great example like to tell people they need to go where the crime occurred this is not only impossible in most cases as the suspects can be several states away but also in violation of the state reporting laws if this happens ask for a watch commander and explain the issue to them once a report is taken unless there are good leads then nothing will happen sorry to be blunt but if there are no leads then the case is dead in the water most of these frauds are so old by the time people figure out they have been scammed the suspects are long gone keep in mind that credit card companies and banks hate working with the police and most often times flat out refuse to give us any help they would rather write off the loss than have one of their internal investigators help us it is very frustrating
1674756 no ring per se but most scams come out the lagos nigeria area
1674757 the first thing is to call the bank and dispute the charge
1674758 its rare that they actually come for the wines or whatever the goods are what they are most interested in is the shipping money that is why they charge so much hard goods wine etc are hard to pawn and sell money is all done by electronic transfers and easy to deal with if someone does pick up the wine or its delivered to an address that gives detectives something to follow up on a good thing once the suspects get the wine it is often sold wherever they can sell it to make money again once sold the money is split with the ring leaders out of country or not as sometimes its not a nigerian scam just someone here in the states
1674759 tons look at all the spam emails you get those are almost all scammers scary huh you would be amazed at how many people fall victim to them they are almost impossible to find and arrest which is why there are so many internet scammers

1674781 it was sunday late afternoon and i wasnt sure what i was in the mood for but it was definitely a big red
1674782 and to drink were currently enjoying a 2004 dover canyon viognier of all the white wines we brought back from california this one has held up the best and remains a really lovely viognier it begins strong with the flavor of pears and seems almost like it might be too sweet but then it turns into a crisp citrusy flavor and ends on dry note that lingers quietly on your tastebuds like dew i highly recommend this winery if you ever find stuff by them which is highly doubtful unless you go to their website as it is a very small family run winery lovely stuff though

1674985 while a lot of people might think of soils as being inanimate
1674986 i think of soils as living because of the integration of the mineral with the organic material which includes microbes roots decomposing leaves soils are the skin of the earth they have pores

1675051 i am hoping to intrigue those who want wines that truly have a story to tell once people experience these wines and winemakers once they know that wine truly does have soul and character it will be difficult for them to cozy up to wines made by the numbers and not from the heart
1675052 the taste of biodynamic and organic and natural is one that appeals to a whole slew of people the taste of the other kind of wine one that i view more as a beverage than an art appeals to another group shouldnt both kinds of winemaking be taught
1675053 you cant be accepted to the yale drama school if you dont have some sort of inner artistic fire
1675054 every other winery i had visited had finished fermentation but here fermentation stopped when the wine wanted it to not when the winemaker stopped it
1675055 modern wine folk like fast ferments a week maybe two weeks at most
1675056 i am no winemaker but i wondered didnt they know that those barrels could also make wine extremely bitter
1675057 parker said the wine had early maturity meaning it got old before its time
1675058 super duper that is an andrea immer robinson term not mine
1675059 after her observation that we often enjoy the taste of a natural product more i cant help but wonder if it were strawberries or tomatoes or donuts which would we enjoy more the worm infested product of a pot smoking earth muffin who took a class in natural baking and gardening or the product of a student who mastered the science and techniques of baking or gardening and made an informed choice to produce a pure healthy product
1675060 as californians we probably find it odd that she so readily condemns most california wine as
1675061 the history of grape growing and its spread throughout the world along with discussions of current viticultural practices in different parts of the world
1675062 here they are this is what they do you decide which if any you will use to achieve your goals
1675063 might mary have been a little touchy after reading my piece on disliking california wines like a few others i think she based her reviews on reading the index and selected page i certainly ticked her off

1675065 pasadena calif nasa scientists have concluded that at least one of the large lakes observed on saturns moon titan contains liquid hydrocarbons and have positively identified the presence of ethane
1675066 any form of hydrocarbon extraction from any moon of a ringed planet
1675067 the risks are just too high oil companies might have even larger profits conservation will be discouraged this is another cruel distraction stage managed by the failed georgebush administration

1675069 no further exploration of extraterrestrial sources should be allowed we must know who authorized the use of nasa for prospecting
1675070 this has dick cheneys oily fingerprints all over it look for halliburton to get an enormous contract
1675071 i will be willing to enter talks with the grand titan with no preconditions
1675072 the observations also suggest the lake is evaporating it is ringed by a dark beach where the black lake merges with the bright shoreline

1675082 intel is projecting that by 2011 the market for the netbooks will be 40 million units a year which is why intel is jumping in with low powered chips that would be used in the netbooks and the net tops intel executives think the market for low cost pcs is too big to pass up though it does raise a potential threat to more powerful and more profitable computing lines
1675083 microsoft has been a reluctant participant too even though it is no longer selling its windows xp operating system software it made an exception for makers of these low cost laptops and desktops microsoft said it was responding to a groundswell of consumer interest in the low cost machines but some makers of those machines say microsoft did so reluctantly because it did not want to lose market share to linux
1675084 why should we participate in cratering the margins of a profitable business
1675085 because its going to happen anyway and well be better off leading rather than following

1675087 america is blessed with the worlds greatest wind power corridor and abundant reserves of clean natural gas
1675088 the plan calls for building new wind generation facilities that will produce 20 of our nations electricity and allow us to use natural gas as a transportation fuel the combination of these domestic energies can replace more than one third of our foreign oil imports and we can do it all in 10 years
1675089 this plan dramatically reduces our dependence on foreign oil and lowers the cost of transportation it invests in the heartland creating thousands of new jobs it substantially reduces americas carbon footprint and uses existing proven technology it will be accomplished
1675090 the future begins as soon as congress and the president act the government must mandate the formation of wind and solar transmission corridors and renew the subsidies emphasis added for economic and alternative energy development in areas where the wind and sun are abundant

1675141 it was a sexy ad really designed for the u s market it was positive and it was supposed to be done in a private function room
1675142 im surprised they were so concerned given weve done similar with asian celebrities in the past
1675143 to exercise extreme caution to assure their safety they should remain at home or where they are for the rest of the day
1675144 i hope this brings you the closure that you seek
1675145 its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas
1675146 its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law
1675147 were concerned for the precedent that the execution may create for the rights of mexican nationals who may be detained in that country
1675148 state and federal courts on three separate occasions have already satisfied the world courts suggestion that american courts examine whether medellin suffered actual legal harm when authorities did not inform him about certain rights under the vienna convention
1675149 on all three occasions state and federal courts concluded that medellin suffered no legal harm
1675150 i figured once they gave me a visa i wouldnt imagine they wouldnt allow me to come in later that was a big shock i wasnt expecting to get a call the evening before i was leaving for beijing
1675151 ive been pretty unimpressed with the iocs efforts in protecting athletes for giving them any options
1675152 visa applications from non accredited persons do not fall within the iocs remit and we are therefore not best placed to answer you on this question
1675153 but its between this government and joey as a private citizen
1675154 i dont begrudge them the olympics i think theyll do well with them
1675155 but there are so many of their governments policies that i find repulsive especially for athletes who have no intention but to help someone else
1675156 decided they arent going to hire anyone at this time because of the current economic situation but if things turn around soon ill be tops on their list

1675163 if we had one appointee brought to us today instead of five youd be getting a positive vote from me
1675164 this is the third time ive attempted to make appointments the first two times they were denied for another wealth of different reasons
1675165 these five appointees have lived here in this community for years and they can be engaged on day one to make effective decisions
1675166 oh my lord yes we grew up there thats where we danced
1675167 when i was a teenager i attended all those dances there
1675168 there are so many ingredients out here for making the brightest future possible and all weve got to do is have a little nudge
1675169 a little nudge that will cause it to all come together into a corridor across this central gulf coast that will make this thing go gangbusters

1675182 on february 5 2004 as part of its ongoing program review at the uop the doe sent apollo a program review report that preliminarily found that the uop had violated doe regulations apollo was not required to immediately disclose the report and it chose not to do so but on six different occasions thereafter between february 27 2004 and september 7 2004 apollo misrepresented the actual state of affairs surrounding the program review by making public statements at odds with the existence and contents of the doe report on september 14 and 15 2004 the contents of the doe report were widely disseminated for the first time through various newspapers articles including articles in the wall street journal the arizona republic and the chicago tribune the market did not react to the disclosure of this news in any significant way five days later the flynn reports were issued these reports downgraded apollos stock for various reasons some of which pabf argued at trial were necessary to reveal the truth of apollos prior misrepresentations apollos stock price fell significantly thereafter
1675183 that a corrective disclosure caused the stock price to decline
1675184 a corrective disclosure is a disclosure that reveals the fraud or at least some aspect of the fraud to the market
1675185 a disclosure that does not reveal anything new to the market is by definition not corrective
1675186 the evidence at trial undercut all bases on which plaintiff claimed the flynn reports were corrective
1675187 misled the market in various ways concerning the doe program review
1675188 failed to prove that apollos actions caused investors to suffer any harm
1675189 a market analysts opinion which is all the flynn reports were is not and never can be a corrective disclosure

1675193 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1675194 stamp duty is always a factor when people buy and sell houses but we need to make sure that we support the financial system too
1675195 despite the doom and gloom about the current economy there are still high volumes of people moving to london and relocating here

1675202 eco cars arent necessarily cheap to repair and every car has a grouping between one and 50
1675203 its just the case that smaller cars which therefore give out less pollution are automatically going to be cheaper to insure
1675204 they want to do more adventurous things and they do so
1675205 and a lot of them are quite bored just sitting on a beach and they want to do something adventurous
1675206 but people are prepared to take the risk of not buying
1675207 home based businesses are growing at a rapid rate so it is increasingly important that small business owners have a clear understanding of what they should be covered for and the type of insurance that they need
1675208 the credit squeeze has had an impact on the main residential mortgage completions down on the equivalent period in 2007
1675209 in prime regional markets prices have generally been more robust with small falls of 0 5 per cent in the first quarter of 2008
1675210 the real issue is the collapse in the number of housing transactions

1675216 i just want to say that president mwanawasas illness has brought both sadness and joy
1675217 sadness in the sense that he is a leader of our nation and at a personal level he is a leader of our family he is a husband father and uncle he is also a friend to so many people in zambia and beyond our borders
1675218 his presidency has put zambia to where it was shortly after independence in terms of good governance transparency and accountability he has created a new breed of leadership in our country in short zambia has become an icon on the continent
1675219 his illness brings joy in the sense that people have become more united than ever before
1675220 it is unprecedented that in the whole country regardless of age or gender people have prayed and have continued to pray for the recovery of president mwanawasa
1675221 this has helped the family to cope with the challenge that we face at the moment i want to say that on behalf of the family we are very grateful for the love that has been shown to president mwanawasa during this trying moment
1675222 i would like to urge all zambians to continue praying because this is also testing the faith of our country since we are a christian nation i also want to say that god has got his own way and time of answering our prayers
1675223 i can only say that the government is responsible to report on the health of the president and this they have done adequately he is the president of the country so government is responsible to report on his health
1675224 all i can say is that the president is making satisfactory progress we are grateful to the government of france for receiving him in their military hospital and the doctors and nurses are looking after him very well the president is responding to treatment that is all i can say
1675225 during this period that president mwanawasa is unwell we hope that the unity that has been shown by zambians can transcend through our party structures can transcend through the government systems as a reflection for the respect and love that we have for the president
1675226 one hopes that through that unity love and respect all organs that are mandated to govern our country should be able to carry on what they are supposed to do even if president mwanawasa is not physically at home the party and the government have got established structures of how work should be done they should do it for him so that when he comes back home he will be very proud to see that the party and the government have been able to continue with the work in his absence

1675240 where that relationship is going its a new type of thing for the show
1675241 ill say this i dont think clark has had the opportunity to have a friend like davis and likewise i cant get any more vague than that can i theyre going to have a very unique buddy buddy friendship that sounds weird too doesnt it i cant talk about it man i really cant its a really awesome idea though
1675242 seth talks about diet and working out with a trainer to get ready to play brit he ended the segment by doing a running dive 17 feet across a swimming pool set up on 53rd street while wearing a black business suit and tie seth lost his glasses during the stunt but managed to come in fourth in the purina diving competition for dogs it was a cool segment and it looks like hes already lost some weight
1675243 and it keeps getting postponed and each time it gets postponed the chances of it getting made seem to decrease its never been officially over so theres always that in a heartbeat i would drop whatever i had going on to do that that movie and what i get to do in it is like nothing ive ever seen or would ever get a chance to do again
1675244 knowing that we were doing a slightly more comic take on batman for this and when i say that its not that were doing spongebob or pinky and the brain or smurfs we are making a batman cartoon but within that we are allowing batman to have a sense of humor and for some of the other characters to have a sense of humor to laugh at the situation which is not really what weve done in the past at all with the specific character of batman
1675245 theres no reason why we necessarily have to use the same three or four that are still around
1675246 i mean batmans got a wide variety a rogues gallery certainly we used two in the first movie that hadnt been in the films before its really up to chris to decide and he has not decided whether or not he wants to go back to the well again
1675247 after everything that went into the first film its important to make sure that nothing is rushed and we come out with a fantastic second film
1675248 what do you mean your sisters dating somebody who works for warner brothers
1675249 id fire a third of the editors and convert another third of them to being reporters and give them a laptop
1675250 i dont want to see you in the newsroom unless your editor or i summon you
1675251 because all the reporters and editors are college graduates and have been making a good living for a good number of years they all live in upscale portions of the metro area which will limit the news that gets reported
1675252 they would be much more concerned about why their johnny cant read and why his classroom has 39 kids one teacher and no aide or why their street never gets swept nor the snow removed in short we would start reporting news that is relevant to my readers
1675253 what do i do with all this news put it on my web site as a zone section

1675267 we are making it clear to china that being a global economic leader carries with it the duty to act responsibly on matters from energy to the environment to development in africa
1675268 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings so america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1675269 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential

1675276 i am appealing to you as a fellow human being to work with us if possible include us and to remember that we are madeleines parents and have needs
1675277 lack of communication and a void of information particularly as the parent of a missing child is torture
1675278 she is not my mummy she is a stranger she took me from my mummy
1675279 if it was madeleine it was a disgrace that it was not passed on
1675280 parts of it he acknowledged were quite realistic but then he felt it turned into something that was completely untrue for someone who was actually there that was upsetting
1675281 he wasnt the greatest admirer of americans and it didnt go down too easily that one of them should be playing the starring role
1675282 he felt angry more than angry that hitler had 50 of the 76 escapees shot and my father was friends with seven of them

1675292 this study illustrates the impact flossing can have on oral health the twins experimental model is a powerful tool to help sort out genetic and environmental factors that often confound the interpretation of treatment studies this study demonstrates that flossing can have an important and favorable impact on an individual as compared to that of a non flossing individual with similar genetics and possibly similar habits
1675293 twins tend to share the same or similar environmental factors such as dietary habits health and life practices as well as genetics in this case the only difference was flossing and the outcome was significant flossing may significantly reduce the amount of bad bacteria in the mouth
1675294 as a practicing periodontist i am constantly telling my patients to clean between their teeth more using dental floss or interdental cleaners
1675295 patients tend to think that flossing cant possibly make that much of a difference but this study demonstrates that the addition of flossing to your dental hygiene routine can significantly reduce the amount of periodontal disease causing bacteria even after just two weeks

1675303 being a part of a merger like this is a strange situation because obviously the new organisation has to look over all of its assets everything it owns and its strategy for the future
1675304 apparently they didnt want an rts studio in europe and to be honest we would have loved to have worked with activision but were pretty confident in our capabilities and there are not many studios that can match our quality
1675305 thats part of the whole situation now in theory they could sell world in conflict separately from massive i think that any buyer would like to make sure it goes together but we dont own it activision owns it so thats their call
1675306 i think that right now everyone is in wait and see mode and just want to know what the future holds
1675307 but massive has been in tough situations before in the past 12 years and weve always come out stronger most of the guys in the company at least have faith in our ability to find a really interesting future

1675378 i think its important to know what youre getting into

1675381 you can spend thousands of dollars on traditional marketing and see poor results
1675382 weve placed big ads in magazines that just didnt work but its possible to spend much less on non traditional approaches that get better results for example one way for us to introduce people to our products is to give away quick start guides to our games at large conventions

1675386 its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas
1675387 its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law
1675388 were concerned for the precedent that the execution may create for the rights of mexican nationals who may be detained in that country
1675389 state and federal courts on three separate occasions have already satisfied the world courts suggestion that american courts examine whether medellin suffered actual legal harm when authorities did not inform him about certain rights under the vienna convention
1675390 on all three occasions state and federal courts concluded that medellin suffered no legal harm
1675391 lets save this for when i see you if we argue about it now well both decide not to get together
1675392 i watched obama when he was here and i think we need someone like him to advocate for us i have no doubts that hes pro israel mccain is too although like obama hes not a leader on israel issues i suspect that they would be pretty much the same as president
1675393 my friends and i prefer obama because when he defends us people will listen bush is pro israel but when he defends us all it does is emphasize how alone we are all we have is bush who is hated worldwide and commands no respect so who cares if he defends us everytime he opens his mouth we lose support
1675394 but when obama goes before the un or the europeans or the africans and asians and says look israel has legitimate grievances too they will pay attention
1675395 mccain cant do anything for us except make us look like a pariah defended by an old conservative president who is identified on the wrong side of every issue
1675396 of course i read his speeches i heard him talk off the cuff he knows israel deeply all mccain does is say there will never be another holocaust like hes some 70 year old jewish leader from america obama speaks a language the world understands and speaks it well mccain does tired talking points being defended by mccain will be a minus not a plus
1675397 no i think its half and half the young ones for sure the guys in the army they agree i mean who could be excited by mccain especially here where he means nothing but the continuation of bush look where that got us
1675398 what we need is someone who can come up with some new ideas about neutralizing iran we need somebody smart we dont need the same old ideas that dont work anyway i dont know for sure that things will be better with obama but i know they wont be better with mccain so the choice is obvious
1675399 i will be your congresswoman until i decide to retire
1675400 i am honored blessed and will continue to serve you to the very best of my abilities
1675401 are you a starter of all and finisher of none
1675402 whats important is whatever changes you make to your routine need to be small enough so that there is a minimal amount of difference between what youve been doing and what you now do
1675403 its kind of like saying theres a bunch of money on the street

1675421 but we dont know how much its going to add up too and we dont know whether thats going to be enough because of the regionality of the situation
1675422 this is the big story of beijings air pollution that is not widely recognized is that its always going up and down in regular cycles
1675423 there was no detectable change in air quality at least for the particulate matter which is the number one concern
1675424 when the air comes from that direction you are guaranteed high levels of pollution
1675425 the emissions in beijing and the surrounding provinces are exactly the same every day so all those changes that you see on the graph are the effect of weather patterns weather patterns rule in beijing
1675426 are now fighting with meteorology which has not been very cooperative in the end of july
1675427 it would be much better off if the olympics were held in september
1675428 the dividing line between healthy and unhealthy is a few times higher in china than it is in the united states for a good reason

1675520 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
1675521 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
1675522 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
1675523 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade

1675685 by creating a single disk based backup environment that will scale in capacity and performance to support the administrative and academic operations of the university we will gain economies of scale and efficiencies that we want to leverage it also provides a path to move away from physical tape as the primary backup medium
1675686 but in order to justify replacing tape with disk disk based backup costs had to be reduced to compete with tape data deduplication with hardware compression became critical technology in our evaluation to solve the cost capacity metric we needed to meet for disk based storage
1675687 we looked at many vendors with various dedupe approaches and sepaton offered a cleaner simpler configuration that was better integrated than alternatives with the contentaware tm architecture we can add performance simply by adding more sepaton replication engine sre r nodes and add capacity simply by adding disks this is a smarter design that enables the system to grow easily their deduplication method seemed to ensure backups would process without slowing performance and sure enough our stress testing showed that despite all the data we could throw at it deltastor passed with flying colors
1675688 our dedupe ratio requirements are conservative because our primary goal is simply to beat the cost of tape
1675689 but as our initial testing shows we fully expect to achieve ratios that exceed our goals realizing capacity gains and costs savings for the university the performance of the system has been excellent as has its usability the browser interface makes configuring the system very easy as soon as our backup infrastructure with new servers and devices is operational well be ready to fine tune deduplication for optimal performance in our environment

1675921 putin is openly and publicly declaring that he is the main figure on the political map and its clear that medvedev still lacks either the resources courage or political experience to answer him forcefully
1675922 putin is now attacking but medvedev is not simply stepping quietly aside he feels the obligation to resist but softly he is not doing this directly but more like acting like a servant in a play by moliere or shakespeare who is whispering an aside while his master is speaking
1675923 i think in the short term they will manage and regulate this disagreement and move it to the back burner but i think in the long term this disagreement can only grow
1675924 there are two ways this could turn out either there will be a big fight one of the two will win and we will return to having a single administrative center or they will find a compromise that says vladimir vladimirovich putin this is your area this is dmitry anatolyevichs medvedev
1675925 if at first you dont succeed call it version 1 0
1675926 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1675927 this transformation will be costly and given the fiscal disaster we will inherit from the last administration it will likely require us to defer some other priorities
1675928 like all compromises this one has its drawbacks it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1675929 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1675930 they think its funny that theyre making fun of something that is actually true they need to do their homework

1675980 this report contains unacceptable accusations made against french political and military officials
1675981 it is possible to question the objectivity of the mandate of this independent commission charged by the rwandan authorities to gather evidence showing the implication of the french state in the genocide carried out in rwanda in 1994
1675982 our determination to build a new relationship with rwanda moving beyond our difficult past remains intact
1675983 we continue to place our relationship with rwanda within this forward looking perspective
1675984 we will have eight schools in each of nine regions across the united states
1675985 in about 20 years you will see a veritas national championship
1675986 in the past few years we have seen an insidious attempt to rewrite history it aims to turn france from an involved party into an accomplice to the genocide
1675987 did we for example systematically take the side of one camp against another hutu against tutsi that is an untruth
1675988 did we fail to denounce the genocide committed by hutu extremists starting in april 1994 that is an untruth
1675989 did we remain passive when the rest of the international community was taking action that is an untruth
1675990 during my time as head of french diplomacy from april 1993 to may 1995 we did everything we could to help the reconciliation of rwandans

1675995 fifa is surprised and disappointed by this decision but we respect it
1675996 nevertheless i appeal to the clubs let your players take part in the olympic games it would be an act of solidarity in perfect harmony with the olympic spirit it would be wonderful for the players for the fans and for the game itself
1675997 fifas opinion has not changed the olympic football tournaments are high level competitions that give everyone involved most notably young players the chance to gain international experience that will stand them in good stead for the future
1675998 it stands to reason therefore that it is not only the player who will benefit from such an experience but also his club
1675999 i regret that the cas has not taken the olympic spirit into consideration
1676000 the olympic tournament doesnt feature in the official fifa calendar and there is no executive decision by fifa which establishes a right of release for under 23 players for this tournament
1676001 consequently schalke 04 werder bremen and barcelona are not obliged to release the players rafinha diego and messi
1676002 cas appeals to the good sense of the clubs and fifa to find a reasonable solution which will allow a player who wishes to represent his country to compete in the olympic games
1676003 sur les c t s courts et sur le dessus
1676004 esta propuesta sencillamente significar a tomar estos recursos de las reservas internacionales mismas que seg n los propios proponentes son sencillamente intocables porque responden a las exigencias del programa con el fmi

1676006 si asumimos que en 2008 la recaudaci n crece a una tasa anual de 18 la recaudaci n de ingresos alcanzar a un monto de c 24 073 millones que se colocar a c 972 millones por encima de lo presupuestado si asumimos una tasa del 18 2 el exceso de recaudaci n ser a de c 1 012 millones una tasa del 19 dar a una sobre recaudaci n de c 1 176 millones
1676007 creo que se puede decir viendo la tendencia de la recaudaci n efectiva de ingresos fiscales que muestra el sigfa el cual muestra de manera sistem tica una tasa de crecimiento interanual de 20 4 de los ingresos fiscales que se obtendr una sobre recaudaci n de como m nimo c 900 millones unos us 45 millones
1676008 para compadecernos incluso de aquellos partidarios del conservadurismo fiscal m s extremo podr amos decir que el m nimo absoluto de sobre recaudaci n que cabr a esperar es de us 800 millones unos us 40 millones
1676009 el gobierno ya sabe que esta sobre recaudaci n se va a producir tanto porque la tendencia efectiva de la recaudaci n 20 4 es muy superior al 13 2 proyectado en el presupuesto como porque el propio gobierno ahora estima que el pib nominal crecer un 19 en 2008

1676029 there has been no decision by the australian government to have a guest worker scheme with anyone as yet he said
1676030 while you know there is consideration before cabinet about such matters the focus is very much on the south pacific as a trial
1676031 a decision will be taken and announced shortly about that but the focus has always been on both the south pacific and a trial as part of our attempts to stabilise the south pacific economies
1676032 there has not been any formal engagement with indonesia on those issues senator evans said

1676056 despite the fact that there had at no stage been a decision expressly divesting the applicant of her parental rights her daughter was freed for adoption and the adoption proceedings were eventually completed without the participation of the applicant in any form save for a telephone call as maintained by the government the court has not overlooked the fact that the applicant was divested of the capacity to act however the court has difficulty in accepting that every person divested of the capacity to act should be automatically excluded from adoption proceedings concerning his or her child as the applicant was in the present case the court finds that it was not sufficient for the applicant to be only summarily informed by the relevant domestic authorities while her parental rights were still intact that adoption proceedings had been instituted in respect of her daughter the court considers that she should also have been given an opportunity to be heard in those proceedings and thus the possibility of expressing her views about the potential adoption of her daughter

1676060 the outlook for growth continues to deteriorate with recession looking increasingly unavoidable
1676061 the consumer sector is bearing the brunt of the credit crisis with falling asset prices negative real wage growth and rising unemployment taking its toll on sentiment and spending
1676062 given the outlook for inflation and the stance of fiscal policy directors saw little scope for monetary easing at present

1676068 i suppose for any state control over hydrocarbons is significant as other resources dwindle
1676069 the other factor is the melting of the polar ice and that is making it easier to explore the area which is why the oil and gas industry is looking at it
1676070 it is now becoming a potential area of development rather than a hypothetical one
1676071 it is vulnerable and extracting oil and gas is not an environmentally friendly activity
1676072 the player is here and will remain with the team he will start thursdays game against ivory coast in shanghai from the beginning and im sure he can be with us for the rest of the competition
1676073 not at this time no i have spoken with him and he wants to stay here with the rest of the team
1676074 i hope this decision will not have any effects on other teams with players who are coming to this tournament every coach would want messi in their team hopefully barcelona can take the decision that he stays here
1676075 surprised and disappointed by the cas decision but we respect it
1676076 nevertheless i appeal to the clubs let your players take part in the olympics it would be an act of solidarity in perfect harmony with the olympic spirit it would be wonderful for the players for the fans and for the game itself
1676077 fifas opinion has not changed the olympic football tournaments are high level competitions that give everyone involved most notably young players the chance to gain international experience that will stand them in good stead for the future
1676078 it stands to reason therefore that it is not only the player who will benefit from such an experience but also his club i regret that the cas has not taken the olympic spirit into consideration
1676079 we are pleased with the cas decision because we have worked closely with the clubs in this legal matter
1676080 it was always our opinion that under fifa regulations we were not committed to allowing our players to go freely fifa failed to realise the legal implications of this decision early and the preparation of the clubs ahead of the new season has been affected
1676081 it is sad for the athletes concerned they were dreaming of the games but obviously there are some issues between the players and the clubs
1676082 there is maybe a lack of clarity about the tournament we will see afterwards how the rules can be worked out

1676091 there is not enough water in the system to bring down the sorts of quantities of water youd need to fill the lower lakes
1676092 even if we did make a decision to not give any allocations upstream there is insufficient water currently in storage less the critical human needs issue for us to viably manage the lower lakes with the amount of water that we have
1676093 that is extremely unfortunate and extremely difficult for the community down there
1676094 theres not going to be a silver bullet to solve the problem so weve got to pursue multiple approaches

1676218 savers should be warned that these accounts do not pay the highest rates on the market by donating to charity you could be losing out on additional interest from having your money in a best buy account
1676219 however it is worth noting that the majority of charity savings accounts are branch based accounts and the rates on offer are equal to other branch based accounts on the market
1676220 there are numerous charity savings accounts on the market with affiliations to many worthy causes such as hospices air ambulances and wildlife trusts so whatever your chosen charity you can make a donation just by having your money in a savings account
1676221 a donation of up to 25 is made when the card is first issued or used after this the card issuer will donate typically 0 25 of the value of purchases made
1676222 these cards do not offer the longest deals on the market but with introductory purchases deals of 0 for six months and balance transfer deals of 0 for 12 months they are not far off the market leading deals

1676238 were definitely seeing continual shifts the great unwashed those people who have never sent a text message is getting smaller all the time
1676239 two years ago asking people about blogs people were shaking their heads i think now its taking off because social networks are taking off people may have been doing it before but may not have realized it now theyre recognizing it for what it is
1676240 why did they have to wait until midnight on the eve of his trial to arrest him
1676241 said lambert mbom 35 who lives in the complex and witnessed the standoff monday night
1676242 it is frustrating they kept pleading with him all night to come out but he never did
1676243 we exhausted all means that we had to try and get him to come out he just did not want to come out when he did come out i believe his intentions were to do more harm
1676244 was never considered to be a disciplinary problem in any sense

1676249 like pricing and metering there are some parts of the world even some parts of the united states
1676250 where sites arent even requiring meter readings for their water users sacramento was one until recently
1676251 catastrophic for our water supply our environment and our economy
1676252 its hard to get businesses or water users to pay attention to conserving a resource thats been so devalued or to cherish it
1676253 right now they have no incentive to use water more wisely because its so cheap but whats changing is locally municipalities are looking at full cost pricing to reflect how much it takes their water service providers to actually deliver it having that reflected in the price of water
1676254 one of the biggest water users in the world is agriculture when you look at what or who consumes the most water its 70 percent agriculture even in countries where the water systems are more developed there are huge places where agriculture can get more efficient
1676255 also the ag lobby in this country and in others is a very powerful force in shaping water policies including pricing
1676256 when it comes to implementing policy changes that would drive conservation theyre blocking much of the legislation
1676257 the water rights are dictated by the doctrine of prior appropriation theyre first in line for water they have first rights so that its there when the region comes into drought periods and others have rationing
1676258 as california and the west were settled w ater rights were established on a seniority system of first in time first in right
1676259 no one thought to allocate to fish birds and other wildlife the water they needed to survive probably no one could conceive or even imagine that they would ever be gone
1676260 it is happening already through these changes in water policy i do think water is one of those resources that is hard for people to see as a global issue because its such a local resource its hard for people who live in michigan or sweden which are surrounded by water to understand water scarcity
1676261 water is just another one of those areas of the green movement and were coming out of this slumber so to speak as a society we havent been really fully aware of how we misuse and over use these resources that are so precious
1676262 in marin county ca where i live they take a fairly clever approach thats driving behavior change they tell you on your water bill how your water usage compares to last years
1676263 its information thats very easy to read you can also compare your usage to the county average and to the town average that kind of information motivates people those kinds of policies allow people to become actively involved in utilities issues
1676264 water utilities in some cases will subsidize the installation of low flow toilets and shower heads and they have good reason
1676265 in southern california they did that at first they said well give you the thing for free and it was so popular they said well give you the toilet and install it for you its still cheaper than them having to go build a dam and then piping the water to cities hundreds of miles away

1676324 destroying the freshwater ecology of the lower lakes for a generation a half century or perhaps even a century
1676325 the advice i have is once the salt waters in there it is next to impossible to get it out
1676326 unfortunately something has to happen and a weir is really the only option left to protect adelaides water supply

1676340 as one of this countrys leading educators of the next generation of hairstylists empire is perfectly positioned to support cut it out by teaching our more than 11 000 students per year about domestic violence and how to respond when clients are suffering from abuse

1676415 i am distraught it was only yesterday that i found out that it was all over so it hasnt really sunk in yet

1676430 it will placate politicians but not satisfy the information needs of consumers
1676431 a website which reports monthly on an industry where prices can change up to five times a day is misleading ineffective and could be detrimental for big and small retailers who on a given day may not be the cheapest supermarket but will carry that label for anything up to a month

1676458 our determination to build a new relationship with rwanda moving beyond our difficult past remains intact
1676459 this report is an important step of which france should be happy
1676460 for diplomacy it is a very good basis the relation between rwanda and france should be based on the truth
1676461 the government has asked the courts to use this report we hope that legal proceedings will follow
1676462 in the past few years we have seen an insidious attempt to rewrite history it aims to turn france from an involved party into an accomplice to the genocide
1676463 during my time as head of french diplomacy we did everything we could to help the reconciliation of rwandans

1676468 it may not mean anything other than shes getting good legal advice
1676469 you dont know what the dea may suspect in this case and i think its a cautious way to proceed i think it would be wrong to assume shes done something criminal simply because shes invoking her 5th amendment against self incrimination

1676505 there has not been any formal engagement with indonesia on those issues

1676793 it was associated with tobacco accords found in some mens fragrances the trio tonka bean coumarine and liatrix a tobacco smelling plant that grows in florida worked very well for many years what i like with the coffee note is its oriental facet usually enhanced by vanilla benzoin and tonka bean and that is how you create a coffee note i like its multiple facets roasted coffee mocha espresso animalic notes are all very attractive notes for perfumers to me coffee can be used as a top note a heart note or a base note when used as a top note it gives the fragrance warmth and body as a heart note it rounds out the other notes and as a base note it gives the other notes a powdery facet i used the coffee note three years ago in gourmandise by rodier a fragrance hinging on a fruity oriental accord featuring a very strong note of coffee with milk i added tonka bean in the end to create a link
1676794 i believe that coffee can be used as a top note a heart note or a base note when used as a top note it gives the fragrance warmth and body as a heart note it rounds out the other notes and as a base note it gives the other notes a powdery facet i used the coffee note three years ago in gourmandise by rodier a fragrance hinging on a fruity oriental accord featuring a very strong note of coffee with milk i added tonka bean in the end to create a link

1676814 water is essential to building and sustaining a community i am pleased that after over 75 years of struggle litigation and negotiation this bill clearly shows how reaching a consensus will help the tribe and san jacinto valley achieve a reliable water source for years to come

1676871 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days john mccain and im not promising change like that other guy barack obama im just hot
1676872 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1676873 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1676874 and now i want to present my energy policy for america just after i finish reading this article on where i can fly to to get the best tan oh maui
1676875 barack wants to focus on new technology to cut foreign oil dependency and mccain wants offshore drilling
1676876 well why dont we do a hybrid of both candidates ideas we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars
1676877 that way the offshore drilling carries us until the new technologies kick in which would then create new jobs and energy independence energy crisis solved

1676881 el crecimiento de la econom a regional es nulo de que son insuficientes los planes de inversi n anunciados por el gobierno regional de que la industria ofrece un notable retroceso y de que la licitaci n de obra p blica de la comunidad y de los ayuntamientos ha bajado estrepitosamente en contraposici n de la licitaci n del estado que sube

1676887 if someone spends a lot more money on food than the average person or if they spend a lot more on medical care then their own personal inflation rate will be different
1676888 with transportation prices today increasing at a much faster pace than overall inflation if you spend more on transportation than the average consumer your inflation rate will be higher
1676889 what people spend their money on varies substantially by age income region and ethnicity
1676890 i live relatively close to campus and there are three or four days a week that i ride my bike to work gas can go up and it doesnt make much difference in my budget i fill up my gas tank twice a month and some people fill up their gas tank twice a week
1676891 feel that the cpi is currently understating the inflation that they are struggling with since the prices for things they buy almost every day like gasoline and bread are rising rapidly
1676892 in most times the cpi is a good benchmark for the inflation most of us face in times such as now however it is clearly less useful
1676893 in most times prices across most goods and services rise at similar rates
1676894 today prices are rising rapidly for energy and food compared to prices for everything else so that for those households that spend more of their budget on energy and food the overall cpi is not representative of the inflation they face
1676895 when you have rapidly rising prices in certain key commodities does that weighting in your basket of goods get changed fast enough so that it really reflects the true cost
1676896 its not so much social networking its having a social experience around things that we care about so pets are just such a great example of that
1676897 social networks like facebook and myspace are sort of about you and your friends and these very direct connections but theres all sorts of other types of connections
1676898 theres a lot of people out there with their dogs and were busy and were all working in the office all day long and this is a way for us to bring our pets with us
1676899 its been a goofy thing to do at the end of the day when you get home from work and you just want to talk to somebody in your dogs voice and say hey how was your day
1676900 im being deleted what do these jerks know about my accomplishments
1676901 our report is not about whether pregnant women should or should not have antenatal screening
1676902 the study focuses on informed choice and parental consent it is about whether people are being given the support they need to make an informed choice to accept or reject screening and about the implications and options that may arise
1676903 parents need the right information at the right time but information alone is not enough every family is different and parents have to be able to think through their decisions taking into account their own experiences beliefs and circumstances
1676904 there are significant groups of parents who are being given insufficient opportunity to consider the options
1676905 in northern ireland there is no requirement for a universal offer individual trusts have different criteria against which they make a decision on the offer of screening the offer can depend on which trust area you live in or which hospital you visit there is inconsistency here if it is to be an offer then the process and the information about it should be available across northern ireland
1676906 our research has shown that parents think knowing about the life of a person with down syndrome is important when making their decision about screening but only half the parents in the study had ever known a person with downs syndrome balanced information about what it is like to have the condition or raise a child with downs syndrome is needed

1677002 people save given the right incentives and right structure but that they will save even at very low incomes which was stunning
1677003 that is certainly not true today if it ever was
1677004 you think im working im making good money you never think this might not last you have to have something put away
1677005 anyone who goes through an ida program is not going to be pushed into a subprime loan they would be put into a mortgage that is suitable for them and their financial situation
1677006 start with a down payment theyve had financial education about homeownership and they have all been guided to high quality mortgage products that they can afford
1677007 in order for our city to be able to rebuild our families would need a place to stay they would need somewhere for their children to go when they went to work

1677032 ho lasciato il calcio perch un ambiente non sempre limpido
1677033 e la societ del quartiere che fa parte del centro sportivo italiano dove lo sport si vive in maniera genuina allinsegna del divertimento e ben lontano da ogni forma di professionismo
1677034 e stata una soluzione demergenza perch mancava il titolare ma dopo alcune gare sono tornato a fare lattaccante
1677035 i numeri a questo livello non contano comunque la scorsa annata ho segnato 10 goal in 15 partite pi o meno
1677036 in realt non successo nulla negli ultimi anni della mia carriera che mi abbia fatto disamorare del calcio soltanto che mi sono stufato dellambiente e non me la sentivo pi di continuare
1677037 vero ho combattuto con diversi infortuni nelle ultime stagioni e devo dire di aver incontrato medici che privilegiavano il risultato sportivo alla mia completa guarigione per fortuna non sono tutti cos per
1677038 s la gente crede che questo mondo sia fatto soltanto di partite e allenamenti ma c dellaltro alcune situazioni poco chiare che portano dei risvolti negativi ma forse ogni ambito di lavoro a suo modo non perfettamente limpido
1677039 beh quella sera mi sono guadagnato lattenzione di molta gente forse stato il momento pi eclatante ma in realt la miglior stagione quella dove ho vinto il titolo di capocannoniere con il vicenza in serie b anche perch a fine anno ho conquistato un europeo under 21 e partecipato alle olimpiadi
1677040 probabilmente in molti sono pi bravi di me ma non tutti cos va la vita alcuni hanno talento altri fortuna altri ancora un procuratore influente
1677041 ad essere sincero anche quando ero un professionista capitava raramente che guardassi una gara adesso la stessa identica cosa

1677064 i think our non conference schedule is very competitive and will give us a good idea of things we need to work on and get us ready to play in the conference season

1677069 bell at 3 feels similar to pietersen as captain it could be brilliant though it could be catastrophic he doesnt play well under pressure
1677070 he did it before so he could do it again
1677071 its been so long since he performed well for england that i dont know why we bother with him now
1677072 hes decided he needs a few days away just to clear his head and get away from cricket its a mental thing
1677073 hell give himself a clean break and hopefully hell play in the game next week over in cardiff
1677074 i am ecstatic words cant describe how ready and excited i am for this season

1677087 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1677088 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1677089 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1677090 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1677091 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs
1677092 by and large these are not run to identify spies they are run to thwart what the officer is trying to do to us and to learn more about what they are trying to do to us

1677099 im absolutely confident there will be no announcement today i guess the best way to put it is if theres an announcement today id be as surprised as anybody else

1677104 private cliques have always existed in the intellectual field particularly in the arts but they used to serve as checks and balances on one another so that a nonconformist could enter the field and rise without the help of a clique today the cliques are consolidated into an establishment
1677105 have you ever wondered what they felt those first men of the renaissance when emerging from the long nightmare of the middle ages having seen nothing but the deformed monstrosities and gargoyles of medieval art as the only reflections of mans soul they took a new free unobstructed look at the world and rediscovered the statues of the greek gods forgotten under piles of rubble

1677139 wow some local companies really understand the value of owning a generic domain name
1677140 our general manager jerry lenz decided to purchase the domain in february of 2005
1677141 due to the ever growing number of lines name products we were carrying honda yamaha suzuki etc we felt our website domain needed to be trimmed down and more memorable
1677142 our founder bob lanphere sr s philosophy has always been
1677143 as a part of ofws marketing package because the domain was shorter and easier to remember and citysearch offered to point the domain to ofws website
1677144 in his advertising wouldnt be smart unless he actually owned the domain
1677145 our stores get so much business from this domain name that one time when our website was down due to some server problems both our stores sales dipped so drastically we realized how important the domain name and website were to our sales

1677158 daarnaast zegt mijn oom dat wilders strijd tegen de islam moslims alleen maar meer moslim maakt de meeste moslims die tot voor kort zich weinig of niet interesseerden in de islam bidden nu in de voorste rijen

1677255 well this is a tricky question backlund lost the title in japan to antonio inoki for several days in november 1979 before getting the title back at the end of the tour however wwe does not recognize the inoki title reign and says that backlund held the title from 1978 to 1983 so by wwes records backlund is the second longest reigning champion behind bruno if you count inokis reign as having happened hogans first reign would pass backlunds reigns i think its easier for everybody involved to accept wwes version of history here hopefully inoki wont come to kentucky and slap the taste out of my mouth
1677256 the only belts that stayed unified were the wcw tag the wwe light heavyweight and the hardcore and european belts
1677257 um no the light heavyweight title was never unified with anything the wwe just chose to ignore it because it had zero history and was held by freakin x pac it just disappeared and they only recognized the cruiserweight title no unification match happened yes the titles were unified at summerslam 2001 but were once again split up

1677298 las relaciones entre la fifa y los clubes no est n tan bien como deber an y parece que hubo una falta de clarificaci n por ambas partes ahora vamos a trabajar con la fifa para que las reglas ayuden a los atletas en un futuro a participar en los juegos ol mpicos

1677309 ser a tambi n una incongruencia porque supondr a dejar tirado un poco al equipo despu s de la marcha de de sanctis
1677310 esper bamos una decisi n en ese sentido amparada en los aspectos legales nosotros como la federaci n alemana de f tbol dfb defend amos que ni el reglamento de fifa ni la pr ctica imponen la obligatoriedad de ceder a los jugadores
1677311 la fifa actu con ligereza y se precipit al dar su veredicto lo que ha perjudicado la preparaci n de los clubes para la pr xima temporada

1677323 we are talking 90 million barrels of oil nearly 17 hundred trillion cubic feet
1677324 i suppose for any state control over hydrocarbons is significant as other resources dwindle
1677325 the other factor is the melting of the polar ice and that is making it easier to explore the area which is why the oil and gas industry is looking at it
1677326 it is now becoming a potential area of development rather than a hypothetical one
1677327 it is vulnerable and extracting oil and gas is not an environmentally friendly activity

1677365 el uso de las m scaras protectoras en nuestro arribo a beijing fue estrictamente una medida de precauci n que nosotros como atletas decidimos tomar y de ninguna manera signific un mensaje ambiental o pol tico

1677378 la postura de la fifa no ha cambiado los torneos ol mpicos de f tbol representan una oportunidad nica para un jugador puesto que se trata de competiciones del m s alto nivel que brindan a todos los participantes sobre todo a los j venes la oportunidad de recabar experiencia internacional muy til en el futuro por este motivo es l gico que no s lo se benefician de ello el jugador y su selecci n nacional sino tambi n su club

1677394 desde que he llegado al chelsea s lo nos hemos gastado 8 millones de libras en el fichaje de deco jos bosingwa ya estaba aqu antes de que yo llegara
1677395 aunque ahora matiz no hace falta gastar tanto porque ya existe una base s lida ahora se necesita un entrenador que desarrolle a los j venes jugadores y creo que yo soy ese entrenador
1677396 el trabajo est hecho pero queda pulir un par de detalles
1677397 el trabajo hecho a falta de un par de detalles
1677398 el objetivo claro del equipo es entrar en la final y mi compromiso queda claro por el hecho de que he renunciado a ser el abanderado en la ceremonia de inauguraci n s lo por no perjudicar al equipo todos somos uno

1677415 we will start working out the process for mobile number portability in the next two months it would come into place in the metros by march or so
1677416 we have also finalised the schedule for extending number portability across all circles by september 2009 one year from the grant of licence
1677417 how can we begin to inquire into it it must be either publicly by setting the magistrate and coroner to work or privately by questioning lydgate as to the first proceeding there is no solid ground to go upon else hawley would have adopted it and as to opening the subject with lydgate i confess i should shrink from it he would probably take it as a deadly insult i have more than once experienced the difficulty of speaking to him on personal matters and one should know the truth about his conduct beforehand to feel very confident of a good result
1677418 i feel convinced that his conduct has not been guilty i believe that people are almost always better than their neighbors think they are
1677419 mr lydgate would understand that if his friends hear a calumny about him their first wish must be to justify him what do we live for if it is not to make life less difficult to each other i cannot be indifferent to the troubles of a man who advised me in my trouble and attended me in my illness
1677420 you cant undertake to manage a mans life for him in that way lydgate must know at least he will soon come to know how he stands if he can clear himself he will he must act for himself
1677421 i think his friends must wait till they find an opportunity
1677422 it is possible i have often felt so much weakness in myself that i can conceive even a man of honorable disposition such as i have always believed lydgate to be succumbing to such a temptation as that of accepting money which was offered more or less indirectly as a bribe to insure his silence about scandalous facts long gone by i say i can conceive this if he were under the pressure of hard circumstances if he had been harassed as i feel sure lydgate has been i would not believe anything worse of him except under stringent proof but there is the terrible nemesis following on some errors that it is always possible for those who like it to interpret them into a crime there is no proof in favor of the man outside his own consciousness and assertion
1677423 and would you not like to be the one person who believed in that mans innocence if the rest of the world belied him besides there is a mans character beforehand to speak for him
1677424 character is not cut in marble it is not something solid and unalterable it is something living and changing and may become diseased as our bodies do
1677425 i should not be afraid of asking mr lydgate to tell me the truth that i might help him why should i be afraid now that i am not to have the land james i might do as mr bulstrode proposed and take his place in providing for the hospital and i have to consult mr lydgate to know thoroughly what are the prospects of doing good by keeping up the present plans there is the best opportunity in the world for me to ask for his confidence and he would be able to tell me things which might make all the circumstances clear then we would all stand by him and bring him out of his trouble people glorify all sorts of bravery except the bravery they might show on behalf of their nearest neighbors
1677426 it is true that a woman may venture on some efforts of sympathy which would hardly succeed if we men undertook them
1677427 surely a woman is bound to be cautious and listen to those who know the world better than she does
1677428 whatever you do in the end dorothea you should really keep back at present and not volunteer any meddling with this bulstrode business we dont know yet what may turn up you must agree with me
1677429 it is easy to go too far you know you must not let your ideas run away with you and as to being in a hurry to put money into schemes it wont do you know garth has drawn me in uncommonly with repairs draining that sort of thing im uncommonly out of pocket with one thing or another i must pull up as for you chettam you are spending a fortune on those oak fences round your demesne
1677430 else you will be getting into a scrape you always did and you always will when you set about doing as you please and i think it is a mercy now after all that you have got james to think for you he lets you have your plans only he hinders you from being taken in and that is the good of having a brother instead of a husband a husband would not let you have your plans
1677431 i only want not to have my feelings checked at every turn
1677432 you are contradictory first one thing and then another you used to submit to mr casaubon quite shamefully i think you would have given up ever coming to see me if he had asked you
1677433 of course i submitted to him because it was my duty it was my feeling for him
1677434 then why cant you think it your duty to submit a little to what james wishes
1677435 because he only wishes what is for your own good and of course men know best about everything except what women know better
1677436 i should not give up to james when i knew he was wrong as you used to do to mr casaubon
1677437 he was afraid of some betrayal in my hearing all he wanted was to bind me to him by a strong obligation that was why he passed on a sudden from hardness to liberality and he may have tampered with the patient he may have disobeyed my orders i fear he did but whether he did or not the world believes that he somehow or other poisoned the man and that i winked at the crime if i didnt help in it and yet and yet he may not be guilty of the last offence and it is just possible that the change towards me may have been a genuine relenting the effect of second thoughts such as he alleged what we call the just possible is sometimes true and the thing we find it easier to believe is grossly false in his last dealings with this man bulstrode may have kept his hands pure in spite of my suspicion to the contrary
1677438 is there a medical man of them all in middlemarch who would question himself as i do
1677439 and yet they will all feel warranted in making a wide space between me and them as if i were a leper my practice and my reputation are utterly damned i can see that even if i could be cleared by valid evidence it would make little difference to the blessed world here i have been set down as tainted and should be cheapened to them all the same
1677440 i shall do as i think right and explain to nobody
1677441 though she has got into the way of putting her religion forward to conform to her husband she has tried to hold her head up above middlemarch by making it known that she invites clergymen and heaven knows who from riverston and those places
1677442 because few of the best people in the town cared to associate with balstrode and she must have somebody to sit down at her table
1677443 but he was never fond of him in his heart that every one knows
1677444 mr thesiger never goes into extremes he keeps to the truth in what is evangelical it is only clergymen like mr tyke who want to use dissenting hymn books and that low kind of religion who ever found bulstrode to their taste
1677445 i understand mr tyke is in great distress about him
1677446 and well he may be they say the bulstrodes have half kept the tyke family
1677447 and of coarse it is a discredit to his doctrines
1677448 people will not make a boast of being methodistical in middlemarch for a good while to come
1677449 i think we must not set down peoples bad actions to their religion
1677450 we ought not to be talking of this before you
1677451 i am sure i have no reason to be partial
1677452 its true mr plymdale has always been on good terms with mr bulstrode and harriet vincy was my friend long before she married him but i have always kept my own opinions and told her where she was wrong poor thing still in point of religion i must say mr bulstrode might have done what he has and worse and yet have been a man of no religion i dont say that there has not been a little too much of that i like moderation myself but truth is truth the men tried at the assizes are not all over religious i suppose
1677453 all i can say is that i think she ought to separate from him
1677454 but worse can never mean finding out that your husband is fit for newgate
1677455 fancy living with such a man i should expect to be poisoned
1677456 yes i think myself it is an encouragement to crime if such men are to be taken care of and waited on by good wives
1677457 she thinks her husband the first of men its true he has never denied her anything
1677458 i suppose she knows nothing yet poor creature i do hope and trust i shall not see her for i should be frightened to death lest i should say anything about her husband do you think any hint has reached her
1677459 we hear that he is ill and has never stirred out of the house since the meeting on thursday but she was with her girls at church yesterday and they had new tuscan bonnets her own had a feather in it i have never seen that her religion made any difference in her dress
1677460 and that feather i know she got dyed a pale lavender on purpose to be consistent i must say it of harriet that she wishes to do right
1677461 as to her knowing what has happened it cant be kept from her long
1677462 the vincys know for mr vincy was at the meeting it will he a great blow to him there is his daughter as well as his sister
1677463 nobody supposes that mr lydgate can go on holding up his head in middlemarch things look so black about the thousand pounds he took just at that mans death it really makes one shudder
1677464 i am not so sorry for rosamond vincy that was as i am for her aunt
1677465 i suppose the bulstrodes will go and live abroad somewhere
1677466 that is what is generally done when there is anything disgraceful in a family
1677467 and a most deadly blow it will be to harriet
1677468 if ever a woman was crushed she will be i pity her from my heart and with all her faults few women are better from a girl she had the neatest ways and was always good hearted and as open as the day you might look into her drawers when you would always the same and so she has brought up kate and ellen you may think how hard it will be for her to go among foreigners
1677469 the doctor says that is what he should recommend the lydgates to do
1677470 he says lydgate ought to have kept among the french
1677471 there is that kind of lightness about her but she got that from her mother she never got it from her aunt bulstrode who always gave her good advice and to my knowledge would rather have had her marry elsewhere
1677472 mr lydgate pray be open with me i like to know the truth has anything happened to mr bulstrode
1677473 there is often something poisonous in the air of public rooms
1677474 strong men can stand it but it tells on people in proportion to the delicacy of their systems it is often impossible to account for the precise moment of an attack or rather to say why the strength gives way at a particular moment
1677475 i have not been anywhere except to church for nearly a week
1677476 but mr bulstrode was taken so ill at the meeting on thursday that i have not liked to leave the house
1677477 the land is to be bought by subscription i believe
1677478 let us hope that there will be no more cases of cholera to be buried in it
1677479 it is an awful visitation but i always think middlemarch a very healthy spot i suppose it is being used to it from a child but i never saw the town i should like to live at better and especially our end
1677480 i am sure i should be glad that you always should live at middlemarch mrs bulstrode
1677481 still we must learn to resign ourselves wherever our lot may be cast though i am sure there will always be people in this town who will wish you well
1677482 if you take my advice you will part from your husband
1677483 even if a man has been acquitted by a jury theyll talk and nod and wink and as far as the world goes a man might often as well be guilty as not its a breakdown blow and it damages lydgate as much as bulstrode i dont pretend to say what is the truth i only wish we had never heard the name of either bulstrode or lydgate youd better have been a vincy all your life and so had rosamond
1677484 but you must bear up as well as you can harriet people dont blame you and ill stand by you whatever you make up your mind to do
1677485 i am not well my dear i must go and lie down attend to your papa leave me in quiet i shall take no dinner
1677486 le sentiment de la fausset des plaisirs pr sents et lignorance de la vanit des plaisirs absents causent linconstance
1677487 this is chichelys scratch what is he writing to you about
1677488 why on earth have you been sending out invitations without telling me rosamond i beg i insist that you will not invite any one to this house i suppose you have been inviting others and they have refused too
1677489 oh my dear have you heard nothing it wont be long before it reaches you
1677490 oh my dear yes to think of your marrying into this trouble debt was bad enough but this will be worse
1677491 its better for you to know my dear i think lydgate must leave the town things have gone against him i dare say he couldnt help it i dont accuse him of any harm
1677492 i am a fool havent i given up expecting anything i have married care not help
1677493 if she has any trust in me any notion of what i am she ought to speak now and say that she does not believe i have deserved disgrace
1677494 surely now at last you have given up the idea of staying in middlemarch i cannot go on living here let us go to london papa and every one else says you had better go whatever misery i have to put up with it will be easier away from here
1677495 to mercy pity peace and love all pray in their distress and to these virtues of delight return their thankfulness for mercy has a human heart pity a human face and love the human form divine and peace the human dress william blake songs of innocence
1677496 but in that case also it is desirable that you should lay them before her
1677497 i have wished very much to see you for a long while mr lydgate
1677498 but i put off asking you to come until mr bulstrode applied to me again about the hospital i know that the advantage of keeping the management of it separate from that of the infirmary depends on you or at least on the good which you are encouraged to hope for from having it under your control and i am sure you will not refuse to tell me exactly what you think
1677499 you want to decide whether you should give a generous support to the hospital
1677500 i cannot conscientiously advise you to do it in dependence on any activity of mine i may be obliged to leave the town
1677501 not because there is no one to believe in you
1677502 i know the unhappy mistakes about you i knew them from the first moment to be mistakes you have never done anything vile you would not do anything dishonorable
1677503 then we can consult together it is wicked to let people think evil of any one falsely when it can be hindered
1677504 to bear hard on bulstrode who has lent me money of which i was in need though i would rather have gone without it now he is hunted down and miserable and has only a poor thread of life in him but i should like to tell you everything it will be a comfort to me to speak where belief has gone beforehand and where i shall not seem to be offering assertions of my own honesty you will feel what is fair to another as you feel what is fair to me
1677505 i will not repeat anything without your leave but at the very least i could say that you have made all the circumstances clear to me and that i know you are not in any way guilty mr farebrother would believe me and my uncle and sir james chettam nay there are persons in middlemarch to whom i could go although they dont know much of me they would believe me they would know that i could have no other motive than truth and justice i would take any pains to clear you i have very little to do there is nothing better that i can do in the world
1677506 that hawley sent some one to examine the housekeeper at stone court and she said that she gave the patient all the opium in the phial i left as well as a good deal of brandy but that would not have been opposed to ordinary prescriptions even of first rate men the suspicions against me had no hold there they are grounded on the knowledge that i took money that bulstrode had strong motives for wishing the man to die and that he gave me the money as a bribe to concur in some malpractices or other against the patient that in any case i accepted a bribe to hold my tongue they are just the suspicions that cling the most obstinately because they lie in peoples inclination and can never be disproved how my orders came to be disobeyed is a question to which i dont know the answer it is still possible that bulstrode was innocent of any criminal intention even possible that he had nothing to do with the disobedience and merely abstained from mentioning it but all that has nothing to do with the public belief it is one of those cases on which a man is condemned on the ground of his character it is believed that he has committed a crime in some undefined way because he had the motive for doing it and bulstrodes character has enveloped me because i took his money i am simply blighted like a damaged ear of corn the business is done and cant be undone
1677507 i understand the difficulty there is in your vindicating yourself and that all this should have come to you who had meant to lead a higher life than the common and to find out better ways i cannot bear to rest in this as unchangeable i know you meant that i remember what you said to me when you first spoke to me about the hospital there is no sorrow i have thought more about than that to love what is great and try to reach it and yet to fail
1677508 i had some ambition i meant everything to be different with me i thought i had more strength and mastery but the most terrible obstacles are such as nobody can see except oneself
1677509 that might do if i had my old trust in myself
1677510 nothing galls me more than the notion of turning round and running away before this slander leaving it unchecked behind me still i cant ask any one to put a great deal of money into a plan which depends on me
1677511 only think i am very uncomfortable with my money because they tell me i have too little for any great scheme of the sort i like best and yet i have too much i dont know what to do i have seven hundred a year of my own fortune and nineteen hundred a year that mr casaubon left me and between three and four thousand of ready money in the bank i wished to raise money and pay it off gradually out of my income which i dont want to buy land with and found a village which should be a school of industry but sir james and my uncle have convinced me that the risk would be too great so you see that what i should most rejoice at would be to have something good to do with my money i should like it to make other peoples lives better to them it makes me very uneasy coming all to me who dont want it
1677512 i think you see now that you spoke too scrupulously
1677513 the hospital would be one good and making your life quite whole and well again would be another
1677514 you have the goodness as well as the money to do all that if it could be done
1677515 why should i not tell you you know what sort of bond marriage is you will understand everything
1677516 it is impossible for me now to do anything to take any step without considering my wifes happiness the thing that i might like to do if i were alone is become impossible to me i cant see her miserable she married me without knowing what she was going into and it might have been better for her if she had not married me
1677517 i know i know you could not give her pain if you were not obliged to do it
1677518 and she has set her mind against staying she wishes to go the troubles she has had here have wearied her
1677519 but when she saw the good that might come of staying
1677520 and indeed i have lost all spirit about carrying on my life here
1677521 the fact is this trouble has come upon her confusedly we have not been able to speak to each other about it i am not sure what is in her mind about it she may fear that i have really done something base it is my fault i ought to be more open but i have been suffering cruelly
1677522 would she accept my sympathy i would tell her that you have not been blamable before any ones judgment but your own i would tell her that you shall be cleared in every fair mind i would cheer her heart will you ask her if i may go to see her i did see her once
1677523 she would feel honored cheered i think by the proof that you at least have some respect for me
1677524 and if mrs lydgate knew that there were friends who would believe in you and support you she might then be glad that you should stay in your place and recover your hopes and do what you meant to do perhaps then you would see that it was right to agree with what i proposed about your continuing at the hospital surely you would if you still have faith in it as a means of making your knowledge useful
1677525 a few days hence it will be early enough for me to send my answer to mr bulstrode
1677526 no i prefer that there should be no interval left for wavering i am no longer sure enough of myself i mean of what it would be possible for me to do under the changed circumstances of my life it would be dishonorable to let others engage themselves to anything serious in dependence on me i might be obliged to go away after all i see little chance of anything else the whole thing is too problematic i cannot consent to be the cause of your goodness being wasted no let the new hospital be joined with the old infirmary and everything go on as it might have done if i had never come i have kept a valuable register since i have been there i shall send it to a man who will make use of it
1677527 i can think of nothing for a long while but getting an income
1677528 it hurts me very much to hear you speak so hopelessly
1677529 it would be a happiness to your friends who believe in your future in your power to do great things if you would let them save you from that think how much money i have it would be like taking a burthen from me if you took some of it every year till you got free from this fettering want of income why should not people do these things it is so difficult to make shares at all even this is one way
1677530 it is good that you should have such feelings but i am not the man who ought to allow himself to benefit by them i have not given guarantees enough i must not at least sink into the degradation of being pensioned for work that i never achieved it is very clear to me that i must not count on anything else than getting away from middlemarch as soon as i can manage it i should not be able for a long while at the very best to get an income here and and it is easier to make necessary changes in a new place i must do as other men do and think what will please the world and bring in money look for a little opening in the london crowd and push myself set up in a watering place or go to some southern town where there are plenty of idle english and get myself puffed that is the sort of shell i must creep into and try to keep my soul alive in
1677531 yet you have made a great difference in my courage by believing in me everything seems more bearable since i have talked to you and if you can clear me in a few other minds especially in farebrothers i shall be deeply grateful the point i wish you not to mention is the fact of disobedience to my orders that would soon get distorted after all there is no evidence for me but peoples opinion of me beforehand you can only repeat my own report of myself
1677532 i can say of you what will make it stupidity to suppose that you would be bribed to do a wickedness
1677533 i have not taken a bribe yet but there is a pale shade of bribery which is sometimes called prosperity you will do me another great kindness then and come to see my wife
1677534 this young creature has a heart large enough for the virgin mary she evidently thinks nothing of her own future and would pledge away half her income at once as if she wanted nothing for herself but a chair to sit in from which she can look down with those clear eyes at the poor mortals who pray to her she seems to have what i never saw in any woman before a fountain of friendship towards men a man can make a friend of her casaubon must have raised some heroic hallucination in her i wonder if she could have any other sort of passion for a man ladislaw there was certainly an unusual feeling between them and casaubon must have had a notion of it well her love might help a man more than her money
1677535 and thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot to mark the full fraught man and best indued with some suspicion
1677536 if tertius goes away you will help us to move will you not papa i suppose we shall have very little money i am sure i hope some one will help us
1677537 yes child i dont mind a hundred or two i can see the end of that
1677538 there never did anybody look so pretty in a bonnet poor thing
1677539 i should like to manage it myself if i knew what to do with it
1677540 i shall take mrs lydgate good news and perhaps she will like to talk to me and make a friend of me
1677541 im not sure my lady ill see if youll please to walk in
1677542 will you please to walk in and ill go and see
1677543 excuse me mrs lydgate the servant did not know that you were here i called to deliver an important letter for mr lydgate which i wished to put into your own hands
1677544 and you dont see anything you look at arthur or anything you are going to do something uncomfortable i know is it all about mr lydgate or has something else happened
1677545 oh all the troubles of all people on the face of the earth
1677546 dear me dodo are you going to have a scheme for them
1677547 would it were yesterday and i i the grave with her sweet faith above for monument
1677548 you can easily go after mrs casaubon and explain your preference
1677549 do you think she would turn to look at me or value any word i ever uttered to her again at more than a dirty feather explain how can a man explain at the expense of a woman
1677550 do you suppose she would like me better for sacrificing you she is not a woman to be flattered because i made myself despicable to believe that i must be true to her because i was a dastard to you
1677551 i had no hope before not much of anything better to come
1677552 explain tell a man to explain how he dropped into hell explain my preference i never had a preference for her any more than i have a preference for breathing no other woman exists by the side of her i would rather touch her hand if it were dead than i would touch any other womans living
1677553 now i saw in my dream that just as they had ended their talk they drew nigh to a very miry slough that was in the midst of the plain and they being heedless did both fall suddenly into the bog
1677554 did not mrs lydgate tell you that i came this morning
1677555 no only a slight nervous shock the effect of some agitation she has been overwrought lately the truth is ladislaw i am an unlucky devil we have gone through several rounds of purgatory since you left and i have lately got on to a worse ledge of it than ever i suppose you are only just come down you look rather battered you have not been long enough in the town to hear anything
1677556 i travelled all night and got to the white hart at eight oclock this morning i have been shutting myself up and resting
1677557 i thought it better to tell you that your name is mixed up with the disclosures
1677558 you will be sure to hear it as soon as you turn out into the town i suppose it is true that raffles spoke to you
1677559 i shall be fortunate if gossip does not make me the most disreputable person in the whole affair i should think the latest version must be that i plotted with raffles to murder bulstrode and ran away from middlemarch for the purpose
1677560 here is a new ring in the sound of my name to recommend it in her hearing however what does it signify now
1677561 mrs casaubon has been the one person to come forward and say that she had no belief in any of the suspicions against me
1677562 i have lost my tortoise shell lozenge box i fear the kitten has rolled it away
1677563 a german box very pretty but if it falls it always spins away as far as it can
1677564 that is an affair of the heart with my aunt
1677565 if henrietta noble forms an attachment to any one mrs casaubon
1677566 it is true you must have half exhausted yourself in talking about lydgate that sort of work tells upon one after the excitement is over
1677567 what should i do how should i act now this very day if i could clutch my own pain and compel it to silence and think of those three
1677568 why madam youve never been in bed this blessed night
1677569 youll kill yourself you will anybody might think now you had a right to give yourself a little comfort
1677570 i have slept i am not ill i shall be glad of a cup of coffee as soon as possible and i want you to bring me my new dress and most likely i shall want my new bonnet to day
1677571 theyve lain there a month and more ready for you madam and most thankful i shall be to see you with a couple o pounds worth less of crape
1677572 theres a reason in mourning as ive always said and three folds at the bottom of your skirt and a plain quilling in your bonnet and if ever anybody looked like an angel its you in a net quilling is whats consistent for a second year at least thats my thinking
1677573 and if anybody was to marry me flattering himself i should wear those hijeous weepers two years for him hed be deceived by his own vanity thats all
1677574 du erde warst auch diese nacht bestandig und athmest neu erquickt zu meinen fussen beginnest schon mit lust mich zu umgeben zum regst und ruhrst ein kraftiges reschliessen zum hochsten dasein immerfort zu streben faust 2r theil
1677575 do you think that mrs lydgate can receive me this morning
1677576 if you will be kind enough to come in and let me tell her that you are here she has not been very well since you were here yesterday but she is better this morning and i think it is very likely that she will be cheered by seeing you again
1677577 i wrote this last night and was going to carry it to lowick in my ride when one is grateful for something too good for common thanks writing is less unsatisfactory than speech one does not at least hear how inadequate the words are
1677578 it is i who have most to thank for since you have let me take that place you have consented
1677579 ladislaw is come rosy he sat with me last night i dare say he will be here again to day i thought he looked rather battered and depressed
1677580 rosy dear mrs casaubon is come to see you again you would like to see her would you not
1677581 pray tell martha not to bring any one else into the drawing room
1677582 i had an errand yesterday which i did not finish that is why i am here again so soon you will not think me too troublesome when i tell you that i came to talk to you about the injustice that has been shown towards mr lydgate it will cheer you will it not to know a great deal about him that he may not like to speak about himself just because it is in his own vindication and to his own honor you will like to know that your husband has warm friends who have not left off believing in his high character you will let me speak of this without thinking that i take a liberty
1677583 i know you have been very good i shall like to hear anything you will say to me about tertius
1677584 when i had asked him to come to lowick to give me his opinion on the affairs of the hospital he told me everything about his conduct and feelings in this sad event which has made ignorant people cast suspicions on him the reason he told me was because i was very bold and asked him i believed that he had never acted dishonorably and i begged him to tell me the history he confessed to me that he had never told it before not even to you because he had a great dislike to say i was not wrong as if that were proof when there are guilty people who will say so the truth is he knew nothing of this man raffles or that there were any bad secrets about him and he thought that mr bulstrode offered him the money because he repented out of kindness of having refused it before all his anxiety about his patient was to treat him rightly and he was a little uncomfortable that the case did not end as he had expected but he thought then and still thinks that there may have been no wrong in it on any ones part and i have told mr farebrother and mr brooke and sir james chettam they all believe in your husband that will cheer you will it not that will give you courage
1677585 and he felt that he had been so wrong not to pour out everything about this to you but you will forgive him it was because he feels so much more about your happiness than anything else he feels his life bound into one with yours and it hurts him more than anything that his misfortunes must hurt you he could speak to me because i am an indifferent person and then i asked him if i might come to see you because i felt so much for his trouble and yours that is why i came yesterday and why i am come to day trouble is so hard to bear is it not how can we live and think that any one has trouble piercing trouble and we could help them and never try
1677586 i thought his looks were sadly changed with suffering the other day i had not seen him for many weeks before he said he had been feeling very lonely in his trial but i think he would have borne it all better if he had been able to be quite open with you
1677587 tertius is so angry and impatient if i say anything
1677588 he ought not to wonder that i object to speak to him on painful subjects
1677589 what he said of you was that he could not be happy in doing anything which made you unhappy that his marriage was of course a bond which must affect his choice about everything and for that reason he refused my proposal that he should keep his position at the hospital because that would bind him to stay in middlemarch and he would not undertake to do anything which would be painful to you he could say that to me because he knows that i had much trial in my marriage from my husbands illness which hindered his plans and saddened him and he knows that i have felt how hard it is to walk always in fear of hurting another who is tied to us
1677590 when you came in yesterday it was not as you thought
1677591 he was telling me how he loved another woman that i might know he could never love me
1677592 and now i think he hates me because because you mistook him yesterday he says it is through me that you will think ill of him think that he is a false person but it shall not be through me he has never had any love for me i know he has not he has always thought slightly of me he said yesterday that no other woman existed for him beside you the blame of what happened is entirely mine he said he could never explain to you because of me he said you could never think well of him again but now i have told you and he cannot reproach me any more
1677593 i did not think that you would be so good i was very unhappy i am not happy now everything is so sad
1677594 but better days will come your husband will be rightly valued and he depends on you for comfort he loves you best the worst loss would be to lose that and you have not lost it
1677595 after i went away i was haunted by two pale faces mrs casaubon looked as much in need of care as you rosy and i thought that i had not done my duty in leaving you together so when i had been to colemans i came home again i noticed that you were walking mrs casaubon and the sky has changed i think we may have rain may i send some one to order your carriage to come for you
1677596 mrs lydgate and i have chatted a great deal and it is time for me to go i have always been accused of being immoderate and saying too much
1677597 what do you think of mrs casaubon now you have seen so much of her
1677598 and she is very beautiful if you go to talk to her so often you will be more discontented with me than ever
1677599 but has she made you any less discontented with me
1677600 how heavy your eyes are tertius and do push your hair back
1677601 i have told mrs casaubon she is not under any mistake about you i told her because she came to see me and was very kind you will have nothing to reproach me with now i shall not have made any difference to you
1677602 and now good morrow to our waking souls which watch not one another out of fear for love all love of other sights controls and makes one little room an everywhere
1677603 am i wanted for anything i shall be so glad if i can do anything
1677604 he fears he has offended you and has begged me to ask if you will see him for a few minutes
1677605 else i must go back and say no and that will hurt him
1677606 if i love him too much it is because he has been used so ill
1677607 i fear you think me foolish and perhaps wrong for coming back so soon i have been punished for my impatience you know every one knows now a painful story about my parentage i knew of it before i went away and i always meant to tell you of it if if we ever met again
1677608 i wished you to know that something connected with it something which happened before i went away helped to bring me down here again at least i thought it excused my coming it was the idea of getting bulstrode to apply some money to a public purpose some money which he had thought of giving me perhaps it is rather to bulstrodes credit that he privately offered me compensation for an old injury he offered to give me a good income to make amends but i suppose you know the disagreeable story
1677609 you know that it must be altogether painful to me
1677610 i did not choose to accept an income from such a source i was sure that you would not think well of me if i did so
1677611 you acted as i should have expected you to act
1677612 i did not believe that you would let any circumstance of my birth create a prejudice in you against me though it was sure to do so in others
1677613 if it were a new hardship it would be a new reason for me to cling to you
1677614 but thinking that you were different not so good as i had believed you to be
1677615 you are sure to believe me better than i am in everything but one
1677616 i mean in my truth to you when i thought you doubted of that i didnt care about anything that was left i thought it was all over with me and there was nothing to try for only things to endure
1677617 see how dark the clouds have become and how the trees are tossed
1677618 that was a wrong thing for you to say that you would have had nothing to try for if we had lost our own chief good other peoples good would remain and that is worth trying for some can be happy i seemed to see that more clearly than ever when i was the most wretched i can hardly think how i could have borne the trouble if that feeling had not come to me to make strength
1677619 you have never felt the sort of misery i felt
1677620 but i have felt worse it was worse to think ill
1677621 we may at least have the comfort of speaking to each other without disguise since i must go away since we must always be divided you may think of me as one on the brink of the grave
1677622 even if you loved me as well as i love you even if i were everything to you i shall most likely always be very poor on a sober calculation one can count on nothing but a creeping lot it is impossible for us ever to belong to each other it is perhaps base of me to have asked for a word from you i meant to go away into silence but i have not been able to do what i meant
1677623 i would rather share all the trouble of our parting
1677624 it is as fatal as a murder or any other horror that divides people
1677625 it is more intolerable to have our life maimed by petty accidents
1677626 it is cruel of you to speak in that way as if there were any comfort you may see beyond the misery of it but i dont it is unkind it is throwing back my love for you as if it were a trifle to speak in that way in the face of the fact we can never be married
1677627 what is the use of counting on any success of mine it is a mere toss up whether i shall ever do more than keep myself decently unless i choose to sell myself as a mere pen and a mouthpiece i can see that clearly enough i could not offer myself to any woman even if she had no luxuries to renounce
1677628 we could live quite well on my own fortune it is too much seven hundred a year i want so little no new clothes and i will learn what everything costs
1677629 though it be songe of old and yonge that i sholde be to blame theyrs be the charge that spoke so large in hurtynge of my name
1677630 it would be very nice though if he were a viscount and his lordships little tooth coming through he might have been if james had been an earl
1677631 jamess title is worth far more than any new earldom i never wished his father to be anything else than sir james
1677632 dont take the throwing out of the bill so much to heart brooke youve got all the riff raff of the country on your side
1677633 thrown out you know eh the lords are going too far though theyll have to pull up sad news you know i mean here at home sad news but you must not blame me chettam
1677634 not another gamekeeper shot i hope its what i should expect when a fellow like trapping bass is let off so easily
1677635 gamekeeper no let us go in i can tell you all in the house you know
1677636 when you are a magistrate youll not find it so easy to commit severity is all very well but its a great deal easier when youve got somebody to do it for you you have a soft place in your heart yourself you not a draco a jeffreys that sort of thing
1677637 im dying to know the sad news the gamekeeper is not shot that is settled what is it then
1677638 im glad you and the rector are here its a family matter but you will help us all to bear it cadwallader ive got to break it to you my dear
1677639 well you know chettam i couldnt help casaubons will it was a sort of will to make things worse
1677640 another time you will admit that i have some foresight or rather you will contradict me and be just as blind as ever you supposed that the young gentleman was gone out of the country
1677641 i went to lowick dorothea sent for me you know it had come about quite suddenly neither of them had any idea two days ago not any idea you know theres something singular in things but dorothea is quite determined it is no use opposing i put it strongly to her i did my duty chettam but she can act as she likes you know
1677642 it would have been better if i had called him out and shot him a year ago
1677643 that is not so very easy for a man of any dignity with any sense of right when the affair happens to be in his own family
1677644 it is perfectly scandalous if ladislaw had had a spark of honor he would have gone out of the country at once and never shown his face in it again however i am not surprised the day after casaubons funeral i said what ought to be done but i was not listened to
1677645 you wanted him shipped off i told you ladislaw was not to be done as we liked with he had his ideas he was a remarkable fellow i always said he was a remarkable fellow
1677646 it is rather a pity you formed that high opinion of him we are indebted to that for his being lodged in this neighborhood we are indebted to that for seeing a woman like dorothea degrading herself by marrying him
1677647 a man so marked out by her husbands will that delicacy ought to have forbidden her from seeing him again who takes her out of her proper rank into poverty has the meanness to accept such a sacrifice has always had an objectionable position a bad origin and i believe is a man of little principle and light character that is my opinion
1677648 i cannot bear to see her again it is too painful it hurts me too much that a woman like dorothea should have done what is wrong
1677649 mrs casaubon may be acting imprudently she is giving up a fortune for the sake of a man and we men have so poor an opinion of each other that we can hardly call a woman wise who does that but i think you should not condemn it as a wrong action in the strict sense of the word
1677650 i think that dorothea commits a wrong action in marrying ladislaw
1677651 my dear fellow we are rather apt to consider an act wrong because it is unpleasant to us
1677652 she said she never would marry again not anybody at all
1677653 oh there is usually a silent exception in such cases
1677654 the only wonder to me is that any of you are surprised you did nothing to hinder it if you would have had lord triton down here to woo her with his philanthropy he might have carried her off before the year was over there was no safety in anything else mr casaubon had prepared all this as beautifully as possible he made himself disagreeable or it pleased god to make him so and then he dared her to contradict him its the way to make any trumpery tempting to ticket it at a high price in that way
1677655 hes not a man we can take into the family at least i must speak for myself
1677656 i suppose others will find his society too pleasant to care about the propriety of the thing
1677657 i cant turn my back on dorothea i must be a father to her up to a certain point i said my dear i wont refuse to give you away i had spoken strongly before but i can cut off the entail you know it will cost money and be troublesome but i can do it you know
1677658 do you mean that dodo is going to be married directly uncle
1677659 i should not make any fuss about it if she likes to be poor that is her affair nobody would have said anything if she had married the young fellow because he was rich plenty of beneficed clergy are poorer than they will be here is elinor
1677660 she vexed her friends by me i had hardly a thousand a year i was a lout nobody could see anything in me my shoes were not the right cut all the men wondered how a woman could like me upon my word i must take ladislaws part until i hear more harm of him
1677661 everything is all one that is the beginning and end with you as if you had not been a cadwallader does any one suppose that i would have taken such a monster as you by any other name
1677662 elinor cannot be said to have descended below her rank it is difficult to say what mr ladislaw is eh james
1677663 it must be admitted that his blood is a frightful mixture
1677664 the casaubon cuttle fish fluid to begin with and then a rebellious polish fiddler or dancing master was it
1677665 he is like the fine old crichley portraits before the idiots came in
1677666 you must all come and dine with me to morrow you know eh celia my dear
1677667 that is to say if it is not to meet anybody else
1677668 dorothea would not come you know unless you had been to see her
1677669 do you mind about my having the carriage to go to lowick james
1677670 what is the use of saying that however im going to the stables ill tell briggs to bring the carriage round
1677671 i have not brought arthur because i was in a hurry
1677672 you have disappointed us all so and i cant think that it ever will be you never can go and live in that way and then there are all your plans you never can have thought of that james would have taken any trouble for you and you might have gone on all your life doing what you liked
1677673 i never could do anything that i liked i have never carried out any plan yet
1677674 because you always wanted things that wouldnt do but other plans would have come and how can you marry mr ladislaw that we none of us ever thought you could marry it shocks james so dreadfully and then it is all so different from what you have always been you would have mr casaubon because he had such a great soul and was so and dismal and learned and now to think of marrying mr ladislaw who has got no estate or anything i suppose it is because you must be making yourself uncomfortable in some way or other
1677675 if you dont ever see me it will not be my fault
1677676 how can i come to you or have you with me when james cant bear it that is because he thinks it is not right he thinks you are so wrong dodo but you always were wrong only i cant help loving you and nobody can think where you will live where can you go
1677677 how can you always live in a street and you will be so poor i could give you half my things only how can i when i never see you
1677678 but it would be much better if you would not be married
1677679 then there would be nothing uncomfortable and you would not do what nobody thought you could do james always said you ought to be a queen but this is not at all being like a queen you know what mistakes you have always been making dodo and this is another nobody thinks mr ladislaw a proper husband for you and you said you would never be married again
1677680 it is quite true that i might be a wiser person celia
1677681 and that i might have done something better if i had been better but this is what i am going to do i have promised to marry mr ladislaw and i am going to marry him
1677682 only i rather you had such a sort of husband as james is with a place very near that i could drive to
1677683 if you knew how it came about it would not seem wonderful to you
1677684 no dear you would have to feel with me else you would never know
1677685 tell me anything that you would like to have me do harriet
1677686 i mean with regard to arrangements of property it is my intention not to sell the land i possess in this neighborhood but to leave it to you as a safe provision if you have any wish on such subjects do not conceal it from me
1677687 i should like to do something for my brothers family nicholas and i think we are bound to make some amends to rosamond and her husband walter says mr lydgate must leave the town and his practice is almost good for nothing and they have very little left to settle anywhere with i would rather do without something for ourselves to make some amends to my poor brothers family
1677688 it is not possible to carry out your wish in the way you propose my dear mr lydgate has virtually rejected any further service from me he has returned the thousand pounds which i lent him mrs casaubon advanced him the sum for that purpose here is his letter
1677689 there is another means harriet by which i might do a service to your brothers family if you like to act in it and it would i think be beneficial to you it would be an advantageous way of managing the land which i mean to be yours
1677690 garth once thought of undertaking the management of stone court in order to place your nephew fred there the stock was to remain as it is and they were to pay a certain share of the profits instead of an ordinary rent that would be a desirable beginning for the young man in conjunction with his employment under garth would it be a satisfaction to you
1677691 poor walter is so cast down i would try anything in my power to do him some good before i go away we have always been brother and sister
1677692 you must state to him that the land is virtually yours and that he need have no transactions with me communications can be made through standish i mention this because garth gave up being my agent i can put into your hands a paper which he himself drew up stating conditions and you can propose his renewed acceptance of them i think it is not unlikely that he will accept when you propose the thing for the sake of your nephew
1677693 le coeur se sature damour comme dun sel divin qui le conserve de la lincorruptible adherence de ceux qui se sont aimes des laube de la vie et la fraicheur des vielles amours prolonges
1677694 oh yes a good dinner cold mutton and i dont know what where is mary
1677695 no are you going out again without taking tea caleb
1677696 it will be a sad while before you can be married mary
1677697 not a sad while father i mean to be merry
1677698 i have been single and merry for four and twenty years and more i suppose it will not be quite as long again as that
1677699 now father you did praise him last wednesday you said he had an uncommon notion of stock and a good eye for things
1677700 yes i put it all down and the date anno domini and everything
1677701 you like things to be neatly booked and then his behavior to you father is really good he has a deep respect for you and it is impossible to have a better temper than fred has
1677702 ay ay you want to coax me into thinking him a fine match
1677703 no indeed father i dont love him because he is a fine match
1677704 oh dear because i have always loved him i should never like scolding any one else so well and that is a point to be thought of in a husband
1677705 theres no other wish come into it since things have been going on as they have been of late
1677706 because better late than never a woman must not force her do a man no good by that
1677707 i shall be constant to fred as long as he is constant to me i dont think either of us could spare the other or like any one else better however much we might admire them it would make too great a difference to us like seeing all the old places altered and changing the name for everything we must wait for each other a long while but fred knows that
1677708 well ive got a bit of news what do you think of fred going to live at stone court and managing the land there
1677709 he would manage it for his aunt bulstrode the poor woman has been to me begging and praying she wants to do the lad good and it might be a fine thing for him with saving he might gradually buy the stock and he has a turn for farming
1677710 oh fred would be so happy it is too good to believe
1677711 i must take it on my shoulders and be responsible and see after everything and that will grieve your mother a bit though she maynt say so fred had need be careful
1677712 there would be no happiness in bringing you any fresh trouble
1677713 nay nay work is my delight child when it doesnt vex your mother and then if you and fred get married
1677714 hell be steady and saving and youve got your mothers cleverness and mine too in a womans sort of way and youll keep him in order hell be coming by and by so i wanted to tell you first because i think youd like to tell him by yourselves after that i could talk it well over with him and we could go into business and the nature of things
1677715 i wonder if any other girl thinks her father the best man in the world
1677716 husbands are an inferior class of men who require keeping in order
1677717 just look at the edges of these coat cuffs it is only by dint of good brushing that i look respectable i am saving up three suits one for a wedding suit
1677718 how very droll you will look like a gentleman in an old fashion book
1677719 why not one lives on them better than on unflattering ones if we cant be married in two years the truth will be quite bad enough when it comes
1677720 i have heard a story of a young gentleman who once encouraged flattering expectations and they did him harm
1677721 mary if youve got something discouraging to tell me i shall bolt i shall go into the house to mr garth i am out of spirits my father is so cut up home is not like itself i cant bear any more bad news
1677722 should you call it bad news to be told that you were to live at stone court and manage the farm and be remarkably prudent and save money every year till all the stock and furniture were your own and you were a distinguished agricultural character as mr borthrop trumbull says rather stout i fear and with the greek and latin sadly weather worn
1677723 that is what my father has just told me of as what may happen and he never talks nonsense
1677724 oh i could be a tremendously good fellow then mary and we could be married directly
1677725 not so fast sir how do you know that i would not rather defer our marriage for some years that would leave you time to misbehave and then if i liked some one else better i should have an excuse for jilting you
1677726 tell me seriously that all this is true and that you are happy because of it because you love me best
1677727 it is all true fred and i am happy because of it because i love you best
1677728 when we were first engaged with the umbrella ring mary you used to
1677729 fred and mary are you ever coming in or may i eat your cake
1677730 cultivation of green crops and the economy of cattle feeding
1677731 that would be too great a trial to your mother
1677732 he was ten times worthier of you than i was
1677733 and for that reason he could do better without me but you i shudder to think what you would have been a curate in debt for horse hire and cambric pocket handkerchiefs
1677734 dorothea has a little boy and you will not let me go and see her and i am sure she wants to see me and she will not know what to do with the baby she will do wrong things with it and they thought she would die it is very dreadful suppose it had been me and little arthur and dodo had been hindered from coming to see me i wish you would be less unkind james
1677735 what do you wish i will do anything you like i will take you to town to morrow if you wish it
1677736 my dear sir it is not for me to dictate to you but for my part i would let that alone i would let things remain as they are

1677792 i no longer crave salt i am enormously content with my loss of weight but primarily perhaps i take understandable pride and pleasure in my feeling of well being and in the knowledge that my new regime is an altogether positive way of living
1677793 i was quietly furious emotionally embittered and frustrated it was not the frustration of the moment but an accumulation of emotions that had engulfed my body almost since birth it seemed to me that in this episode it was as though scores of years lives hopes generations of sons and mothers were involved in this evening at the waldorf a curious place for southerners of that generation
1677794 that part of my brain that was trained in public relations was vigorously triggered quicker than you can say georges auguste escoffier i thought i could turn this offer to my own profit i did not bid on that meal with visions of caviar and foie gras racing through my brain my vision was and cynicism be damned that i could capture a few inches of space in one newspaper or another if i played the game right
1677795 so blanches kitchen became my playground when blanche fried chicken i always got a piece of crisply cooked gizzard or a chicken wing to stay my appetite until supper
1677796 hugh as long as you live dont ever call me craig again im mr claiborne
1677797 an hour must have passed before i summoned the courage to push open the door of that kitchen
1677798 blanche never held me again and ever after i was mr claiborne persona non grata in the world of my childhood the place where i once had been hugged and loved even perhaps needed

1677803 listening coupled with regular periods of reflection are essential to the growth of the servant leader the most successful servant leaders are those who have become skilled empathetic listeners
1677804 most people and leaders do not listen with the intent to understand they listen with the intent to reply the essence of empathetic listening is not that you agree with someone its that you fully deeply understand that person emotionally as well as intellectually
1677805 i have a hunch that this is what we ought to do
1677806 this is what the church needs this is what business needs this is what society needs
1677807 for you know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own children
1677808 as apostles of christ we could have been a burden to you mother caring for her little children
1677809 to prepare gods people for works of service so that the body of christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the son of god and become mature attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of christ
1677810 you know that the rulers of the gentiles lord it over them and their high officials exercise authority over them not so with you instead whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant and whoever wants to be first must be your slave just as the son of man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many
1677811 but even if i am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service coming from your faith i am glad and rejoice with all of you
1677812 leadership is always the problem and leadership is always the answer
1677813 level 5 refers to a five level hierarchy of executive capabilities with level 5 at the top level 5 leaders embody a paradoxical mix of personal humility and professional will they are ambitious to be sure but ambitious first and foremost for the company or organization and not themselves level 5 leaders are fanatically driven infected with an incurable need to produce sustained results they are resolved to do whatever it takes to make the company great no matter how big or hard the decisions
1677814 level 5 leaders look out the window to attribute success to factors other than themselves when things go poorly however they look in the mirror and blame themselves taking full responsibility other kinds of leaders do just the opposite they look in the mirror to take credit for success but out the window to assign blame for disappointing results

1677823 cattells influence in the society of friends has been unparalleled with respect to the conceptualization of the nature of christian missions and in establishing a model of sorts of an evangelical ecumenicism a notable strength of cattell is that he provides enough clarity and conviction to address those who are hazy and unconvinced yet he also provides enough ambiguity to humble the most self assured

1677840 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised

1677844 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1677845 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1677846 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
1677847 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
1677848 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

1677859 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price

1677870 to the extent that these requests are sent to organizations that engage in telemarketing and that are therefore subject to the rules regarding do not call lists these requests would be in compliance with the telecommunications act and the current unsolicited telecommunications rules
1677871 i consider that do not call requests made through ioptout are valid and should be honoured
1677872 its difficult for banks to amend that profile unless theyre sure its that person who is actually making the request
1677873 you could have a competitor go through the phone book and download all sorts of names to go on your list just so you cant market to those people anymore
1677874 what we can see for now is she has wounds to her head we dont know exactly how these wounds were inflicted but there is blood on her head

1677884 americans rate price gouging by the oil companies price gouging by foreign oil producers and a lack of effective action by congress as the most important reasons why the price of gasoline is so high essentially equating congressional inaction with price gouging
1677885 i want to do everything i can to advance the agenda of my district but to the extent that i can i also want to have a broader debate about the way we run government in illinois

1677915 isi has been involved in the terror attacks against the indian embassy in kabul and the organisation needs to be reined in unless funds to the taliban dry out the us is in for a long haul in afghanistan kapoor said while referring to the situation in the war torn country
1677916 we have condemned in strongest words the act of terror against the indian embassy in kabul india says there is proof of isi involvement in the attack but it has been over a month and no proof has been provided despite pakistans demand for this
1677917 pakistans effort in the global war against terror including in afghanistan is greater than any other country
1677918 as good neighbours i will not react to your comments
1677919 terrorism is affecting all of us it is better to join forces to rid the region of terror
1677920 if i just listened and kept quiet it would have meant i was agreeing to the allegations of isi involvement in the kabul blast
1677921 irretrievable damage has been done to the couple who lost their only child this is unthinkable in a democracy
1677922 media must know that it does not affect judicial minds

1677924 the frequent and recently intensified disturbances are not only delaying the projects but are showing west bengal in a poor light
1677925 these agitations are turning the clock back and fuelling negative perceptions that will unarguably slow down the current growth momentum and choke any future investment prospects in the state
1677926 we appreciate that both agriculture and industry have important roles to play in the developmental process if there is any dispute we firmly believe that the same can always be sorted out amicably

1677931 youre bored youre bickering and youre bored already what are you gonna do in ten years
1677932 sounds like you need a break before you need a
1677933 i feel good im doing some exercises on my own in order not to contaminate the rest of the squad
1677934 myself and jimmy bell have enjoyed our time here and there arent many clubs that employ managers for this long im the fourth longest serving manager in the league its been an enjoyable task so far and hopefully itll continue to be that way
1677935 if you havent got that enthusiasm then you should pack it in ive been looking forward to playing football this season as much as i can remember looking forward to playing football i cant wait for the games to come the minute that you lose that its time to look for another job i cant see us ever losing that
1677936 well obviously we had our own ambitions but maybe its happened a bit quicker than everyone anticipated its been hard work but ive always been an advocate that you can always raise peoples expectations but you cant lower them
1677937 i think the fans themselves wouldnt have dreamt it all those years ago when we were playing lincoln united first up and its hard to give them a reality check because you dont want to go back to those situations
1677938 well if it goes to the cycle then well win the league this season
1677939 all you do is do your best and weve always had that philosophy weve always not beaten ourselves up over results and focused on form and how weve been playing
1677940 weve still improved our league position every year and theres no other team that has done that in the football league thats an impressive record that we want to keep but we also want to improve as a team and grow as a club and thats difficult but were doing our best to do it
1677941 id like to think that if we have an objective this season itll be to play better football at home and give the fans something to be proud of
1677942 i think you have to alter your football to suit accordingly last season was just something that im hoping was a blip and something foreign to us because we didnt play with our normal style hopefully we can get back to how weve always played
1677943 i think last season you wouldve had to say that peterborough and mk dons before the season started with the money that they had and the clout that they had were always going to be the ones to go up
1677944 this year i think there are a lot of teams who are capable of doing it and itll be the ones that find their feet quickest find a bit of luck and believe in themselves
1677945 but we had a chat at the end of last season as i just felt that at his age i would have hated him to finish his career and look back and say i could have done better because i believe he can
1677946 i think hes got everything in his locker to be a top player
1677947 we gave him a programme for over the summer and to be fair to robbie he went away and worked his socks off and came back a couple of kilos lighter
1677948 hes probably felt better himself and thats all credit to him
1677949 we can give people the benefit of experience but ultimately it will be up to each and every player to bring what they can to the party
1677950 hes been desperate to play in every game of pre season so if hes feeling good about himself then thats pleasing for me to hear because then i know ive got somebody whos both mentally and physically right
1677951 every player goes away and thinks long and hard in the summer and i thought losing weight was going to be the best thing for me
1677952 i was running virtually every day and eating the right foods not having the two week party where you go away and have a few drinks i couldnt do that with a small child either
1677953 i feel quicker too im not a pacy player anyway but i do actually feel a little bit sharper off the mark
1677954 that might be in my head but even if it is its still beneficial to me
1677955 judging by pre season i think its beneficial that i have lost a bit of weight
1677956 ive lost between eight and 10 pounds it was a gradual loss as well it wasnt sudden it was over the summer doing things right and eating well
1677957 and im determined to stay in shape its just a nice feeling
1677958 when software is hard to use dont make excuses for it improve it when a user makes a mistake dont blame the user ask how the software misled them then fix it the users time is more valuable than ours respect it good ui design is humble
1677959 we know where we missed out last season probably through our home form more than anything
1677960 the four teams who were bottom of the league came here and took the 12 points
1677961 you put those 12 points on our tally at the end of the season youre in the play offs virtually
1677962 we know what weve got to do were willing to do it and weve got the players to do it
1677963 i think weve got a better squad of players than last year and we had a good squad then
1677964 i dont think youre going to have a runaway team in this championship its going to be the same as last season
1677965 everybody can beat everybody its just about getting a bit of consistency
1677966 turf moors a difficult place to come to for any team and we know well certainly beat where we were last year and hopefully its onwards and upwards for us
1677967 kyles obviously a big loss hes a powerful lad and hes only going to improve and he was a good asset for us last season
1677968 but weve brought a number of players in who can certainly fill his boots and weve brought a lot of quality as well
1677969 its a big loss but youve got to get over it teams lose players and youve got to rebuild and i think thats what weve done
1677970 weve certainly got good enough players who have come in to do the job for us
1677971 tugay can definitely play a part for us not just on the field but off the field
1677972 the lads look up to him and its important that even if hes not playing hes making sure things are right in the dressing room and stuff like that
1677973 but when he does comes on his variety of passing is different class and im pleased ive got him for another year
1677974 it all depends on what formation you want to play
1677975 there are certain formations where i could have tugay sitting in midfield
1677976 its horses for courses it depends on what teams we are playing against
1677977 but the lad has definitely got quality thats for sure and its certainly something we can use throughout the season
1677978 it was slightly different for me because i was more of a tackler a box to box player so my legs used to go and id struggle a bit
1677979 tugay is not that sort of player hes more of a sprayer and runs the game that way
1677980 i am very proud to have the opportunity to work with paul ince everybody in world football knows what a great player he was and to have the opportunity to learn from him is fantastic it can only help to make me a better player

1677991 the atmosphere was friendly and bubbly and i am here to work hard learn and to impress
1677992 hecha con inteligencia y sensibilidad art stica y que pueden disfrutar los ni os de este pa s am n de que se puede recomendar a los padres con mente abierta y con ganas de que sus hijos no vean las historias chabacanas y simplonas que pululan por todas partes
1677993 este trabajo nos muestra que el pensar en los ni os como seres inteligentes capaces de procesar los s mbolos art sticos para darles una interpretaci n acorde con su realidad adem s de calidad conceptual e interpretativa es lo menos que se les puede ofrecer
1677994 los bailarines acuden al hecho esc nico como seres polim rficos y no le dan ninguna concesi n a los personajes y situaciones estramb ticas surgiendo como apariciones inefables y et reas que elevan a la c spide sensual para despu s observar c mo se transforman con la velocidad de la vida en la ciudad
1677995 hace poco tiempo pero muy poco tiempo en realidad apenas ayer y en un lugar cercano tan cercano como tus manos vivi un hombre que se llam a s mismo el hombre que s lo sab a amar pero ten a un peque o problema peque o porque en ese lugar nada era grande y nada era mediano de otra manera no cab a nada estaba encima de algo y todo estaba encima de nada porque todo estaba en su lugar pero l no ten a a quien amar
1677996 it is no surprise that theyve all gone on to manage at premier league clubs as they are all leaders
1677997 we took great pride in the fact that the statistics showed that there was no fitter team in the premier league than blackburn
1677998 we aim to make sure that is the case with city
1677999 appointing phil and loz has been a big move because its allowed me to move a big chunk of the workload onto them and theyve done a fantastic job
1678000 ive got the signings i needed off the pitch and weve brought some very good players in on the field as well
1678001 the boys weve brought in look hungry full of desire and some of the football we played in pre season has been breathtaking
1678002 everybody has high hopes before the start of a new season and im no different
1678003 we have driven a winning mentality into the players and i know theres a bit if a buzz going around the league about what were doing here
1678004 the new boys did well especially shorrock who is strong with either foot
1678005 collinge was safe in goal and crossley took his two goals really well
1678006 losing kevin is a big blow for us so finding a new striker is our main priority
1678007 every club wants a 20 goal a season player and we were lucky to have two in kevin and liam
1678008 we are more or less like for like in other departments
1678009 weve lost a few players but brought in others as natural replacements
1678010 we started the season with eight or nine players missing and suffered a couple of early defeats
1678011 but once we got all our players back we showed what we could do
1678012 after christmas we had the second best record in the division so it is important that we keep our players fit and get off to a good start this time around
1678013 pre season is going well so far weve taken something out of every pre season game and were improving all the time
1678014 the young players have been like a breath of fresh air and its given me and my assistant phil brown a real boost
1678015 and the players who remain from last season have shown a real appetite for the job
1678016 there was a losing mentality under the old regime and were trying to change that
1678017 were hoping to develop the young talent and although inexperience may be our undoing at times people certainly wont take us lightly
1678018 escritos cr ticos con el nuevo psoe que dirige rodr guez zapatero
1678019 tambi n lo hago para distanciarme de quienes quieren usarme como ariete contra el psoe
1678020 la cr tica constructiva no existe pues es una forma sutil de sometimiento o de elogio
1678021 rodr guez zapatero ha sacado del baile interno no hablo de listas electorales a toda una generaci n de socialistas a la que pertenezco y no estoy dispuesto a aplaudir la jugada
1678022 jugada que por cierto el secretario general parece querer repetir con sus conmilitones de lo que se llam nueva v a
1678023 creo como muchos compa eros del psoe que durante la primera legislatura de zapatero hubo abundantes decisiones estrat gicas err neas y peligrosas como fue abrir el mel n territorial que no se sabe adonde nos puede llevar y no pocas ocurrencias algunas car simas

1678033 esto no son cifras o datos que jos luis rodr guez zapatero ponga en una lista compar ndolos con datos de crecimiento de empleo sino que
1678034 es un disparate para un pa s que necesita de crecimiento y para un pa s democr tico como es espa a
1678035 el mes de julio es importante para la creaci n de empleo porque el sector servicios con el turismo al frente y con la hosteler a hace que cree el empleo en nuestro pa s aunque sean temporales
1678036 pues este a o se ha destruido empleo y es e l segundo mes consecutivo en el que baja la afiliaci n a la seguridad social y esto no ocurr a en nuestro pa s desde hace much simo tiempo
1678037 datos muy alarmantes para que el gobierno ponga encima de la mesa y diga qu es lo que quiere hacer cu les son las medidas a aplicar y c mo van a sacar a nuestro pa s de esta tremenda crisis

1678043 we were disturbed to learn that china has refused his visa we are taking the matter very seriously
1678044 i asked for a reason and they said we dont give reasons
1678045 i said who else can i speak to about this and they said there is no other recourse
1678046 im not surprised they did this because they said they were going to keep out activists
1678047 but these are legitimate olympians with a history with the olympics id sure like to know what the international olympic committee has to say about this i think its really disappointing
1678048 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1678049 and we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
1678050 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
1678051 this speech puts together what the president has been saying for seven and a half years but does it in a very focused way
1678052 is one of the most important relationships that we have in the united states and the speech is being given on the eve of his trip there so he thought it was appropriate to talk about it at this point
1678053 absurd to try to sustain the claim that americas policies are principled while then effectively standing back and saying we will watch from the sidelines while the chinese do what they do

1678091 no est incluido en el calendario coordinado de partidos internacionales y no hay una decisi n espec fica del comit ejecutivo de la fifa que establezca la obligaci n de los clubes de liberar a los jugadores menores de 23 a os para este torneo
1678092 los requisitos que justifican una obligaci n legal de los clubes para liberar a los jugadores sobre la base de la tradici n no se cumplen indic el tas en la decisi n de su panel de tres jueces

1678095 la fifa est sorprendida y decepcionada por la decisi n pero la respetamos declar su presidente joseph blatter seg n un comunicado de prensa
1678096 no obstante les pido a los clubes dejen que sus jugadores participen en los juegos ol mpicos
1678097 ser a un acto solidario que armonizar a perfectamente con el esp ritu ol mpico ser a maravilloso tanto para los jugadores como para los aficionados y el propio deporte agreg blatter
1678098 las relaciones entre la fifa y los clubes no est n tan bien como deber an y parece que hubo una falta de clarificaci n por ambas partes ahora vamos a trabajar con la fifa para que las reglas ayuden a los atletas en un futuro a participar en los juegos ol mpicos indic felli
1678099 me siento muy triste por los atletas porque ya ellos estaban aqu so ando con representar a sus pa ses y ahora no podr n hacerlo agreg

1678101 quedar an sujetos a una violaci n de sus contratos
1678102 este es el momento de sentarse en la mesa y encontrar una soluci n razonable dijo reeb

1678104 messi va a jugar todos los juegos ol mpicos para argentina se va quedar todo el torneo yo habl con l y l me dijo eso
1678105 s que lionel quiere quedarse con el plantel yo no me voy a meter en temas legales pero ma ana jueves va a salir a jugar y lo va a hacer durante todo el campeonato
1678106 cualquier entrenador quiere tener a messi en su equipo pero el barcelona tambi n puede tomar la decisi n de que se quede aqu
1678107 no estoy preocupado por ello espero que la decisi n no tenga consecuencias con jugadores de otros clubes que est n en el campeonato
1678108 la buena voluntad y el sentido com n de la fifa y los clubes para encontrar una soluci n razonable

1678118 sunday was a great day for the club but particularly for andy robinson he flew in from fuengirola for the game flew back out to his family on monday and hes coming back tomorrow for the weekend
1678119 that shows real commitment to the cause and were delighted for him
1678120 andy took the job four years ago and weve finished in the top three for the last two seasons
1678121 we havent won the league since 1999 and with andy being a one club man it would be a great thing for him
1678122 we have a great mix of youth and experience and were looking forward to the run in
1678123 weve got a good bowling attack led by our professional kashif siddique and a good batting line up
1678124 peter usher was the man of the match on sunday and hes been a very useful player for us
1678125 he bowled well and took a stunning catch to get rid of ribblesdales danger man joe scuderi and it really set us up

1678133 no afecta al estatus de los jugadores oficialmente convocados por su comit ol mpico nacional que siguen siendo seleccionables para competir en los juegos ol mpicos de pek n
1678134 a la vista de la recomendaci n de la fifa a los clubes de liberar a sus jugadores y en aras del esp ritu ol mpico el tas hace un llamamiento a la fifa y a los clubes para que adopten una soluci n razonable con buena voluntad y sentido com n en relaci n con aquellos jugadores que deseen representar a su pa s en los juegos ol mpicos
1678135 el calendario internacional de partidos no tiene importancia alguna en el momento en que se establece si los clubes tienen la obligaci n de liberar a sus jugadores para el torneo ol mpico de f tbol masculino
1678136 representan una oportunidad nica para los atletas de cualquier disciplina deportiva y que por tanto no podr a justificarse que se impidiera a cualquier jugador menor de 23 a os participar en ese acontecimiento en caso de que su equipo representativo se hubiese clasificado
1678137 lo normal es que ahora vaya a jugar con argentina pero si el tas falla a favor del club tendr a que volver

1678145 we are a bit crazy together so we wanted something that suited
1678146 das ist eine fremde die haben mich von meiner mama weggenommen die haben mich aus den ferien weggeholt
1678147 diese entscheidung haben wir aufgrund der sach und rechtslage erwartet
1678148 die fifa hat es leichtfertig verpasst fr hzeitig die geltende rechtslage anzuerkennen
1678149 wir haben keine offizielle mitteilung bekommen die spieler bleiben teil des teams und werden gegen belgien spielen
1678150 messi will das ganze olympische turnier spielen er ist f r die startelf vorgesehen
1678151 die fifa ist berrascht und entt uscht ber die entscheidung aber wir respektieren sie dennoch ich appelliere an die vereine lasst eure spieler teilnehmen es w re ein akt der solidarit t in perfekter bereinstimmung mit dem olympischen geist zudem w re es wunderbar f r die spieler die fans und f r den fu ball insgesamt
1678152 ich bin traurig f r die athleten die davon tr umen hier zu sein wir werden hart mit der fifa daran arbeiten dass in zukunft die besten nachwuchsspieler bei olympia sind die klarheit h tte vor zwei drei monaten kommen m ssen
1678153 they were very eager to take the right action which was to apologize to their hosts
1678154 they have the right to wear masks if they feel its in their best interest to do so
1678155 hopefully they wont have to use them and the air quality will be good
1678156 we offer our sincere apologies to bocog the city of beijing and the people of if our actions were in any way offensive that was not our intent
1678157 the wearing of protective masks upon our arrival into beijing was strictly a precautionary measure we as athletes chose to take and was in no way meant to serve as an environmental or political statement
1678158 we deeply regret the nature of our choices our decision was not intended to insult bocog or countless others who have put forth a tremendous amount of effort to improve the air quality in beijing
1678159 we look forward to putting this incident behind us while we prepare for our competition next week
1678160 you never want to go to somebody elses place and cause any embarrassment and in this case some of them did
1678161 were not chastizing anybody they came forward of their own volition
1678162 it probably wasnt the most opportune time for these athletes to wear these masks
1678163 they were overly cautious those athletes have written an apology to bocog
1678164 we believe hopefully this will be the last incident of this kind
1678165 i keep saying im not sure if this is true or not true im making the team and now im the first guy coming to the stadium and the whole world will be watching me carry the flag there are no words to describe it
1678166 in america everyone has a chance to do all these things
1678167 you follow the rules people will choose and if im blessed to get that opportunity ill get it
1678168 i was sitting next to jerry colangelo and said you know weve waited three years to get off this plane and do this
1678169 i think were prepared and while were here we need to prepare more
1678170 its a little overwhelming that its really here the reality that were here
1678171 weve been treated with the greatest amount of respect and friendliness we could not have been treated better i know well get the same treatment in beijing the chinese people love basketball and were excited were playing the first game against china
1678172 i try to see american players every time they come to china but this time is the most special because of the olympics
1678173 a once in a lifetime opportunity and they should experience all those things
1678174 i hope to get my team ready to perform at the highest level to win a gold medal thats my only desire here and ill be ok with that
1678175 the chinese team is in good condition but its not as easy as it was when only the
1678176 i think the pressure on them is too high with all the eyes of china on them sometimes we chinese expect too much i will be happy if they make the top four
1678177 im saying not to kill innocent animals theres nothing negative that goes into that
1678178 i go to the office in a swim suit im comfortable with shedding a few more items of clothing i dont think its too crazy or risque
1678179 you have concerns im not out here taking my clothes off were doing it in a very positive way
1678180 im not trying to be in everybodys face and be harsh or negative i want to be calm and yet get my voice out there im doing it for all those animals who dont have a voice
1678181 i think some people were scared of what this might become
1678182 i think they tried censorship but it was not successful amanda didnt want her voice to be silenced
1678183 im hopeful things will change here but im not optimistic this is a message for the world
1678184 but things are changing five years ago you would never have considered doing things like this
1678185 in bringing the charges the fa used video evidence cctv footage and various witness statements from individuals present
1678186 you guys are the ones who are talking all about it im not saying anything
1678187 im just going through doing what i have to do to prepare myself the best that i can to be as fast as i can
1678188 thats my goal and thats what im going to stick with
1678189 i havent said anything about breaking any record going after any record my goals havent been published
1678190 i think michael is a fantastic swimmer and i think if anyone in the world can possibly do it is michael
1678191 i think it will be a great story over the nine days of competition there will be a lot of people watching hoping to see history
1678192 ive been working over the last few weeks to fine tune a few things and hopefully improve the 400 im
1678193 physically hes much stronger and more mature so hes got a lot more power and still has the fitness
1678194 emotionally hes much the same guy handles challenges very well
1678195 the biggest advantage he has now is hes been through the process before so he knew what to expect and hes handled all of the other things that come with the better
1678196 its fun for us to be here not everyone gets the opportunity were lucky to have the opportunity to come over here and swim for our country
1678197 in the village we have like six guys in our apartment its fun
1678198 the player is here and will remain with the team he will start thursdays game against ivory coast in shanghai from the beginning and im sure he can be with us for the rest of the competition
1678199 not at this time no i have spoken with him and he wants to stay here with the rest of the team
1678200 i hope this decision will not have any effects on other teams with players who are coming to this tournament every coach would want messi in their team hopefully barcelona can take the decision that he stays here
1678201 surprised and disappointed by the cas decision but we respect it
1678202 nevertheless i appeal to the clubs let your players take part in the olympics it would be an act of solidarity in perfect harmony with the olympic spirit it would be wonderful for the players for the fans and for the game itself
1678203 fifas opinion has not changed the olympic football tournaments are high level competitions that give everyone involved most notably young players the chance to gain international experience that will stand them in good stead for the future
1678204 it stands to reason therefore that it is not only the player who will benefit from such an experience but also his club i regret that the cas has not taken the olympic spirit into consideration
1678205 we are pleased with the cas decision because we have worked closely with the clubs in this legal matter
1678206 it was always our opinion that under fifa regulations we were not committed to allowing our players to go freely fifa failed to realise the legal implications of this decision early and the preparation of the clubs ahead of the new season has been affected
1678207 it is sad for the athletes concerned they were dreaming of the games but obviously there are some issues between the players and the clubs
1678208 it is well noted we have shown interest we have had discussions with madrid over it and they are ongoing the window is still open and we are still talking to
1678209 one of the key issues over buying robinho has always been that real madrid are looking for a replacement
1678210 eine deutliche spur aus der dautphe endete genau vor einem dieser beh lter
1678211 the tournament just started and this was a good result
1678212 now we need to have a good preparation to play against brazil and germany
1678213 our game plan was to match them speed for speed and skill for skill
1678214 but unfortunately that didnt happen our game plan didnt work today
1678215 having lost my grandmother to cancer its not an easy battle and i know his goal was to swim at the olympic games and hes doing that
1678216 hes positive and hes excited to be here and were all supporting each other in everything we do and he seems like just a normal guy
1678217 eric has been quite inspiring in many ways the way hes handled this has put all this into perspective for all of us weve taken a step back and realised there is more to it than just swimming
1678218 he gives you a sense of the bigger picture look a lot smaller when youre dealing with something like cancer
1678219 its been pretty easy to keep focused a lot of times when we get to an event like this you put a lot of pressure on yourself
1678220 ive probably got an out with cancer that puts things into perspective for me theres a lot more to life than just the olympic games
1678221 when you look at what he did after he was diagnosed and treated for it you cant help but be inspired by that
1678222 zu wissen wo man hingeh rt ist in der globalisierten welt besonders wichtig

1678224 the goal now is to win the gold medal that beijing organizers will hand out august 20
1678225 youve got to train like you are on a mission to take him out
1678226 i hung in there and i eventually caught up and mastered the workouts
1678227 i also grew as an athlete now i am more diligent i work harder and i am more patient
1678228 in terms of assembly and demonstrations china has related laws and regulations we hope that foreigners will respect the related chinese laws and regulations
1678229 use the platform of the olympic games to draw attention to their causes
1678230 the ioc are confident beijing city authorities will assess the situation reasonably and act with tact and understanding
1678231 it was important for us that there be a clear voice speaking out against the chinese governments abuse of human rights
1678232 its so shocking being an american to see the blatant oppression
1678233 after my injury with my chest i didnt know if i was able to come back in time i did which was great
1678234 i would love to have him here but im really excited with the guys on the team excited to compete with them and see what we can do
1678235 if he had another month hed be 100 percent on the team
1678236 at certain times i would try to motivate him and he really did an amazing job to get back to where he did he really pushed hard
1678237 he asked a lot of times what my opinion was of his status he had enough time to be ok but not enough time to be great
1678238 his use was inadvertent he was cleared by the federation and cleared by the international federation
1678239 we believe its perfectly appropriate that hes here participating we dont believe that he gained any unfair competitive advantage through his inadvertent use of the substance in question
1678240 i told him id love to have you here get on a plane
1678241 he is at the point of finishing up the sport while i am at the peak of gymnastics at the olympics we kind of coach each other so it would be helpful
1678242 it disappoints you when somebody so close to you goes through something like that
1678243 i knew it was a matter of time before my name would come up anyway
1678244 it didnt bother me i know what i did i know what i went through and how hard i practiced to achieve things and reach the goals i sought
1678245 it wasnt the realization like youve got it again it was maybe im back because it was a new feeling i could be in better shape than i was in 2004 but i dont know how to interpret it because ive never trained like this before
1678246 he could come out there and upset anybody because hes had the experience of winning
1678247 hes been there it could come down to experience and whos been to the olympics before because eventually youre going to be in a situation where youre running in front of 90 000 people and regardless of what you say that will change the attitude of anyone whos going to run
1678248 i watched yang wei on pommel horse he was very good and his routine looked effortless
1678249 overall the chinese had almost no mistakes but if we can do the same it will be a close competition

1678254 it doesnt need much money or weapons compared to what the foreign troops are spending
1678255 the goal of terrorism is to terrify and to intimidate
1678256 it is not to take and hold territory it is not to dominate institutions it is not to win the allegiance of the populace it is to terrify and the tactics of the taliban are more terroristic even than at the end of the last fighting season
1678257 the increasing use of very public attacks has had a striking effect on morale far beyond the immediate victims

1678300 your eminence when father john carroll who was to become the first american bishop accompanied benjamin franklin to qu bec to ask that the canadians join in the american revolution the then bishop briand of qu bec forbade his priests to have anything to do with the visitors and he actually excommunicated john carroll
1678301 bishop briand had his reasons in that the british had guaranteed the catholics of qu bec freedom of religion a freedom which was not guaranteed at that time in the original thirteen rebellious colonies where catholics were often discriminated against
1678302 bishop briand saw no reason for canadians to join the american colonies against the british and he was very annoyed that a catholics priest should be among those seeking to encourage canadians to risk their religious liberty in what he considered to be a dubious cause so he excommunicated father carroll and there is no record of which i know that such an excommunication has ever been lifted
1678303 in the interest of better canadian american relations and in recognition of the fact that americans now enjoy religious liberty i would deeply appreciate it if you might lift the excommunication against john carroll

1678315 the perfect 10 you dont have to say anything to describe it the perfect 10 you were perfect
1678316 why why is it needed it attracted so much attention the perfect 10 was something that was cherished
1678317 i thought it was crazy to take it out a humongous waste i still feel that kind of in this way maybe selfishly
1678318 something needed to be done to try and make it more fair
1678319 im always thinking about that you can still strive for perfection in the b score
1678320 im always thinking how to get closer to a 10 on that part
1678321 the 10 is what you dreamed of as a kid you were always trying to reach a 10 you dreamed youd do a routine so awesome youd get a 10
1678322 but im pretty happy with the system ive gotten comfortable with it
1678323 you could sit down and look at a rule book for four years and probably still wont get it

1678333 so he thinks were going to have to move the desk to continue over on the mouse

1678444 im michael spitzer rubenstein the internet director for kevin powells campaign for congress and after reading your recent post on room 8 i had to wonder have you actually met kevin before hes a very charming guy in person and not nearly the egomanic you depict him as
1678445 if only you could meet rabbi x or reverend y you would understand
1678446 im not the one who depicted kevin as an egomaniac that person would be kevin who controls what is put on his site
1678447 was straight quotes from kevins website the rest of my piece was mere garnish
1678448 you are entitled to your interpretation and i suggest you post it but id still like to hear from mr powell in his words exactly how he feels about durban

1678450 i would say that awful is the right word for what ed towns has done he has helped ship thousands of jobs out of brooklyn and to other countries with his support of nafta cafta and other free trade agreements he has weakened our public schools by voting to pass the no child left behind act which has been an unmitigated failure and in spite of his long service in congress ed towns has done little for brooklyn moreover as the internet director for kevin powells campaign i can assure you that we are raising money and will have enough money to win the race however if you have any doubts about our viability i encourage you to help out by giving to the campaign sincerely michael spitzer rubenstein internet director kevin powell for congress
1678451 apparently its happening everywhere from people stealing manhole covers from people breaking into foreclosed homes
1678452 i think one of the overriding things is that im interested in bringing crime to the national agenda
1678453 something that two years ago wouldnt have been worthwhile now it is
1678454 the prices have doubled and tripled the prices that are driving the crime are making it worthwhile to engage in this kind of thievery
1678455 in my opinion the guy that gets laid off from gm doesnt get a gun and do an armed robbery but youre seeing people doing shoplifting that dont really have a criminal record
1678456 it took a year or two before you saw it show up in actual crime whos the person stealing bread stealing food
1678457 ive been very aware very quickly that roosevelt boulevard is a serious challenge for motorists for pedestrians and actually for law enforcement
1678458 weve seen far too many accidents and casualties and there is a fear of dealing with roosevelt boulevard because of the difficulties of this particular road
1678459 this signals another step in our continuing effort to make this unique highway as safe as possible for all who travel along it either by foot or by vehicle
1678460 the goal is zero fatalities on the boulevard and we will continue to strive to have that happen
1678461 i felt real safe today with all the police and everyone else around
1678462 commanded the highest level of attention from j k and his office
1678463 from the very beginning councilman kelly has fully cooperated with authorities when asked to do so and will continue to do so if asked
1678464 the problem was there was nothing to tell with respect to the others
1678465 there should be no homeless living on the streets of philadelphia or anywhere
1678466 we havent had a focus on what we want to do and how we want to do it
1678467 between 2005 and 2007 the numbers of those living in shelters and on the streets dropped about 30 percent
1678468 we are aware that there were several motorists who may have seen the collision and not stopped and spoken to police
1678469 it is everybodys business and continues to be the collective responsibility of each one
1678470 the accused person in my view failed to observe all these
1678471 if he comes out with an issue you can be sure what he says will certainly happen if b j comes out to say one particular person should not be accepted by the party i agree with him entirely
1678472 hajia alima mahama has to wait a bit and eventually she will reach the point that the party will consider her

1678474 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1678475 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1678476 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1678477 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1678478 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1678479 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people

1678481 richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationery on which the assignment was written
1678482 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1678483 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1678484 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1678485 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated
1678486 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case

1678501 crists newfound support for a property tax cut on the november ballot clashes with a pledge his office made to constituents just six months ago
1678502 the governor is not supportive of increasing sales taxes either by repealing exemptions or by raising the rate even if the revenues are used to lower property taxes
1678503 while the numbers dont yet show that the amendment 1 property tax reform created the economic sonic boom he promised gov charlie crist has thrown his support behind amendment 5 the proposal to replace school property taxes with higher taxes elsewhere it will be on the nov 4 ballot
1678504 crist has demonstrated he can persuade voters to cut their taxes but amendment 5 is a different animal it is a tax swap not a cut and it only hints at how the budgetary hole in public education would be plugged if the governors support for amendment 5 is sincere he needs to tell voters how he would fill in the blanks
1678505 floridas continuing economic woes could soon prompt gov charlie crist to dip into either the states post hurricane recovery fund or its health care endowment to pay for state operations this year
1678506 empty political rhetoric in a state facing a fiscal eclipse
1678507 if excellence ever is to become more than empty political rhetoric in a state facing a fiscal eclipse political and business leaders must finally come to grips with the need for substantive revenue reform not faux solutions in the form of constitutional amendments that falsely promise economic turnarounds

1678514 the overly generous exemption from disclosure offered private companies or even individual investors negotiating with state or local governments about economic development possibilities such as a companys relocation the exemption is offered even though the negotiations between the private company and the government entity are usually predicated on direct taxpayer support a local government may offer to discount or defer taxes to lure a company or offer other kinds of incentives like infrastructure improvements what it usually adds up to is making public money available for private gain which in turn trickles down to some public benefit in the form of jobs a diversified tax base and better paid consumers who buy local products

1678516 the cosmic neutrino background and the age of the universe
1678517 presto look at that great big probability that means that its impossible for the universe life everything to exist without god
1678518 if we knew the values of these variables we could compute the probability
1678519 empirically we can observe that the survival of life is something that occurs with high probability at least once life has started
1678520 space is big you just wont believe how vastly mind bogglingly big it is i mean you may think its a long way down the road to the chemists but thats just peanuts to space
1678521 the answer is obvious because if you didnt constrain the multiverse in this way his proof wouldnt work so he just handwaves his way past it
1678522 assuming an approximately uniform distribution and assuming a parametrized multi multiverse we have to conclude that the most probable set of free parameter values must be whichever set of parameter values has the maximum probability of the origin of life
1678523 it should be pointed out that the very notion of the multiverse was proposed for the purpose of negating the fine tuning argument
1678524 you do not need to be a tailor to see that the emperor has no clothes
1678525 he starts by imposing an artificial limit on the kinds of multiverses
1678526 it says more about obama inflating your car tires is common sense
1678527 but soon well have all those who will vote for him anyway on here making posts about anything other than mccain in their defense of mccain sound convoluted it is
1678528 sir you have an under inflated left rear tire ill have to give you a citation
1678529 maam your engine is throwing off excess hydrocarbons you can take this ticket to the court house when your fine is paid and your car is certified clean burning you can apply for reinstatement of your drivers license
1678530 sir your neighbors report that you left your outside light on all night that is your third violation of conservation law mandatory jail time
1678531 theres not one vehicle in ten on the road that has improperly inflated tires
1678532 more than a quarter of automobiles and about a third of light trucks including sport utility vehicles vans and pickup trucks on the roadways of the united states have one or more tires underinflated 8 pounds per square inch psi or more below the level recommended by the vehicle manufacturer according to a report by the department of transportations dot national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa
1678533 of course keeping your tires inflated is important more to reduce tire wear than anything else
1678534 every pound per square inch of tire underinflation wastes 4 million gallons of gas daily in the u s
1678535 theres not one vehicle in ten on the road that has improperly inflated tires
1678536 obama put out tire pressure and tuneups as a major solution to our energy problems
1678537 i dont currently own a vehicle that needs a tune up few people do
1678538 obama is stupid theres not one vehicle in ten on the road that has improperly inflated tires
1678539 obama proposes increasing tire pressure to increase fuel economy perhaps hell also reccomend eating less fat to lose weight
1678540 however obama has suggested we eat less he has said that our health crisis is a diet crisis which is exactly what it is
1678541 house republicans on tuesday said their protest of speaker nancy pelosis d calif decision not to allow a vote on expanded offshore oil drilling has helped lower gas prices
1678542 i think the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
1678543 i think the market realizes this kind of pressure from congress may in fact lead to a change in policy

1678547 for a lot of people their street lights are just about the only service they thought they could rely on getting
1678548 it seems absurd that there are going to be turned off
1678549 i would be interested to see if the council is practising what it preaches and stops using cars and taxis for official trips
1678550 personally i think keeping lights on overnight is a waste of time
1678551 most people have gone home by midnight especially older people so there should not be any risk for anyone falling over without the lights or people feeling unsafe
1678552 it is important that we reduce our carbon emissions and make financial savings wherever possible

1678568 abradable coatings such as ni 4cr 4al bentonite entail a family of coatings used throughout jet engines primarily as sacrificial coatings into which moving components wear the coatings generally consist of a metallic phase and a nonmetallic phase and contain relatively high porosity levels to 40 typical locations for application of an abradable coating include the fan and low and high pressure compressor sections
1678569 the composite nature of abradable coatings presents unique challenges from a metallography standpoint due to thickness and porosity considerations vacuum impregnation with a low viscosity cold mount epoxy is the recommended mounting method to facilitate impregnation with fast cure epoxies which are typically more viscous than slow cure epoxies the resin can be heated to approximately 150 f 65 c prior to mixing with the hardener holding the epoxy at elevated temperature for 15 to 20 minutes should result in a significant improvement in the viscosity of the epoxy
1678570 poland is a first time entrant to the global index property prices rose over the course of the year 2007 by around 22 per cent although the last two quarters saw falls in growth of seven per cent and 2 3 per cent in q3 and q4 respectively somewhat negating the 16 per cent growth seen in each of the previous two quarters
1678571 between 2005 and 2007 prices went up by around 100 per cent which is obviously not sustainable over the last year prices have remained stable but in the next year we anticipate a five to ten per cent rise and slightly more the year after that in the long term krakow is a very very good investment

1678617 das turnier am rothenbaum war immer eines der h chsten kategorie und der masters status ist uns zeitlich unbegrenzt zuerkannt worden solange wir die regularien der atp erf llen m sste dieser status jedes jahr erneuert werden
1678618 die geschworenen und der richter haben unser recht anerkannt nderungen am atp kalender durchzuf hren die notwendig sind um das volle potenzial unseres sports auszusch pfen
1678619 das gericht erkannte damit auch an dass diese nderungen in transparenter und vertrauensvoller weise durchgef hrt wurden

1678624 die fifa ist berrascht und entt uscht ber die entscheidung aber wir respektieren sie dennoch appelliere ich an die klubs lasst die spieler an den olympischen spielen in peking teilnehmen es w re ein akt der solidarit t in perfekter harmonie mit dem olympischen geist
1678625 diese entscheidung haben wir aufgrund der sach und rechtslage in dieser form erwartet wir haben gemeinsam mit dem dfb stets die auffassung vertreten dass sich weder aus den fifa reglements noch aus gewohnheitsrecht eine verpflichtung unserer klubs ableiten l sst die spieler freizustellen die fifa hat hier leichtfertig verpasst fr hzeitig die geltende rechtslage anzuerkennen die vorbereitung der klubs auf die neue saison wurde erheblich beeintr chtigt

1678630 anything you typically find at a farmers market can now be found on our website
1678631 we are encouraging marylanders to buy more local food and support our farms plus were helping to bolster the economic viability of our working agricultural lands in the state thats a heritage this state cant afford to lose
1678632 buying directly from maryland farms just makes good economic sense
1678633 we have some of the best quality food you could ever want to eat right here in maryland
1678634 our next steps are to go after these reservoirs of hiv and although much work needs to be done to find and eliminate them infected people who have access to antiretroviral drugs and who take them as prescribed stand a good chance of leading normal lives
1678635 adding more drugs to current regimens will not further reduce the amount of virus in the blood
1678636 we have already reached rock bottom in using drugs to stop hiv from replicating the trace amounts of virus that remain are coming from viral reservoirs not active replication of the virus
1678637 neuropathy is a chronic and significant problem in hiv patients as there are few existing treatments that offer adequate pain management to sufferers
1678638 we found that smoked cannabis was generally well tolerated and effective when added to the patients existing pain medication resulting in increased pain relief
1678639 this study adds to a growing body of evidence that indicates that cannabis is effective in the short term at least in the management of neuropathic pain

1678644 he had end stage heart failure and was at the brink of death when he arrived output from his heart could not be maintained even though he was receiving maximum intravenous medications in the icu
1678645 we had to implant the device in an emergency operation he was then able to go home to wait for a donor heart and kidney to become available

1678647 he is a young guy with a great family without the transplants he would not have the quality of life that he now can expect and without the pump he would not have survived at all
1678648 our staff and transplant coordinators make every effort to help resolve financial insurance and funding issues and its very rewarding for us to see that patients receive the medical care they need
1678649 all stars and movie stars sports in film and history
1678650 roberto clemente the puerto rican baseball legend he did a lot to build baseball diamonds all over latin america he was also very popular because he was the first hispanic player to win an mvp award
1678651 because baseball is so popular in latin america players have moved into the major leagues here and thats angered some of the african american and caucasian players because now they cant get into the show although we know that if youre not good enough to play the game youre not going to play at all i think a lot of latin players have a lot more drive and they want to succeed more
1678652 mexican americans and sports a reader on athletics and barrio life
1678653 there is an increase of latino fans because they see more players like them out on the diamond so they start to come
1678654 i think that to older african americans who can remember back to jackie robinson in 1947 breaking the color barrier baseball is still important
1678655 but the younger african americans are no longer as much into baseball
1678656 impressively quinn competed against undergraduate students masters students and ph d students from all across canada and tied for first place this is really prestigious particularly as this is the premiere conference for anyone studying and researching plant biology in north america and beyond many preeminent botanists were there
1678657 extraction partial purification and susceptibility testing of a potentially novel antibiotic from lodgepole pine dwarf mistletoe arceuthobium americanum
1678658 we dont usually think of northern forest plants as important sources of pharmaceuticals
1678659 i was kind of surprised to find that the extract from dwarf mistletoe works against the so called superbug mrsa
1678660 it is not surprising that many tru graduates who have gone on to graduate school have indicated that they excel because they have already worked in a lab or in the field and have had the opportunity to engage in original research
1678661 one of trus distinguishing features is the dedication of its faculty in working one on one with undergraduate students who wish to engage in independent research students at the bachelor degree level benefit from being able to design and pursue their own research projects under the direct supervision and mentorship of a faculty member engaged in a similar line of investigation
1678662 youll probably see us catch a whole lot of balls this year
1678663 they are joint news conferences with the side purpose of trying to make the opponent look bad in some fashion if you think about the values that win debates they are the things that make for bad government instant short and snappy answers to enormously complex questions given mainly with an eye toward replays on the news and good spin in the post debate analysis
1678664 when have you ever heard a candidate say you know my opponent has a very good idea about how to deal with this problem i think we should do what he suggests we would want a president to do this if it was right for the country but we award debating points to those candidates who are witty in disparaging their opponent and who never show any hint of compromise or inconsistency
1678665 the lincoln douglas debates are complete with moral historical legal and political arguments they are thorough and sharp witted revealing of the candidates talents positions and thinking in ways contemporary debates cannot approach
1678666 all these factors have helped to make old fashioned reasoned argument the kind that anticipates an informed and interested audience obsolete
1678667 i dont entirely blame the candidates we are getting what we crave who wants to listen to three hours of debate on abortion or the iraq war when we can have rush limbaugh or jon stewart tell us whats going on
1678668 neither obama or mccain is even within a country mile of abraham lincoln or stephen douglas as a skilled rhetor
1678669 the shoes should help me improve my swing and ill be able to walk the tournaments now

1678671 it was such a relief to know what it was and what we were dealing with
1678672 this young girls feet were twisted and deformed like the limbs of an old oak tree
1678673 this was the kind of deformity a 90 year old might develop not a healthy adolescent it made quite an impression
1678674 there were definitely feelings of frustration he just couldnt keep up
1678675 dr pfeffer answered our questions the way wed hoped and we had total confidence he could do the surgery
1678676 i can tell her what cmt is all about and help her through it
1678677 there are a large number of americans with cmt who sit at home dont go to high school dances dont play sports dont get jobs all because they dont know what can be done for them
1678678 when you take away the burden of cmt these young people finally begin to fly

1678680 interactions of s aureus with fibronectin were first reported more than 30 years ago and yet we still dont understand precisely how and why the bacteria target this human protein
1678681 in the current study we focused on preexisting psychiatric risk factors for postpartum suicide attempts resulting in hospitalization most importantly a prior psychiatric or substance use diagnosis among postpartum women significantly increased the risk of a serious postpartum suicide attempt one implication of this study is that screening for past history of psychiatric and substance use diagnoses as part of routine prenatal care may be a means of identifying women at high risk of postpartum suicide attempt although a recent review of prenatal screening for depression cited insufficient evidence to recommend screening as a way to improve outcomes
1678682 future studies should evaluate the effectiveness of screening for psychiatric and substance use disorders on decreasing adverse outcomes such as suicide attempts during the postpartum period if found to be effective such interventions may prevent the devastating impact associated with postpartum suicide attempt
1678683 the research uncovered a previously unknown link between the energy machinery of the nostoc bacterium and its core nitrogen metabolism further investigation of this pathway might lead to understanding and improvement of the hydrogen production mechanism of these bacteria it will certainly be some time before a pool of bacteria powers your car but this research is yet another small step towards sustainable fuels
1678684 the effects of todays rough economy can certainly be felt on most everyones pocketbook
1678685 when trimming grocery lists or school meal plans to save money its important to remember the nutritional and economic value that nutrient rich foods like milk provide for our children milk cheese and yogurt are especially critical for growing children as they contain a unique combination of nine essential nutrients critical for bone health and development
1678686 food allergic individuals need to increase the awareness of their food allergy among the people around them
1678687 this would include not only telling them that they are food allergic but also showing them how to treat them and how to recognize signs of an ongoing reaction

1678692 neuropathy is a chronic and significant problem in hiv patients as there are few existing treatments that offer adequate pain management to sufferers
1678693 we found that smoked cannabis was generally well tolerated and effective when added to the patients existing pain medication resulting in increased pain relief
1678694 this study adds to a growing body of evidence that indicates that cannabis is effective in the short term at least in the management of neuropathic pain

1678696 it appears to be true that lianas grow more rapidly at higher levels of c02
1678697 but there could be other explanations for the increase in lianas too weather could be a factor
1678698 if lianas can grow far more than trees during seasonal droughts then global increases in drought from such events as el ni o or la ni a may be responsible for the documented increases in liana abundance

1678702 developing new and improved mathematical and computational methodologies will further enable systems developers intelligence analysts biologists and health care workers to implement new methods to detect the expected and discover the unexpected among massive data sets
1678703 fodava seeks to put an improved science base under one portion of the problem how can we transform large complex data sets into reduced computational models or mathematical formalisms that retain the information content while better supporting the human in extracting critical information from the data
1678704 scientific advances here are critical to future advances in the science of data and visual analytics that will keep us safe and provide technological and commercial advances that benefit mankind
1678705 reducing the computation time for an analysis from hours to seconds makes all the difference since data analysis is inherently an iterative and interactive process

1678728 were deeply concerned and disturbed that our reporter of all of those in that area was asked to move
1678729 my understanding is that stephen was the only reporter approached and asked to leave the area and the only reporter in that area who is black another reporter who stood up for stephen was then asked to leave
1678730 at the end of the day your reporter was in the wrong place i do not know why the other reporters were not moved the rest of the local press should have been moved as well

1678733 with the smuggling of arms into lebanon from syria irans involvement and the fact that hezbollah is now a part of the lebanese government there is a need to discuss the situation and formulate policy
1678734 the lebanese cabinet has agreed on fundamental points that show how hezbollahs victory has been effective in this government as the first article is related to the resistance and liberating land this means that there exists an official document that confirms that hezbollah is a force acting in the name of the state to liberate land

1678742 at the risk of stating the obvious sex is unquestionably a significant human activity one our species has been engaging in at least since the biblical injunction to be fruitful and multiply
1678743 as a basic physiological act practiced regularly by a vast portion of the population a cornerstone of family and marital life a conduit to emotional and spiritual fulfillment and a crucial element in intimate relationships sex easily qualifies as a major life activity

1678752 the duke of edinburgh has authorised us to confirm that the claim made by the evening standard that he has received a diagnosis of prostate cancer is untrue
1678753 we believe that the evening standards front page story today titled prince philip defies cancer scare is a serious breach of prince philips privacy
1678754 buckingham palace has always maintained that members of the royal family have a right to privacy particularly in relation to their personal health
1678755 for this reason we have always refused to confirm or deny the persistent rumours that circulate about their health particularly during the quieter news months
1678756 we will continue to observe this long standing practice but on this occasion because the damaging story is now being reported widely the duke of edinburgh has authorised us to confirm that the claim made by the evening standard that he has received a diagnosis of prostate cancer is untrue
1678757 we believe there has been a serious breach of the duke of edinburghs right to privacy and we will be taking this issue to the press complaints commission
1678758 common calls in portsmouth are to deal with ants or being a coastal city dead seagulls or pigeons in the grounds the number of calls logged reflects the proactive approach adopted by the trust as successful pest control relies on early identification of potential problems

1678788 whats offensive about this complaint is that it suggests something he did was intended to be prurient and nothing could be further from the truth
1678789 it was intended just to make the patient feel better most of the patients are delighted by dr kirshners sense of humor

1678794 nicotine interacts with a variety of neurochemical pathways within the brain to produce its rewarding and addictive effects
1678795 however during the early phase of tobacco exposure many individuals find nicotine highly unpleasant and aversive whereas others may become rapidly dependent on nicotine and find it highly rewarding we wanted to explore that difference
1678796 while much progress has been made in understanding how the brain processes the rewarding effects of nicotine after the dependence is established very little is known about how the mesolimbic dopamine system may control the initial vulnerability to nicotine that is why do some individuals become quickly addicted to nicotine while others do not and in some cases even find nicotine to be highly aversive
1678797 importantly our findings may explain an individuals vulnerability to nicotine addiction and may point to new pharmacological treatments for the prevention of it and the treatment of nicotine withdrawal

1678822 epidemiologic observations of sex differences in the onset and course of schizophrenia prompted exploration of estrogens role in schizophrenia
1678823 estrogens neuroprotective and psychoprotective actions may be mediated by a variety of routes ranging from rapid actions including antioxidant effects and enhancement of cerebral blood flow and cerebral glucose utilization to slower genomic mechanisms which may include permanent modification of neural circuits
1678824 the lack of effect for negative symptoms is consistent with literature reporting that negative symptoms are less responsive to treatment than other symptoms of schizophrenia it is possible that longer term treatment is required for negative symptoms to respond to treatment alternatively brain regions implicated in negative symptoms may be less responsive to gonadal hormone effects
1678825 estrogen treatment is a promising new area for future treatment of schizophrenia and potentially for other severe mental illnesses

1678833 according to his clemency petition during the investigation and prosecution of jos medell ns case his court appointed lead lawyer was under a six month suspension from practising law for acting unethically in another case he continued to represent jos medell n while suspended prior to the trial the lawyer was held in contempt of court and arrested for violating his suspension time that should have been spent preparing his clients defence went instead to preparing and filing a habeas corpus petition to keep himself out of jail records indicate that the only investigator for the defence spent a total of just eight hours on the case prior to the trial the defence failed to oppose the selection of jurors who indicated that they would automatically impose the death penalty jos medell ns lawyers called no witnesses during the guilt phase of the trial at the sentencing phase their presentation of mitigating evidence lasted less than two hours
1678834 an investigation funded by the mexican consulate has found that jos medell n grew up in an environment of abject poverty in mexico and was exposed to gang violence after he came to houston to join his parents when he was nine it has also established that he suffered from depression suicidal tendencies and alcohol dependency if his trial lawyers had sought consular assistance experts and investigators could have been retained by the mexican consulate to present the full range of mitigating evidence to the sentencing jury in addition consular monitoring of the case in the pre trial stages could have exposed and remedied the inadequate legal representation that jos medell n was receiving

1678839 while eating tuna and other types of fish seems to help protect against memory loss and stroke these results were not found in people who regularly ate fried fish
1678840 more research is needed as to why these types of fish may have protective effects but the omega 3 fatty acids epa and dha would seem to have a major role
1678841 previous findings have shown that fish and fish oil can help prevent stroke but this is one of the only studies that looks at fishs effect on silent brain infarcts in healthy older people

1679151 outbreaks of viral encephalitis in horses are a seasonal occurrence due to the prevalence of mosquitoes in late summer and early fall
1679152 horse owners should be aware of symptoms of viral encephalitis and consult their local veterinarian if a horse develops any of the signs associated with this group of diseases
1679153 definitive diagnosis is important in tracking the spread of eee and wnv infections
1679154 horse owners should work with their local veterinarian to verify test results through laboratory analysis
1679155 because there is no eee or wnv vaccine available for humans people should avoid mosquito bites by using epa registered insect repellents containing deet picaridin oil of lemon eucalyptus or ir3535 and by wearing clothes that cover the arms and legs
1679156 these preventative measures are especially important during the period from evening until morning when mosquitoes are most active or any other time mosquitoes become active

1679164 we will attend the meeting only if there is a radical substantive change
1679165 ongoing israeli systematic perpetration of racist crimes including war crimes acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing
1679166 yes the europeans say it should not be anti semitic and the israelis are demanding a focus on human rights around the world
1679167 but what about those that did the bashing theyve said nothing
1679168 from what ive seen in the preparations im afraid were going to face the same scenario
1679169 canada wont take part israel most probably wont either the united states and most of the europeans will boycott durban ii if this is going to be the case

1679185 im here today because ive been a long term tibet activist and i feel
1679186 the beijing games have been used by the chinese government as a propaganda tool to whitewash their human rights record in tibet

1679188 most incidents relate to old buildings which have now been demolished at pembury hospital there is no specific problem
1679189 labor have said over and over again that they will improve cleanliness in our hospitals but these figures clearly show that they are failing it is difficult for health service estates to maintain a completely pest free environment but the level and variety of these infestations is concerning we need greater transparency in nhs infection control and publishing data like this is one way in which we can drive up overall hygiene standards
1679190 we receive a wide range of information on hygiene from different sources however concerns around pest control have to date been negligible clearly it may be necessary to take action against pests in these large public buildings from time to time however it is important for hospital trusts to have robust procedures in place to deal with any pest problems and if they persist trusts should question whether they have the right systems in place if we were concerned that the safety of patients was at risk through poor hygiene standards or in any other way we would take immediate action
1679191 hospitals must be responsible for ensuring their buildings are clean and that patient safety is not compromised the hygiene code requires nhs bodies to have a pest control policy that anticipates and manages this issue trusts should take rapid action and follow through with surveillance in place to avoid pest incidents and minimize hazards use of pest control is a sign of good proactive management the claim that insects spread hospital acquired infections is entirely unproven there is no evidence of their carriage of antibiotic resistant bacteria being a hazard to patients despite this we expect hospitals to take continued action to tackle pest problems
1679192 these figures must be put into context it goes without saying that as the fourth largest trust in the country our hospitals are bigger than most others around the country and therefore our figures should be compared with trusts with similar sized estates rather than smaller acute trusts it is also worth bearing in mind that trusts are likely to have recorded and reported figures differently and therefore the table may not be comparing like for like data

1679196 3 4bn of the governments loan to northern rock is now being converted into ordinary shares which rank right at the bottom for repayment continuing losses at the bank put this money at great risk
1679197 other banks have taken the cream of northern rocks mortgages leaving the rest to curdle
1679198 the scale of the problems at the bank underlines the extreme negligence and irresponsibility of northern rocks previous management and highlights the scale of the failure of regulation by the fsa
1679199 the government should now go after the former directors who have managed to shift the banks losses on to the taxpayer ministers must also go after the auditors who failed to spot glaring problems and mounting bad debt
1679200 the chancellor and the government were totally irresponsible for failing to heed my warnings from last october that the bank should be stopped from giving out 125 together mortgages these shocking figures show northern rock has 6 3bn in unsecured loans it was clear even then that they could never be repaid in a falling housing market
1679201 nationalisation is by far the best way to manage the bank provided the govt can assure us that the loans can be secured
1679202 the govt assured us that loans were secured and so took up our suggestion of nationalisation but their assurances were misleading wrong lies and they didnt take all our advice properly in implementing the nationalisation
1679203 because right now my season with just two wins is i think just ok but if i were to come through and win this event it would make an ok year a great one
1679204 winning the last major could turn it into something special
1679205 im imagining it probably wasnt too nice were they complimenting my outfit i obviously didnt like the way i finished but i was so glad that i was in a position where every shot counted and mattered in a pressure situation heading into this event
1679206 but i felt like i hit a lot of good shots so i cant get too disappointed because there wasnt any one thing that was deficient
1679207 from a players point of view i dont really notice tigers absence too much
1679208 the atmosphere for the competition seems to be the same and everybodys into their own games trying to get their best out of them
1679209 so i dont know i couldnt tell you why i think that i have no particular reason
1679210 i think i will be ready but unfortunately you cant be 100 percent sure until you actually tee it up and play but i believe i can do it im pretty comfortable with the test ahead
1679211 that wouldnt weigh on me at all that gives you something to write about this is about playing your best golf and seeing if you come out on top
1679212 there will always be somebody missing it doesnt work like that you can only win the tournament youre playing in you can only win the week youre playing and you can only beat the field thats there so at the end of the day it doesnt matter whos here
1679213 the last 15 years maybe theres been a little bit of a lull in european golf in terms of winning majors but obviously theres plenty of good european players around now and theres plenty of them capable of winning
1679214 if we pass a new program we either ought to get rid of the old program or we ought to make it to where it blends with this other one so its effective
1679215 and even though the legislation did not cost a dime it was filibustered

1679219 donation came from as far away as cape canaveral fl from a retired wiu faculty member the generosity of our faculty staff and many others shows the great commitment that western illinois university has to be a part of our community as well as our dedication to being socially responsible citizens
1679220 id like to thank everyone who donated time and resources to this cause in times of need the wiu community has always been willing to take the initiative and provide assistance
1679221 we appreciate the generosity of brian anderson in giving his fathers works to western and the artistry of warren anderson in these wonderful works vice president for advancement and public services dan hendricks said
1679222 in all those varied forms there is also a hint of a slightly offbeat romanticism in essence my art commemorates the vernacular of the past from the heightened perspective of the present
1679223 we are proud and privileged to receive this donation of warren andersons work from his son brian already some of the works are on loan due to their relevance and popularity
1679224 i remember him with great fondness he cared a lot about western
1679225 i also greatly appreciate the efforts of the staff at the etherton gallery in getting this extensive collection to us they were highly instrumental in this process
1679226 i am glad i brought this monster to its knees

1679230 i may have read something by solzhenitsyn in school but i dont remember
1679231 i dont know him so why should i go and pay last respects to him
1679232 i knew he was going to go because of where we find ourselves financially
1679233 but im pretty sure i will be able to bring some players in now
1679234 thats all part of a club like watford at this moment in time we have to sell i want to be in a position as a manager where i can trade and i cant even bring in loan players at present

1679238 ive known mark for a long time and played against him in the past i know hes the number one but im here to give my best so that in the end the team is successful thats my mentality
1679239 if i sign a contract with a club i want to be successful i want to do everything possible to help fulham have a good season thats my number one aim
1679240 you really dont know whats in a banks or insurance companys portfolio until after the fact

1679242 that will allow them to do well regardless of whats going on in the environment around them
1679243 were really trying to understand what makes the company tick in more detail than what you could get from a phone call
1679244 when he left i was surprised because he was very well respected at the company and we thought very highly of him
1679245 so i called him up and tried to understand what it was that he saw at rsc

1679257 i question whether the tax code is the best way to do this
1679258 ironically in such periods the best positioned groups can actually underperform the market temporarily because traders look to raise cash by selling their winners

1679273 i hope to get my team ready to perform at the highest level to win a gold medal thats my only desire here and ill be ok with that
1679274 the going rate right now is 250 to 300 per couple attending the wedding depending on the size overall flamboyance of the wedding and we give more if the bride and groom are close friends or relatives my husband and i broke even at our wedding and were happy about that
1679275 giving the couple money as opposed to gifts is an increasingly popular trend nowadays and i see nothing wrong with it as long as it is done tactfully
1679276 i live in japan where the custom is to bring some money to the wedding reception no one thinks twice about this
1679277 it would be different if there had been some horrible financial emergency in their lives but otherwise i would be very turned off by that kind of wedding invitation
1679278 the entire situation makes me a little uncomfortable but they have expressed that this is what they want and now knowing their feelings on the subject i feel as if i have to comply
1679279 i think its both highly offensive and unfortunately a sign of the times somehow couples dont have any shame in asking for specific gifts such as cash
1679280 i just really wanted to marry this woman and it didnt matter at all how simple the ceremony and reception were we had the kind of wedding we could afford at the time

1679308 people make a judgment about you in the first five seconds after they meet you
1679309 and they are making a judgment about who you are
1679310 where do you want to be three years from now where do you want to be professionally where do you want to be socially
1679311 the first thing you need to do is find out what the fashion culture is where you are going
1679312 in italy you could probably interview in a paprika suit if thats a color that works for you i wouldnt recommend that in japan theyre not fashion forward in the business world
1679313 you need to consider whether you can wear open toed shoes sleeveless shirts or shorts to work thats your responsibility as a person going from one country to another
1679314 we had to consider that she was a female doing business in the middle east
1679315 coming to work in a short skirt would not be looked upon well
1679316 alterations and tailoring have a lot to do with how an article looks on you
1679317 its better to buy a size too big than a size too small the worst that could happen is people will think you lost weight
1679318 as americans i think we need to respect the people and places we visit you need to remember that you are a guest its not just the fashion part of it but the intellectual part as well you can have the right outfit on but if you dont have the right attitude it isnt going to work
1679319 americans think white socks are acceptable that is a big mistake youll see educated powerful people wearing white socks they should know better

1679328 we had a great chemistry in the first film and really good friendship
1679329 as much as we could we stayed in touch in the three years between the two movies im particularly close with amber because on the campaign trail together for hilary clinton we all like to keep in touch because we like each others company
1679330 at the core carmen is dealing with the same issues she was dealing with in the first movie which is her issues with abandonment
1679331 in the first movie her father is moving on without her and this time around its her friends are moving on in an easier way than she is and her mother is remarried and pregnant
1679332 so again her world is moving on without her when shes quite happy with the way things are
1679333 shes upset about being abandoned by her friends and her mother and shes stuck in her shell until she realizes that its time to move on before she becomes an unhappy person
1679334 i was really interested in this notion of how friendships evolve in the first movie the friendships were really sweet and a lot of the conflict came from each of the girls individual lives and stories there wasnt a lot of conflict within the friendship
1679335 what i was excited about this time around was the focus of the friendship and how it was changing with my character and ambers character tibby theyre both so lost in their own struggles that they cant be there for each other i liked that the friendship was getting more complicated
1679336 i think in terms of would i have needed to see this when i was a kid the idea is a little bit selfish to be frank
1679337 but when salma hayek came to me with the idea ugly betty i thought to myself god this is the kind of show i would want to watch if i was a girl sitting at home or even now when it comes to sisterhood and when i read those books and was such a huge fan theses are stories i want to watch as movies
1679338 i pick things that way because im a young woman looking for inspiration

1679344 but to say weve seen a quantum leap in regards of one treatment being better than the other is premature
1679345 whats driving the increase is truly the consumer patients are requesting it like never before
1679346 the fact that less blood is lost and a short hospital stay is appealing for some patients
1679347 i freaked out a bit got on the internet and called around to find out what was out there for me
1679348 i do a lot of exercise i wanted to be back on my feet as quick as possible
1679349 i was amazed at what little pain i had i was at home and even walked my dog the very next day
1679350 its important to talk to your doctor to figure out what is the best way to treat your individual case

1679407 your cholesterol has a tendency to be high you better take this medication to prevent a future heart attack dont worry about side effects there are a few but theyre very rare
1679408 pfizers cholesterol pill lipitor remains the best selling drug in the world for the fifth year in a row its annual sales were 12 9 billion more than twice as much as its closest competitors
1679409 every year millions of people fall victim to the very deceptive highly profitable cholesterol scam
1679410 its time to take action get off them immediately before they do any more damage
1679411 ldl cholesterol plays many critical roles in both the body and brain it forms the very basis of our hormones and vitamin d which provides many benefits the majority of cholesterol is found in the brain where it serves as an insulator for neurons cholesterol even removes toxins from the blood stream preventing potential damage to the arteries cholesterol is part of every cell wall and plays a critical role in sealing and stabilizing damaged or weakened arteries
1679412 when our ldl is excessively elevated its an indicator that we need to address the underlying problem that our cholesterol is attempting to deal with not take a cholesterol lowering medication the most likely contributors to elevated ldl are low vitamin c toxins low thyroid elevated homocysteine the rogue amino acid that damages the arteries and oxidizes cholesterol and even stress as the body actually uses ldl to produce stress hormones
1679413 sharply reduced the desired levels of harmful cholesterol for americans who are at moderate to high risk for heart disease

1679423 hmm aku tahu bunda karena bintang lebih kecil dari matahari kan
1679424 tuhan ijinkan aku mati jika disinipun aku tak bisa menuntun anakku
1679425 perempuan itu menutup mata dan pergi sedang si gadis kecil belum tahu hingga gelap menjelang saat tubuh ibunya dirasa kaku dan mendingin seketika tangisnya pecah ia belum pernah satu kalipun pun wajah bundanya yang kini telah pergi
1679426 sedang apa saya disini kanapa saya tidak seperti dua teman saya saja
1679427 mungkin tuhan benar benar berencana tidak baik padaku aku dibiarkan sendiri sebagai perempuan diumurku yang ke duapuluh tujuh bukan muda lagi bagi perempuan
1679428 dan mengapa pula ia tahu isi otakku bahwa aku benci akhir pekan ini
1679429 kalo tuhan tahu mustinya dia tahu apa yang aku inginkan keinginannku tidak aneh keinginanku biasa sperti perempuan yang lain
1679430 bagaimana mungkin tuhan benar jika ia menciptakan seorang perempuan yang jelek dan bodoh seperti aku
1679431 lihatlah kebawah nggak selalu lihat keatas masih banyak orang lain yang tidak seberuntung kamu
1679432 kamu tahu aku udah berusaha keras kamu tahu jumlah jam yang aku habiskan tiap hari kamu juga tahu apa saja yang sudah aku lakukan setiap malam aku bangun berdoa ibadah tak pernah tertinggal aku tidak pernah berbuat jahat aku baik sama orang lain terus apa alasan tuhan ini benar tidak adil
1679433 aku ingin kuliah di hukum internatioanal di peguruan tiggi negeri kerja di perusahaan international bukan menjadi mahasiswa seni tari sederhana kan
1679434 tetapi bukannya tuhan punya peta sendiri bagaimana hambanya akan menjadi asal kamu udah berusaha keras dan itu yang aku lihat
1679435 yang logis aja mana bisa seoarang lulusan seni tari kerja di perusahaan international kamu mahasiwa teknik mungkin bisa ngomong gitu
1679436 bukannya hidup itu sendiri sudah nggak logis logika nggak selalu menang karena logika tak punya keajaiban sedang hidup penuh dengan hal hal yang ajaib
1679437 kalo kamu percaya tuhan berarti percaya akhirat dan perjaya juga bahwa ada keajaiban dalam hidup
1679438 mereka hebat sudah cakep bisa hidup sangat bebas dan semaunya dan tidak ada bencana sedangkan di negara kita kelaparan dan kemiskinan bencana terus terjadi
1679439 semua akan tidak adil jika hanya ini yang tuhan berikan
1679440 jika hanya hidup yang diberikan tuhan maka akan menjadi tidak adil tetapi jika mati diberikan juga olehnya dan setelahnya akhirat maka hidup menjadi adil dan mempercayai itu artinya mempercayai bahwa hidup juga ajaib

1679462 no ser a mejor si tuvieran agua en el pueblo
1679463 el agua me cuesta cada d a dos horas de trabajo para un burro y un chico que lleva el burro eso hace al a o mil cuatrocientas sesenta horas si cuentas las horas del burro como las horas del chico pero si el burro y el chico estuvieran trabajando en el campo todo ese tiempo yo podr a por ejemplo plantar todo un campo de calabazas y cosechar cuatrocientas cincuenta y siete calabazas m s cada a o
1679464 por qu entonces no construyes un canal para traer el agua al r o
1679465 en el camino hay una colina que deber amos atravesar si pusiera a mi burro y a mi chico a construir un canal en vez de enviarlos por el agua les llevar a quinientos a os si trabajasen dos horas al d a al menos me quedan otros treinta a os m s de vida as que me es m s barato enviarles por el agua
1679466 s pero es que ser as t el nico responsable de construir un canal son muchas familias en el pueblo
1679467 hay cien familias en el pueblo si cada familia enviase cada d a dos horas un burro y un chico el canal estar a hecho en cinco a os y si trabajasen diez horas al d a estar a acabado un a o
1679468 entonces por qu no se lo comentas a tus vecinos y les sugieres que todos juntos construy is el canal
1679469 mira si yo tengo que hablar de cosas importantes con un vecino tengo que invitarle a mi casa ofrecerle t y halva hablar con l del tiempo y de la nueva cosecha luego de su familia sus hijos sus hijas sus nietos despu s le tengo que dar de comer y despu s de comer otro t y l tiene que preguntarme entonces sobre mi granja y sobre mi familia para finalmente llegar con tranquilidad al tema y tratarlo con cautela eso lleva un d a entero como somos cien familias en el pueblo tendr a que hablar con noventa y nueve cabezas de familia estar s de acuerdo conmigo que yo no puedo estar noventa y nueve d as seguidos discutiendo con los vecinos mi granja se vendr a abajo lo m ximo que podr a hacer ser a invitar a un vecino a mi casa por semana como un a o tiene s lo cincuenta y dos semanas eso significa que me llevar a casi dos a os hablar con mis vecinos conociendo a mis vecinos como les conozco te aseguro que todos estar an de acuerdo con hacer llegar el agua al pueblo porque todos ellos son buenos con los n meros y como les conozco te digo que cada uno prometer a participar si los otros participasen tambi n entonces despu s de dos a os tendr a que volver a empezar otra vez desde el principio invit ndoles de nuevo a mi casa y dici ndoles que todos est n dispuestos a participar
1679470 pero entonces en cuatro a os estar as preparados para comenzar el trabajo y al a o siguiente el canal estar a construido
1679471 estar s de acuerdo conmigo que una vez que el canal est construido cualquiera podr ir por agua tanto como si ha o no contribuido con su parte de trabajo correspondiente
1679472 incluso si quisierais no podr ais vigilar todo el canal
1679473 cualquier caradura que se hubiera librado de trabajar se beneficiar a de la misma manera que los dem s y sin coste alguno
1679474 as que como a cada uno de nosotros se nos dan bien los n meros intentaremos escabullirnos un d a el burro no tendr fuerzas el otro el chico de alguien tendr tos otro la mujer de alguien estar enferma y el ni o el burro tendr n que ir a buscar al m dico como a nosotros se nos dan bien los n meros intentaremos escurrirnos el bulto y como cada uno de nosotros sabe que los dem s no har n lo que deben ninguno mandar a su burro o a su chico a trabajar as la construcci n del canal ni siquiera se empezar
1679475 conozco un pueblo al otro lado de la monta a que tiene el mismo problema que ustedes tienen pero ellos tienen un canal desde hace ya veinte a os

1679485 lebih baik kita pisah aku sayang kamu aku nggak mau nyakitin kamu nanti dan menjadi masalah yang berlarut larut jadi dari pada sakit nanti mending kita belajar dari sekarang
1679486 ah nggak penting lah istilah kamu tahu sendiri kenyataannya bagaimana
1679487 iya seih raja majapapit juga nggak pernah pacaran makanya di dalam buku sejarah tidak ada istilah pacaran di eropa juga tidak ada istilah pacaran yang ada itu boyfriend apa sama boyfriend dan pacar tidak tahu yang jelas kalo seorang cewek punya boyfriend mereka bisa tinggal serumah seranjang di negaraku itu tidaklah wajar bisa bisa didobrak sama hansip
1679488 waktu itu kita tidak pernah bahas soal istilah maksudnya saat itu dia bilang sayang sama aku dan nyatanya aku juga suka sama dia jadilah kami seperti itu
1679489 nggak jelas cuman aku udah menyerahkan semua perasaanku sama dia sampe hampir mati
1679490 sebelumnya saya minta maaf dan saya sudah minta maaf pada temanmu itu
1679491 saya tidak yakin dia bisa menjadi istri saya meskipun dia adalah pacar saya makanya ketika ada perempuan lain yang saya lihat lebih bisa menjadi istriku aku berani meninggalkan dia
1679492 pacaran kan pacaran yang artinya penjajakan kalo nggak cocok dan menemukan perempuan lain kenapa tidak
1679493 hai kamu perempuan juga bisa melakukan itu tidak hanya laki laki semua orang bisa melakukan itu
1679494 tetapi temanku kan tidak dia sangat mencintai kamu bukannya dia berhak mendapatkan cinta kamu
1679495 we are hoping to gain financial support by approaching producers to try to fund british chicken marketing bcm ourselves as much as possible its important to promote our product and the red tractor logo
1679496 one leading retailer has already offered to support the bcm campaign and we hope others will follow
1679497 the market place had changed in recent times due to farm assurance schemes like freedom foods and the credit crunch had also had affect on consumers
1679498 i appreciate we are asking our producers to contribute but we want to make every pound work as hard as it can to support them and british chicken whether they are producing conventional free range or organic

1679504 we study global climate change that is in our authorisation we think we do it rather well
1679505 im proud of that but nasa is not an agency chartered to quote battle climate change
1679506 i am not sure that it is fair to say that global warming is a problem that we must wrestle with
1679507 i have no doubt that a trend of global warming exists

1679512 but its not like the hatfields and the mccoys its a heck of a lot more complex
1679513 and i agree with you we ought to expend some effort into understanding them but speaking only for myself its hard to keep things in perspective and in the categories
1679514 how can the intelligence committee do effective oversight of u s spy agencies when its leaders dont know basics about the battlefield
1679515 ik moest hier gewoon bij zijn om zo iets terug te doen voor mijn sponsoren en trouwe fans
1679516 op een gegeven moment kon ik gewoon niet verder het profiel op mijn banden was helemaal weg
1679517 het was echt geweldig ik kon de vele mensen langs het parcours goed zien vooral op het hofplein was het erg druk het is voor mij leuk om te zien dat zoveel mensen hier naar toe gekomen zijn dit is belangrijk voor de sport want zo kunnen de fans zien voelen en horen hoe het er normaal alleen op het circuit aan toe gaat
1679518 het leek wel een film hoe hij de brug af kwam lopen

1679520 heres a free business idea for a budding iphone entrepreneur develop a graphical iphone app builder that lets non technical people like me make simple iphone apps through a drag amp drop interface
1679521 being a mom has forced me to become less self centered and more aware of the small thing big thing differences in life yes i still have dreams that im being picked on by my seventh grade classmates but when i wake up im able to laugh it off a bit better being at blogher has made me more aware of this change snip i almost never approach anyone because im intimidated but once were in a conversation ill become quite extroverted since penelope has been born a lot of this fear has disappeared though i still find it difficult at times to go up to a person and say hello
1679522 techcrunch and techmeme get as much grumpiness tossed their direction as they do because they each own a valuable niche in the blogosphere and are expanding their lead rather than relinquishing it while you could say that techcrunch competes with readwriteweb mashable gigaom or others they have cemented themselves as the go to site for new services entering the market and even their opinion pieces are widely read with almost a million unique rss subscribers taking note techmemes best competition at this point is blogrunner with hacker news dave winers techjunk duncan rileys qmeme and more organic sites like rssmeme or readburner coming up in conversation but techmemes original perceived competition like tailrank and megite are mere shadows of what they initially promised meanwhile techcrunch is bringing on new writers and posting more stories than ever see the statbot techcrunch statistics a w and techmeme is going more mainstream with news sources like the wall street journal and new york times featuring more prominently than most individual bloggers
1679523 kentuckians like all americans are hard hit by record high gas prices
1679524 these tough times call for creative solutions and i believe allowing kentuckians the option of using an electric vehicle is one of those solutions electric vehicles may help ease the burden on the pocketbooks of hard working
1679525 never have we received such hospitality and such overwhelming enthusiasm for electric vehicles as exhibited by the governor and every single person we met while in
1679526 so you are simon the son of john you shall be called cephas
1679527 he gave him a new name cephas his giving him a name intimates christs favour to him a new name denotes some great dignity by this christ not only wiped off the reproach of his mean and obscure parentage but adopted him into his family as one of his own
1679528 when christ afterwards prayed for him that his faith might not fail that so he might be firm to christ himself and at the same time bade him strengthen his brethren and lay out himself for the support of others then he made him what he here called him cephas a stone those that come to christ must come with a fixed resolution to be firm and constant to him like a stone solid and steadfast and it is by his grace that they are so his saying be thou steady makes them so

1679532 weve already participated in about a dozen public meetings including the four we hosted with the central indiana regional transportation authority cirta but the requests keep coming clearly mass transit is a hot topic to people looking for relief from high gas prices and rush hour congestion
1679533 were sharing the public comment weve gathered with the irtc this month so its important that people who want to be heard contact us soon
1679534 they can do it on our web sites on the mpos 24 hour comment line 327 8601 or by requesting a group presentation 327 5136 or 327 7585
1679535 for nearly a century greenfield laboratories has been an important lilly site currently housing elancos worldwide headquarters and a significant portion of lillys toxicology testing as well as other r amp d support functions
1679536 these actions reflect lillys determination to take the necessary steps to compete in a very challenging marketplace in which our customers are demanding innovative high quality affordable medicines these are difficult but necessary decisions we must make in order to compete successfully as an independent indiana based company
1679537 our longstanding relationship with lilly has delivered innovation in the safety and efficacy testing of new prescription drug candidates and it sets the stage for this landmark agreement through the years we have demonstrated significant success in expediting early development timelines and improving efficiency
1679538 this expanded agreement creates a new strategic paradigm at a time when the pharmaceutical industry needs to challenge traditional thinking in order to improve its r amp d productivity we are confident that this alliance will help create strategic competitive advantages for lilly and allow lilly to strengthen its focus on its core competencies
1679539 we are also very pleased to expand our employee base in central indiana which has a strong life sciences talent pool and has long been a successful home for our global central laboratory and bioanalytical businesses
1679540 in recent years elanco has expanded in both sales and product offerings posting record revenues of nearly 1 billion in 2007 elanco also recently launched the lilly companion animal health division and acquired ivy animal health
1679541 as weve grown however the current configuration of greenfield laboratories no longer supports elancos needs the new elanco headquarters will centralize the divisions operations while offering significant savings in annual operating expenses
1679542 what we call years yz the period beginning in late 2011 when patents for several medicines begin to expire requires a thorough transformation of our company that includes reduced cycle times and lower r amp d costs
1679543 as we act decisively we aim to implement these changes with utmost respect for our employees and continued support for the communities in which lilly operates
1679544 nowhere is lillys network strategy more pronounced than in indiana where more than 3 000 firms support the companys work in both national and global markets
1679545 through this collaboration with covance and others lilly will help enhance the regions life sciences sector expanding lillys economic footprint in indiana as never before specifically these partnerships will result in no net job reductions in the state and they will offer the potential for new jobs in the future throughout this process we have worked to put lilly employees and indiana first
1679546 we were pleased with our quarterly performance with strong results in our video category and prudent and effective sg amp a cost management balancing the anticipated downturn in our core appliance business we successfully opened our florida distribution center and staffed our florida management team and have been pleased with our initial new store results we look forward to adding more stores in florida this year not only gaining a foothold in a market that has strong long term potential but also leveraging our distribution and marketing investments in the short term

1679552 mai no he insultat he parlat pol ticament i he dirigit les meves paraules a qui son els responsables dels insults als catalans
1679553 com puc insultar als extremenys o els andalusos si el meu avi era nascut a andalusia i el meu segon cognom n s una prova evident

1679557 i have had a meeting of cyber cafe owners and asked them to

1679559 we have police mitras citizen cops in every housing cluster and we
1679560 the problem is that in the research community people have felt it is best practice to have full disclosure
1679561 for the longest time the security community has held on to this common practice five years ago we didnt have exploit toolkits on the underground to build exploits today this is becoming a problem i think we have to shift gears and reconsider this full disclosure policy and is the impact doing the best thing for the greater good
1679562 certainly the concept of responsible disclosure involves two words responsible and disclosure if you go out to the internet at large and reveal a large security hole without informing the vendor then you have given the bad guys an advantage they would not have through tradition non public disclosure
1679563 it becomes a race between how fast can you test and implement it versus how fast can the bad guys weaponize it

1679565 how id love to get my hands on those balls
1679566 i grew up with the promise that if one wanted to go to space they would get the chance
1679567 it became obvious that the only people that were going to space were government trained employees called astronauts other folks were not getting to go
1679568 the least likely guy was the one who won it this part time barnstorming airmail pilot
1679569 x was for the unknown for experimental for 10 10 million
1679570 the prize would be analogous to the prize that stimulated the aviation industry this prize though would stimulate the personal space industry
1679571 i read through it and i was kinda like hmm
1679572 i gave it a little bit of thought was like gosh you know if it were me id probably just try concrete vibrators
1679573 i was kinda like well gosh this is almost too obvious i struggled with that a little bit but i went ahead and submitted the solution and won
1679574 i was pretty dumbfounded at that point whod have thought
1679575 it could be your inventor next door or your ph d scientist from harvard
1679576 these people love the hunt they sometimes can connect dots that many people cant
1679577 they care about a lot more than just the money they want to be part of a community and they want to do stuff that matters
1679578 we find now organizations are really just beginning to see the power of inviting the outside world into really helping them with their innovation whether its inviting in customers or partners or 7 billion people
1679579 it doesnt replace inside innovation what it does is it provides a very powerful outside mechanism for driving innovation into the organization
1679580 we all hoped that within some years of the ansari x prize being won an industry would start for personal spaceflight i think none of us dreamt that that industry would actually start during the competition
1679581 when i stood there out at the tarmac on mojave and looked at the tail of spaceshipone and there was the logo for a business that had been launched to take paying customers into space it was incredible that this would happen concurrently with the prize and not in the distant future
1679582 people get very excited about their causes and lack the sense to see if the information backs them up
1679583 you dont see their bodies going blotchily red and hear them howling like a banshee
1679584 in the second quarter of 2008 we continued to focus on the integration of the dangaard operations
1679585 our financial results for q2 were below our expectations and we remain committed to executing our operating plan and enhancing long term shareholder value our focus areas for 2008 and beyond include continuing to drive down debt by managing our balance sheet executing on our recently announced european restructuring plan as well as other reductions in spending continuing to align with leaders in the smartphone space and growing our presence in india and latin america i believe smartphones will account for roughly 75 of all wireless devices sold globally in the next five years our strategic focus areas for the next several years will revolve around distribution customized logistics and associated activation competencies in the smartphone arena
1679586 i am pleased with our progress on our inventory reduction initiative which resulted in a 7 day reduction in dio from the first quarter
1679587 there will be full open and free internet access during games time to allow journalists to report on the olympics
1679588 but i have also been advised that some of the ioc officials had
1679589 social networks today rely on friends of friends or real world connections to drive growth but a handful of iphone only social networks actually help drive new connections in the real world and the backbone of those applications is location awareness
1679590 our goal is to have iphone users at our meetups and conferences be able to network with each other swap contact information and meet new people
1679591 hes one of the big superstars in the game we feed off those guys i think more so than his ability to hit the ball out of the ballpark he loosens us up as a team hes a huge part of who we are
1679592 the more important thing now is my legs are good my hands are good i can do whatever i can do to help he team win im happy to be back in the lineup
1679593 yeah i had choices and obviously the right one wasnt chosen
1679594 when i went out to talk to him it was the first time he told me that he had had enough
1679595 thats something i have to get used to the heat and humidity and running the bases
1679596 i guess i have to learn when to run and when not to i did lose a little bit of strength in my legs but i have to make pitches no matter what
1679597 i think i did that to myself last year in the first half
1679598 i dont think lou ever got over that thats fine i have no ill feelings and i mean that truly
1679599 we needed to get woody on the roster and we needed a spot we couldnt go to 13 pitchers hopefully somebody picks him up and he can go help some team i wish him nothing but the best
1679600 i guess i have to learn when to run and when not to
1679601 no derrek you need to learn to stop grounding into fucking double plays
1679602 we are beginning to see much needed help for texans
1679603 we have fema staff on the ground and in our call centers ready to help texans apply for disaster assistance
1679604 community relations field staff have been distributing flyers in communities and with our state partner we have three mobile units supporting disaster recovery centers
1679605 if theres a place in the united states where families are not expected to conform to the nuclear ideal its portland oregon
1679606 there is a destiny that makes us brothers none goes his way alone all that we send into the lives of others comes back into our own
1679607 i cannot prophesy the immediate economic effect of this new war on our nation but i do say that no american has the moral right to profiteer at the expense either of his fellow citizens or of the men the women and the children who are living and dying in the midst of war in europe
1679608 it never occurs to me that there are things that i cant do
1679609 mr asbahi has informed the campaign that he no longer wishes to serve in his volunteer position and we are in the process of searching for a new national arab american and muslim american outreach coordinator
1679610 we dont want any residents who might be eligible to miss out on valuable disaster assistance that could help them get back on their feet
1679611 if disaster affected texans are in doubt they should apply for assistance and fema will determine their eligibility
1679612 in five short months the bush administration will be done
1679613 so i guess we have to put her n the short list for mccain or barack
1679614 either one quayle added of the pig tailed appearance in which hilton melds the energy plans of both mccain and obama into one sound bite and declares the energy crisis
1679615 i mean she sort of took them both on there
1679616 i think and i hope john mccain will win the indianan said
1679617 when people go into that voting booth they know that were in unprecedented times both economically and internationally and the lack of experience of barack obama is really there
1679618 well he did beat the clintons anybody that can beat the clintons in my book is pretty good we didnt do it in 1992 i wish that we had but obama he is very effective on the
1679619 hes been able to modulate a little bit on you know iraq
1679620 when youre running for president of the united states in the primary you stake out positions and theyre pretty hard core positions quayle explained
1679621 you have certain constituencies you have to appeal to but look times change facts change new information new circumstances people that dont change their position you have to really worry about
1679622 and then you have to look at sort of the value added are you looking for somebody that has an economic background foreign policy background is it youth is it geography theres a lot of things but that loyalty of being comfortable with the vice president is very important
1679623 i think john mccain has a much easier choice here he said
1679624 i think mitt would be very good he was a good governor he knows economics hes a problem solver hes very articulate
1679625 i think this gov tim pawlenty from minnesota id put i think hes got a real shot
1679626 you have two people who are being considered to run your county head up your local school board and manage your police force based on the background and experience listed below who would you choose candidate a middle aged studied overseas attended two different colleges in the u s before getting a degree went on to get a law degree worked community affairs in his adopted home city was elected to local office served in local politics for just over six years got elected to a federal state wide office has one real year of experience in that job candidate b middle aged went to college and got a degree served in the national guard for six years became a sergeant while in the national guard earned a law degree became an investigator for a consumer protection division was elected to a federal office was re elected to a federal office was elected to a federal statewide office was re elected to a federal state wide office served in the executive branch for four years either in person or over the phone i showed or recited exactly as written above the background of these two candidates to voters who dont follow politics very closely i ended up speaking with twenty different people from diverse backgrounds to be sure some of those i spoke with rightfully said in reality id need to know a lot more than youre giving me accepting that caveat all 20 people picked candidate b candidate b is dan quayle candidate a is barack obama stripped of his name the color of his skin or his history making primary win in a blind experience only test does mr obama possess a resume that is worthy of the oval office
1679627 mr asbahi has informed the campaign that he no longer wishes to serve in his volunteer position and we are in the process of searching for a new national arab american and muslim american outreach coordinator
1679628 is supported financially by the government of saudi arabia holds title to many mosques in the u s and promotes a conservative brand of islam compatible with the ideology of the muslim brotherhood and also akin to the fundamentalist style predominant in saudi arabia
1679629 the number of daily applications has declined and we feel that the majority of those needing assistance have taken advantage of all our center services
1679630 anyone who applies for disaster assistance can access their needed information through the fema helpline
1679631 the drc is set up as a way for applicants to meet face to face with representatives from the various agencies providing disaster assistance this same help is available from representatives staffing the helpline service at 1 800 621 fema
1679632 we want to reach out to texans who may need help with other disaster related questions which is why fema and the state opened three mobile centers on sunday
1679633 you can get answers to questions about your application by calling the same number you use to register for assistance but we understand sometimes it helps to talk face to face
1679634 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
1679635 solving our national energy crisis requires an all of the above approach

1679641 the germans are very wobbly and certainly the french the british and the americans are quite worried
1679642 their spine needs to be stiffened the more mixed messages the more it plays into the iranians hands
1679643 shutting down the strait closing down the persian gulf would be sort of a self defeating exercise
1679644 that doesnt say anything about whether we tolerate such a thing to happen
1679645 we knew we shouldnt expect to see something like that
1679646 we know that microbes can exist quite happily in oxidizing conditions
1679647 the story possibly could turn out to be the same for mars we dont know yet

1679653 the leads weve generated have guided our clients to total sales in excess of 10 million in 2007
1679654 expansion was inevitable we simply had to evaluate where and with whom
1679655 it seems to be economy proof when the market is flying high companies need something extra almost a supplement to stay ahead of the game yet at times like these they need good quality leads simply to stay afloat and they need to assure that those leads arent sent to their competitors
1679656 its really disheartening to watch the news these days and see all the stories about corporate downsizing and revenue losses because thats not the world i live in we couldnt grow fast enough in hartford and ive experienced the same in boston we just need to make sure were growing with strong people who have great business ethics

1679666 its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas
1679667 its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law
1679668 were concerned for the precedent that the execution may create for the rights of mexican nationals who may be detained in that country
1679669 state and federal courts on three separate occasions have already satisfied the world courts suggestion that american courts examine whether medellin suffered actual legal harm when authorities did not inform him about certain rights under the vienna convention

1679718 we are very pleased to have this opportunity and believe that we are in the final stretch of obtaining this very lucrative contract i am confident that our team will complete this deal by weeks end
1679719 due to the sensitivity of the finalization of the contract by both parties the client will be announced upon the completion of all executed contracts
1679720 given the significant uncertainty on the date for completion of our proceeding after issuance of the stbs time limits decision and the fact that u s steel has read the spa to require that this transaction close by december 31 2008 cn contacted u s steel last week to formally request an extension of the deadline
1679721 u s steel is prepared to cooperate with cn towards the goal of closing the transaction in 2008 but it will not agree to extend the spa therefore we need a decision in this case and we have decided to seek legal relief to allow cn to close on the transaction prior to december 31 2008
1679722 the public interest calls for the stb to complete its review of the transaction and should it be approved to serve a decision that would allow the transaction to close by the end of the year
1679723 this transaction would not simply benefit cn and its customers this transaction is in the broader regional and national interest
1679724 shifting cns trains to the underutilized ej amp e line would bring benefits for millions of residents in downtown chicago while also streamlining rail operations for every community along the ej amp e line that would see increased train traffic as a result of this transaction nearly double that number along other rail lines would experience a traffic decrease cn recognizes the concerns of the communities along the ej amp e line about increased train traffic and we have been working for the past several months with community leaders on appropriate mitigation measures for reducing adverse impacts

1679740 its a bold title yknow were getting old and were trying to make people think we still have the sex drive that we did
1679741 rowing for wisconsin was the most valuable experience of my life i learned a great deal from my coaches about what it takes to be a good rower and a good student athlete the training was quite comparable to national team training which helped the transition to elite rowing
1679742 head mens rowing coach chris clark is always a great source of token advice not only for rowing but also for life in general he always made light of the fact that everything was always stacked against us and it is in some way we uw madison recruit people like me whove never heard of the sport before and turn them in to olympic caliber athletes in four years we hardly ever get to row since the water is frozen most of the school year we expect to win even though we race against teams that are more skilled and more experienced simply because we push each other within the team so hard that there is no give theres only what we take
1679743 training for any sport is difficult when you get as old as i am its harder to stay with the young guys fresh out of college and yes 27 is old in this sport as for the diet i eat what i feel like eating no matter how much trans fat or carbonation it has in it im not a good barometer for diet though i love junk food
1679744 were sticking to our same training schedule for the first week or so rowing about 16 kilometers per practice twice a day then well start tapering which just means more rest the diet is entirely up to the hotel chef so far its been a mix of chinese cuisine and some more familiar food like scrambled eggs and pasta and meat sauce
1679745 its different but its very interesting the people are very polite so i feel kinda like a brutish jerk when i open my mouth i think the country is very excited to show everyone how its done its so well organized its almost frightening but in a good way
1679746 i enjoy racing i have the utmost respect and admiration for the people i row for and with i dont love rowing anyone whos rowed can tell you there is no love between a rower and rowing we punish ourselves through rigorous training so we can hold on longer and push harder than our competition
1679747 im just here to race if the u s olympic committee said were boycotting id be disappointed but im sure thered be a reason i dont really think about the politics involved i just pull on an oar sit on my duff and go backwards because thats what i know how to do
1679748 thats entirely up to everyone elses interpretation i know that while im here im going to meet new friends and be as friendly as possible to everyone because thats what the olympics are about meeting new people and cultures and accepting them even if its only for one month
1679749 retire along with my father hes got until november though maybe cut down some of the dead trees on our land since hes too lazy to do it himself beyond that i havent really stopped to think about it might row might coach might mow lawns for a living for all i know
1679750 four years countless hours of practice thousands and thousands of miles rowed all for five and a half minutes
1679751 ive spent my 20s on tour and theres no consistency in my life which can take its toll
1679752 eventually i want to focus on being a completely different person because i dont want to be doing this into my 40s and 50s and beyond like the rolling stones
1679753 i dont want to give it up just yet though i think we have a little more to say
1679754 often dont tell a complete story about how americans attend religious worship services
1679755 theres often an assumption that people either do attend worship services or they dont
1679756 but what we find in this study is that one out of every five americans is attending worship services at least occasionally during the year even though they are not regularly involved
1679757 it is not our intent to say that anything in the research world is wrong but the unchurched is a huge mass of people
1679758 some people out there may not regularly attend services but they do regularly attend every easter and every christmas
1679759 the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket but is he ready to lead
1679760 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too
1679761 only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1679762 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1679763 we could do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars
1679764 that way the offshore drilling carries us until new technologies kick in which will then create new jobs and energy independence
1679765 a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
1679766 barack obamas latest negative attack ad shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy after all it was senator obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
1679767 this has kind of changed the dynamic of how were educating our children and expecting all of our kids to have a strong proficiency particularly in math and language arts
1679768 its no surprise given that the tests are a moving target that change from year to year providing no reliable baseline for performance
1679769 minnesotans know that even though our schools face serious challenges the majority of them are not failing
1679770 i dont think our lawmakers have a real grasp of reality when it comes to setting goals and labeling our schools
1679771 special education by its very definition is going to present different challenges we dont feel special education students should be held to the same standard as the other subgroups
1679772 you just cant put your chest out too far because itll get deflated really quickly the next year
1679773 well never be 100 percent proficient its impossible nasa isnt 100 percent proficient either
1679774 we cant think about what if we need to think about how we continue to come alongside of our kids
1679775 this is doing very very significant psychological damage both to the mindset of minnesotans about their schools and secondly to the mindset of the educators inside the schools who are increasingly frustrated
1679776 they are trying harder and doing everything they can in spite of it they just know inevitably theyll be on this list
1679777 is at an age where she is thinking with her head not just her heart no way would she still be with anyone if marriage wasnt a real option
1679778 we have chosen to reduce package sizes as one of our responses to these dramatic input cost increases
1679779 exposing the strings and catches buried in the fine print
1679780 check different brands and their unit prices perkins says be wary of sale prices because of different bag sizes that bag of potato chips on sale for 3 25 may be more expensive per unit than the one selling for 3 95
1679781 some of them will switch to grams instead of ounces on their labels perkins says
1679782 these sales are very exciting for cdi as both companies have either opened or are soon to open brilliant new casinos

1679789 our first well is at the final stage and we appreciate everyones hard work and patience over the past months this well is a great beginning and the next few days should be very exciting ones for our company
1679790 our board is excited by bruces acceptance of the senior executive role at aurora
1679791 we view his extensive development and operational experience in the mining industry to be both a major asset to the company going forward and fully consistent with the companys longer term strategy in bringing the michelin project into production bruce has a proven track record of bringing effective leadership to projects with diverse stakeholders which should be of particular benefit to aurora at the current stage of the michelin project
1679792 aurora has been on a path of continuous growth since its inception and bruces arrival coincides with the companys next evolution
1679793 i look forward to working closely with him both during the upcoming changeover period as well as in my new role on auroras board with the aim of maximizing the continuity of knowledge and experience with aurora and the relationships we have established with our project stakeholders
1679794 with the data you can see that theres really a direct relationship between yield and the speed and vibration of equipment across the fab
1679795 the more you optimize acceleration and limit vibration youre going to encounter less downtime and contaminated wafers and improve your cycle time
1679796 the lighter device can access more equipment at 300mm fabs and essentially identify more wafer damaging processes
1679797 has a legal and moral obligation to make official statements first to the victims and their families then the public
1679798 and thats the order in which were going to do it
1679799 despite the current economic environment and additional challenges arising in the second quarter vineyard continues to make significant strides toward the resolution of our asset quality issues and the implementation of other risk mitigation measures payoffs of our luxury home construction loans loan sales and the sale of other real estate owned properties have made positive contributions we continue to work diligently to maintain core deposit relationships and have been successful in attracting new deposits management remains committed to executing the strategies necessary to reduce risk fulfill the requirements established with our regulators and meet our internal objectives therefore although there are still significant challenges vineyard is starting to see positive results from the strategies that have been put in place

1679856 we are delighted to have the opportunity to work with purdue on this exciting and potentially transformational research into nuclear fuels
1679857 we fundamentally believe that multi oxide and beo fuels are the way of the future and will be the foundation of a more efficient economically sound and safer nuclear power industry by supporting purdues ongoing nuclear fuels research
1679858 we aim to make an advanced uo2 beo fuel commercially accessible and to enhance the value of our strategic assets for both our shareholders and the nuclear fuels industry
1679859 could very possibly be used in current nuclear power reactors as well as next generation reactors which are already in the prototype stage for either type of reactor
1679860 multioxide high thermal conductivity fuels are much safer as well as being more efficient requiring the fuel rods to be changed less frequently
1679861 although todays oxide fuels are very stable and safe a major problem is that they do not conduct heat well limiting the power and causing fuel pellets to crack and degrade prematurely necessitating replacement before the fuel has been entirely used the beryllium oxide is like a heat pipe that sucks the heat out and helps to more efficiently cool the fuel pellet if you can operate at a lower temperature you can use the fuel pellets for a longer time burning up more of the fuel which is very important from an economic point of view lower temperatures also mean safer more flexible reactor operation

1679892 we see a 13 percent increase in the number of families accessing shelter here in ramsey county
1679893 they said that they are serving 127 families in those 99 units so theyre actually getting people who are already homeless and asking them to double up in shelter because theres not capacity to house them elsewhere
1679894 our calls for service are up 100 percent from this time last year
1679895 im a single father with a 14 year old daughter looking for a place

1679898 hi my name is charley we are faced with an eviction i have two children i lost a job and got laid off so i lost my home and some other issues i lost this job it was a good job

1679903 if i had known they were going to shoot my son i would have handled the situation myself
1679904 i called police because i wanted them to help my son not kill him
1679905 he had a small steak knife maybe four inches with the tip broken off
1679906 i need help with my 24 year old son who is flipping out
1679907 he has those blank kind of eyes thats not really him he is very very angry hes not going to be pleasant i dont think
1679908 he is just going to shoot him in the arm right
1679909 i saw him walking toward them slowly just trying to get around them i have compassion for the officer if he was scared but there had to be another option other than shooting to kill my son
1679910 why couldnt he shoot him in the leg or arm or even take him to the ground
1679911 the only way i will drop the knife is in your neck

1679913 we believe that the services decision to list the polar bear was not based on the best scientific and commercial data available
1679914 it would certainly result in a great deal of polarization in the community
1679915 i think the community cares very very much about it and ive heard reports about radio broadcasters and others wanting to chain themselves to the cross that people want to lay in front of the bulldozers
1679916 the court finds the memorial at mt soledad including its latin cross communicates the primarily non religious messages of military service death and sacrifice
1679917 the primary effect of the mount soledad memorial is patriotic and nationalistic

1679934 until now marketers hypothesized that the key role of inbox advertising was an acquisitive one and there was no formal research to verify the branding benefits
1679935 this study makes it clear that inbox advertising provides significant brand impact across each of the key branding metrics including brand favorability this applies to both contextual ad inclusions and targeted stand alone branded acquisition focused email advertising

1679937 we use the z one system exclusively for vascular imaging and we are very happy with the image quality as well as its performance on difficult to image patients where deep penetration is needed to make more accurate diagnoses
1679938 the z one system is very light and easy to move around between exam rooms and as a result our technicians prefer this system over conventional ultrasound because of its premium image quality and portability
1679939 the image quality and depth resolution with the z one system is like no other ultrasound system i have ever used i never imagined such a small machine could have this level of premium image quality but the z one has proven itself over and over again and is truly the system of choice in our lab
1679940 the opportunity to partner with this oil technology group and utilize their technologies will allow freedom financial holdings shareholders to participate in new technologies that promise to revolutionize the manner in which heavy oil is produced compared to existing expensive recovery techniques associated with heavy oil we believe the technical and economic viability of this breakthrough heavy oil upgrading technology has the potential to significantly increase yields of gasoline diesel and jet fuel from heavy and ultra heavy crude oils and could be used to increase and upgrade production of heavy oil resources
1679941 heavy oil is everywhere in southwestern missouri its no secret that some of the largest oil sands reserves in the country sit right here we are here to set a precedent on how heavy oil will be produced very soon heavy oil was once viewed too costly and prohibitive for production but were about to change that perception we feel the next oil boom is here because the oil is so abundant and shallow only 200 feet deep this will allow us to use both conventional oil recovery methods and our proprietary heavy oil sands recovery processes we have the best of both worlds with such abundant oil and oil sands deposits located in the same area that are easy to recover compared to similar reserves found in utah colorado california texas and canada however getting it out of the ground has been the challenge for many in the past we are very excited about the amount of oil just in vernon county mo where oil reserves alone are estimated at 300 million barrels of oil we are looking forward to aligning ourselves with freedom financial as we form this long term partnership to produce oil utilizing our technologies and the team of professionals we have assembled for this project is exceptional our five year goal is to be producing 8 000 barrels of oil per day which equates to nearly 1million per day based on forecasts for oil and oil sands production with oil at 120 per barrel
1679942 the first oil production lease that freedom will be partnering on contains approximately 1 500 acres with oil reserves that are estimated to be over 800 million us freedom will own a 12 5 working interest in the oil leases unlike conventional light oil heavy oil is very viscous like syrup or even solid in its natural state underground making it very difficult to extract but heavy oil reserves that could keep the planets oil dependent economy going for a hundred years lie beneath the surface in many countries especially within the u s

1679955 somebody told me that there were red headed woodpeckers up here so i came walked five minutes and there was a red headed woodpecker
1679956 and it flew into a hole in a tree and i said wow this is easy
1679957 the young make a lot of chattering so you can usually tell where the nest is
1679958 theres a red headed and hes got a baby with him
1679959 were going to measure the diameter of the tree how high the nest cavity is the species of the tree is it alive or is it dead so we can get some data on what seems to be the preferred habitat
1679960 if our theory see this is all theory if our theory is correct the golf course replicates an oak savannah and there should be birds there
1679961 the woodpecker is called a primary nester it digs the cavity but flying squirrels mice snakes bluebirds tree swallows there are lots of other animals that are secondary nesters
1679962 they cant drill the hole but they live there so what were trying to do is preserve the habitat so the woodpeckers drill the hole and when they leave something else will come in and live in it
