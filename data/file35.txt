350000 ch vez could be considered a factor but under condition that he not use this for his personal gain that he cut relations with the farc that he order guerrillas be attacked
350001 argentina is like a kid who makes a really good sand castle at the beach takes a lot of care in building it just right then steps on it himself
350002 things have been good recently now we have to put a question mark on everything
350003 i think people are shocked because three months ago there was absolutely no reason why anyone would predict this tragicomedy that is happening now
350004 yet that bill is dead unless the speaker schedules a definite vote
350005 theres been a recognition that the traditional command and control approaches to conservation have not really worked
350006 its the economy that makes the drivers of deforestation change their behaviors
350007 when people talk about sustainable activities especially in europe and the u s the images they have in their minds are of almost artisanal activities indians and poor farmers wandering in the forest and taking sap out of the trees
350008 were not talking about that were talking about large scale institutional innovation and big business and that therefore presents an entirely higher order of difficulty to us
350009 we want to be environmentally responsible and if the international community wants to save the amazon thats fine with us
350010 but they have to be willing to pay for it
350011 the increase in coca cultivation in colombia is a surprise and shock
350012 a surprise because it comes at a time when the colombian government is trying so hard to eradicate coca a shock because of the magnitude of cultivation
350013 the power to do terror and to put colombians and others at risk is weaker and weaker than it was five years ago
350014 the easy pickings in terms of spraying coca in colombia are over and for there to be progress beyond this plateau there needs to be an alternative livelihood
350015 the country has been generous with them but the government cannot tolerate their return to crime their failure to truly and efficiently collaborate with justice
350016 it shows the power determination and progress of whats happening in colombia
350017 it becomes harder to ask them about their ties with politicians
350018 the agenda of the united states is drug trafficking and our agenda is crimes against humanity the political scandal and learning the truth
350019 no one can ever question whether or not the colombian government tampered with the seized farc computers
350020 we are absolutely certain that the computer exhibits that our experts examined came from a farc terrorist camp
350021 there was no tampering with or altering of any of the data contained in the user files by any of the colombian law enforcement authorities
350022 today we proved that the little guy also is capable of prevailing
350023 lugo is seen as a political outsider and he appealed to a group of people who generally havent been involved in the political process the rural poor
350024 theres a feeling that even though paraguay is experiencing economic growth that hasnt been reaching the people
350025 never again will the political class make policies based on clientism
350026 im content and happy because change was produced even if it was not through me
350027 the presidents brothers act like theyre the owners of barinas
350028 they act like this is a hacienda that belongs to them
350029 this mister has said he has lots of proof but he has not presented it
350030 weve done the political revolution but not an administrative revolution
350031 with the apology and the promise of never again violating a brother country we have overcome this very grave crisis
350032 how hard it is to believe something from someone who has lied so many times
350033 i have never done it and will never do it
350034 i could have sent a lot of rifles to the farc i will never do it because i want peace
350035 i didnt inform him of the operation because we have not received cooperation from his government in the fight against terrorism
350036 what all of us would like is for this meeting to end with a hug a handshake between the presidents of venezuela colombia and ecuador
350037 if the situation continues like this the farc will be finished
350038 it wont be tomorrow and it could take years but it will happen
350039 the internal situation is this finances bad medicines bad supplies bad
350040 we were all political refugees now as envoys here we represent the best values of our generation
350041 i will leave the pictures just to remember every day how dangerous it is not to react against a dictatorship it starts with police brutality and ends up with people dropping out of planes
350042 i promised myself that i would never leave my new homeland
350043 i dont want anyone in argentina to see a jew run away
350044 he stuck it out despite the bomb threats to the paper
350045 they will stand trial and be indicted i will never forgive or forget
350046 i have been doing this since 1977 why should i stop now
350047 were very satisfied with the resolution because it contains everything ecuador proposed
350048 theres recognition that there was a violation of ecuadoran sovereignty and that the attack was a serious violation of the principle of respect for territorial sovereignty
350049 that the resolution was approved by consensus was a good starting point to walking back and defusing tension
350050 is it possible that something like what happened in ecuador could happen here
350051 if this act goes unpunished the whole region will be in danger because the next victim could be peru it could be bolivia or any of our countries
350052 colombias attitude is creating a danger for the entire region and setting intolerable precedents
350053 i told the president that america fully supports colombias democracy and that we firmly oppose any acts of aggression that could destabilize the region
350054 i told him that america will continue to stand with colombia as it confronts violence and terror and fights drug traffickers
350055 certainly one of the points of greatest discord between venezuela and colombia has been the overt support of ch vez for the farc which resulted in a worsening of diplomatic relations even before march 1
350056 generally ch vezs view on the farc has been largely benign in the face of a colombian government that has dedicated itself to encountering the farc and the other illegal armed groups
350057 i think that the state and municipal governments here were irresponsible in the way they handled this because they didnt do anything until the problem was already out of control
350058 now everyone is just trying to pass the blame around to someone else
350059 the mosquito aedes aegypti has found a very favorable environment in cities where there has been fast growth without the corresponding infrastructure
350060 in a lot of neighborhoods in rio for example they store water on their houses because they dont have 24 hour seven days a week water service
350061 move 10 battalions to the colombian frontier immediately tank battalions military aviation
350062 we are not going to permit the north american empire which is the ruler to allow his lapdog president uribe and the colombian oligarchy to divide or weaken us we will not permit it
350063 what is clear is that military police intelligence and security cooperation between colombia ecuador and venezuela are completely fractured at this moment
350064 the worst aggression ecuador has suffered on the part of colombia
350065 they were bombed and massacred while they slept using pinpoint technology that found them at night in the jungle for sure with the collaboration of foreign powers
350066 uribe has got to go down there meet with correa calm him down and hes going to have ch vez fuming at the border
350067 in a pickle in the sense that diplomatically hes got to get himself out of this corner that hes got himself in
350068 because if it occurs to you to do that in venezuela president uribe ill send some sukhois so you know it pal
350069 lvaro uribe could be the head of a mafia but never a country a mafiosi can never be president of a country less so a south american country and less so a country like colombia
350070 ci sono alcune regioni vicine alla congestione per quanto riguarda le discariche dei rifiuti non arriveremo alla situazione acuta della campania perch questa esperienza ci ha me
350071 this commission has been created because the executive considers it to be of great historical and cultural value to clarify important doubts regarding the death of the liberator
350072 some say he was very ill and knew he was going to die and he wanted to die by the side of the sea and he died happy and colombia was happy and venezuela was happy
350073 how the oligarchs fooled us the ones here the ones there how the historians who falsified history fooled us
350074 why should i care bol var died if they killed him they killed him if he died of tuberculosis he died of tuberculosis in this day and age this doesnt have any significance
350075 he told me i want to see if its possible
350076 so we began to explore it and we found vast tracts that could be utilized
350077 i think that with the presidents intuition the president is a man of great intuition he perceived that you could develop something there so we started in november of 2006
350078 what he wants to do is build a small model of what a future venezuela could possibly look like
350079 he wants undoubtedly to strengthen his influence on the poor people living in the poor quarters of town he wants to reinforce the belief that many low income venezuelans have that hes on their side that hes on the side of the underdog on the side of the poor
350080 were looking to have a city with a different vision
350081 a city thats self sustainable that respects the environment that uses clean technologies that is mostly for use by the people with lots of walking paths parks sports areas museums and schools within walking distance
350082 this is a social housing project for people with little money so its very accessible for those types of families
350083 its a good idea because there are many people here who need a place to live
350084 we know its dangerous here for me if they make the offer ill accept
350085 the majority of socialist cities that were built in socialist countries failed
350086 when you create something by ideological decree it doesnt respond to the real needs of people cities have their own origin develop on their own and have their own dynamic
350087 i cant do that because i dont know anything about that
350088 im happy because of the proof of life but i see a picture of my daughter that shows her very sad very thin having suffered much
350089 lost a lot of weight his cheeks have sunken in
350090 to us it was like whoa a very stark difference from when he left
350091 but still were very grateful very gratified that this proof of life did surface
350092 looking at this photo of ingrid which has saddened my soul i can say that what i lived in was a five star hotel compared to what shes living in
350093 with this completion of the job we have a new constitution approved by a two thirds vote and if some of the articles dont get two thirds an arrangement will try to be reached and if theres no agreement they will be sent to a referendum
350094 with the new investment well be able to increase production little by little starting now in 2008
350095 the increases will allow us to meet our export commitments and in some years well have more than enough to exceed them by 2010 or 2011
350096 when you talk to some of the older people in the small rural communities they remember seeing condors when they were children
350097 it is considered to be the link between us and the heavens so its very important that we work to save it
350098 the puppets are important because they learn to recognize adult condors at feeding time as they do in nature
350099 we dont have plans to stop sending oil to the united states
350100 next week we are going to have a new constitution for the bolivian state
350101 if this is not an act of deception then lets move forward with it and lets do so as soon as possible
350102 the vote on sunday in venezuela showed that the people of south america want to stand up for democracy and that we wont stand for losing our individual liberties
350103 that is what theyre doing now trying to bring the government down using the national news media in order to do so
350104 but mas still has a lot of support in rural areas throughout the country and in the political strongholds of la paz and el alto where traditionally most national political decision making happens
350105 i think it makes a substantial difference because he can concentrate on registering voters and getting to the polls a much larger portion of his campesino base
350106 this is an authoritarian project that only seeks to perpetuate morales in power
350107 the first thing we did was to defeat that giant leap of the president to his totalitarian project
350108 that has an enormous significance the second thing we did was to show that the vote does work here
350109 we had 3 million fewer votes than we received a year ago imagine that
350110 they abstained because of doubts fears because there wasnt enough time or preparation to explain perhaps
350111 but there you find many political elements and statistics that we need to take into account to continue this battle
350112 the natural tendency is to be sympathetic toward people after they reach a certain age but these are the last people on earth who deserve sympathy
350113 i think that in no way does the passage of time lessen their crimes their victims deserve that an honest effort be made to find them
350114 theres now a prize of 310 000 euros on his head 130 000 offered by the german government another 130 000 offered by us and this july the austrians added another 50 000 euros
350115 side denies having documents related to the division of information that was the office that operated steps from per ns office
350116 the older peronists have a really hard time dealing with it but the younger ones particularly those who grew up during the military dictatorship here are more willing to accept that per n wasnt a demigod
350117 so many of us say they should be punished but nothing happens
350118 how much more proof do you need everybody knows what happened
350119 are not terrorists they are true armies they must be recognized
350120 i say it even though someone could be bothered by it
350121 the farc uses violence against democratic government and civil populations in the canon of international law that makes them a terrorist group
350122 we are very aware of your struggle you are the ones that have to maintain this effort
350123 i had been alerted that the liberation could occur or that the farc could announce the liberation of a group of people
350124 this seems to be a good christmas gift especially for the families of these people
350125 we accept your call to liberate dr clara rojas her little one emmanuel and dr consuelo gonzales de perdomo as a sign of the unquestionable hope we had placed on your role as facilitator
350126 the order to liberate them in colombia has been made
350127 if these guerrillas demobilize and bring out hostages dr ingrid betancourt and other countrymen those guerrillas will enjoy liberty as much as the hostages
350128 there can be no sector in latin america or the world that does not recognize presidents ch vezs tireless and unwavering efforts to obtain peace in colombia
350129 listen to these messages that the entire world has sent
350130 we wish our son were one of the three but were very grateful the farc has agreed to do this
350131 very soon i will meet him and little by little well start sharing what for us is a rebirth
350132 i dont have any information about the boys father whats more i dont have any idea if he even knows hes the boys father
350133 the information i have is that he could even have died i dont have any confirmation
350134 have the peace to face the situation of the birth
350135 and i said well ill put it in the hands of god
350136 carlos kauffmann advised guido alejandro antonini wilson that the consequences of antoninis future actions might put the life of antoninis children at risk
350137 moises maionica advised guido alejandro antonini wilson that pdvsa would pay for all the expenses and financial penalties that antonini might incur as a result of the seizure of the 800 000
350138 clearly he has a lot of money and clearly he has a regional political agenda but theres never been concrete evidence of him supporting campaigns
350139 i think if this were proven true and if this were established then this would be a significant change and would mark a real departure in the conversation up until now
350140 it is part of the plan of the empire to disrupt our travels
350141 all these past corruption scandals seemed to have some degree of separation from cristina they were seen as a part of n stor kirchners administration and the expectation was that cristina kirchner was something better
350142 so if there is a link to her campaign then this will be a very big problem for her
350143 one of the things that has caused concern for venezuelans is to know that the president directly or through his agents is using the power of the venezuelan government in political projects abroad
350144 its an open official policy of this regime to utilize the public resources to carry out international policies everyone knows that
350145 assured antonini that the matter was being handled at the top of the venezuelan government
350146 hes decided that his best tactic to recover the control of his movement is to instill fear in his people that theres a world conspiracy against venezuela
350147 its a tactic that uses histrionics as a weapon to unite the people so they vote for him on sunday
350148 theres an army theres a navy theres an air force theres a national guard theres soldiers theres cadets and the people dont consider it because youll repent
350149 if you launch an offensive i will launch a counterattack
350150 the conclusion of the scientists is that theres a greater probability that juan david belongs to the family of do a clara gonz lez de rojas than to any other family
350151 that the farc is hermetic and virtually impenetrable that it loves to play games and cant be trusted
350152 it will recall the fruitless peace process of the pastrana years marked by lots of posturing and promises but not concrete results
350153 this enemy is supremely intelligent and has lots of money
350154 it shows that the narco traffickers are betting on this method
350155 whats most striking is the logistical capacity of these criminals to take all this material into the heart of the jungle including heavy equipment like propulsion gear and generators
350156 like the trunk of that papaya the cassava and bananas are also dying
350157 before oxy came the fruits and the plants grew well
350158 history has shown that oil companies will cut corners if someone isnt watching
350159 we try to get to local communities first to help them make informed decisions about oil companies and the changes they bring
350160 we are aware of no credible data of negative community health impacts resulting from occidentals operations in peru
350161 long standing commitment and policy to protect the environment and the health and safety of people
350162 wilber varela in the last few years was truly the main leader of colombian drug trafficking organizations
350163 pas un seul mot ne signifie quoi que ce soit
350164 i felt something on my leg and thought it was my cat and i look up and it was this naked guy and he ran again
350165 well not really i would recognize him more if there was a shot of his skinny white butt the second time he was naked as could be
350166 the homebush location is a fantastic olympic legacy and the v8s could be a great addition to an already busy sporting and entertainment precinct
350167 but we want to ensure maximum benefits to the people of nsw and the best return on the investment of taxpayer dollars
350168 it reflects the fact that premier iemma and the nsw government want nsw to be the event capital of australia
350169 i must stress that the nrl and not the clubs should look at paying on top of a players club contract a separate commercial contract for elite players
350170 an elite groups of say 30 players based on what that players is worth to the game commercially
350171 say the most a top end player can get from the nrl as a top up sum is a300 000 and the minimum is a100 000 then the average per player will be a200 000
350172 it would do a lot to stop high profile players leaving the nrl
350173 thirty players at an average of a200 000 would mean the nrl would have to find a6 million a season and would stand a much better chance of keeping its players
350174 i dont think a6 million is something the nrl given its turnover and its multi million dollar tv rights wouldnt be able to find in its next budget
350175 an elite contract would make it more attractive for those guys who people love to watch either live or on the box to stay in rugby league
350176 theres been plenty of criticism over how he left his club
350177 i feel like my game is a lot better obviously the score doesnt show it but i know what i need to work on
350178 if the opportunity to play in a pga tour event comes again id think about it
350179 i just kept telling my caddy i wanted to get to 15 under
350180 this is the first time ive played really well in a united states tournament
350181 i was pretty nervous for awhile i kept hitting good shots and he flores kept getting up and down from incredible places
350182 i was hitting it really well and was comfortable with what i was doing i just kept focusing on my game
350183 there is smoke due to wear and tear on the brakes
350184 the smoke started at sindang station but it was just from the action of stopping the train if we hadnt acted quickly it could have been really serious
350185 i immediately thought of the fire that happened in daegue and was frightened
350186 why should i be ashamed becuz of someone else sickness
350187 a gorgeous little thing like yourself why i bet you must be beating them down with sticks

350207 its a restaurant cum lounge bar and i am opening this in delhi it also has a very interesting name lap implying lounge and party we were thinking about a lot names but we wanted something different and yet simple so we just took the initials
350208 having a restaurant was something that i have always carried in my mind since long but having a restaurant in mumbai is very difficult with respect to space finding a suitable place is very tedious and time consuming in addition to that i have a lot of film commitments as well i have always been excited to open a place like this for late night parties and for people to just hang out and chill out i was toying with the idea for a while then one day i met a d singh the partner and director of olive bar amp kitchen restaurant he told me about his desire to open something new so we together decided on lap anyways it would be great to begin with a partner besides a d singh and me there is shirish saras our third partner to this venture i know shirish for 20 years and share a great rapport we short listed a place at the samrat hotel in delhi it has great potential its large and once the work is all done it would be really nice

350210 in delhi it will have a grand opening by november that is if we meet the deadline its like a challenge from my perspective a need to do something different thats all
350211 well the credit goes to the director abhishek kapoor and niharika who has worked on everyones look rock on is inspired from individuals all over the world who have a dream but somewhere due to many uncanny reasons we brush it off one is stuck in the mundane routine of life would life be any different if you get an opportunity to change it is the question often asked the film is a musical and realistic it talks a lot about relationships friendship the band is called magic i am the lead guitarist of the band and farhan is the lead singer luke kenny is keyboardist while purab is the drummer it is the journey of magic prachi is fabulous in the film she is one of female actors in the film the other girl is sahana goswami she has a difficult role to play and suhana has done an amazing job

350281 we meet and talk a lot we have become good friends
350282 before they came to the surrogacy agency they had tried every possible method to conceive but all failed
350283 i wanted to build a platform to help those miserable women and families
350284 they are happy with my pregnancy they live in another city and come to see me frequently they are really kind people i am pleased to carry their child
350285 the rate of infertility among chinese couples is reportedly between 7 and 10 per cent
350286 i wanted to build a platform to help those miserable women and families
350287 about 800 couples have had babies with our help and so far no serious disputes have happened between clients and surrogates
350288 we want to make sure that the clients show honesty and respect to their surrogates we decline anyone who simply thinks a surrogate mother is a reproductive machine and might treat them badly
350289 it is an inevitable phase of any new business still i see great opportunities in the surrogacy service
350290 a surrogate should also have a mild character and not get her clients into trouble
350291 i will never tell my son of my surrogacy for i dont think he and people around him would accept it
350292 after high school i did printmaking and when i went to america to study abroad i saw that there was a field for animation
350293 i sent it to major festivals and to events where the application fee was cheap
350294 my grandmother was born in 1911 she went through the japanese occupation and the korean war i turned all those hardships into a fantasy
350295 when sundance was underway i was doing my first month at pixar
350296 i like finding nemo most out of all the films that i did it was the first movie i did from beginning to end
350297 the evidence were receiving from right across the country be it cornwall london or the north east england is that solicitors are not receiving a hip when the deal is struck
350298 you would have expected that the hip would be available immediately the agreement to accept an offer is reached
350299 were not getting a hip until three to four weeks later sometimes not until exchange of contracts
350300 sellers dont see the point of them they certainly dont want the aggravation of putting them together and nobody wants to pay the cost in what is a flat market
350301 about 130 000 houses went onto the market in may but only 89 000 hips were commissioned
350302 some of that shortfall would have been made up by people who sacked their first estate agent because they failed to sell the house and instructed a new agent they dont need to commission a hip
350303 however we think about 15 000 people put their house on the market without first commissioning a hip
350304 if i had the choice now i wouldnt buy a hip i cant see what value it has
350305 ive had a hip in place since november and it hasnt helped us sell the house at all nobodys ever asked to see it although weve told them that there is one available
350306 the home information pack itself the majority of the information is quite technical like title like searches and its not really for the interest of the individual consumer
350307 buying a home is still quite an emotional decision the idea is that once youve made that emotional decision youve chosen the house you want to buy and you turn to your professional adviser your conveyancer a whole pile of the information they need is already available for them
350308 we did come from rotonda so its about an hour drive here to come and not be able to swim
350309 i wish we would have known about this to begin with
350310 if theyre good ill be able to open the beach saturday afternoon
350311 my concern is that the cumulative drop will probably be worse than we saw in the 90 91 recession which would make it the worst recession since 1973 1975
350312 the economy began to contract in the second quarter of this year but we have been awfully close to recession like conditions for a year
350313 the reason we are concerned is that not only did we see a sharp decline in the second quarter but the decline is across virtually every industry and almost every part of the state
350314 generally we measure that by employment and loss of jobs
350315 we have had almost four months of that going on
350316 who knows whether it started fourth quarter last year or first quarter this year
350317 ive been saying there was a high probability we were headed for one because of the housing
350318 downtown sarasota seems pretty solid but i know the housing markets in the southern part of the county are struggling in a major way
350319 the problem with declaring a recession at the state level is that there is never a definitive way to back it up
350320 certainly wachovia was at ground zero for the boom and the bust they have a keen firsthand knowledge of what is going on there
350321 my belief is that the housing recovery is going to be quite muted l shaped rather than v shaped and as a result of that you are not going to really see much pickup for a while there
350322 we are not going to see any real signs of positive growth in florida until the middle of 2009 and we are not going to get back to the level of growth we are accustomed to in florida until 2010 and it is all due to the credit crunch and the housing bust
350323 we think we are going to bounce along the bottom here until late 2009 or early 2010
350324 were getting people from the east coast but not enough to fill in for whats missing from national tourism
350325 the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a simple question
350326 if we want to create jobs we should do more to make work pay for ordinary americans
350327 across this country americans are hurting and todays job numbers are just the latest reminder of the economic challenges we face
350328 i do not believe that raising taxes is the answer to our economic problems there is no surer way to force jobs overseas than to raise taxes on businesses
350329 i may not have spoken out the way you would have wanted me to speak out
350330 which gives you the option of voting for somebody else
350331 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
350332 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
350333 if senator obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
350334 with that kind of track record senator mccain should be the last person lecturing senator obama about a commitment to quality education for our nations children
350335 i think the united states of america has reached the point where we should provide equal economic opportunity for all americans
350336 that frankly is something that i dont think helps anyone
350337 he handled himself very well given the crowd and his positions
350338 it would have been nice to see him compare and contrast himself less with obama but focus more on his positions
350339 still needs to go to school on affirmative action and the real impact
350340 i do not think this country is in a place where we all have an equal opportunity
350341 hopefully when we get there we wont need the programs but we arent there yet
350342 i can hear and listen to the passion caring and concern involved that you have expressed so eloquently
350343 i do have an idea what its like to be deprived of your rights
350344 i learned to love america when i was deprived of its company
350345 what you did not hear in there was the usual run of the mill political rhetoric
350346 the fact that the fdic is named as receiver the bank was essentially bankrupt
350347 why wasnt this pardon the pun a priority for the fdic
350348 weve had them in and out of the bank on an every other day basis
350349 this is good for the community of bradenton good for the customers and good for the employees
350350 you put on the right costume and the character just falls into place
350351 but she drove around town in her lavender fleetwood cadillac
350352 so there was some flash to her like these buttons
350353 a simple gal from a small town somewhere in west virginia this was not somebody who put on airs
350354 and youll keep them on when you shake hands that was the thing not a bad idea actually
350355 that disappointed me i mean 99 percent of the world picks roses as their favorite flower and she was a gardener so somehow i expected more but again a conventional gal just rich
350356 ive had this thing since what no sex please were british at the apple 10 years ago
350357 or more or less who remembers anyway i drag it out for parts where nothing is allowed to jiggle
350358 well thats true you look at the photographs of marie and the bosoms were very
350359 look the woman lived part of the year in her husbands fishing camp out on the myakka
350360 they lived for 10 years in the little bungalow that was meant to be the guard house and she was perfectly happy there apparently living the simple life out in the woods id say in general she was unfettered thats a good word for her
350361 that actually happened to me once with okeeffe i introduced myself and some woman said oh im so honored im so thrilled and i had to tell her darling sorry to be the one to bring you the news but georgias dead
350362 when you bring them back to the grave thats when you know youre doing your job
350363 we lost like five children in one week mostly due to job loss
350364 but there were 25 people out there it was dark these guys were all engaged in a fight and no one knows which blow was the one that killed him
350365 essentially the police are saying that two people committed the same murder
350366 the whole familys been crying from day 1 including max
350367 and our spirit has been beaten down into the ground just like he was
350368 we took them everywhere to help people see what we were planning
350369 he said kind of jokingly that for many years he couldnt show anybody what he was doing not even his family so this was an opportunity to do things that he could share with other people and see them enjoy it
350370 he was the smartest guy that you would ever meet
350371 best practices guide 101 amazingly simple ways to beat insomnia
350372 i would dearly love to see the day when we have no animal welfare problems in kent but i feel saddened that day is a long way off
350373 these horses are left or dumped in fields and no one knows who the owners are some get better if we find them quickly or they are found dead
350374 it is a graphic demonstration of the irresponsibility of some horse owners
350375 these animals are the helpless victims of our throwaway society
350376 theyre bought on a whim and discarded when the novelty wears off todays must have item quickly turns into tomorrows cast off
350377 prosecuting is a last resort under the legislation we offer advice and guidance to improve the lot of the animal first
350378 next is a welfare improvement notice then a formal warning notice and finally we will put them in front of a magistrate
350379 until this government and any future government gets firmly to grips with the fact that antisocial behaviour and the general uncaring attitude of many people in todays society are largely to blame for these figures we will not begin to see any improvements
350380 we have to ask is the newest animal welfare act actually working
350381 i enjoyed the fight especially driving in front my family and friends
350382 the battle is almost as close as last year when i fought with marcus gr nholm
350383 everything is so close between us that im not going to take any gambles by changing the settings on the car there are many new stages tomorrow so anything can happen on roads that we dont know so well
350384 i approached a left right left combination of bends and decided to keep the car as straight as i could
350385 but i hit a rock which wasnt in my pace notes with the front right of the car the handling felt strange immediately afterwards and suddenly i was thrown off the road into the ditch where the car half rolled and hit a small tree the data shows i was doing 117kph when i went off
350386 i just thought this cant be happening to me again i felt relaxed this morning and felt really confident in the opening stage and the early part of the next i want to continue so that i can get my confidence back
350387 im getting the feeling back after the break and i was happy with my times on these rapid stages this is a very very fast rally and on the open sections we gave it everything but maybe i backed off a little on some of the more aggressive jumps today was about getting to the end and building confidence the changing weather meant i had to adapt my driving in some areas i tried to go full out on some of the later stages but there were times when i eased off as the road became slippery
350388 im disappointed with jari matti he made a fundamental mistake in making his pace notes by not including the rock he hit he put more pressure on mikko who has done an exceptional job from first in the start order at the start of the day i felt if we could be within 15sec of the lead we would be in a good position tomorrow

350429 i saw different aspects of the game at corner as far as knowing where the help from a safety is
350430 a lot of offensive guys would grab that facemask and push
350431 now if the db turns his head or jerks in any way and we have hold of his facemask thats a penalty i havent done it a lot but it happens
350432 you thought should i try to break the pass up ive got to make sure im not forcing him out there was too much gray area this clears everything up and makes the game a lot simpler i welcome it
350433 its not so much that it favors the defense as much as it takes a lot of the guesswork out of the game
350434 i guess it is kind of helping the defense but its also making it easy on the referees too
350435 because a lot of big plays were made in the last year where it came down to was a guys foot inbound
350436 if hes in the air push him out of bounds as long as you dont carry him out of bounds its out of bounds
350437 were in the air trying to make a catch trying to get two feet in but the momentum of the defensive player is forcing us out of bounds theyre taking some of the guesswork out of it but theyre also taking away part of the offensive players game
350438 happens a lot because the best way to beat the cover two defense is the corner route
350439 when we play a cover two team thats what we do its a timing route
350440 i guess you just have to work more on getting your feet in bounds without getting forced out
350441 run patterns a little better and get separation so you wont have to worry about that

350444 cara n o sei o que aconteceu tive um apag o da hora em que eu estava no clube at me encontrar na minha cama de pijama acordei olhei a roupa que usei na balada e minha camiseta estava cheia de sangue vou te falar de quem foi a culpa da vodka
350445 eu sempre fui de tomar cerveja e isso nunca me aconteceu de uns tempos para c fui para a vodka lembro me de ter tomado a quarta ou quinta vodka inclusive a mina do bar me deu a dose de gra a e a s me recordo de ter acordado na cama com as costas raladas
350446 um amigo que estava comigo esclareceu a parada eu aloprei subia para a pista descia para o show subia para a pista chegava em todas as minas poss veis da balada teve uma hora em que eu subi no palco e fiquei tocando air guitar no show da banda nem lembro quem tava no palco
350447 a ele disse que eu fui o banheiro e nunca mais voltei quando ele foi ver o que acontecia eu estava entalado na porta do reservado parecia um parto de uma pessoa ele falou para fora do buraco estava minha cabe a e meus bra os rid culo
350448 n o me pergunte por que eu resolvi sair pelo v o da porta do reservado n o sei dizer o pior que nem foi problema de a porta estar trancada travada ela estava aberta n o sei o que deu na minha cabe a de querer sair por baixo dela
350449 o neg cio que at estar s os bra os e a cabe a estava tudo bem mas a resolvi passar a cintura a entalou
350450 come ou a juntar a balada inteira no banheiro para me ver eu ali tipo um verme uns rindo outros com cara de quem n o estava acreditando
350451 a merda foi que os seguran as chegaram no banheiro e acharam que eu tava zoando bravos come aram a me puxar com for a para eu sair logo dali isso foi o que machucou minhas costas
350452 quando eles viram que eu estava realmente entalado passou a raiva dos caras mas a eles come aram a gargalhar sem parar da minha situa o

350479 travel is the frivolous part of serious lives and the serious part of frivolous ones
350480 for my part i travel not to go anywhere but to go i travel for travels sake the great affair is to move
350481 sometimes clients like to drink their own kool aid smoke their own brand crack
350482 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate
350483 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
350484 this terrorism is certainly one of the issues which for us is a very important part of the issues in the summit
350485 is that there will be a next time and it could be as soon as tomorrow
350486 fresh produce travels a mean of 1 500 miles to get to our plates
350487 feedlots can hold 300 000 head of cattle outbreaks involving several hundred victims no longer shock us
350488 unfortunately if fda chooses to limit the information they share with states we are likewise limited in how useful our assistance will be to them
350489 fda failed to ask states to provide them with information we now know they needed and we had no way of knowing what kind of data that was without them telling us
350490 is what it is it worked it was just slow
350491 i dont know if im completely finished with the characters
350492 im sorry to bother you but could you tell me what kind of car youre driving
350493 i know but i was wondering is that are you driving a mercedes guardian
350494 do you mind if i take a picture with it
350495 really you want to take a picture with the car
350496 sure nobody is going to believe me if i dont get proof
350497 went at it with a flame thrower in the online video didnt even pucker the paint
350498 of course not you could roll a tank over this baby not much of a market for one over here designed for middle east diplomats arms dealers and drug lords mostly
350499 maka bukan sedikit negeri negeri yang kami binasakan dengan sebab kezaliman penduduknya
350500 i cannot imagine any scenario where layoffs would be necessary for mohela
350501 we will need everyones input on how this can be accomplished
350502 weve seen a lot of mosquitos and its going to continue were going to see numbers of mosquitos that we havent seen for many years
350503 you dont have to worry about wildlife or animals drinking out of a pond
350504 because it is something that is real specific to mosquito larvae
350505 mosquitos arent attracted to light they find us by detecting carbon dioxide and other odors we give off
350506 theres a lot of cases in the eastern part of the state
350507 but its because populations are higher on an individual basis people in the western part of the state are more at risk
350508 these culex tarsalis mosquitoes start feeding on humans and other large mammals in the summer after nesting birds leave their nest
350509 the risk of west nile virus will continue through the summer months until frost
350510 coach willingham tried to get me in but they didnt approve it
350511 the holdup was my grade point average it wasnt high enough with the sat score i got i needed to retake two classes online and get bs i finished the classes and still need to take the finals but i have bs for sure
350512 guess its a day late a dollar short as they say
350513 im qualified with those bs they told me what to do and i got it done but theyve talked about different options for me and i want to spend time with the team and stuff
350514 the ncaa allows that and that would be a great option so i can still bond with my teammates
350515 boyles is my boy and we talked about this its not the worst thing but im really bummed
350516 he was back home last week and we threw some balls and talked about it
350517 dns patching has probably slowed down because the procedure effectively requires customer facing dns servers to be segregated from the domain hosting servers
350518 most isps dont segregate the servers because it is cheaper and easier to keep them in one box there has not been a compelling reason to segregate them until now which is probably why it is taking some isps a long time to secure themselves
350519 a hacker could make a fake bank web site find a vulnerable resolver and poison its cache so that customers using that resolver are directed to the fake address instead of the bank web site
350520 the bank is aware of situation and we are quite comfortable as we have the tools in place to monitor the situation which complement our existing capability in both hawk i and two factor authentication
350521 undermined the assumption infamously espoused by mr summers that boys are more likely than girls to be math geniuses
350522 if one is talking about physicists at a top 25 research university
350523 were talking about people who are three and a half four standard deviations above the mean in the one in 5 000 one in 10 000 class even small differences in the standard deviation will translate into very large differences in the available pool
350524 sparked an uproar at an academic conference friday when he said that innate differences between men and women might be one reason fewer women succeed in science and math careers
350525 if we could go back in time and take this class we would
350526 accounting cash flow and p amp l make you want to run screaming
350527 a lot of people come in this sport and have a lot of hype and they dont quite stack up where you expect them to be
350528 i dont think joey is going to be that guy
350529 he belongs here he wasnt promoted too quickly i dont know if we threw him in the deep end or not we put him in the nationwide series when he turned 18 thats what this series is for hes just done exceptionally well at it you just dont expect a driver to go out and win in his third race hes capitalizing on his opportunities as well
350530 joey logano jumped into some really good equipment behind some good people with really good set ups it really made him look good hes got a lot of talent too but so does brad were sitting here second in the point standings with a good shot at winning the championship
350531 at a lot of these tracks brad is still a rookie were trying to give him the best equipment we can give him but weve been getting killed by toyota all year if we had what toyota has had maybe it would be a different story but points leader clint bowyer would be in the same boat were in things are equal up now so maybe well see a difference
350532 theres a big difference between joey and myself and the way we came up
350533 i dont mean this to be in a hyping way but i feel like one of the last of the mohicans
350534 hopefully i can close this deal out and make the most of it
350535 thats whats different between me and joey we dont have that big of an age separation we may look the same skinny young white boys but were just different way different
350536 in landons case prior to dover he was driving a race then skipping three
350537 he had more on the schedule earlier in the year but it just didnt work out
350538 then he went to chicago and that was the biggest track he had ran a nationwide car on and that was going to be the real test and he made an a on that he showed us that he was at the point where if he continues to make progress dale jr should look at putting him in a full time ride next year
350539 i think my greatest strength right now is qualifying weve been really decent in my truck i always seem to have something someone will wreck in front of us or ill make a rookie mistake but weve qualified strong
350540 colins not running a full time deal so hes not getting quite the exposure that joey logano is getting
350541 hes the real thing he did a great job at orp last week unfortunately hes just practicing for greg but hes fun to watch its going to be fun watching him grow
350542 i try really hard not to go into the year expecting anything
350543 expect the unexpected more than anything else im happy to be where im at really happy
350544 we believe he was in the woods and near our officers who were also in the woods all night
350545 theres a saying up here that this is a great place to raise kids
350546 we have seen a marked increase in these graffiti tagging gangs taking to weapons and fighting to protect their walls their territory their name
350547 if we see someone calling the police then we target them
350548 you are trying to stop me from what i live what i believe in and what i breathe we are not going to let no one get in the way
350549 take a deep breath back off and call law enforcement
350550 i said if you are going to write on the wall write on your own wall
350551 why would you want to put spray paint on a kids face
350552 we live in the same community we are all in this hellhole together
350553 i curl up in bed and the wind is howling and i see him freezing cold in his underpants trying to run away i imagine his terror i imagine him escaping and then being shot in his right eye i hear him crying for me
350554 my biggest fear is that this person will be getting out of jail and some other child will be hurt
350555 had there been a death penalty we would have asked for it
350556 killed in a brutal cold blooded fashion after he had been marched by his assailant approximately six tenths of a mile unattired in the dark in below freezing weather
350557 at one point attempted to implicate his father as the assailant
350558 he attempted to perpetrate unnatural sexual acts on a 15 year old boy at exactly the same location on the premises of the lone pine hunters club on aug 23 1968
350559 threatened the boy with a firearm chased him through the forest and placed a rock on his head and threatened to smash his skull in
350560 ill never forget that ride it was a cold cold night
350561 were this crime committed today guay would never have the opportunity to be paroled
350562 if hes served his time he is allowed to go free
350563 without evidence of a direct threat i dont think the victims mother can do anything
350564 the punishment did not fit the crime i was very disturbed he was allowed a second degree murder charge its not fair 25 years for killing a person as a father and a grandfather i want to keep these predators at arms length the sentence was light he was a convicted felon and he could not afford to let lindovski get away
350565 it just seems so unjust so unfair that he could murder my little boy and just walk out i pray that before i leave this earth he has justice i know how important it is to forgive but this little guy never had a chance
350566 i want people to be up in arms my biggest fear is this person will get out and harm other children
350567 and the laws have substantially changed over the past 25 years
350568 based on the information you the cabinet have given me registration is not required not because it was so long ago but because of the charge he was convicted of
350569 the general court further finds that the prognosis for rehabilitating sexually violent predators in a prison setting is poor the treatment needs of this population are very long term
350570 we informed him that if he submits an alternative plan we will review it
350571 nooo i dont know how to do it its tooo hard why are you making me do this youre so boring
350572 do it now or well add a half hour to our chinese lesson hao bu hao
350573 very good now finish playing this piece up to this point and well work on the rest tomorrow
350574 fine but i dont want to do any work tomorrow because its friiiday i dont want to do anything at all but kick myself in the face
350575 what it didnt work you just have to try harder
350576 this man has just told us a most interesting story about you
350577 i am a police officer and your online friend goto123
350578 i know i told you all that but it wasnt true you see there are people on line who pretend to be kids i was one of them but while others do it to injure kids and hurt them i belong to a group of parents who do it to protect kids from predators i came here to find you to teach you how dangerous it is to talk to people on line you told me enough about yourself to make it easy for me to find you you named the school you went to the name of your ball team and the position you played the number and name on your jersey just made finding you a breeze
350579 no i live in raleigh it made you feel safe to think i was so far away didnt it
350580 i had a friend whose daughter was like you only she wasnt as lucky the guy found her a nd murdered her while she was home alone kids are taught not to tell anyone when they are alone yet they do it all the time on line the wrong people trick you into giving out information a little here and there on line before you know it you have told them enough for them to find you without even realizing you have done it i hope youve learned a lesson from this and wont do it again tell others about this so they will be safe too

350592 disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable
350593 raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions
350594 when that happens on the field usually guys have helmets on
350595 but this happened on the sidelines so it probably wasnt a good idea

350599 this isnt about definitions this about action on the ground to help these workers
350600 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
350601 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
350602 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
350603 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
350604 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
350605 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
350606 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
350607 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
350608 represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning
350609 do you think you are better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago if you arent better off can you afford another four years
350610 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
350611 it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down your own debt
350612 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
350613 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done

350624 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
350625 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
350626 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
350627 he will need regular medical supervision until his doctors clear him to return to work
350628 his doctors remain hopeful that he will fully recover but due to extensive surgery and the nature of the injuries there remains a substantial risk of both infection and other complications
350629 his two fingers are pretty smashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it into the story
350630 received information that suggests that the other driver may have been traveling upwards of 50 miles per hour and that said driver may not have been looking forward at the time of the accident

350635 the governor promised california when he was running for this job that he was the leader that could work with the legislature to get responsible budgets for california
350636 and we are here to say governor schwarzenegger you are terminated
350637 i needed this job to continue to do my part in being their mother to provide them with the security that they need
350638 it hurts me to my heart to have to tell my sons this
350639 understands how difficult this is going to be for state workers
350640 its a day by day situation so well try to manage
350641 i knew when they start cutting jobs youre going to get poor service
350642 we dont believe the governor has the authority to lay off state workers by executive fiat and thats what that executive order does
350643 we will defend ourselves in court if necessary to make sure the state can meet its obligations
350644 imagine going in to talk to your boss and saying lets talk about wages and he says well im cutting you to minimum wage now what do you want to talk about
350645 ill be in argentina next month if you need help
350646 you get some butterflies but once you take that first hit youre ready to go
350647 i was always a shy and reserved person who just wanted to work hard and stay in the background
350648 theres no need to talk when youre a good athlete
350649 half of my teammates were mad at me so i said its better not to say anything
350650 he may not like it public speaking so much but he is really good at it
350651 ive told a lot of these guys what are you looking over your shoulder for

350657 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
350658 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
350659 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
350660 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
350661 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck

350676 die zensoren haben sehr bewusst ausgew hlt welche seiten sie ffnen sie wollen damit dem ausland gegen ber ein zeichen setzen
350677 sie ist zumindest ein schritt nach vorn ich hoffe dass die freigabe der seiten jetzt nicht nur f r die zeit der spiele gilt sondern auch danach und dass am ende das internet v llig ge ffnet wird
350678 sie bef rchten offenbar dass ich wenn ich allein in die stadt fahre kontakt zu ausl ndischen politikern aufnehmen will die zur er ffnung der spiele kommen

350686 eine energiepolitik ohne gro kraftwerke ist in deutschland v llig unvorstellbar gegen eine solche position muss ich vorgehen k nnen das verlangt das landesinteresse das in diesem fall dem parteiinteresse vorgeht
350687 wenn dies tats chlich so kommt und auf der anderen seite jemand wie ich aus der partei geschmissen wird dann ist das ein bild von dem ich kaum glaube dass es der spd zutr glich sein wird
350688 ich h tte zur ckgefeuert und argumentiert warum der andere unrecht hat diese inhaltliche auseinandersetzung hat aber weder die hessische noch die bundes spd bis jetzt gewagt

350718 what this did was verify what we already knew about the impact of ribose on energy recovery in muscles generally
350719 but specifically we determined the energy building benefit of ribose directly improved the debilitating symptoms of these conditions i think this study and follow on studies now in development will make ribose one of the most important new nutrients studies in the next few years
350720 we do know however that people with fibromyalgia have lower levels of the energy molecule called adenosine triphosphate atp and a reduced capacity to make atp in their muscles we know from previous studies ribose can fuel atp synthesis and are gratified to see this latest piece of science showing ribose supplementation can reduce muscle pain and enhance quality of life for those suffering with chronic fatigue

350733 he showed up he threw on some gear and he took the time to come out and catch my bullpen
350734 that was a classy move especially by an 18 year veteran
350735 ive never really had to do it before so it will just be a growing experience more than anything
350736 the only way to get comfortable with somebody is for him to be behind the plate and catch me you can talk about it all you want but its about execution and him getting a feel for my stuff and what i like to do and how i do it
350737 hes been great he was working with me and kept saying i am with you i am there with you
350738 hes come in and is trying to familiarize himself its just going to take time and experience
350739 you have to still pitch your game dont worry about shaking him off or if you have to have him come out and talk things over
350740 it just happens i dont go out there with a different mentality i just go in there to get three people out
350741 you cant go out there and walk the first guy
350742 thats unacceptable you cant go out there and walk anybody
350743 you dont get to him very often and its a full moon if he walks somebody
350744 its frustrating because we got a great performance by sidney and werent able to capitalize
350745 they scratch a run across against mo and you lose a game its unfortunate im going to continue to go to him because thats his job hes the greatest closer of all time it just didnt work tonight
350746 it was just nice to get back on the rubber and actually get back to pitching with all these distractions
350747 i was rusty a little bit the rust of not pitching in 20 days i mainly lose a little bit of the touch for the pitches and the location once you let it go there is no way to pull it back
350748 he was better than the last time i faced him
350749 his breaking pitch was sharp if he pitches like he did tonight hes going to be tough
350750 i was just trying to make contact use the middle of the field get the run in and not hit a ground ball
350751 i wasnt able to execute on a couple of pitches and ended up giving up homers
350752 it was an amazing thing why not doubles all homers
350753 we were trying to get 75 pitches in and i was able to go a little deeper
350754 the feeling of the game let me know i could go a little deeper or at least try i dont regret it i hope the next time out im able to do that and do even better
350755 we are a joint venture made up of three companies i specifically work for hammond
350756 i never met him or had any dealings directly with him his management team was down there at the school and that was overseen by the state
350757 people say that manny is a hall of famer but i dont know that hes such a shoo in he lets in as many runs with poor defense as he contributes
350758 its the greatest summer ive ever spent i dont think it will ever sink in ive been totally overwhelmed by it
350759 it is a shell of what it used to be though its still great
350760 i would say it just happens i wish i could explain it or somebody could explain it to me
350761 hes pretty much owned me my entire career 1 for 9 plus friday nights walk any time you get on base against him its a plus
350762 mariano is incredible you dont get to him very often and its a full moon if he walks somebody
350763 our guy was outstanding it came down to a battle of the bullpens and they beat us
350764 this story is false and we have asked digitimes for a full retraction
350765 we have no intention of getting out of the chipset business in fact our mcp business is as strong as it has ever been for both amd and intel platforms mercury research has reported that the nvidia market share of amd platforms in q2 08 was 60 percent we have been steady in this range for over two years contrary to popular perception we have not lost any ground to amd despite their chipset introductions over the last year or so
350766 isnt it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too

350778 loads and thats why we decided to pass on this valuable information to the average hogwarts student who needs a place to snog away from the spectacle of common rooms and bleachers out on the quidditch pitch
350779 in our line of work blood blisters and boils are a natural consequence of many of our experiment gone slightly awry
350780 so putting a boils hex on the book only made sense
350781 we understand that hormones are araging but weve got to make a buck or two as well
350782 if kids want to snog theyre gonna snog were just giving them a tool to do it smartly

350791 saya banyak bicara dengan orang orang di sepakbola dan mereka bilang kepada saya tentang ajax yang di tahun 1970 an memenangi piala champions dengan tim yang luarbiasa muda dan mengubah wajah sepakbola
350792 orang orang mengatakan kepada saya bahwa kami sedang menuju ke sana tapi kami membutuhkan sebuah batu loncatan yakni menjuarai sesuatu dan mengetahui bagaimana caranya menang
350793 lihatlah chelsea mereka tidak memenangi apapun dalam beberapa tahun mereka membawa pemain pemain berpengalaman masuk dan kemudian menjuarai liga itu memberi mereka pengalaman dan kepercayaan diri yang lainnya akan menyusul kemudian
350794 kan semuanya sudah allah atur termasuk jodoh jadi jalanin aja yang ada nikmatin enjoy aja
350795 ucap si bapak dan jun pun terperangah dengan apa yang ada di depan matanya

350841 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
350842 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness

350875 koons had a genuine creative rationale for borrowing blanchs image rather than merely using it merely to get attention or to avoid the drudgery in working something fresh up

350890 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
350891 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
350892 its a shame that peoples awareness about the kind of disruption and destruction that is possible came from someone working inside biodefense circles

350977 recently i have become aware of the growing body of literature linking long term cell phone use to possible adverse health effects including cancer
350978 i guess its only newsworthy when a cancer doctor who hasnt done any of the research himself discovers it
350979 i consider it alarmist premature and without any scientific basis
350980 that may be due to the fact that so many of these studies have been done by scientists funded by the industry
350981 the problem is that we still dont know and the science has been heavily politicized henry lai was never alarmist he just presented his findings and refused to budge from them
350982 we thought they were collaborating and interested in the science
350983 it is noteworthy that despite numerous attempts other scientists have not been able to confirm dr lais claims of dna breaks in fact recent scientific reviews have concluded that the weight of scientific evidence demonstrates that rf radio frequency exposure does not induce dna breaks
350984 nobody wants to hear this and even though the corporations have cut off all the research money for this in the u s theres plenty of new data supporting this coming out of europe
350985 the price for duplicates of this machine will be for not more than 85 of the price of this machine
350986 the plans are the exclusive property of automation by design and may not be reproduced or used by raybestos or provided by raybestos to any third party for its use
350987 generally the construction of a written contract is a question of law for which summary judgment is particularly appropriate
350988 making and selling are distinct rights and you can assign one without the other
350989 a contract is ambiguous only where a reasonable person could find its terms susceptible to more than one interpretation
350990 abd grants rpc the right to duplicate any or all design copyrighted by abd as it relates to this project
350991 for maintenance and repair purposes raybestos products company does have the right to duplicate parts of the assembler
350992 for maintenance and replacement purposes raybestos products company does have the right to duplicate parts of the assembler
350993 is only for equipment to be used exclusively by raybestos
350994 the language of the license clearly states that the license is non transferable
350995 a bsent from the language the license however is any right to distribute the designs
350996 there is no question but that the license language does not permit distribution
350997 it is without question that the express language of the license prohibited the transfer of any duplication rights to any third party including pdsi
350998 o n its face the license did not grant any rights of distribution
350999 implicit right of distribution for the sole purpose of maintaining and repairing the machine
351000 o ne who is authorized to act for or in place of another a representative
351001 pdsis low bid on the replacement machine and its possession of the existing machines designs was merely coincidental in the face of a reasonable inference to the contrary

351003 is only for equipment to be used exclusively by rpc
351004 raybestoss implied right of distribution should not extend beyond making spare and replacements parts for the first machine because abd has not admitted such a right of distribution
351005 touch and go presents two primary issues the first is that the licensing agreement is irrevocable because consideration the 50 percent share of the profits was paid this contention is without merit
351006 businesses are not compelled to make sensible bargains but courts should not demolish the economic basis of bargains that would be sound if the contract were given a natural reading
351007 terminablility means that if the firms goals or methods diverge either side may get out
351008 yesterday i told them we could be sued if we played the music
351009 they buy paper twine and glue for their crafts they can pay for the music too
351010 rape is simply sex i am talking about husband rape here women enjoy sex so rape cannot be such a terrible physical ordeal to suggest that rape when conducted without violence is a serious crime is like suggesting force feeding a woman chocolate cake is a heinous offence

351037 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
351038 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
351039 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
351040 we believe efca is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time
351041 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
351042 we feel its important that our employee partners fully understand the implications that the employee free choice act could have on their work environment and benefits
351043 weve always maintained the termination was not related to the union and that there was nothing unlawful about an answer provided an associate about merit pay
351044 following the decision we were considering offering reinstatement but that is on hold since the union appealed the decision
351045 this is a david and goliath confrontation but we believe well have enough stones in the sling to knock this out
351046 why not why cant a bear do anything he likes
351047 because bears arent the sort of fellows who can do whatever they like
351048 once again this is just another low road attempt by john mccain to distract from his own record on latino issues by making false attacks on barack obama on a day when our economy lost another 51 000 jobs and when latino families all over the country are struggling john mccain chose the low road rather than offering a real plan for the latino community what is clear is that barack obama has fought for issues latinos care about for the past 20 years as a community organizer illinois state legislator us senator and as president he will continue his fight for comprehensive immigration reform education equality and healthcare for everyone
351049 i rise to defend the moon and stars the air we breathe the oceans and the rivers the plants and all living things upon this our mother earth and you and your children and your sacred poem before the salmon die before the birds stop singing before the bees forget how to fly

351057 we believe he was in the woods and near our officers who were also in the woods all night
351058 i feel bad about those other people that got killed
351059 my friend had to work otherwise we would have still been there
351060 theres a saying up here that this is a great place to raise kids
351061 im going crazy here i wish theyd tell me something
351062 we are sad to hear of the apparent death of this gentleman mr al masri and we extend our condolences to his family
351063 i say that because we have not completely established the circumstances or the facts of whats happened here
351064 the death of a father and husband is a tragedy for all those people who are left behind
351065 however we emphasise the fact that even if the person has spent some time in australia this does not mean that australia is responsible for all events that may befall them in the future
351066 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
351067 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
351068 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
351069 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
351070 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
351071 a city really none of us were comfortable walking in the streets to one that was basically safe
351072 the best equal opportunity employer in the country is the u s military
351073 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law

351080 but the polls more interesting finding was about who americans blame for 4 a gallon gas prices about two thirds said oil companies and foreign countries that produce energy were the major causes just over half blamed the bush administration the war in iraq and the moratorium on offshore drilling but only about 1 in 3 31 percent blamed democrats in congress for high gas prices
351081 hillary clinton is 100 percent committed to helping barack obama become the next president of the united states and realizes there are passionate feelings that remain among many of her supporters while no decisions have been made at this time they will be made collaboratively with senator clinton and her staff the dnc and senator obamas campaign and released at the appropriate time
351082 that is a question that i think is a very obvious one to ask i mean what will happen at the convention with respect to my putting my name in nomination a roll call vote no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the dnc and with the obama campaign
351083 i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
351084 because i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go its as old as greek drama there is a catharsis everybody comes they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good
351085 read from it diligently if we meet again here on earth i hope you can show me a well read and well used bible
351086 if people are going to build homes where hurricanes hit they have to assume a great part of that liability

351090 i was cool i was comfortable with it i was definitely comfortable with it it is what it is normal stuff that happens its crazy cause for me it was normal it was normal but i know when i look back at it when i see it im gonna be like damn look at this this is crazy i stun myself sometimes i cant even front pretend

351099 no redneck bar no gay bar went to a fancy one that thought it was cool because they played the police still had fun
351100 that was already defeated by the resistance and the army
351101 goes beyond politics and confessionalism maintaining security is your duty which requires sacrifices
351102 today the wheel of the state has begun to roll
351103 do not allow any space for corruption and sectarianism in this country because we are standing in front of the door to dialogue and the achievement of justice be the protectors of the nation and the people
351104 lebanon suffered a great deal to fight terror and it needs its armys sacrifices
351105 do not hesitate to curb violators no matter what their affiliations are
351106 the lebanese army fought fierce battles in the nahr al bared camp
351107 you have preserved our national unity with your sweat and blood do not let it be shaken now
351108 close to adopting practical measures that will force israel to cease the overflights
351109 they who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
351110 because im sure the first thing you will yell out when being questioned is
351111 i was just preparing a brief keep studying youre going to need it apparently
351112 in the heller case scotus declared an individual right to keep and bear arms in your own home for self defense subject to reasonable restrictions
351113 but apparently the supremes thought differently well 5 of them anyway
351114 you know son hard times do test our faith which can produce endurance which in turn makes us more mature
351115 i dont know about you son but i am about as mature as i want to be from tough times
351116 also why should i thank a serviceman for a right that this country has had since its inception
351117 provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity
351118 i walked out of the republican convention in san diego pointing out that it was really nothing much more than a picture show and there wasnt any news happening i dont think anyone can make that observation about this year
351119 this has been one of the most remarkable political years weve ever seen and even though we know who the candidates are going to be i still think there will be news coming out of both the democratic and republican conventions
351120 its issues like how the anglican communion is organized how it understands itself
351121 its about the churchs understanding of marriage of male and female of sexuality in gods plan
351122 its the benefit of anglicanism to me weve got everything from the arch conservative to the arch liberal
351123 there are people who have left st pauls on this issue both because were not liberal enough and not conservative enough
351124 it has affected us here at st pauls locally regionally nationally and internationally
351125 its a terribly devastating thing for me i grew up in this church this crisis and this issue has been very hurtful
351126 living with the ambiguity and the tensions has been very challenging
351127 some of us have the concern that this is drawing us away from our main mission
351128 were focused on showing the love of christ to the world
351129 by still gathering at the table both in spite of and because of our differences
351130 if the national episcopal church denied the resurrection of jesus christ wed have a problem with that beneath that its tough to answer
351131 it doesnt help us proclaim christ to pick a side
351132 et si tre adulte c tait avoir un compteur qui va de 0 280 et toujours rouler 60
351133 i think what hooked me on rollercoaters was the thrill i just love to be scared
351134 i hate to go to the park and stand in line for two hours for a thirty second ride
351135 im all right now but well find out tomorrow morning
351136 i hit it ok but you never know until you dont see it anymore
351137 lets do it and take photos with come all over her
351138 i did a boys are gross eye roll as they cheered their creative brilliance
351139 its not you its definitely me and this is how my body works at the moment
351140 i felt like turn 2 i really got well through the tunnel
351141 if only we could find a drummer and keyboard player but it s got to start with the songs so you can be our test audience
351142 a set of guiding principles that when communicated and adopted in the organization generates a desired pattern of decision making a good strategy provides a clear roadmap consisting of a set of guiding principles or rules that defines the actions people in the business should take and not take and the things they should prioritize and not prioritize to achieve desired goals
351143 focus on the other person in the relationship rather than them selves
351144 yes business leaders need to have certain personal characteristics to be successful but it is often the application of those characteristics within a specific context that define great success its not only who you are but when and where you are
351145 there is far too much focus on individual characteristics of leadership and far too little focus on the situational context by placing too much emphasis on the individual we can easily fall prey to the cult of the ceo and believe that any individual who was successful in one setting would naturally be successful in a new setting the list of once successful ceos who have failed in new business settings is long
351146 clearly context is important business leaders who have been sensitive to context possess what nitin nohria and i call contextual intelligence not only do these leaders understand the implications of the contextual forces that surround them they also have the ability to adapt and change their leadership style and approach as environmental conditions evolve success in one realm does not always translate into success in another indeed relying on past models of success without being sensitive to the context of the situation has often yielded major disappointments
351147 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
351148 is up there with the tesla roadster in terms of sex appeal
351149 i didnt see the sidewalk and i twisted my ankle
351150 it was a nice wake up call for me to be a lot more careful in the future because i clearly wasnt paying attention as i should have
351151 i wouldnt have taken that call but it might have been important
351152 it reinforces the idea that were seeing a steady but not dramatic decline in employment which is likely to last for some time
351153 significant public safety services to first responders across the country
351154 at least 25 public safety entities in 13 states throughout the country
351155 these agencies can ill afford to be confronted with a precipitous loss of service when dealing with potentially life or death situations
351156 why dont women run the world maybe its because they dont want to
351157 think of all the problems that disappear overnight we dont have to think about family leave or after school or the day to day grind or the tough challenges of work and family
351158 when we saw women starting to drop out in the early part of this decade we thought it was the motherhood movement women staying home to raise their kids
351159 we did not think it was the economy but when we looked into it we realized that it was
351160 the public is sure that the technical professionals that theyre dealing with are qualified
351161 we expect the second half of 2008 will be more challenging than the first half as economic and credit conditions weaken
351162 we have seen a marked increase in these graffiti tagging gangs taking to weapons and fighting to protect their walls their territory their name
351163 if we see someone calling the police then we target them
351164 you are trying to stop me from what i live what i believe in and what i breathe we are not going to let no one get in the way
351165 take a deep breath back off and call law enforcement
351166 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
351167 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
351168 i will keep the moratorium in place and prevent oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
351169 i think its important for the american people to understand were not going to drill our way out of this problem
351170 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
351171 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
351172 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
351173 we suffered 11 soldiers killed and 20 wounded and the terrorists lost seven killed and 27 wounded
351174 to me it is scary to buy food that you dont know how or where it was grown
351175 this rule potentially will have an impact on all participants in the supply chain
351176 the greatest impact will be on retailers and intermediaries handlers processors wholesalers and importers while the impact on individual producers is likely to be relatively small
351177 there are some things going on that i cant talk about
351178 i dont think im free to say whether i have gotten a letter or not
351179 a person as to whom the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial evidence linking him or her to the commission of a crime and who in the judgment of the prosecutor is a putative defendant
351180 a hard boiled wonderland and the end of the world
351181 we are sad to hear of the apparent death of this gentleman mr al masri and we extend our condolences to his family
351182 i say that because we have not completely established the circumstances or the facts of whats happened here
351183 the death of a father and husband is a tragedy for all those people who are left behind
351184 however we emphasise the fact that even if the person has spent some time in australia this does not mean that australia is responsible for all events that may befall them in the future
351185 however we are not going to discuss this in further detail until we have properly investigated all the facts which we will conduct as soon as possible
351186 were being inundated with as many as a dozen pelicans a day
351187 we believe its because pelicans have done well this year and produced lots of young
351188 the high number of ailing birds is actually a good sign
351189 a lot of these birds are basically starving to death
351190 after three months of being fed in their breeding colonies this years young pelicans are beginning to disperse from their nests with enough baby fat to tide them over for a few months while they learn to fish
351191 use up all that baby fat thats when they start showing up at rehabilitation centers
351192 will they survive after we let them go hard to say
351193 but i do know this we are giving these birds a second chance to get back in the wild and figure it all out
351194 are you the one they talk about so much going to college
351195 its very very helpful to have a student in the class who along with me remembers lyndon johnson and his presidency who remembers nixon who remembers jimmy carter
351196 younger students have read about and heard about it but they havent lived through those administrations and all the things that occurred then joann offers a very welcome perspective shes lived long enough to see a great deal
351197 i dont have that many more years to live and i want to do good for humanity while im here
351198 i started hitting some bad drives bad irons and i struggled the whole back nine
351199 that was something else i thought it was pretty comical myself making a 4 like that i was applauding he didnt see the humor in it
351200 people here are used to it but theyre not playing in the golf championship either its bothersome
351201 i told my caddie to put his watch back on and see when every 15 minutes is coming once its like that i cant get it out of my head but that wasnt the day the day was everything else
351202 it appears to have been a momentum stopper but i just didnt play well the final nine holes
351203 starting on no 10 i started hitting some bad drives bad irons and i struggled the whole back nine
351204 my game is very good my concentration is good its two more rounds to go ill be there
351205 the greens are very difficult very very difficult but im telling you its the u s senior open it has to be tough
351206 im happy im half the way and my game is very good very good
351207 it was certainly challenging but we moved the tees up and it played 153 yards which for most of these players thats a 9 iron and we felt that with a shorter club in their hand it would offset some of the difficulty of the hole location
351208 we knew it would be difficult if you miss the ball on the right side of the green then you had a very difficult two putt we did not think the slope exceeded our tolerances
351209 if you had the ball to the right side of the green or long right that was just in jail but i also saw some birdies
351210 i dont know if i can shoot really low because i dont know if i can walk another two days but were going to give it a shot
351211 when we went to dinner we were told you we could have anything under the amount of 27
351212 when we were leaving they told us we owed 270 we didnt have the money and our line manager said she wasnt paying for it we tried to offer our bank details and said that we would be due to work another shift again but they werent happy about it and the police were called the police spent some time there and could understand our situation but we still ended up getting arrested
351213 we had worked so hard for ets and we begged our line manager to pay the bill for us and dock our wages but they refused to do it
351214 officers arrested two women aged 20 and 25 on suspicion of theft
351215 the police kicked the whole thing off to try to cut down on the number of people roaming the city late at night looking for taxis and young girls getting into unlicensed private hire cars
351216 her mobile phone was analysed and showed she was making calls and writing text messages throughout the journey
351217 it showed text messages going in and out although there is no evidence that she was actually on the phone at the time of the collision
351218 it was an appallingly bad piece of driving you had been making calls and sending text messages one of them 208 characters long and were at least three times over the limit
351219 she is fully aware how her actions have impacted on that family it was never her intention to cause harm to any other individual she wishes to publicly apologise to the family although no words can possibly express to them the extent of her remorse she is deeply ashamed
351220 i dont like it when people easily condemn someone who has an addiction as if he were a criminal as if he were a person who should be persecuted
351221 those who should be persecuted are those who sell the substances those who give it away those who traffic in it
351222 decriminalization of the consumer should include what are called second generation human rights but at the same time there should be a strong policy of prevention so that no one falls in the situation of consuming any substance
351223 the evidence generally shows that the decriminalization of possession is not clearly associated with any increase in illicit drug use
351224 you basically need to get those people out of the underground and into health systems
351225 this would be part of a growing number of countries in latin america where there is either for political or judicial reasons a push toward decriminalization of personal possession sometimes combined with initiatives to crack down harder on bigger drug traffickers
351226 it typically involves both lessening the criminal sanction for possession of cannabis while also providing for alternatives to incarceration for people addicted to drugs who are arrested for drug possession or other minor offenses
351227 the vast amount of human activity ought to be none of the governments business
351228 i dont think it is the governments business to tell you how to spend your leisure time
351229 its much harder answering the questions in the studio than at home
351230 you can be absolutely certain of an answer but still have doubts
351231 its bad enough when youre gambling with your own money but when the money is for charity its terrifying
351232 they were winning a lot of games without me and they didnt have a spot for me so i just kind of waited for the open spot
351233 ive got more confidence in everything i do right now
351234 all my pitches are working pretty good i dont have any problems with my arm right now everythings fine
351235 it was basically one of the happiest days of my life other than when my son was born

351239 the terrorists have served twin goals by hitting bjp dominated areas they have sent the message to the chief minister that his claim of security is hollow in spite of a red alert in the city they have shown their capacity to strike at places they want second by hitting hospitals in a cruel and dastardly manner they have caused the maximum damage
351240 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
351241 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
351242 thats about the worst possible thing that couldve happened to us
351243 well have to make do with the guys we have
351244 we want to get tougher up the middle get more gang tackling and create turnovers
351245 we might be losing him on the field but hes still going to be there vocally on the sidelines
351246 dan krijgen we weer het hele nederlandse deel in de marketingpool een kleine twintig miljoen euro
351247 als twente zich wel plaatst ontvangt die club 45 en moeten wij het als landskampioen met 55 doen
351248 we hoopten op zon moeilijke loting voor fc twente was dat financieel jammer maar voor het nederlandse voetbal maakt het niet uit is het misschien zelfs beter de punten die je in de uefa cup haalt tellen net zo zwaar als in de champions league
351249 afgelopen jaar heeft psv veel punten gehaald maar voornamelijk na de winterstop in de uefa cup dat is scheef en zal ik aankaarten in de commissie van de eca europese club associatie waar ik deel van uitmaak

351253 how concerned are you that israel may undertake a unilateral strike against iran by the end of the year
351254 my strong preference here is to handle all of this diplomatically with the other powers of governments ours and many others as opposed to any kind of strike occurring
351255 this is a very unstable part of the world and i dont need it to be more unstable
351256 ive been pretty clear before that from the united states perspective the united states military perspective in particular that opening up a third front right now would be extremely stressful on us
351257 that doesnt mean we dont have capacity or reserve but that would really be very challenging and also the consequences of that sometimes are very difficult to predict
351258 when i talk about dialogue actually i would say very broadly across the entirety of our government and their government
351259 but specifically that would be need to be led obviously politically and diplomatically
351260 and if it then resulted in military to military dialogue i think that part of it certainly could add to a better understanding of each other
351261 we havent had much of a dialogue with the iranians for a long time
351262 it takes two people to want to have a dialogue not just the desire on one part
351263 i have made it very clear to all parties that the first option ought to be to solve this problem diplomatically
351264 and the best way to solve it diplomatically is for the united states to work with other nations to send a focused message and that is that you will be isolated and you will have economic hardship if you continue trying to enrich uranium the first step toward making nuclear weapons
351265 in iran we must defend our national security our country and our revolutionary system and we will continue to do so
351266 i put all the trust in her she kept the tape in her camera on top of the closet where i couldnt even reach it
351267 this lawsuit is ridiculous and riddled with lie upon lie from verne troyer and his camp it is in our opinion a transparent attempt to secure as much publicity as he can from his less than average career in the wake of his most recent failure in the love guru
351268 the only abuse that ever occurred in their household was that of emotional abuse inflicted upon ranae and her dog lacy on the occasions when he hit ranae and her dog with his reaching sticks or kicked them when having one of his drunken rages
351269 this alleged abuse certainly has not seemed to affect his recent round of interviews or his golf swing over the weekend is this not the same man who is renown as a professional stuntman in all his movies
351270 the force of the impact immediately flipped shias vehicle over and as a result shias left hand was crushed
351271 shia underwent four hours of surgery on sunday and has been recovering since then his doctors remain hopeful that he will fully recover but due to extensive surgery and the nature of the injuries there remains a substantial risk of both infection and other complications
351272 we have also received information that suggests that the other driver may have been traveling upwards of 50 mph and that said driver may not have been looking forward at the time of the accident
351273 people have seen conservative governance and theyre turning their noses up at it

351282 como compa a tenemos claro que debemos apostar y trabajar por la integraci n de los discapacitados no va a ser f cil ya que la primera duda a la que se enfrenta cualquier empresa producto de una dificultad social son los prejuicios estamos convencidos de que de la mano de la fundaci n adecco vamos a lograr buscar mecanismos de sensibilizaci n e integraci n que van a ir m s all del proyecto de hesperia

351289 im not going to bow to political correctness im going to do it with humor im going to focus on the issues im going to react to what he says simple
351290 if my great grandparents had no advantages why should they now
351291 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
351292 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
351293 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
351294 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
351295 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
351296 you could hand me a billion dollars and im still going to be on the field
351297 it doesnt matter to me but everyone has different situations has different views on money money is not more important than football to me right now
351298 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
351299 hes not a part of our 80 man roster right now
351300 and if or when he is well deal with that then and i think our team has done a great job of just staying focused
351301 when that happens on the field usually guys have helmets on
351302 but this happened on the sidelines so it probably wasnt a good idea
351303 he was trying to apologize so i was walking with him just to be there
351304 i dont anticipate this having any lingering effect on this team
351305 we were talked to and things were squashed thats it thats the way it is it happened there will be no retaliation by anybody on anything when you look at the schedule we dont play the panthers this year so we need to be smart when were out there
351306 when i was 22 i was a different guy so im not trying to spin anything
351307 you spend two hours with somebody and now you know them thats not the case
351308 obviously everybody is going to be waiting to see what the repercussions are from this event
351309 im just praying that we rally together as a team because obviously theres going to be some adversity here the focus is not where it needs to be right now
351310 draw a view through a doorway from one interior room to another
351311 when we traded for him and bill came to me to tell me about it we really didnt know what to expect but i knew instantly that i liked him
351312 there was a chain link fence running alongside ruston high stadium and fred swung that running back so hard the guy actually got caught underneath that fence
351313 they had to get wire cutters and everything to get this kid out
351314 i dropped the rifle on my toe and it fired
351315 i didnt realize there was still a bullet in the chamber it just went off
351316 i was afraid my mom and the coaches would get on me
351317 he went into the coaches office grabbed a doughnut and a cup of coffee and lifted up his jersey and showed them the bullet hole then they took him to the hospital and fred was afraid of needles
351318 coach walsh changed my life and so did mr d
351319 he was the most explosive undersized pass rusher i have ever seen he never lifted weights just did incredible things on the field
351320 he made every part of our team better on offense we knew we would get the ball in a great spot because fred with his ability to get sacks and everybody on that entire defense would get the job done
351321 and that made me realize how great an owner he was and how much i finally belonged
351322 my father always said wait until its all signed on the dotted line
351323 he made every part of our team better on offense we knew we would get the ball in a great spot because fred with his ability to get sacks and everybody on that entire defense would get the job done
351324 i cant seem to find any balance for some reason im having a hard time establishing routines this year

351330 what she does eat for the main part of her meal
351331 did they forget did they think i was taking her home instead are they lost or am i spazzing out for no good reason
351332 yeah i asked her if she was a naked princess
351333 this is what we are having for dinner it tastes great and there is nothing else to have
351334 i dont know i think its still about limits you just have to limit their time on it
351335 look i dont have anyone out on the stump you guys do at least ask bush the question
351336 we dont want to be the ones to tip it in any direction

351363 and until you beaten every single person ive beaten you are never getting a title shot against me on pay per view
351364 im going to run up the stairs and go down the biggest slide here
351365 these are two excellent baseball men class acts but we thought we needed a change we feel andy hawkins has been in the organization a long time knows our young pitchers thats clearly the direction were headed
351366 we felt we needed to try a different direction with the pitching staff a different voice a different message not that anything they were saying was wrong but sometimes players respond to different voices and were going to take that chance
351367 its very hard to explain right now because i really cant tell you every emotion thats going through my body
351368 this city is great the fans are fantastic i dont know how to say thank you enough to them not only for myself but for the organization
351369 oh my god how adorable im going to try this on
351370 attention target guests the time is now 9 45 and the store will be closing in 15 minutes get the hell out of my store
351371 i hope you dont mind that i put down in words how beautiful life is while youre in the world
351372 it makes it so much more fun being out here practicing the game itself is fun but its like a mini game when youre out there and the fans are cheering im glad theyre here
351373 there is an element here that is entertainment but you have to back it up with action
351374 what i try to do is work as hard as i can and do things right in life try and do things the right way
351375 and i can put my head down on the pillow at night and say i did it the right way even if im not a good quarterback even if i dont do well i can at least go on and live life what i cant do is have regrets in some ways about what i should have done or could have done differently and i feel like i dont do that
351376 the offense probably comes quicker because im a firm believer in repetition
351377 you study until youre blue in the face but until you see how the sam linebacker blitzes all of a sudden you need to be able to react to it fast you can tell yourself when he comes im throwing to the hot receiver but until youre out there and you see him do it you just really cant react to that same speed
351378 he doesnt have as much to prove as a guy coming in who hadnt played
351379 most of the time when you come in during the middle of the season like he did last year youre trying to prove something the next year that you can play quarterback i think hes proven that he can play quarterback whether he can play great quarterback all the time thats where we need to get him to
351380 certain quarterbacks can make plays when everything breaks down whether its with their feet whether its their movement in the pocket
351381 even dan marino moved around in the pocket romo is one of those guys he made plays last year that other guys cant make
351382 i know sometimes its a grind for some of the old offensive and defensive linemen for me you can compete twice a day you go out there and throw the ball and try and beat the defense or a guy its exciting to have the emotional side of being happy when you leave practice or sad or upset or whatever to do that two times in one day i just love it
351383 i choose to reach across the aisle with john kerry to protect homeowners against foreclosure
351384 kerry advocates all kinds of additional socialism at home appeasement abroad and what that means is weakness for the future
351385 oh my god i cant get my breath i cant breathe
351386 if everyone were just filling their tires and getting regular tuneups you could actually save just as much
351387 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
351388 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
351389 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
351390 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
351391 civilizations flourish the most where the masses are passionate about their liberties
351392 ive fought a lot the last few years to be no 1
351393 to be seen as no 1 always is a goal
351394 i thought that i was serving much better and day after day im getting stronger in the segment of my game which is really important coming up to the final stages of the tournament
351395 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
351396 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
351397 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
351398 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
351399 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
351400 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
351401 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
351402 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
351403 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
351404 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
351405 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
351406 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
351407 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
351408 this is certainly not the player or the person that i knew the last six years
351409 connor and chiti are two excellent baseball men but we felt a change was needed andy hawkins has been in our organization a long time he knows our young pitchers and that is clearly the direction were headed
351410 jim colborn has lots of major league experience both as a player and coach and we wanted to fill these positions from within well give them every opportunity the rest of the year they will be the pitching coach and bullpen coach for the rest of the year and well reevaluate then
351411 we just felt we needed a different message and a different voice right now
351412 sometimes people and players respond to a different message and were going to take that chance
351413 i was feeling good and i was hitting the ball well but then all of a sudden i just got exhausted completely lost my concentration
351414 it was hard for me throughout you know for that rest of the match to keep up because the points were quite long the longer the play went i felt worse and worse
351415 im suffering in that department it will take time for me to get that better because at the moment you know im struggling to play in a high level for two sets
351416 if i was playing three sets i dont know they would probably take me in an ambulance
351417 its ok doesnt matter the first ranking i want to be healthy
351418 i want to improve i want to play tennis i mean i dont really think about no 1 or whatever happens if its going to happen it will happen but at the moment i dont deserve that spot
351419 i wasnt as pinpoint as i had been in my earlier starts
351420 i know that every great pitcher has bad outings like this early in their careers but it doesnt make it any better
351421 its all that i expected i personally expected to run up front it would have been a big surprise if i had done badly
351422 theyve been here a long time they should get that respect and you try and give them the respect i guess thats just not enough
351423 thats just part of racing and making your way up
351424 its tougher than what you imagined you really have to go all out youre always racing for fun but youre racing for your job and everybody else is too
351425 with coming along i would have only done 17 races again my goal is to be a sprint cup driver this gives me the opportunity to be at the track every weekend with a great team and a fully paid sponsor those are very hard to find in the nationwide series these days
351426 coming from gibbs last season where i had five top 10s and three top fives in 17 races i thought id come in here and win a couple of races
351427 it just goes to show you its just not that easy it makes it hard to compete when youre not based in charlotte
351428 i probably hadnt expected this much media attention but its more than i thought it would be because were running up front
351429 i think the pressure makes you run better every week im a very competitive person i put more pressure on myself than anyone else does ive always been mad with a second place finish
351430 but leaving here montreal with a second is something ill be happy about
351431 i told him to turn it off and treat her like she was one of the guys
351432 but i know what i need to work on there were just a lot of positives this week
351433 wow im an uncle kind of a surprise for an only child
351434 up front they fill gaps quickly theyre fast on the back side and they can cover you one on one whenever they want im excited to watch em play and cant wait until the season to see what they can do
351435 im grateful for the reps they could easily give them to somebody else but they chose to give them to me im trying to make the most of every chance i get
351436 i said if you make a mistake make it full speed and play hard we surrounded the ball real well and played physical

351440 s ources close to the situation at one of taiwans top motherboard makers
351441 gauge support for it continuing to develop chipsets in the future
351442 this story is false and we have asked digitimes for a full retraction
351443 we have no intention of getting out of the chipset business in fact our mcp business is as strong as it has ever been for both amd nyse
351444 mercury research has reported that the nvidia market share of amd platforms in q2 08 was 60 percent we have been steady in this range for over two years contrary to popular perception we have not lost any ground to amd despite their chipset introductions over the last year or so
351445 r eception to the nforce 200 chip br04 which will enable sli technology on intel x58 motherboards has been lukewarm at best with many makers saying they will not bother adding the chip on their boards
351446 have already canceled upcoming high end motherboard projects based on the nforce 7 series chipset
351447 find a way of licensing and enabling multi gpu support on motherboards using intel and or amd chipsets fast
351448 to cede the top end of the graphics card market to amd which now has the benefit of crossfire
351449 is looking forward to bring new and very exciting mcp products to the market for both amd and intel platforms

351460 whats most important to you advancing atheism or advancing the public understanding of science or are they kind of one in the same for you
351461 youve suggested quite a few times that the more you know about science the more likely it is that you are gonna end up an atheist
351462 yes thats thats what we know from the statistics of people going into science that science has a great corrosive influence on religious belief it isnt always going to destroy religious beliefs of course theres theres a number of fairly prominent scientists who are religious but in general most people when they get training in the scientific method and start applying it in the lab and start applying it in their real life experiences find themselves questioning religion a lot more
351463 yeah jonathan miller had that study out a few years ago you know countries in europe people score higher in science literacy therefore they were more accepting of of evolution more naturalistic but the university of buffalo recently had a study oh i think just in the last year that suggested that it was a chicken and egg sort of thing that people who were already kind of skeptical and secular ended up choosing to go into the sciences rather than the other way around
351464 yes i i can see it working both ways thats not earth shaking news either i dont think if youre into religion you are going to be steered away by your own interests from science so theres there is a self selection going on but still you know we we want more scientists right we want more people thinking critically and skeptically about the world around them its something that we want to encourage lots more people sic
351465 i think we are getting new recruits i i get emails all the time from people who are saying well thank you you know this whole thing has lead me to be more self aware and criticizing in coming to the conclusion that yeah im an agnostic or im an atheist
351466 its the kind of coming out story that richard dawkins reports a lot of people recounting when they read his book the god delusion
351467 if youd asked me when i was twelve years old i would of said yeah im a committed christian and all this kind of thing i wasnt born again or anything silly like that
351468 for every person strongly swayed by rational argument in favor of atheism there are countless others more effected by non rational psychological factors
351469 just think of that phrase that you just said corrosive influence of scientific thinking imagine what what what a fundamentalist could to with that ah you know pz myers himself said that scientific thinking has a corrosive influence
351470 on religious belief yeah and you know if they threw that in my face what would i say say yeah it sure does laughter
351471 most people when they get training in the scientific method and start applying it in the lab and start applying it in their real life experiences find themselves questioning religion a lot more
351472 i actually dont see even now how anyone can find the explanations in the book of genesis at all satisfying as explanations for the real world i meant its its god did it said eight times nothing more look at the book of genesis and you should be asking lots of questions about it
351473 youre position about science leading to atheism is fundamentally at odds with the national academies of science and the aaaf they say for instance that evolution is perfectly compatible with religion
351474 but dont parents have a right to teach their children what they believe to be true without a professor undermining certain deeply held beliefs

351495 aim for success not perfection never give up your right to be wrong because then you will lose the ability to learn new things and move forward with your life

351536 the attacker was standing up right over the top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him in the chest area
351537 when we came back on the bus he was cutting the guys head off and pretty much gutting him up
351538 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
351539 there was no rage in him it was just like he was a robot or something
351540 some people were puking some people were crying other people were in shock everybody was running screaming off the bus
351541 we believe that our data add to those from previous studies showing a causal relationship between h pylori infection and gastric cancer and also support the use of h pylori eradication to prevent the development of gastric cancer
351542 preventing gastric cancer by eradicating h pylori in high risk regions should be a priority
351543 this result adds to our understanding of the relationship between h pylori and stomach cancer and to the debate on how we should treat people with this infection
351544 the trial aims to recruit 56 000 people across the uk treat any who show signs of h pylori infection and follow them over 15 to 20 years to see if this treatment is effective

351549 welcome to the reality where dreams come true god has a dream and it is certain to happen just as he imagines it he has placed the stamp of his image on our souls so that we also dream great dreams as we learn to passionately share and enjoy gods dreams we will see him work in amazing ways
351550 this book is intended to help you learn to walk so intimately with god that you will see him fulfill his dreams in and through you
351551 do you feel as though youve given up on dreams you had when your faith was new
351552 a dream is a desire felt so strongly that we think and meditate on it constantly until we see it in our mind as clearly as if it were reality a dream believes that what is desired will happen it is accomplished by anticipation and positive expectation people who dream tend to be upbeat and enthusiastic

351568 we moeten niet in iets geloven alleen omdat het gezegd is noch in tradities omdat ze vanuit de oudheid aan ons zijn overgeleverd noch in geruchten als zodanig noch in geschriften van wijzen omdat wijzen ze schreven noch in fantasie n waarvan we misschien mogen vermoeden dat ze ons door een deva zijn ingegeven dat wil zeggen in veronderstelde geestelijke inspiratie noch in gevolgtrekkingen afgeleid uit de een of andere door ons gemaakte toevallige veronderstelling noch omdat iets een analogische noodzakelijkheid schijnt te zijn noch alleen maar op het gezag van onze leraren of meesters maar dat wij moeten geloven wanneer het geschrift de leerstelling of het gezegde door ons eigen verstand en ons eigen bewustzijn wordt bevestigd daarom leerde ik u om niet alleen maar te geloven omdat u hebt gehoord maar om indien u met uw bewustzijn geloofde in overeenstemming daarmee te handelen

351571 a documented history of unacceptable behavior toward his fellow employees
351572 ultimately were going to have to grow the business in a tough market
351573 im not too worried about them running out of cash
351574 in that respect the negative cash flow in the second quarter is overstated
351575 its just a question of how severe the downturn is and how extended it is and obviously how successful the new models are that theyre looking to launch
351576 the crew on the canal deluge did everything they could to prevent the fire from spreading
351577 right now we are really focusing on ensuring the boat doesnt become a hazard to navigation or the environment
351578 the higher cost of crude oil used in the refining process was not fully recovered in the price of gasoline and other refined products
351579 as a result our downstream operations incurred a loss in the second quarter with most of the loss taking place in the united states
351580 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
351581 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
351582 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
351583 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
351584 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
351585 a city really none of us were comfortable walking in the streets to one that was basically safe
351586 the best equal opportunity employer in the country is the u s military
351587 the fact that an investigation may exist and might have been completed at the department level does not mean it is in any way complete
351588 if somebody has an allegation and its being investigated a filed complaint will be looked at seriously
351589 but it will have no effect whatsoever on the original investigation
351590 based on what im aware of some action is warranted
351591 there is no place within law enforcement for any officer to not abide by or violate the law in any way
351592 im disappointed with the lack of progress in this case but im limited in what i can say due to restrictions of the mcad suit
351593 the entire complex has been tested several times what were doing now is narrowing the scope of the testing
351594 before any determination can be made they need to do some additional assessment
351595 they need to do additional samples lets wait to see what the results are
351596 we will be able to resolve the issue before spring
351597 well know what we need to do to treat the area
351598 it is now unimaginable to many people that this court could acquit me
351599 i believe that this fact seriously jeopardizes the trial itself
351600 i do not know how long the arm of mr holbrooke is or whether that arm can reach me here
351601 hes one of the greatest mass murderers of the world and hes putting this out in order to defend himself its an invented story and no one ought to believe it
351602 what i said was if anyone deserves the death penalty its karadzic and mladic
351603 that was my specific reference and if karadzic is in the hague and is still scared that i have an arm that long i guess i should treat it in a backhanded way as a compliment
351604 proclaimed me a war criminal at a time when the only victims were serbs
351605 it takes quite a precision plan to dismantle a branch with its technology and reassemble in a totally different location
351606 he has written a plan he will be like the traffic cop
351607 we had 15 leases up last year that needed to be executed and we did four major moves and did not lose a day of service
351608 new bedford is the hub of southeastern massachusetts and it became clear after we talked with the patrick administration and the legislative delegation that everyone wanted to keep it in new bedford
351609 siting it downtown will be very good for the local economy
351610 we will do everything we can to make sure it stays in the city
351611 bring in volumes of people i am looking forward to the hustle and bustle of the registry of motor vehicles being on union street
351612 we know it will be a big boost to the economy of the area that kind of foot traffic is exactly what the businesses need to grow and to bring other businesses into the area
351613 the patrick administration is excited to be part of the downtown revitalization and the vision
351614 weve had dialogue with the dea already to begin scrutinizing more carefully the purity of the heroin that has been seized off the streets of the city
351615 were certainly interested to see if the speculation is true if so we will assist and work with new bedford police to raise public awareness about the potential issue
351616 the public should be concerned about any heroin overdoses anyone unfortunately using this substance should use necessary precautions
351617 we had three pitchers come in in the bottom of the sixth
351618 we had a lot of walks but the kids made some key plays to get us out of it
351619 i didnt really go to church up until i was 19 years old
351620 i began to ask god are you real are you out there at some point at maybe two or three in the morning and after having stayed in the hospital for 24 hours a day seven days a week during this three week period in 1986 i was alone with my grandfather and i had an experience with christ it was as if jesus just walked into the room and said im alive your grandfather is okay and he is in my hands thats when the journey began
351621 i wanted to go to a region of the country that wasnt the bible belt where there was a need for evangelical bible preaching churches
351622 a professor was talking to another student in his office and was talking about new england being a region that needed an evangelical voice and all of a sudden it was like my whole being was like a heat seeking missile right for new england
351623 over the past eight years weve seen the church growing steadily year after year and weve had a lot of people come to know the lord
351624 weve had a lot of people who were part of the establishment for years who have become part of the leadership as well weve all come together as part of a team
351625 i feel that you can hear god just as much as we can
351626 you can take him home with you and he has a purpose for you i think what we try to do is allow them to know that you can take this home and do something with it its not a sunday to sunday thing
351627 one is that we have been able to help people find and utilize their gifts and talents in the work of the lord
351628 another reason is that god is doing something very special with our church hes lighting a fire on this place so this fire will spread throughout the community our community desperately needs help
351629 were in a blue collar city and its not like theres a lot of money around so were going to utilize as much space as we possibly can
351630 the people have given faithfully and thats whats really allowed us to make these plans its exciting and humbling
351631 mother beatrix lalone the first superior of this nascent community did all she could to make the sisters feel at home
351632 she would remind them that their first mission was adoration time of prayer spent before the blessed sacrament each day there they would pray for people all over the world and receive strength to serve their lord well
351633 with but a rudimentary knowledge of the english language sisters louise antoine leblanc and louise henriette thoelen in fear and trembling led 60 pupils to their respective classes at st joseph school
351634 meanwhile at the other end of town sr antoinette monmaneix and sr marie eugenie brugere were doing the same at sacred hearts school
351635 now if asked how many grandchildren and great grandchildren she has she says a lot said sister claire
351636 the spirit of our sisters lives on in all the people we touched through our ministries over the past 100 years
351637 his nature was more primitive bedouin person and far from civilization he was not fit to plan or execute
351638 he was not with the ideology of osama bin laden and people like him he was only searching for pleasure and money in this life
351639 he is intending to invoke self incrimination rights and not appear
351640 i must have a trillion different passwords for a trillion different web sites
351641 people will absolutely shut off the spending spigots given the soured jobs market
351642 with job losses mounting prices rising increased turbulence in our financial system and a growing credit crunch we need to do more
351643 we cannot afford four more years of the failed bush economic policies and that is what sen mccain if offering
351644 americans are hurting and todays job numbers are just the latest reminder of the economic challenges we face
351645 its easy to see why consumer spending is expected to remain weak through the summer if not the rest of the year
351646 simply managing their network they had arbitrarily picked an application and blocked their subscribers access to it
351647 poses a potential competitive threat to comcasts video on demand service
351648 disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable
351649 raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions
351650 i agree that we do have jurisdiction in general over these areas however we do not have any rules governing internet network management to enforce
351651 i took the attitude that you know what if it happens this year im excited if it doesnt then next year
351652 the year before i had gotten to the final and so it was getting closer to say that i expected it no
351653 toward the end of my career probably around 90 i talked to guys and guys would say to me you know how do you stay there all of the things that are going on and why dont you do something to get out of there
351654 and to me it wasnt my manner it wasnt my personality or my makeup to be that type of person
351655 i dont think he got the attention because he wasnt media friendly like taylor was and we werent winning championships like taylor was
351656 so i dont think people really gave him the attention he probably deserved until now
351657 most of the great ones have a great motor and that is what i remember most about him
351658 the guy who always practiced the hardest was patriots guard john hannah and thats why hes in the hall of fame and tippett would be a close second he went full bore all the time
351659 if you were game planning against him youd have to know where he was very similar to lawrence taylor
351660 if you didnt he was going to make a play on you
351661 it may seem crazy to say this but tip was more of a brute
351662 he was not a thinking mans linebacker he would just want to crush you and run over you
351663 he just played the game with so much intensity i can remember times getting my own sack and hed be so excited hed slap me on the head three or four times
351664 he put up some good numbers when he had people around him
351665 its a known fact that ive been referred to as the lt of the afc
351666 he opened a lot of doors for a lot of other guys to come into the league guys were measured up against him we want to get us an lt we want to get us an andre tippett
351667 whatever happened in boston is in the past im excited man i cant wait i feel like i took 5 000 pounds off my back
351668 its just a new chapter in my life im happy to be here thats all i can say las a great city im happy to be a dodger
351669 i want to say something from the bottom of my heart
351670 i want to thank the fans in boston i love you guys i just want to move on im thinking blue right now im thinking about the dodgers i want people to judge me on what i do here not what i did in boston
351671 im going to start maybe stealing some bases i dont go deep anymore i just hit line drives to right field
351672 can i go and get something to eat get ready for the game
351673 im like a little kid now im kind of nervous
351674 im just going to be manny and play the game
351675 in our hearts it is and in the mexican community it was 66 then it went to 99 in a matter of minutes it was all through the agent scott boras and his staff
351676 ive played a lot against him ill let you know in a month we went through some conversation
351677 clean it up a little bit and make it manageable
351678 ive got to cut it im going to be looking like a baby
351679 i dont want them to treat me different than the other guys if they want me to cut it ill cut it it will grow back
351680 you have to separate the desire to get out of boston and the desire to get out of the situation
351681 im just going to play hard well see what happens
351682 do you think you are better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago if you arent better off can you afford another four years
351683 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
351684 insecurity has spread to areas which were previously relatively stable in parts of north northwest and central afghanistan
351685 aid organizations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
351686 increasing and spreading insecurity is jeopardizing the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance to these people and threatening their lives and livelihoods
351687 the needs of its people cannot be met by the government and the u n alone
351688 coalition forces make every effort to minimize the risk of any damage injury or loss of life to noncombatants
351689 we hope that colleagues will have heard from their constituents that something has to be done and done before congress finishes its business this year
351690 can begin to break the current legislative stalemate on the senate floor
351691 would bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term
351692 we would need to see a bill that would increase the supply here in our own country across the board in a comprehensive way
351693 the fact that theyre uncomfortable means were doing the right thing
351694 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
351695 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats plans and actions towards therapists
351696 he came in and he was just covered i was just frantic to get him clean he was rubbing all over the carpet
351697 we always leave a little time in our schedule for skunk dogs its very important to get to it right away
351698 i know it can cause conjunctivitis but this has always responded to treatment in my patients that have been targets
351699 it does seem to burn their eyes pretty well like mace does to us as evidenced by their rubbing and pawing at their faces
351700 the last thing you want to do on a saturday night after working eight hours is to wash a dog
351701 i felt like i was in a laverne and shirley episode
351702 i tell the players every day not to believe what people are writing and saying about them
351703 you cant let that kind of thing go to their heads i learned a long time ago that you dont live in the past and you dont live in the future
351704 i figure i should get 10 to 15 percent better this year just because of that experience
351705 it was totally different than giving up a draft pick
351706 we were trading to fill a specific need we needed to build up the interior of the defensive line and we found two players who were available
351707 you see it in the billboards you see it in the people out here watching us at practice you see it when you meet people they want you to win its part of the citys heritage that the browns be winners
351708 would you tell me please which way i ought to go from here
351709 that depends a good deal on where you want to get to
351710 as a devout shaolin monk i train daily in the martial arts transforming my hands feet and mind into deadly weapons
351711 the air sang as the cruel edge of katana cleaved the air where i had stood a second before my arm was already moving to parry his attack and my face was expressionless for a shaolin monk does not know fear
351712 does her mom have cancer is she the one busy taking care of her sick mom
351713 she said it doesnt matter that you have to take care of your sick mom if you really wanted to be with me and to see me you would have
351714 i have a small team of activists that blog for me from computers in my home where i have a personal office
351715 as a body the middletown human rights commission is of the opinion that mr gallaghers comments on his
351716 i have a small team of activists that blog for me from computers in my home where i have a personal office
351717 as a body the middletown human rights commission is of the opinion that mr gallaghers comments on his
351718 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
351719 the euphoric episode is protected and sustained by the will of those involved in order to justify the circumstances that are making them rich and it is equally protected by the will to ignore exorcise or condemn those who express doubts
351720 contributing to and supporting this euphoria are two further factors little noted in our time or in past times
351721 the second factor contributing to speculative euphoria and programmed collapse is the specious association of money and intelligence mention of this is not a formula for eliciting reputable applause but alas it must be accepted for acceptance is also highly useful a major protection against personal or institutional disaster

351728 but mom i have so much left to accomplish in life
351729 only the pure of heart would sacrifice themselves for the one they love
351730 if you want to come into a movie theater and have an experience not be told a story but actually have a physical emotional experience then this is the ride for you
351731 one night after church alex and stephen sherwood associate pastors and directors of the film asked me to come to a casting call
351732 i believe strongly in marriage and the covenant relationship between a man and a woman and i hope thats the lasting impression that people remember when they leave the theaters
351733 one of my fondest memories was seeing how god supplied the needs of the production crew we dont have a hollywood budget but god provided all the resources of the albany police and fire departments hospital and other resources at or below cost and in many cases for no charge it was simply amazing to see him at work
351734 my dad had been a fireman in albany when i was growing up and that meant something to me to play that role in the movie but on another level my dad experienced several divorces so i saw the pain that was caused through those events
351735 i love gods concept of covenant marriage and wanted to be part of something like this movie that communicates that message to our society one of the lines gets right to the point of marriage you dont follow your heart you lead your heart
351736 that says that you dont let your emotions be the compass for your marriage thats the word hurting couples need to hear today and im praying they will come to see gods truth by viewing this movie
351737 this is definitely the first and most likely the last time we will ever be in a movie
351738 stephen and alex were looking for a couple in their 50s to play a part so thats how we were drafted
351739 my prayer is that this movie will show the world gods plan for marriage and that lives will be changed for eternity as a result
351740 one thing i especially like about this movie is how it addresses male pride and the related problems this is a must see movie for couples in all stages of their marriage
351741 be a part of something extraordinary that is going to impact our culture for christ
351742 i have two small children and i want to change the culture for them by helping produce movies that have a positive message
351743 i also want to help send a message to hollywood that they can produce christian movies that attract an audience
351744 im a do this and do that girl as well as being responsible for petty cash purchases needed on the set today im also serving iced tea for the lunch crowd
351745 the first 12 years of my marriage were a real roller coaster until my husband was saved after that it was like the lord gave me a totally new marriage i already knew christ but he wasnt a believer and that caused some built in problems from the outset
351746 we have now been married for 30 years and ive personally seen how god can turn a marriage around im praying that this movie will help save marriages like mine that were on the verge of collapse
351747 they just keep knocking them out of the park ive seen every one of them
351748 i think this is going to address some major issues with marriages and its got enough evangelism in it that people can get saved
351749 obviously we think that marriage is a crucial issue to address in our culture inside and outside the church
351750 marriage has become simply a contract a piece of paper we hope that the movie is going to impact homes not only inside the church but outside the church because every one of us knows a couple that struggles either we are or we know somebody who is
351751 if couples learn some things out of this film that will help them in their marriage then it will be successful to us if we can help save some marriages that are on the brink of going off a cliff it would be great
351752 i think the things that this movie could do for peoples lives are immeasurable
351753 i think the message is timeless love is not based on an emotion its not birds chipping and flowers blooming all the time sometimes its hard and its a decision very often love starts with an action and then follows with an emotion rather than vice versa as we tend to think that it does
351754 what we keep hearing from those fight scenes from couples is do you guys have a camera in my house because my wife and i have had those fights
351755 i think thats why theyre so hard to watch because theyre so real this couple is fighting about real issues theyre fighting about finances theyre fighting because of miscommunication theyre fighting because he struggles with an internet pornography issue
351756 she catherine refers to caleb viewing trash on the internet so that when children are watching the movie it will go right over their head
351757 but every adult knows what were talking about we believe we can deal with a very sensitive subject without being graphic that we can address the issue without slapping people around with it or showing things that are inappropriate a family can still go and see this movie
351758 the opening weekend is the key and is so critical
351759 unfortunately we live in a society with movies where its market driven and box office driven
351760 we had a great opening weekend with facing the giants and so it spread to other cities
351761 three people are dead can you help us recover the bodies
351762 a bit of smoke that appears for a little while then vanishes
351763 weve got more than one camera plus i dont have to both direct and play a major role
351764 the foundation of marriage has been attacked devalued and redefined by many in our culture
351765 it is our desire to tell a story that would allow the audience to relate to common marital issues and then to take them down a path toward understanding principles for unconditioned love through the roles of husband and wife
351766 our hope would be that after viewing the film couples and singles hoping to marry would be challenged and exhorted to pursue god honoring relationships that reinforce the foundations of marriage in light of a relationship with jesus christ we want people to realize that fireproof does not mean the absence of fire but the ability to withstand it
351767 we could not be more pleased with our relationship with albany the police and fire departments offered their services and equipment and some officers volunteered their time and others received credit for training exercises
351768 the fire department even burned down an old house for us that is a pivotal role in the movie and gives kirks character the opportunity to rethink lifes priorities phoebe putney hospital let us film on site as well as provided some doctors offices as a set for some scenes more than 20 sets and a production office were provided by local businesses
351769 i just wanted to be part of something exciting that a church was doing on the quality level that sherwood has brought to the screen i wanted to be sure that my casting if it occurred would be of the lord and not just because i had more experience than others
351770 in my lifetime the divorce rate has climbed to one out of two marriages and the marriage rate has dropped 30 percent what if we can make a dent in those statistics
351771 if we go back to the idea of redeeming the time because the days are evil this is the best use of our ministry time
351772 we each have full time responsibilities at the church but this is just something else that we feel needs to be done and is worked into our schedule
351773 thats why you see all of these volunteers out here in the hot sun taking vacation and personal time away from their jobs to help make this movie we are preaching a two hour sermon in the format of a hollywood movie and will be able to reach people who would never set foot inside a church
351774 they are doing this for more than here more than now they have a sense that long after they have left this world this movie will still be telling a story of redemption and will represent what they feel is important in life
351775 dont you ever tell me he she is leaving just let me know if someone i know is dead i dont want to hear people going abroad
351776 the wounds of a friend are trustworthy but the kisses of an enemy are excessive
351777 we think that current disease reporting procedures and animal tracking methods provide the kind of information health officials need to respond to animal disease events
351778 at a time when the job of protecting our food safety is woefully underfunded the usda has spent over 118 million on just the beginning stages of a so called voluntary program that ultimately seeks to register every horse chicken cow goat sheep pig llama alpaca or other livestock animal in a national database more than 120 million animals its a program that only a bureaucrat could love
351779 other mandatory implementations which weave nais into existing regulatory fabric and programs have occurred in the states of wisconsin and indiana where premises registration has been made mandatory in drought stricken north carolina and tennessee where farmers have been required to register their premises in order to obtain hay relief and in colorado where state fairs are requiring participants to register their premises under nais
351780 we are asking the court to immediately halt implementation of the program nationwide before more farmers and ranchers are strong armed into participating in a program that the usda has called voluntary
351781 we got into so much trouble in obtaining the pirated copy of this movie and he gave us this shit fuck you rgv
351782 how am i to gain experience in the field if i cannot be allowed to practice
351783 pas de probl me ces routes ont tendance ne pas tre en ligne droite elle va ventuellement commencer se diriger vers cali
351784 furthermore it doesnt matter if its hard to read because its really the holy spirit that explains it to you
351785 but its o k because the holy spirit explains it to them
351786 why does my love interest have to be romeo of all people
351787 youre the expert youre the sunday school teacher youre the one whos being reading it your whole life and you dont even understand kings english why in the world would you tell a young believer who with our public school system is probably barely literate to begin with to start out reading the king james thats insane
351788 the plain truth of the matter is that the version that is so cherished among senior saints who have more or less come to terms with elizabethan english is obscure confusing and sometimes even incomprehensible to many younger or poorly educated christians
351789 you cant have filenames longer than 14 chars you cant even think about them
351790 when that happens on the field usually guys have helmets on
351791 but this happened on the sidelines so it probably wasnt a good idea
351792 he was trying to apologize so i was walking with him just to be there
351793 i dont anticipate this having any lingering effect on this team
351794 we were talked to and things were squashed thats it thats the way it is it happened there will be no retaliation by anybody on anything when you look at the schedule we dont play the panthers this year so we need to be smart when were out there
351795 when i was 22 i was a different guy so im not trying to spin anything
351796 you spend two hours with somebody and now you know them thats not the case
351797 obviously everybody is going to be waiting to see what the repercussions are from this event
351798 im just praying that we rally together as a team because obviously theres going to be some adversity here the focus is not where it needs to be right now
351799 you thought should i try to break the pass up ive got to make sure im not forcing him out there was too much gray area this clears everything up and makes the game a lot simpler i welcome it
351800 its not so much that it favors the defense as much as it takes a lot of the guesswork out of the game
351801 i guess it is kind of helping the defense but its also making it easy on the referees too
351802 because a lot of big plays were made in the last year where it came down to was a guys foot inbound
351803 if hes in the air push him out of bounds as long as you dont carry him out of bounds its out of bounds
351804 were in the air trying to make a catch trying to get two feet in but the momentum of the defensive player is forcing us out of bounds theyre taking some of the guesswork out of it but theyre also taking away part of the offensive players game
351805 happens a lot because the best way to beat the cover two defense is the corner route
351806 when we play a cover two team thats what we do its a timing route
351807 i guess you just have to work more on getting your feet in bounds without getting forced out
351808 run patterns a little better and get separation so you wont have to worry about that
351809 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
351810 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
351811 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
351812 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
351813 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
351814 you could hand me a billion dollars and im still going to be on the field
351815 it doesnt matter to me but everyone has different situations has different views on money money is not more important than football to me right now
351816 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
351817 hes not a part of our 80 man roster right now
351818 and if or when he is well deal with that then and i think our team has done a great job of just staying focused
351819 when we traded for him and bill came to me to tell me about it we really didnt know what to expect but i knew instantly that i liked him
351820 there was a chain link fence running alongside ruston high stadium and fred swung that running back so hard the guy actually got caught underneath that fence
351821 they had to get wire cutters and everything to get this kid out
351822 i dropped the rifle on my toe and it fired
351823 i didnt realize there was still a bullet in the chamber it just went off
351824 i was afraid my mom and the coaches would get on me
351825 he went into the coaches office grabbed a doughnut and a cup of coffee and lifted up his jersey and showed them the bullet hole then they took him to the hospital and fred was afraid of needles
351826 coach walsh changed my life and so did mr d
351827 he was the most explosive undersized pass rusher i have ever seen he never lifted weights just did incredible things on the field
351828 he made every part of our team better on offense we knew we would get the ball in a great spot because fred with his ability to get sacks and everybody on that entire defense would get the job done
351829 and that made me realize how great an owner he was and how much i finally belonged
351830 my father always said wait until its all signed on the dotted line
351831 he made every part of our team better on offense we knew we would get the ball in a great spot because fred with his ability to get sacks and everybody on that entire defense would get the job done
351832 not only did our sample of students report more positive emotions after listening to music but their already positive emotions were intensified by listening to music
351833 control yourself take only what you need from it a family of trees falling to be haunted
351834 i saw different aspects of the game at corner as far as knowing where the help from a safety is
351835 a lot of offensive guys would grab that facemask and push
351836 now if the db turns his head or jerks in any way and we have hold of his facemask thats a penalty i havent done it a lot but it happens
351837 the social security administration is required by law p l 101 239 sect 10308 to send statements automatically to eligible people who are age 25 or older have a social security number ssn have any earnings on record are not receiving benefits including medicare for whom we can obtain a current address and have not requested a statement within the last 11 months if you are eligible you can expect to receive an updated statement each year about three months before your birthday
351838 some people may also want to tell us the of growth investments and of value investments they want
351839 what is a man if his chief good and market of his time be but to sleep and feed a beast no more surely he that made us with such large discourse looking before and after gave us not that capability and god like reason to fust in us unused
351840 aek announces the beginning of its co operation with sotiris kyrgiakos the greece international defender agreed to sign a 5 year deal with the club
351841 i am here to give my best along with the other players and with the people at aek so that the club can achieve all of her goals
351842 the squad is not as big as wed like and with just two weeks to go we need to start focusing on the job in hand
351843 it is a natural comparison as there are similarities in terms of media presence a certain challenging attitude and hard work
351844 the latter is the one that most links these two characters of all the tacticians i have known he is the one who is closest to herrera
351845 it isnt easy to keep your supremacy on an even keel we just need to play well and win
351846 i think milan have the confidence above all else to go for it now roma are very strong and must repeat their extraordinary last season to be up there again while juventus are full of character
351847 we are all traumatised parched from the heat of the fire and hungry and all they give us are empty words
351848 it was horrible i was covered by smoke and flames by the time i woke up
351849 i did not know who threw me out of the train i believe it must be god
351850 it took nearly more than six hours for them to respond
351851 he had been a unique hero of the indian revolutionary movement
351852 together we had fought the revisionist line of s a dange then we gave shape to the cpm i had a more than 50 years association with surjeet
351853 with akg surjeet had tried to build up a farmers movement across the country
351854 comrade harkishan was always with us especially during the last days of my husband in new delhi in 2004 recalled sarada teacher who is undergoing treatment at government ayurveda college hospital at tripunithura
351855 when nayanar was admitted to escort hospital in new delhi surjeet visited us and consoled me with soothing words taken from the depth of his heart the teacher said
351856 if a basic accounting document can be restricted on security grounds theres no limit as to what can be withheld
351857 were trying to see if we can get our residents back into our homes
351858 the aid is not designed to make you whole its designed to help you get a leg up
351859 we are now at pretty much 100 percent power we got the last bits on today
351860 i cant speak for every property but the town and our board of directors have urged all properties to comply
351861 people drive in the same entrance and then split off into neighborhoods designed for different lifestyles and values
351862 more of us are partisan and more of us are living in ever smaller communities of interest places that nurture our certainty and feed our extremism
351863 tolerance and its progeny in the political world compromise were the victims of late twentieth century politics
351864 were the beginnings of political alignments that would extend for the next forty years
351865 two books show that more of us live as we think divided
351866 many texas residents are unprepared for the fast approaching dtv transition especially those who live along the border
351867 households that continue watching stations from mexico rather than taking steps to prepare for the transition may not receive amber alert and emergency alert system messages
351868 i always kind of looked at him and thought he was invincible
351869 rick was a jack of all trades and a master of everything
351870 my wife would always ask me how do you know that
351871 we had a couple of good years because of that bag
351872 outdoorsman parr 58 had knack for making folks like him
351873 it was an issue with all these children coming down here unnecessarily
351874 before we could just keep coming but now with the 40 minutes a week we wont be able to do that anymore
351875 there are some employees who prefer to work only three days a week of course especially if they have part time jobs
351876 we have to make this work and i believe we have a plan that will make it work
351877 it seems like every week we see some new proposal in the newspaper without there being any of the work done regarding the joint land use study
351878 if theres no reason to think youve got an endangered species on your property
351879 but we expect developers to set aside their portion as well
351880 what we need is a regional approach to this idea
351881 youre trading a future stream of revenue for cash right now once the cash is spent its gone
351882 you wouldnt find yourself in this fix if you had a revenue system that could deliver an adequate amount of revenue every year to make the investments you need and provide services
351883 it will be an important step at a very critical time for us in terms of the systems overall needs
351884 as the marketplace becomes more complex does the state evolve in order to maximize our returns or do we operate more traditionally
351885 i think we have to look at it on a case by case basis
351886 it happens in the private sector and corporate sector so there is a structure in place
351887 with gas prices soaring barack obama says no to offshore drilling and says hell raise taxes on electricity
351888 nonpartisan fact checking web site from university of pennsylvanias annenberg public policy center whose analysis of the ad took issue with the ads claim that sen barack obama says hell raise taxes on electricity
351889 the mccain campaign sent out a fact sheet to reporters
351890 that cited a quote from a feb 19 interview with carlos guerra of the san antonio express news as the sole source for the claim
351891 barack obama told a texas newspaper what we ought to tax is dirty energy like coal and to a lesser extent natural gas
351892 the problem the quote was taken completely out of context and obama didnt say he wants to raise taxes on electricity
351893 during that q and a which focused largely on education the reporter asked obama whether he would consider taxing energy to help fund education
351894 q have you considered other funding sources say taxing emerging energy forms for example say a penny per kilowatt hour on wind energy
351895 a well thats clean energy and we want to drive down the cost of that not raise it we need to give them subsidies so they can start developing that what we ought to tax is dirty energy like coal and to a lesser extent natural gas

351906 this terrorism is certainly one of the issues which for us is a very important part of the issues in the summit

351957 the accordion was post war the most popular instrument in america by far
351958 the guitar took over the new music style killed it
351959 now you can get a girl as an accordion player
351960 it was all rock n roll you know the who the accordion was looked at as thing your dad played when he was a kid it got a real negative connotation

351962 are you the one they talk about so much going to college
351963 its very very helpful to have a student in the class who along with me remembers lyndon johnson and his presidency who remembers nixon who remembers jimmy carter

351965 i dont have that many more years to live and i want to do good for humanity while im here

351973 i think the iranians have to believe that we will use force if necessary and im concerned because you had statements for a period of time there from people like the commander in centcom who has since been relieved suggesting that force was off the table
351974 everything we can to dispel this idea that somehow we dont have the capacity militarily to take action

351991 we noticed that the victims came from all over the world and we wanted to present a remembrance that counted as many feelings as possible

352091 we got stuck with a co uk version of the domain we wanted
352092 but we played it to our advantage by marketing heavily to those in the uk and beefing up local seo in great britain the results show for themselves we had record breaking profits last quarter
352093 weve heard of other businesses temporarily loosing their domain name to hackers
352094 but after a couple days the name is recovered and doubly secured by the respective company at their domain name registar
352095 one of the most amazing online casinos related sales we had was in last septembers auction
352096 though the domain didnt go for much money bidding was very spirited with some 50 people getting in on the action in the end the online casinos domain went to a well established marketing firm who did not disclose their future plans for it
352097 email is so ingrained into the backbone of the online casinos internet sector that many forget about it when buying a domain

352148 i probably would not have done that either pursue a graduate degree had i not participated in junior senior scholars
352149 i would have probably have gone to a community college or i would have started at a public school and have not done so great
352150 they have a lot of outcomes they purpose for those students
352151 those students are choosing more selective colleges than they might have done on their own
352152 its been an extraordinary experience both for our college students and the students from the community its been life enriching
352153 one of the wonderful things about this program is that it has been ongoing
352154 it got to the point that everyone wanted to be a junior scholar
352155 the support they had for me motivated me somebody cared i didnt want to let them down
352156 one thing ive learned through education you can make your dreams come true
352157 just to have that college experience is more than words can say

352405 we are no longer limited to being independent readers or consumers of information as well see we can be collaborators in the creation of large storehouses of information
352406 bloggers have made an indelible imprint by focusing less on the meta conversation and more on specifics fact checking comparing old transcripts to new material and making phone calls
352407 thats true power the power of revealing powerful things and blogs are one of the mediums responsible
352408 oh yeah its about making a difference but thats what they all say to make themselves feel better we will be rolling in the big bucks while you have meager life with a teacher salary even though we both will have a degree from ksu
352409 its easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than a rich man to enter heaven
352410 per aver saputo costruire un ritratto famigliare di grande autenticit umana dolce e aspro al tempo stesso e per lirresistibile figura di un protagonista lontano da ogni stereotipo il film unisce lapparente svagatezza dei toni a un discorso molto profondo sulla provincia italiana sul mondo del lavoro sulle relazioni famigliari e su quelle fraterne non pensarci mostra come si possano coniugare le solide strutture del racconto cinematografico con la rappresentazione delle vicende minime impercettibili affettuosamente comiche che appartengono allesistenza di ciascuno di noi

352418 gentile e del sordi intervengono per stigmatizzare le presunte colpe dellex prefetto cui imputano di non aver acceso le luci sul sabotino e davvero difficile comprendere come chi si richiama a valori cos alti della patria e della sua difesa sui sacri confini dellisonzo non faccia una piega nellaccettare che bossi ministro della repubblica e preziosissimo alleato di governo indirizzi un gesto ingiurioso verso linno nazionale

352470 si torni a votare nella prima data utile che il 30 novembre per evitare anche i ragionamenti pelosi di un centro destra che non ha lautorit morale per dettare lagenda della politica in abruzzo
352471 dobbiamo avere la capacit di riorganizzare un nuovo centrosinistra che sappia candidare gente cristallina e che non abbia problemi con la giustizia
352472 e soprattutto un centrosinistra in cui la sinistra sia unita e capace di rialzare la testa dopo tutto quello che successo
352473 ci che successo in abruzzo una sconfitta per tutta la politica
352474 questo paese orfano di una questione morale in senso pi propriamente politico la questione morale una questione politica nella misura in cui capace di evitare ci che di negativo successo arriviamo in ritardo in questa come in altre questioni e quello che successo riguarda badate bene tutti sia le giunte di centro sinistra sia quelle di centro destra
352475 la questione morale arriva in ritardo in casa nostra arriva in ritardo in calabria in campania e arriva purtroppo in ritardo anche in abruzzo
352476 non abbiamo diritto allo stupore ci che sta accadendo in questo paese successo quando abbiamo detto che la questione morale era una questione del passato questo un paese che delega tutto a tutti fuorch alla politica
352477 in questi anni abbiamo creato unaria di opacit non abbiamo quasi mai scelto e invece bisogna scegliere da che parte stare e alcune volte bisogna stare anche con chi perdente
352478 in abruzzo ha perso la politica perch ha messo in scena la propria subalternit la politica il luogo della decisione e in tutto questo tempo ha abdicato a questo ruolo
352479 qui si avverte in maniera pi evidente il fallimento di un centro sinistra che quando va al potere invece di rompere lo status quo lo asseconda e quando questo succede siamo di fronte alla fine della politica la politica deve essere autonoma deve tornare ad essere autonoma
352480 si deve restituire la politica alla sua funzione se vogliamo che dalla corruzione non si arrivi anche a pratiche mafiose perch il passo breve
352481 mi chiedo e vi chiedo come facciamo a non indignarci per il cosiddetto lodo alfano sul quale si sviluppato un dibattito surreale non possiamo accettare supini tutto ci questa unidea privata della democrazia e ci dobbiamo indignare di nuovo e ribellare
352482 come si pu votare il trattato di lisbona allunanimit mentre fino a ieri siamo stati sanzionati con voto allunanimit di tutto il parlamento europeo la terza volta che succede a berlusconi di fronte alla reintroduzione di concetto di razza lunione europea non poteva che scagliarsi contro come facciamo ad accettare che il concetto di razza diventi un concetto giuridico nel nostro paese
352483 di tutto ci ce ne dobbiamo fare carico noi noi la sinistra ho sempre avuto la sensazione che a sinistra c la cantiamo e ce la suoniamo da soli una parodia da piccoli maestri siamo stati sempre dalla parte della ragione mai avuto un dubbio sinistra arcobaleno stato questo una grande intuizione una intuizione generosa ma nella pratica un atto notarile abbiamo saltato qualche passaggio abbiamo sbagliato a non rinnovare i nostri gruppi dirigenti mario tronti ha detto una cosa molto interessante una sinistra che smette di fare domande ha smesso di fare politica
352484 la sinistra si deve riorganizzare deve essere in grado di ragionare sui sostantivi su una innovazione profonda abbiamo bisogno di una sinistra che torni a stare insieme su grandi temi e bisogna fare presto e bene
352485 tutto questo in abruzzo si pu fare dobbiamo restituire unetica civile che si perduta e questo processo va innescato dal basso con processi inclusivi proviamo a ragionare insieme senza padroni di casa e senza ospiti se ci sono le possibilit di una sinistra aperta coltiviamole abbiamo bisogno di una sinistra che raccolga il voto del 14 aprile non come una offesa ma come un ultimo avviso sappiamo che alcune cose che noi diremo altri non le potranno dire
352486 la costituente di sinistra non un titolo un viaggio e un modo di stare insieme nessuno oggi in questo paese autosufficiente tantomeno il partito democratico io vi chiedo di crederci perch in questo paese c ancora lo spazio per una sinistra impegnatevi impegnamoci ce la possiamo fare ce la dobbiamo fare
352487 that makes decisions on the people for the people instead of the people a politics that holds that in the political order all sections of the community have been assigned their proper place
352488 for us street traders being a stakeholder is a slavery term this is because government and big business think for us plan for us and all we are left with is to fit in their plan and do as we told even if we feel hurt and oppressed by their plans
352489 there are two ways of counting the parts of the community the first only counts empirical parts actual groups defined by differences in birth by different functions locations and interests that constitute the social body the second counts in addition a part of the no part we will call the first police and the second politics there is politics inasmuch as the people refers to subjects inscribed as a supplement to the count of the parts of society a specific figure of the part of those who have no part politics exists as a deviation from this normal order of things it is this anomaly that is expressed in the nature of political subjects who are not social groups but rather forms of inscription of the ac count of the unaccounted for the poor does not designate an economically disadvantaged part of the population it simply designates the category of peoples who do not count those who have no qualifications to part take no qualification for being taken into account
352490 today the great majority of people do not have a name the only name available is excluded which is the name of those who do not have a name today the great majority of humanity counts for nothing
352491 we are being used under the banner of being stakeholders whenever the government makes a policy they consult us individually and say different things to us having caused enough chaos among us they say they have consulted stakeholders whereas those among us who are not well learned they are often ignored
352492 to educate the masses politically does not mean cannot mean making a political speech what it means is to try relentlessly and passionately to teach the masses that everything depends on them that if we stagnate it is their responsibility and if we go forward it is due to them too that there is no such thing as a demiurge that there is no famous man who will take responsibility for everything but that the demiurge is the people themselves and the magic hands are finally only the magic hands of the people
352493 it seems that the poor and excluded are perpetually being fragmented by the authorities in the name of being stakeholders
352494 an emancipatory politics is universal and not linked to any specific interest it is for all never for some
352495 civil society citizenship and the politics of the im possible rethinking militancy in africa today
352496 the nation does not exist in a programme which has been worked out by revolutionary leaders
352497 it was clear to all that you have to approach it from the bottom start small in a form like struggling against baig mlaba etc because in no ways you can jump into the world bank while failing to identify a close enemy that you can see touch an enemy that denies us a right to life
352498 we must rid ourselves of the very western very bourgeois and therefore contemptuous attitude that the masses are incapable of governing themselves
352499 having observed social formations and their politics i have this question to ask why is it that every time the poor come together ngos and leftists jump in and take over in their conventional praxis they provide capacity building whereas my observation is that capacity building demobilises people it takes them away from their original agenda
352500 livni es la persona que m s me apasion entre los muchos pol ticos que conoc en esta gira
352501 notice your team is not hidden and is visible to all players
352502 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
352503 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
352504 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
352505 i put myself in a bad situation and i did not handle it the right way
352506 i was wrong and made a mistake my girlfriend my attorney and i wanted a quick resolution and knew that a suspension could happen
352507 bernards somewhere else right now and we like our receivers we have im 50 years old i forget pretty quick
352508 bernard was here last year right i can talk about our receivers quite a bit we like everything theyre doing we appreciate what bernard did for us in the past
352509 the guys we keep i could see all of them being involved i dont think itll be a situation where its just going to be two or three guys playing 90 percent of the time if we have five or six i can see them all getting a lot of playing time
352510 we have a lot of guys we think can move into that role but we havent given out any starting jobs or anything like that
352511 we definitely think devin hester can be a no 1 receiver for us brandon lloyd has looked good marty booker has been a no 1 receiver and we like what rashied davis has been able to do earl bennett was a high draft pick for us third round and mark bradleys coming back so we have some good depth
352512 i wouldnt doubt anything that devin hester could do whether its returning punts taking a couple snaps at quarterback or playing cornerback
352513 i got a chance to come out and make some plays so i just did that
352514 weve got some guys that are taking a little time to get back to 100 percent so i had a chance to come out and get in the first lineup and have a chance to shine
352515 i dont know i hope i would have made the team but that was ultimately for the coaches to decide
352516 last year at this time we were talking about he and mike hass
352517 he got hurt at the end but he was really making progress now weve had him all off season and he seems like hes one of our guys he has ability and he got an opportunity you need to step up when you get that chance
352518 it would be great for me to get out there and catch some balls if i can and if that happens i welcome it
352519 but the team needs me to block so thats what im going to do
352520 hopefully i can get a little bit of both in there
352521 i dont think they want to lose their leading scorer for nothing maybe they do i dont know
352522 after coming off a season like last year where we didnt make the playoffs its just tough to possibly go through another thing theres too much tension there
352523 i think for me id like to just have some clarity we have all these guys at one position i think things should work out naturally theres no reason it shouldnt for myself and the organization
352524 you dont need 29 all you need is one a sign and trade both sides would have to agree so well see what happens
352525 i want to make it clear to the fans that i want to come back but something good has to be done that both sides feel comfortable with thats pretty much it
352526 i kind of faced a similar situation when i was entering high school
352527 they did the same thing where they were threatening to cut the budget i was really scared back then so i can just imagine how the kids feel facing that now
352528 i think eliminating sports from a high school could be disastrous
352529 i think at the end of the day theyll come to some decision

352533 some of us were lucky we had showers before got off the airplane
352534 we are sad to hear of the apparent death of this gentleman mr al masri and we extend our condolences to his family
352535 i say that because we have not completely established the circumstances or the facts of whats happened here
352536 the death of a father and husband is a tragedy for all those people who are left behind
352537 however we emphasise the fact that even if the person has spent some time in australia this does not mean that australia is responsible for all events that may befall them in the future
352538 however we are not going to discuss this in further detail until we have properly investigated all the facts which we will conduct as soon as possible
352539 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
352540 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done

352556 for six years dr ivins fully cooperated with that investigation assisting the government in every way that was asked of him
352557 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
352558 everybody is jumping to the conclusion that because this guy committed suicide he must be the anthrax killer
352559 that is a lousy premise the pressure of these f b i investigations on individuals is phenomenal and it is quite likely that this guy cracked under that pressure but had nothing to do with the killings
352560 the time is now for congress to step in to protect the rights of law abiding americans
352561 a man is not born into greatness but he who achieved so much for mankind is truly great

352579 the last expedition brought back several minuscule examples of what we believe are written text
352580 i have been trying to relate that to the radio wave broadcasts that they have been transmitting in recent time
352581 but you know that wont matter to the government research oversight board all they care about is whether we can eat it or not
352582 at least our food preparers will have a name to call it as an ingredient whatever those symbols mean im sure we will translate into something
352583 we now have a positive id on the body i can confirm to you that al masri has been killed
352584 al qaeda has never proven itself as a potent force in using chemical and biological weapons
352585 if al masri has in fact died his death will not cripple al qaeda or the taliban
352586 this case once again demonstrates that without active cooperation from pakistan key militants cannot be targeted
352587 every time you have someone prominent like al masri getting killed in pakistan everybody has good reason to ask why are all these people getting found in pakistan
352588 we are committed to fight against those extremists and terrorists who are destroying and making the world not safe
352589 of his own volition he suggested adding an hour to the questioning the questions were to the point
352590 the smallest thing could happen and they report it to us which we really appreciate
352591 we of course review it and want to know corrective action has been taken
352592 we suffered 11 soldiers killed and 20 wounded and the terrorists lost seven killed and 27 wounded
352593 we are sad to hear of the apparent death of this gentleman mr al masri and we extend our condolences to his family
352594 i say that because we have not completely established the circumstances or the facts of whats happened here
352595 the death of a father and husband is a tragedy for all those people who are left behind
352596 however we emphasise the fact that even if the person has spent some time in australia this does not mean that australia is responsible for all events that may befall them in the future
352597 however we are not going to discuss this in further detail until we have properly investigated all the facts which we will conduct as soon as possible
352598 weve seen record growth in the number of solar rebate applications lodged since the government acted on budget night to better target the rebate to those earning less than 100 000
352599 an average of 522 applications have been lodged weekly since the budget with 794 in one week alone
352600 this confirms that the government took the right step in bringing funds forward for this program and ensuring that they go to those australian families that most need financial assistance to install solar systems in their homes
352601 despite the scaremongering of the opposition in the 10 weeks since the budget we have seen continuing solid demand for this program and i am confident that will continue
352602 some industry sources believe mr garrett will soon announce the government will increase the means test on the solar panel rebate program from 100 000 to 150 000
352603 this will not scrap the means test simply tweak it
352604 but this would still be a bad result for australias solar industry and for home owners wanting to install solar panels
352605 it still makes it harder for many people who want to install solar in their homes it would still treat the rebate as welfare not a positive incentive to boost the renewable sector in australia
352606 todays release of the figures is especially timely as hundreds of representatives from the solar pv industry including installers distributors and dealers are in melbourne to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing the industry nationally
352607 the rebate scheme particularly in the last two years has allowed the industry to build capacity and capability
352608 however the industry is now ready to transition to a nationally consistent gross feed in tariff this policy will deliver the long term certainty needed for investment and jobs growth
352609 ive been through thousands of thursdays but i aint never been here before
352610 the system is designed to be relatively simple and theres no reason to complicate it

352612 it also is one big reason why so many really young kids are showing up at heart concerts these days
352613 we usually shoot for the same vibe and pick players and vocalists that will work with the song
352614 we dont over think it we just have them play the song as they hear it or sing the tune with their own voice in terms of the arrangements we often make changes to the guitar and bass parts in order to make gameplay more interesting in
352615 theres at least a half dozen other bands waiting in the wings to see what happens with this case
352616 what they did was file for a preliminary injunction over the thanksgiving holiday trying to disrupt sales of guitar hero on a theory that just doesnt hold water
352617 in some cases its karaoke except with the original band members
352618 other times theyll go back to the original to get the vibe but go for something new with aerosmith the vocals and guitar and every sound is different we didnt go for retro we wanted it different for
352619 we had re recorded the song a couple years earlier because we did a commercial for napa auto parts but we couldnt close the deal at the time and so we had a great multitrack of the song sitting on the shelf guitar hero needed it we were ready

352632 no i wont condemn my pastor and i wont leave my church just so i can be president

352640 the attempt was made to shoo her off the fence to chase her from the boundary of culture into the wilderness from dusk into night
352641 the arrogant woman was incarcerated as a witch and her sensualism was burned out of her
352642 it would have meant an inadmissible diminution of the power of the demon if it had transpired that he needed bewitching herbs to confuse the senses of witches and sorcerers
352643 did they possibly experience something that our ordinary or our scientific language was unsuited to describe are we forced to say in this instance in analogy with wittgensteins dictum and if a lion spoke we could not understand him if a witch turned into a crow and flew we would not be able to see it
352644 presupposed that one could only fly like a bird or like a panam pilot
352645 that which we include in our personality will then expand to the same extent as we our everyday person surrender our more or less firm boundaries the limits of our person now include matters we formerly saw as belonging to the outside world with lightning clarity we realize that these limits are not circumscribed by 5 ft 11 in and 150 lb our soul does not leave our body but the limits of our person no longer coincide with the boundaries of our body that we might see on a snapshot it is not so much that we fly what happens instead is that our ordinary ego boundaries evaporate and so it is entirely possible that we suddenly encounter ourselves at places where our everyday body whose boundaries are no longer identical with our person is not to be found
352646 what are the criteria and where can they be found which would make it possible to decide whether one perceived a normally closed range of reality or was merely the victim of a delusion of the senses what will give us the confidence to maintain that a psychiatrist such as george devereux is wrong in his assertion that insanity is the only thing that lurks beyond the fence
352647 is not the experience of another reality but rather the experience of another part of the reality there are not two realities one for the witches of the sonora desert and the other for the university of california
352648 that to doubt the witches flight meant also to doubt the testimony of the senses as for instance that at the moment he was composing a book about witches
352649 which supposedly make a person as hot as a buck as blind as a bat as dry as a bone as red as a beetroot and as crazy as a hen

352672 internet retailing in new zealand is behind where it is in other countries and thats got nothing to do i think with the innate willingness of new zealanders to buy things online i think where it falls over is in the execution

352682 it wasnt as difficult as i thought it was going to be but it definitely wasnt easy everything about writing comics especially when youre writing for a company like idw marvel what have you everything has to fit into their particular page count so trying to pick and choose out of an entire screenplay which scenes should get the priority and how deeply you go into each scene can be difficult its a matter of picking and choosing
352683 weve really had to hit the ground running i had a little trouble waking up this morning but i dont think that showed in our stage times
352684 first time round this mornings loop we were encouraged by the impeccable handling of our c4 wrc to push hard we were frequently on the limit but thats the only way to build up a lead here in finland the conditions were damper this afternoon and the going was fairly tricky because certain portions were quite cut up while the grip had altered in other places we had to be on our toes all the time but that didnt stop us attacking all the way thats the challenge of this event you need to find the ideal compromise
352685 but the chance of covering extra kilometres on this terrain which is so specific turned out to be extremely useful it only took me a few corners to settle into a quick but safe pace our situation changed when one of our main rivals retired it is important that we keep the manufacturers title chase in mind because this event could be good for us
352686 it wasnt as difficult as i thought it was going to be but it definitely wasnt easy everything about writing comics especially when youre writing for a company like idw marvel what have you everything has to fit into their particular page count so trying to pick and choose out of an entire screenplay which scenes should get the priority and how deeply you go into each scene can be difficult its a matter of picking and choosing

352688 those of us who oppose an attack on iran are under no obligation to accept iranian president ahmadinejads claims of peaceful intent
352689 the iranian supreme jurisprudent has given a fatwa against having or using nuclear weapons as illicit in islamic law you cant acknowledge that iran is a dictatorial theocracy and then turn around and say that his fatwa is irrelevant

352767 they are working on it so thats good and there are no health risks to campers
352768 this definitely adds to the challenge of keeping them in good functional order
352769 the site will most probably look like a mess by the end of the long weekend but our contractor will be there to clean it up
352770 this is a good first step in helping the region develop and take advantage of the lead time we have while i consider the full strategy
352771 theyre going to need support services that we dont have now
352772 services to help move on to other jobs to help with family situations to help with financial situations just to deal with the unfortunate situation that could be created we dont have a lot of tools in our communities to deal with these things
352773 with temperatures soaring into the upper 20s and low 30s
352774 with frequent flashing and rumbling on many more days than normal
352775 in the end the month was purring along with slightly above normal temperatures and drier than normal conditions however the last week changed this considerably
352776 the result was a normal month temperature wise however precipitation came in above normal

352787 i dont really think about no 1 and at the moment i dont deserve it
352788 all of a sudden i just got exhausted completely lost my concentration
352789 it was hard for me to keep up because the points were quite long the longer the play went i felt worse and worse
352790 ive started to believe i can beat these top players
352791 the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
352792 theyve got test ranges in iran which are more than long enough to handle scud launches and even shahab 3 launches
352793 why would they be launching from the surface of the caspian sea they obviously have not explained that to us
352794 detonated the warhead near apogee not over the target area where the thing would eventually land but at altitude
352795 the only plausible explanation we can find is that the iranians are figuring out how to launch a missile from a ship and get it up to altitude and then detonate it
352796 and thats exactly what you would do if you had a nuclear weapon on a scud or a shahab 3 or other missile and you wanted to explode it over the united states
352797 if even a crude nuclear weapon were detonated anywhere between 40 kilometers to 400 kilometers above the earth in a split second it would generate an electro magnetic pulse emp that would cripple military and civilian communications power transportation water food and other infrastructure
352798 the first indication of such an attack would be that the power would go out and some but not all the telecommunications would go out we would not physically feel anything in our bodies
352799 so you would be walking you wouldnt be driving at that point
352800 and it wouldnt do any good to call the maintenance or repair people because they wouldnt be able to get there even if you could get through to them
352801 we wouldnt be able to pump the fuel into the trucks and get the trucks to the warehouses
352802 would quickly revert to an early 19th century type of country
352803 most of the things we depend upon would be gone and we would literally be depending on our own assets and those we could reach by walking to them
352804 people in hospitals would be dying faster than that because they depend on power to stay alive but then it would go to water food civil authority emergency services and we would end up with a country with many many people not surviving the event
352805 you have to go back into the 1800s to look at the size of population
352806 id have to say that 70 to 90 percent of the population would not be sustainable after this kind of attack
352807 explicitly discuss a nuclear emp attack that would gravely harm the united states
352808 one of the nations in the middle east had launched a ballistic missile from a cargo vessel they had taken a short range probably scud missile put it on a transporter erector launcher lowered it in taken the vessel out into the water peeled back the top erected it fired it lowered it and covered it up and the ship that they used was using a radar and electronic equipment that was no different than 50 60 100 other ships operating in the immediate area
352809 well known to the white house but have not been disseminated to the appropriate congressional committees
352810 could be used in a devastating stealth attack against the united states or israel for which the united states has no known or planned defense
352811 the use of an atomic bomb against israel would destroy israel completely while the same against the islamic only would cause damages such a scenario is not inconceivable
352812 an emp attack on america would send us back to the horse and buggy era without the horse and buggy
352813 if youre a terrorist this is your ultimate goal your ultimate asymmetric weapon
352814 they could do it either directly or anonymously by putting some freighter out there on the ocean
352815 its well known that people dont go on a diet until theyve had a heart attack
352816 and we as a nation are having a heart attack
352817 as of today we have no defense against such an attack we need space based missile defenses to protect against an emp attack
352818 nuclear missiles dont discriminate on party lines when they land
352819 senator obama has been quoted as saying i dont agree with a missile defense system and that we can cut 10 billion of the research out never mind as i say that the entire budget is 9 6 billion or 9 3 billion
352820 needs a missile defense that is so strong in all the different phases we need to defend against that countries will decide its not worth coming up against us
352821 thats one of the things that defeated the soviet union
352822 re 7 29 08 propaganda 70 of us would die from em pulse attack by iran
352823 if even a crude nuclear weapon were detonated anywhere between 40 kilometers to 400 kilometers above the earth in a split second it would generate an electro magnetic pulse emp that would cripple military and civilian communications power transportation water food and other infrastructure
352824 u s intel iran plans nuclear strike on u s
352825 iran has carried out missile tests for what could be a plan for a nuclear strike on the united states the head of a national security panel has warned in testimony before the house armed services committee and in remarks to a private conference on missile defense over the weekend hosted by the claremont institute dr william graham warned that the u s intelligence community doesnt have a story to explain the recent iranian tests graham chairs the commission to assess the threat to the united states from electromagnetic pulse emp attack a blue ribbon panel established by congress in 2001
352826 fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me
352827 thats why they call it the american dream because you have to be asleep to believe it
352828 conformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth
352829 those conspiracies that are too incredible to be believed are
352830 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
352831 he has been dodging his responsibility on that property for more than 25 years
352832 first and foremost we have a duty to follow the law
352833 our obligation is to issue the permit if plans have been submitted in substantial detail and weve done that
352834 because otherwise we dont think hes going to do anything
352835 were not going to sit around and do nothing while this guy pulls down property values around him
352836 its an unsafe condition and i dont want it to continue
352837 theyve got test ranges in iran which are more than long enough to handle scud launches and even shahab 3 launches
352838 why would they be launching from the surface of the caspian sea they obviously have not explained that to us
352839 detonated the warhead near apogee not over the target area where the thing would eventually land but at altitude
352840 the only plausible explanation we can find is that the iranians are figuring out how to launch a missile from a ship and get it up to altitude and then detonate it
352841 and thats exactly what you would do if you had a nuclear weapon on a scud or a shahab 3 or other missile and you wanted to explode it over the united states
352842 if even a crude nuclear weapon were detonated anywhere between 40 kilometers to 400 kilometers above the earth in a split second it would generate an electro magnetic pulse emp that would cripple military and civilian communications power transportation water food and other infrastructure
352843 the first indication of such an attack would be that the power would go out and some but not all the telecommunications would go out we would not physically feel anything in our bodies
352844 so you would be walking you wouldnt be driving at that point
352845 and it wouldnt do any good to call the maintenance or repair people because they wouldnt be able to get there even if you could get through to them
352846 we wouldnt be able to pump the fuel into the trucks and get the trucks to the warehouses
352847 would quickly revert to an early 19th century type of country
352848 most of the things we depend upon would be gone and we would literally be depending on our own assets and those we could reach by walking to them
352849 people in hospitals would be dying faster than that because they depend on power to stay alive but then it would go to water food civil authority emergency services and we would end up with a country with many many people not surviving the event
352850 you have to go back into the 1800s to look at the size of population
352851 id have to say that 70 to 90 percent of the population would not be sustainable after this kind of attack
352852 explicitly discuss a nuclear emp attack that would gravely harm the united states
352853 one of the nations in the middle east had launched a ballistic missile from a cargo vessel they had taken a short range probably scud missile put it on a transporter erector launcher lowered it in taken the vessel out into the water peeled back the top erected it fired it lowered it and covered it up and the ship that they used was using a radar and electronic equipment that was no different than 50 60 100 other ships operating in the immediate area
352854 well known to the white house but have not been disseminated to the appropriate congressional committees
352855 could be used in a devastating stealth attack against the united states or israel for which the united states has no known or planned defense
352856 the use of an atomic bomb against israel would destroy israel completely while the same against the islamic only would cause damages such a scenario is not inconceivable
352857 an emp attack on america would send us back to the horse and buggy era without the horse and buggy
352858 if youre a terrorist this is your ultimate goal your ultimate asymmetric weapon
352859 they could do it either directly or anonymously by putting some freighter out there on the ocean
352860 its well known that people dont go on a diet until theyve had a heart attack
352861 and we as a nation are having a heart attack
352862 as of today we have no defense against such an attack we need space based missile defenses to protect against an emp attack
352863 nuclear missiles dont discriminate on party lines when they land
352864 senator obama has been quoted as saying i dont agree with a missile defense system and that we can cut 10 billion of the research out never mind as i say that the entire budget is 9 6 billion or 9 3 billion
352865 needs a missile defense that is so strong in all the different phases we need to defend against that countries will decide its not worth coming up against us
352866 thats one of the things that defeated the soviet union
352867 re 7 29 08 propaganda 70 of us would die from em pulse attack by iran
352868 if even a crude nuclear weapon were detonated anywhere between 40 kilometers to 400 kilometers above the earth in a split second it would generate an electro magnetic pulse emp that would cripple military and civilian communications power transportation water food and other infrastructure
352869 u s intel iran plans nuclear strike on u s
352870 iran has carried out missile tests for what could be a plan for a nuclear strike on the united states the head of a national security panel has warned in testimony before the house armed services committee and in remarks to a private conference on missile defense over the weekend hosted by the claremont institute dr william graham warned that the u s intelligence community doesnt have a story to explain the recent iranian tests graham chairs the commission to assess the threat to the united states from electromagnetic pulse emp attack a blue ribbon panel established by congress in 2001
352871 fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me
352872 thats why they call it the american dream because you have to be asleep to believe it
352873 conformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth
352874 those conspiracies that are too incredible to be believed are
352875 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
352876 republicans are desperate to win this election theres a lot at stake and theyre going to say and do whatever they need to to get re elected the supreme courts at stake
352877 if youre ever down in houston you better act right you better not gamble or get in a fight cause the sheriff will arrest you and hell bring you down the next thing youre knowin youll be sugar land bound
352878 i have a competition in me i want no one else to succeed i hate most people
352879 these congressional approval ratings are worse than we had on the eve of losing the majority
352880 dont be afraid to say you are disappointed in fellow republicans dont hesitate to be anti washington d c
352881 ready to do whatever possible to keep the white house and to win as many elections down the ballot as possible
352882 look at it this way if we end up with riots you know like rodney king if that happens what do you think is going to happen to the white democrat vote or the independent vote they vote for mccain because theyre scared maybe they stay home and dont vote at all either way it benefits republicans
352883 you know i tried to talk about good roads and good schools and all these things that have been part of my career and nobody listened and then i began talking about n ggers and they stomped the floor
352884 if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists to protect them and to promote their common welfare all else is lost

352887 we are sad to hear of the apparent death of this gentleman mr al masri and we extend our condolences to his family
352888 i say that because we have not completely established the circumstances or the facts of whats happened here
352889 the death of a father and husband is a tragedy for all those people who are left behind
352890 however we emphasise the fact that even if the person has spent some time in australia this does not mean that australia is responsible for all events that may befall them in the future
352891 however we are not going to discuss this in further detail until we have properly investigated all the facts which we will conduct as soon as possible
352892 wal mart opposes proposed legislation called the employee free choice act that would make it easier for workers to unionize by signing a card rather than holding a vote obama a co sponsor of the original bill has called for passage of the act last june presumptive republican presidential nominee john mccain voted against it

352920 rule one obviously enough was that i could not in my search for jobs fall back on any skills derived from my education or usual work not that there were a lot of want ads for essayists anyway two i had to take the highest paying job that was offered to me and do my best to hold it no marxist rants or sneaking off to read novels in the ladies room three i had to take the cheapest accommodations i could find at least the cheapest that offered an acceptable level of safety and privacy though my standards in this regard were hazy and as it turned out prone to deterioration over time

352941 jack we have to face it the dream that we had is dying if bolshevism means the peasants taking the land the workers taking the factories then russias one place where there is no bolshevism
352942 ya know i can argue with cops i can fight with generals i cant deal with a bureaucrat
352943 you think zinoviev is nothing worse than a bureaucrat the soviets have no local autonomy the central state has all the power all the power is in the hands of a few men and they are destroying the revolution they are destroying any hope of real communism in russia they are putting people like me in jail my understanding of revolution is not a continual extermination of political dissenters and i want no part of it every single newspaper has been shut down or taken over by the party anyone even vaguely suspected of being a counter revolutionary can be taken out and shot without a trial where does it end is any nightmare justifiable in the name of defense against counter revolution the dream may be dying in russia but im not it may take some time but im getting out
352944 you sound like you are a little confused about the revolution in action eg up till now youve only dealt with it in theory what did you think this thing was going to be a revolution by consensus where we all sat down and agreed over a cup of coffee
352945 nothing works four million people died last year not from fighting war they died from starvation and typhus in a militaristic police state that suppresses freedom and human rights where nothing works
352946 they died because of the french british and amerikan blockade that cut off all food and medical supplies and counter revolutionaries have sabotaged the factories and the railroads and telephones and the people the poor ignorant superstitious illiterate people are trying to run things themselves just like you always said they should but they dont know how to run them yet did you honestly think things were going to work right away did you honestly expect social transformation was going to be anything other than a murderous process its a war eg and we got to fight it like we fight a war with discipline with terror with firing squads or we just give it up
352947 those four million didnt die fighting a war they died from a system that cannot work
352948 its just the beginning eg its not happening like we thought it would its not happening the way we wanted it to but it is happening if you walk out on it now what does your whole life mean

352951 i took the liberty of altering a phrase or two
352952 yes well i dont allow people to take those liberties with what i write
352953 arent you propagandist enough to utilize what moves people most
352954 and who defines this truth you or the party is your life dedicated to speaking for yourself or
352955 you dont talk about what my life is dedicated to
352956 your life you havent resolved what your life is dedicated to you see yourself as an artist and at the same time a revolutionary as a lover of your wife and as the spokesperson for the amerikan party
352957 zinoviev if you dont think a man can be an individual and be true to the collective or speak for his own country and the international at the same time or love his wife or still be faithful to the revolution then you dont have a self to give
352958 would you be willing to give yourself to this revolution
352959 when you separate a man from what he loves the most what you do is purge whats unique and when you purge whats unique in him you purge dissent
352960 and when you purge dissent you kill the revolution revolution is dissent you dont rewrite what i write
352961 a revolution is not a dinner party or writing an essay or painting a picture or doing embroidery it cannot be so refined so leisurely and gentle so temperate kind courteous restrained and magnanimous a revolution is an insurrection an act of violence by which one class overthrows another
352962 just as to the bourgeois the disappearance of class property is the disappearance of production itself so the disappearance of class culture is to him identical with the disappearance of all culture

352971 podemos mencionar que en el a o 2001 el clima de movilizaci n y tomas de predios era generalizado en gran parte de las provincias del bio bio arauco malleco y caut n por su parte los comuneros de trapa trapa hab an ocupado parte del fundo del mismo nombre controlando el acceso y la veranada de cochico a partir de este momento se comienzan a suceder una serie de hechos no esclarecidos por la justicia chilena que dicen relaci n con muertes de pewenches acciones de amedrentamiento por parte de los colonos y carabineros y persecuci n judicial contra los dirigentes

352973 los colonos pasaban a ser como due os ilegales los ruiz los castillo los acu a por eso decidimos entrar con nuestras familias pero apenas entramos ellos hicieron las denuncias por robo de animales por da os por usurpaci n de tierras f jese si la tierra habia sido de nuestros abuelos veranadas que ten amos y nos acusaban de estar usurpando no nos movilizamos solos tambien de malla malla de cau ic la gente comenz a moverse para recuperar su tierra es por esta raz n que me persiguen judicialmente

352977 me encuentro recluido en esta c rcel por reivindicar nuestro derecho como naci n mapuche me han encarcelado injustamente este es el costo que tenemos por luchar por nuestro pueblo por qu de una vez el gobierno de chile no nos respeta como pueblo
352978 vi que est n empobrecidos que sus tierras est n secas que detr s de las forestales hay todo un aparataje pol tico pol tico militar y vi que la industria forestal se gasta toda la plata que sea necesaria para acallar a cualquier persona que se rebele contra el sistema los allanamientos a las comunidades mapuches son constantes y terribles yo creo que algunos todav a buscan entre los mapuches a ese terrorista que imagin pinochet un terrorista que nunca van a encontrar en la zona mapuche porque no existe
352979 no me dejaron hablar con un abogado en 24 horas no me dijeron de qu se me acusaba
352980 estoy presa por mi trabajo profesional como cineasta por la informaci n que manejo por interactuar con activistas mapuches que luchan por lo que creen por entrevistar a personas de comunidades mapuches que han sido muy reprimidas y que no se atreven a decir nada porque s muchas cosas tan crueles que me llegan a enfermar el pueblo mapuche ha sido humillado ha sido perseguido he visto tanta gente aplastada emocionalmente siqui tricamente tanta gente que no se atreve a hablar por eso estoy presa

352989 todas somos coordinadoras cada una de nosotras desde su organizaci n nacional no necesitamos formar una nueva instancia organizativa para la cumbre de mujeres
352990 estamos preparando la cumbre de mujeres ind genas con la m s amplia participaci n para plasmar de manera conjunta la dif cil situaci n de los pueblos ind genas del continente y construir propuestas no solo para las mujeres sino para todos desde una mirada de mujer
352991 los pueblos originarios no fueron incluidos en la discusi n de la lge
352992 as pues hay muchos recursos sin uso que no son transables que no reciben inversi n y que no generan trabajo
352993 si no lo hago yo que no lo haga nadie
352994 el primer recurso es la amazon a tiene 63 millones de hect reas y lluvia abundante en ella se puede hacer forestaci n maderera
352995 dicen tambi n que dar propiedad de grandes lotes dar a ganancia a grandes empresas claro pero tambi n crear a cientos de miles de empleos formales para peruanos que viven en las zonas m s pobres es el perro del hortelano
352996 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
352997 ley de promoci n de las inversiones en el sector agrario
352998 emplazamos p blicamente a ambos consejeros a que si tienen algo que decir comentar o discutir las puertas de la comunidad siempre han estado abiertas al di logo y por lo tanto les invitamos p blicamente a visitarnos adem s necesitamos que cambien su actitud servil a los intereses del estado chileno y que le hacen un flaco favor a la lucha de nuestro pueblo mapuche
352999 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
353000 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades
353001 cabe recordar que dicha acusaci n corresponde a la formulada por el ex director de conadi jaime andrade qui n habr a concurrido a participar de una reuni n en la comunidad el d a 29 de agosto del 2006 informando posteriormente por medio de una conferencia de prensa que habr a sido objeto de agresiones por parte de nuestra gente
353002 hay un intento del gobierno de satanizar a los secundarios
353003 vos jos ancalao te cagastes solo y donde te pillemos te vamos a liquidar
353004 insultar golpear y en ltimo caso humillar de la forma en la que se le hizo y no conformes con ello con el objetivo de eludir su responsabilidad en los acontecimientos se le acusa y se le imponen cargos sin fundamentos s lidos que son requerimiento esencial en este tipo de casos
353005 junto con lo mencionado previamente es menester mencionar y explicitar el hecho que el acusado est siendo procesado por el mismo tribunal militar regional que dej impune a los asesinos de los hermanos alex lemun y mat as katrileo por lo cual es clara la tendencia del tribunal en cuesti n

353007 el fiscal de la forestal mininco ha estado amedrentando a las comunidades mapuche de chequenco y antinao oblig ndoles a declarar en contra de nosotros que actualmente nos encontramos recluidos en la c rcel de temuco y de angol a muchos mapuche de la comunidad se les est ofreciendo dinero y artefactos como celulares para que declaren y esp en a su propia gente
353008 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
353009 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
353010 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
353011 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
353012 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e
353013 los problemas aparejados por la extracci n ilegal de madera en la frontera brasil per vienen siendo denunciados intensivamente desde 1998 desde entonces los gobiernos de ambos pa ses han formado comisiones para resolver el problema pero nunca llegaron a acuerdos claros ni realizaron acciones contundentes para frenar la situaci n
353014 mediante carta dirigida al coordinador residente del sistema de naciones unidas enrique ganuza y acompa ada con copia a diversas autoridades el observatorio ciudadano manifest su extra eza ante un acuerdo celebrado sin la debida consulta a los pueblos ind genas as como su preocupaci n por las implicancias que ste pueda tener en los derechos de estos pueblos en chile
353015 a ser consultados mediante procedimientos apropiados y en particular a trav s de sus instituciones representativas cada vez que se prevean medidas legislativas o administrativas susceptibles de afectarles directamente
353016 tratamos de producir obras de denuncia claras y provocadoras que hagan reaccionar a la prensa y suscitar esfuerzos de destruccion de la obra por parte de aquellos que no puedan soportarla haciendo mucho ruido y volviendo accesible el mensaje a los que no pertenecen al campo

353022 a menudo lo han hecho en unos t rminos muy desfavorables para los granjeros pobres dejando a estos con m s inseguridad alimentaria y a los gobiernos a depender de unas ayudas internacionales poco predecibles
353023 muchas de las empresas privadas que vinieron a reemplazar a los investigadores estatales resultaron ser monopolistas en busca de dinero
353024 no pensamos que el coste humano de esos programas seria tan grande y que las ganancias econ micas tardasen tanto en llegar

353052 this new school of communication is rooted in our plan to expand undergraduate and graduate offerings in programs that continue to foster our jesuit tradition of strong liberal arts education among students who will work in professional settings
353053 it will be a collaborative community of scholars and professionals who will function as instructors internship supervisors and advisory board members
353054 this undertaking is a focused initiative supported by the universitys faculty and administration
353055 the soc has been under consideration for some time given the enrollment and market data that suggest there is increased demand for these programs the time for this expansion is perfect and we will have the ideal location for the school at the clare
353056 our location in downtown chicago is a major advantage as we strive to become chicagos premier school of communication and the first choice for students seeking a unique jesuit foundation for their careers in communication
353057 if you notice since britney spears started wearing clothes and behaving paris hilton is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
353058 if the ones that attract the paparazzi behave in the first place like we expect of anybody that solves about 90 percent of the problem the rest we can deal with
353059 i forget the exact terminology but the comment was made in terms of her activities now seem to be that shes calmed down and shes in a relationship thats quieted her down and as such she seems to be attracting less attention and theres less activity that the paparazzi all of you are focusing on
353060 look hes doing well and i have done well in the past
353061 this year was hard i guess with the start of the year but nevertheless i still think its been a good year i just hope i can show it now at the olympics and the u s open
353062 im looking forward for the next two tournaments those are really the ones that can make this season from a good one to a great one again
353063 i already played against him six times and it was always close so i knew that im going to have a chance today
353064 i dont think american tennis is troubled by any means but the way it is right now the best players in the world are from switzerland and spain
353065 to be honest i didnt think that it would happen in this tournament because last week i played really bad
353066 and i was injured before so i didnt do nothing basically for two weeks
353067 its tough to beat a guy like that with a second serve
353068 i feel my game is a lot better obviously the score doesnt show it but i know what i need to work on
353069 i gave it my best today and i felt like i did a lot of good things and hopefully that outshines the ones i made mistakes on
353070 i think if i played a couple pga events in a row it would be a different story its just hard to play one and then one maybe a year later
353071 i think if i played eight in a row and i missed all eight that would be a different story
353072 everything went pretty smoothly out there i hit a lot of fairways lots of greens and made a bunch of 10 footers i mean just kind of the way you like to draw it up
353073 i didnt know what the course record was but i caught myself thinking about 59 at no 14 i had like about a 10 footer
353074 i thought if i birdie the last five holes i can shoot 59 and thats just the worst thing to think so i made par there

353079 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
353080 my goodness its time to educate americas so called leaders about the law of supply and demand
353081 i dont care if they really understand it but lets make sure congress acts before its too late energy prices are robbing our country of jobs seriously hurting real americans ability to make ends meet driving up prices for every other product and service imaginable this is no time to be talking about tire pressure lets put some pressure on house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid

353101 dont worry about that heavy stuff buy something and enjoy yourself
353102 sure shop around for your church or faith believe that but that doesnt mean you cant be a good consumer too
353103 who was by all accounts a raging virago who forced you into child labor and locked you in a closet for the better part of your first eleven years
353104 you owe that woman that family nothing i dont understand why you feel like you have to do this
353105 ill just pay my respects and then we can go
353106 if you might have time to come by the house for a moment
353107 weve the wife and i we were going through the house deciding what we had to do to get it ready to sell and we came across something in the attic
353108 we found something that was your mums harry and i think you should have it
353109 i know im prudence dudleys wife please come in its not much cooler in here than it is out there but at least youll be out of the sun
353110 why at the cemetery he was looking at me as if hed like to see me stuffed and mounted
353111 cant say that i blame him under the circumstances if someone had ever done to my pru what was done to you by this family id want their blood too
353112 mum just closed it up after you left the broken toys and the palette they were still in there she thought it had been someplace where i played but then i told her well it was your room at least at first
353113 we have a girl a daughter her name is matilda and shes two
353114 if someone ever did to her what was done to you
353115 for mum i think it was more about her relationship with her own mother than it was about you
353116 i didnt either not until mum was right at the end can we sit
353117 mum was in a lot of pain near the end
353118 theyd given her morphine so sometimes she wasnt quite herself but other times she just seemed to want to talk
353119 when your mum got her hogwarts letter apparently her parents our grandparents were right tickled they were over the moon about their magical daughter and my mum began to feel as if because she hadnt got one she was a disappointment that feeling only got worse when her parents didnt like my dad
353120 especially not her mother i guess she thought he was a loud mouth and low class and that mum was throwing her life away on him what made it worse was that when your mum brought potter home they both loved him
353121 my mum felt like she never measured up even when she was taking care of her father as he was dying and then dealing with her mothers grief it was pretty clear that lily was the favorite
353122 its not like anyone told you and with your folks gone
353123 anyway when mum was right near the end she told me that she regretted the way that she and dad had treated you that youd just been a baby and that you hadnt deserved it
353124 i didnt try to open it but im guessing its been in the attic nearly as long as
353125 well it probably came about the time you did i imagine wasnt sure who it belonged to at first cause you know never met yer mum actually id forgot her name was lily it was pru who put it together
353126 i think well be going now theres folks coming back to our house
353127 i didnt really think that you would but i thought i should ask
353128 please dont take this in any manner other than it is intended but i somehow doubt that your guests are ready for dudleys gay cousin and his lover
353129 and im quite certain that harry is anxious to see whats contained in that trunk
353130 take your time i figure you arent likely to steal anything
353131 im going to go pay the driver and send him on his way
353132 theres no point in the meter continuing to run and we can minimize the trunk and apparate now that your family is no longer a factor
353133 its hot in here as soon as i get back inside ill cast a cooling charm
353134 it was one of the first things sirius said to me
353135 im sure that you do remember i recognize my mothers perfume as well
353136 scent memories are some of the strongest the most evocative
353137 no wonder youre so brilliant in the air its hereditary
353138 this could explain why a certain other seeker always managed to beat the pants off of me
353139 although if id realized then how very fond you would come to be of me with my pants off i might have distracted you enough to occasionally beat you to the snitch
353140 clearly slughorn hasnt deemed it necessary to partake of this himself
353141 youre asleep in your crib just across from me your thumb in your mouth
353142 your aunt petunia says youll ruin your teeth that way but i cannot bring myself to stop you you look so sweet with your round little cheeks and your messy black hair youve inherited your fathers hair i fear and i love every cowlick on your head youve had a busy day today but you so didnt want to go to bed im quite certain the cause for that can be divided equally between a surplus of sugary birthday cake and your desire to never get off of the toy broom that your godfather sent you youre quite terrifying on it actually and poor mr whiskers between sirius chasing him up trees when hes around and you chasing after him all afternoon on that broom its no wonder his fur is falling out in clumps it was a very quiet party just you and me and your dad and old bathtilda bagshot we saw the longbottoms last week before we came here and baby neville who just had his first birthday yesterday the two of you were so cute crawling around on a blanket under a tree in their back yard it was an idyllic day really hard to believe that there is so much uncertainty in the world your father and godfather think that i worry too much i suppose i do in a way its amazing how much your life changes when you have children its not just about you anymore you have someone else to think about to worry about to put before yourself their welfare becomes more important to you than your own their happiness the thing you wish for most we live in frightening times my love and there are those who believe that this is the wrong time to be bringing children into our world part of me understands that sentiment but another part of me agrees whole heartedly with alice longbottom if not now when if we dont go on with our lives then doesnt the darkness win i dont know i look at you and all i can think is that i will do whatever i must to make the world a better place for you to live in than it is right now perhaps we need our children to remind us of what is important to compel us to fix what is wrong forgive me love i hadnt intended to wax philosophical i suppose im feeling a bit nostalgic missing our old house the old rooms we were happy there but its not safe any longer and while i want so much to write these little notes on each of your birthdays and to save them up to embarrass you at some future date by showing them to the love of your life i cant help but understand that that might not happen i remain hopeful but im a realist my darling there were so many things that i wanted to tell you but as i look at you sleeping so peacefully only one of them seems very important now if for whatever reason your dad and i arent with you when you read this i want you to know that you were the most important thing in our lives no matter what happens i want you to know that you are loved so much thats the important thing harry the most important thing you are loved im going to close this now and put it in the little hidden compartment in the bottom of my school trunk im going to hope against hope that ill be the one to rediscover it at some later date and that you and i can have a good laugh over it while im having tea with my handsome grown up son but if that shouldnt be the case i want you to know that on your first birthday you were the center of your parents world which is as it should be happy birthday little man may your life be full of joy and laughter and someday my fervent hope is that someone else will love you just as much as i do right now yours mum
353143 no i would never intrude like that not unless you wished for me to
353144 one you never would have received if youd listened to me to begin with
353145 you seem to bring that out in people potter that desire to love the need to protect
353146 i cant pretend to understand a parents love but i can tell you this i think shed be happy to know that someone loves you as much as shed hoped they would
353147 i know that you do and i love you too
353148 i was thinking that you must still be irritated with your aunt
353149 so did your aunt share your uncles aversion to people of our predilection
353150 if you mean was she a homophobic twat then yes
353151 language potter honestly youd think you were raised in a cupboard
353152 at any rate i was just thinking of what i could give you for your birthday
353153 you gave me a lovely rolex and a new broom
353154 to shag right here on your aunts really hideously ugly couch that ought to send the old bat spinning
353155 well dudley did say that we could take our time
353156 maybe after we get done here we could move on to the bitchs bed
353157 merlins balls id never be able to get it up in that bed the idea of them doing it ever is enough to put me off of sex for months
353158 you dont seem to be having that problem on the sofa however

353160 we must be dedicated art lovers to come out on a night like this
353161 someone would have got involved with the police at quite a high level and said look lets hold it the story for 48 hours and in that 48 hours the publicists seed the story to those people that matter the fans and tell them what is going on
353162 when talent arrive in the uk for a press tour theyll have an entourage with them of anything from one to six people
353163 our first job is to ensure a smooth transition from plane to car to the hotel where weve already got the requisite blenders running machines masseurs and kabbalah water in place for their arrival
353164 we book them dinners and shopping trips we imagine what they might want to see at the theatre and we book them tickets
353165 we organise dress alterations sightseeing tours and if theyve got kids with them we organise kids activities weve even been asked at the last minute to find hair extensions for a big name star who refused to leave her hotel room to come down to the premiere until we got them we went all around london through every hairdresser until we found the right colour those kind of requests stretch you
353166 they say they want to go to a club and youve had to make sure youve made reservations in three clubs in case they want to go to one of them
353167 on one occasion a particular group refused in the middle of the day to take off on their private plane until they had takeaway food from a very expensive chinese restaurant on board even though the restaurant didnt open till 7pm that night
353168 the estimated value of the pirates of the caribbean premiere in print coverage alone was 1 4 million ie if you bought the equivalent space in pure advertising it would cost that much money
353169 when journalists come in and ask dumb questions im very quickly aware of it
353170 in a recession in a downturn the movies will survive because people want to step inside into this world and to be released they want to be part of the fantasy
353171 you may say im a dreamer but im not the only one
353172 i thought i traveled back in time for a minute
353173 now my curse on the murderer whoever he is a lone man unknown in his crime or one among many let that man drag out his life in agony step by painful step
353174 stop in the name of god if you love your own life call off this search my suffering is enough listen to me
353175 listen to you no more i must know it all i must see the truth at last
353176 you youll see no more pain i suffered all the pain i caused too long you looked on the ones you never should have seen blind to the ones you longed to see to know blind from this hour on blind in the darkness blind
353177 life isnt about weathering the storm its about dancing in the rain
353178 just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round you know i love to watch them roll
353179 spiritualism has several different meanings but it usually refers to a religious movement originating in the mid nineteenth century this movement has always stressed survival after death and communication with the dead by means of psychic mediumship claiming to embody a scientific spirituality spiritualists reject many doctrines of traditional religions such as eternal damnation most known societies have believed in the possiblity of communication with the spirit world one of the key notions of mainstream spiritualism is the idea of spirit guides disembodied helper spirits who are often deceased relatives these guides resemble traditional guardian angels a specific category of angelic beings said to be assigned to watch over each person despite functional similarities these two categories of beings ghosts and angels have traditionally been regarded as entirely distinct today however because many people who have undergone near death experiences have reported seeing deceased loved ones on the other side the distinction between disembodied helper spirits and guardian angels has blurred for many

353201 i remember going to san francisco in the early 90s and hearing some djs like marc farina the dance scene here in nyc was very aggressive it was either older softer house music or very aggressive rave music and you went to san francisco and it was much more disco inspired and a bit softer and it reminded me of being out in night clubs in manhattan in the early to mid 80s where you had this genuine underground dance scene that no one outside of lower manhattan had any interest in and so the song disco lies i wanted it slightly to be reminiscent of paradise garage with larry levan or tony humphreys who used to play at this club called zanzibar out in newark so with these cold electronic elements but with a very impassioned diva vocal on top

353265 he will get his retaliation in first with a massive relaunch and a massive this or that and everyone will wait and see if it works
353266 it would have been helpful to see some tentative feet being put forward by some non uber blairite wing to say there was some intelligence in the article
353267 he is poised on the edge of a cliff it will only take a small mistake for him to slip and plunge down in the end the public will decide they may just say they do not want brown and if that happens labour backbenchers will follow and if that happens miliband is now clearly there waiting to try and take his chance

353436 however we are not going to discuss this in further detail until we have properly investigated all the facts which we will conduct as soon as possible

353464 we are sad to hear of the apparent death of this gentleman mr al masri and we extend our condolences to his family
353465 i say that because we have not completely established the circumstances or the facts of whats happened here
353466 the death of a father and husband is a tragedy for all those people who are left behind
353467 however we emphasise the fact that even if the person has spent some time in australia this does not mean that australia is responsible for all events that may befall them in the future

353490 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
353491 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
353492 contract that creates an additional paid holiday eid al fitr a muslim holiday that occurs toward the end of ramadan
353493 union leadership did request and receive eid al fitr which is apparently spelled various ways including id al fitr and eid ul fitr as a paid holiday in place of labor day
353494 since all team members will still have eight paid holidays the change will not affect production
353495 if this holiday is that important to them make them take it off instead of christmas day and allow all workers to be off labor day most american families have some type of function on labor day
353496 it says union leadership made this request makes you wonder who runs the union i guess they are already working on a plan to replace memorial day that means nothing to the muslims so why should we have the right to celebrate it labor day commemorates the plight of workers and the struggle of labor unions to improve working conditions for american workers the muslims will not stop until all of our rights and laws are changed to accommodate their beliefs this will be a new america but it will be their america
353497 diversity is one of the strengths of our union we may come from different countries and speak different languages but what unites us is the belief that by standing together we can better advance our interests
353498 the negotiating committee felt this was extremely crucial since this holiday is as important to muslims as christmas is to christians
353499 two prayer rooms have been created to allow muslim workers to pray twice a day and return to work without leaving the plant
353500 this is america founded by the blood of our forefathers and should not be challenged by somalians hispanics or any other immigrants if they come to america they need to learn our language and our ways they can practice their culture in private if they so please but not shove it down our throats would they let us go there and change there country i have banned tysons products from my home for years because of the illegals they were hiring i am sorry for the producers that are supplying them but tysons has once again crossed the line with the american people labor day was here long before tysons what holiday will be next to be taken away and replaced to accommodate an immigrant this stinks worse than the plant

353518 we wish the waiting lists werent like this so we dont have to make those god like decisions

353520 we would not be leaving if only the problems we outlined had been heard and addressed in some way
353521 this is not crying wolf what does one do to have to capture the attention of the people who are supposed to deal with these issues what tactics are there it was truly done knowing how final it is
353522 they really have a very luxurious situation in that they have three extremely well trained very competent individuals who are really committed to this line of work
353523 im just not sure that the minister realizes what quality he has out there
353524 i nearly fell over when i read that in the paper
353525 the specialists in this area are so scarce across that country that i dont know where the minister of health in newfoundland thinks hes going to find the capacity to transfer these women into
353526 the outcome is poor these women are living under enormous burden the treatments are difficult to suggest that they now have to go somewhere else and have them is just unacceptable
353527 i dont know what id do without her i dont know if id be here without her
353528 the thought of her leaving is extremely upsetting its extremely upsetting for women in this province in general
353529 but i do understand where theyre coming from if there is a discrepancy why shouldnt they receive the same as the other specialists
353530 hiring and retaining health professionals including physicians falls under the purview of the provinces and territories

353551 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
353552 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
353553 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
353554 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric

353556 the best equal opportunity employer in the country is the u s military
353557 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
353558 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
353559 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
353560 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
353561 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
353562 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
353563 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
353564 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
353565 represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning

353567 the atomic bombs which that reactor was capable of producing whether from enriched uranium or from plutonium would be of the hiroshima size thus a mortal danger to the people of israel progressively arose
353568 fully aware of the fact that iraq has been a party to the treaty on the non proliferation of nuclear weapons since it came into force in 1970 that in accordance with that treaty iraq has accepted iaea safeguards on all its nuclear activities and that the agency has testified that these safeguards have been satisfactorily applied to date
353569 the red line is not when they get to that point but before they get to that point
353570 either you finish the job for us or we will with nukes
353571 nobody said this to me directly but i get the feeling from my talks with israeli leaders that if the sanctions dont work israel is going to strike iran
353572 a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being interrogated on the island
353573 were probably holding around 3 000 people you know bagram air field diego garcia guant namo 16 camps throughout iraq
353574 theyre behind bars weve got them on diego garcia in bagram air field in guant namo
353575 we have received concurring confirmations that united states agencies have used diego garcia which is the international legal responsibility of the uk in the processing of high value detainees
353576 he had received credible evidence from well placed sources familiar with the situation on the island that detainees were held on diego garcia between 2002 and 2003
353577 the cia officer surprised attendees by volunteering the information apparently to demonstrate that the agency was doing its best to obtain valuable intelligence
353578 the u s may also have kept prisoners on ships within diego garcias territorial waters a contention the u s has long denied
353579 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
353580 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the u s did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
353581 is a violation of uk law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
353582 a u s plane with a single detainee on board refuelled at the u s facility in diego garcia the detainees did not leave the plane and the u s government has assured us that no u s detainees have ever been held on diego garcia
353583 neither of the two detainees carried aboard the rendition flights that refuelled at diego garcia was ever part of the cias high value terrorist interrogation program
353584 the united states government confirmed that with the exception of two cases related to diego garcia in 2002 there have been no other instances in which u s intelligence flights landed in the united kingdom our overseas territories or the crown dependencies with a detainee on board since 11 september 2001
353585 intentionally failed to ask the right questions of the u s and accepted implausible u s assurances at face value
353586 this remains a transatlantic cover up of epic proportions while the british government seems content to accept whatever nonsense it is fed by its u s allies the sordid truth about diego garcias central role in the unjust rendition and detention of prisoners in the so called war on terror cannot be hidden forever
353587 it is deplorable that previous u s assurances about rendition flights have turned out to be false the failure of the united states administration to tell the truth resulted in the uk government inadvertently misleading our select committee and the house of commons we intend to examine further the extent of uk supervision of u s activities on diego garcia including all flights and ships serviced from diego garcia
353588 responsible for the 9 11 operation from a to z
353589 diego garcia is an obvious place for a secret facility they want somewhere thats difficult to escape from difficult to attack not visible to prying eyes and where a lot of other activity is going on diego garcia is ideal
353590 were fighting to free our country we are not a threat to the world
353591 becoming a sort of surreal hunting estate in which the u s and nato breed the very terrorists they then track down
353592 colorful little flags identify the nato troops presence throughout the country
353593 not one person in my neighborhood has a building permit
353594 illegal building is simply a pretext for destroying palestinian families homes and lives
353595 the demolitions are part of a policy to stop the natural expansion of palestinian communities in and around jerusalem freeing up the maximum amount of land for use by israeli settlers
353596 the demolitions increase the pressure on palestinians to move into the west bank so that they will lose their residency rights in the city
353597 this is the first time a government has supported the rebuilding of an illegal palestinian home demolished by the israeli authorities
353598 we estimate that there have been at least 18 000 homes destroyed during the four decades of occupation
353599 most demolitions are of multistory buildings that are home to several families meaning that well in excess of 100 000 palestinians may have been made homeless by israeli administrative policies
353600 its one thing to destroy a home supposedly built illegally by a palestinian but another to destroy one built with money provided by the spanish government
353601 it was an eye opener to realize that the principles of urban planning we are taught at the university are being used by the israelis but for exactly the opposite purpose from the one usually intended the planning rules here are designed not to improve the palestinians lives but to make them more miserable

353622 what i was impressed with really was how effective the women in these meetings were
353623 but he is not fully responsible for his acts because he was taking drugs nonstop during the four days prior to the killing
353624 my mum had paid for the ticket home and we were looking forward to having her back
353625 he met her out there they were not a couple they had only known each other for a short time
353626 im not really a femme fatale i was never an adulteress since i never got married
353627 thats just nonsense i have never made a decision as a minister based on anything other than what is before me
353628 its an abuse of process to take this land out of the tfl and ask the community to beg for crumbs
353629 from the ministry of forests we get sprawl from wall to wall
353630 this is just the first sale and its larger than victoria its unbelievable
353631 if they are able to leverage a little capital from private land to sustain their operations we should hope that is what will happen
353632 im predicting there will be a really vigorous defence of the forest and the habitat
353633 people feel strongly about protecting this area i think some will risk arrest
353634 were looking at every possible option to stop it to delay it to send it back to the drawing board and to demand more consultation and actual meaningful dialogue and accommodation of environmental concerns
353635 we thought the meeting was about consultation but it wasnt
353636 its always a challenge but its part of the process
353637 i want to know all the pros and cons i encourage all people to have their say
353638 its not really a race to see who finishes first as much as it is a general goal that we should all get to at some point in the future
353639 i think its a win win situation for everyone involved
353640 and consumers stand to benefit greatly as well in the long run competition will only drive prices down and produce higher quality products
353641 this just goes to show that proper research balanced with strict budgeting and investment practices will result in higher profits and corporate growth were excited and our investors are pleased many of them long time online casino shareholders have been able to retire on the profits from our stock growth alone
353642 our online casino research division has been able to harness the power of data mining and databasing to better understand to best way forward
353643 and as a result finding key online casino market trends can be easily made through simple algorithms
353644 while the numbers team is crunching data my team and i are focusing on important online casino human behavioral patterns and psychological trends including buying patterns the impact of economic recession or boom and governnment mandates
353645 weve been working on this online casino project for 8 months now
353646 and we have yet to see daylight the finance team is getting ansy because we have spent much more than we have gained
353647 this is an investment in our future and as such will not yield immediate results we need to look for the return 10 even 15 years down the road
353648 democracy is the theory that the people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard

353650 uh its not playing right now anak but yes we will watch when it does come out in the theater
353651 thats okay i think she appreciated the fact that people werent all over her treating her like a celebrity
353652 the smallest thing could happen and they report it to us which we really appreciate
353653 we of course review it and want to know corrective action has been taken
353654 we are sad to hear of the apparent death of this gentleman mr al masri and we extend our condolences to his family
353655 i say that because we have not completely established the circumstances or the facts of whats happened here
353656 the death of a father and husband is a tragedy for all those people who are left behind
353657 however we emphasise the fact that even if the person has spent some time in australia this does not mean that australia is responsible for all events that may befall them in the future
353658 welcome to spanish ii according to the world almanac and book of facts 2001 three hundred twenty two million five hundred eighty thousand people around the world speak spanish as their first language after you finish this course you will be number 422 580 001

353660 we suffered 11 soldiers killed and 20 wounded and the terrorists lost seven killed and 27 wounded
353661 weve seen record growth in the number of solar rebate applications lodged since the government acted on budget night to better target the rebate to those earning less than 100 000
353662 an average of 522 applications have been lodged weekly since the budget with 794 in one week alone
353663 this confirms that the government took the right step in bringing funds forward for this program and ensuring that they go to those australian families that most need financial assistance to install solar systems in their homes
353664 despite the scaremongering of the opposition in the 10 weeks since the budget we have seen continuing solid demand for this program and i am confident that will continue
353665 some industry sources believe mr garrett will soon announce the government will increase the means test on the solar panel rebate program from 100 000 to 150 000
353666 this will not scrap the means test simply tweak it
353667 but this would still be a bad result for australias solar industry and for home owners wanting to install solar panels
353668 it still makes it harder for many people who want to install solar in their homes it would still treat the rebate as welfare not a positive incentive to boost the renewable sector in australia
353669 todays release of the figures is especially timely as hundreds of representatives from the solar pv industry including installers distributors and dealers are in melbourne to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing the industry nationally
353670 the rebate scheme particularly in the last two years has allowed the industry to build capacity and capability
353671 yes we know youre a good reference because you have a lot of links
353672 they were given two weeks the two weeks is up this weekend
353673 we will see what iran does in two weeks but i think the diplomatic process now has a new kind of energy to it
353674 if they do not decide to suspend then we will be in a situation where we have to return to the security council

353686 business people who think they can bribe their way into contracts with school systems and government agencies face the risk of being caught and convicted
353687 our investigations into public corruption do not end with the conviction of the public officials we seek to investigate and prosecute the business people who pay bribes and join the corrupt conspiracies in this case we have already convicted the recipients of harris bribes and now he too will go to prison
353688 todays guilty verdict demonstrates the departments resolve to hold accountable individuals who subvert the competitive process and frustrate efforts to help our nations economically disadvantaged school children
353689 a state where it hasnt been in the past four years because we face a situation where things have happened in the recent past which were unfortunate

353694 when i heard the bobcat it didnt bother me because its just nature
353695 it bothers me that there are kids in this neighborhood and people with other pets im worried the bobcat could harm them
353696 it definitely had the characteristics of being a bobcat that did it
353697 cats are normally pretty secretive about what they do they dont leave very many signs and normally are only out at night
353698 unless you get one cornered or they happen to be sick
353699 remember the bobcat is more scared of you than you are of him
353700 it is not normal to see this happen to a domesticated animal
353701 really mattered at a time when every other word out of other comedians mouths did not begin with f
353702 whoever welcomes you welcomes me and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me whoever welcomes a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophets reward and whoever welcomes a righteous person in the name of a righteous person will receive the reward of the righteous and whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones in the name of a disciple truly i tell you none of these will lose their reward
353703 we banked my income for nine months to see if we could live on my husbands income alone
353704 i had it down to the penny that i could stay home for five months i was home for five years
353705 we learned to conserve to distinguish between wants and needs and to buy smart when we shopped
353706 we started a 30 day challenge to eat at home
353707 for us eating out became more of a lifestyle than a treat
353708 we did it more to break the habit than to save money
353709 its much cheaper than going to a restaurant and we have the added benefit of sharing a meal with our family and friends without the cost of hosting a gathering all by ourselves
353710 i go straight home after work whatever i need to get done i do it on the way home and i dont go back out
353711 children grow so fast and the local and regional consignment sales really only feature clothes and toys in excellent condition
353712 i seldom buy brand new childrens clothing off the rack and when i do it is usually off season and on clearance youd be amazed how much money you can save
353713 i know as the children get older ill have a harder time shopping consignment sales
353714 but look how much i will have saved in the meantime
353715 why would i want to buy something new when a perfectly good used item is readily available
353716 when i first started consigning it was really more about saving money and trying to stay home with my children
353717 now its more about the bigger picture living within your means and thinking about your familys consumption habits is something we can all do
353718 and it can make a real difference for the planet thats something else i can do for my girls
353719 the girls love it its nice and cool in the theater and its free
353720 just because youre trying to save money doesnt mean you cant still have fun
353721 its important that you dont feel overly deprived because it can really break your momentum and cause you to lose sight of your goals

353725 i submitted a film called ogre its basically a reimagining of troll 2s plot
353726 i really wasnt sure on how well it would be received i mean there were some really good ones and i was really suprised we actually won
353727 but the best part is that they asked us to bring our monster down there and after they screened ogre they whipped up a tarp and they had the ogre standing underneath it and the host walked up to it with his microphone and said how does it feel to be here and all that and it puked for everybody it was just so cool not only to hear my film getting a lot of laughs but the monster itself i made
353728 sometimes i go and question whether i want to go ahead and be a filmmaker but i was standing inside the ogre and animating it while the ogre was being screened and hearing everyone laugh it was just so cool i told myself i need to be a filmmaker

353741 i have nothing but respect for the work of halas croslin in the baseball betting field but we must proceed with caution and consider all ideas on the table if we blindly accept the work of a few thinkers without questioning the validity of their thought we are all wasting our time
353742 the research from the vanveldhuize wartenberg inc group is ground breaking but at the same time solidifies a number of ideas that have been prolierated in the baseball betting community now for years i for one am going to purchase the book attend the seminar and join in every conference discussion i can
353743 i agree that facts must be checked and analysis must be scrutinized but at the same time i do trust the work of the vixay zayas llc group that has slaved away for nearly a decade now developing cornerstone theories in modern baseball betting thinking
353744 i firmly believe that moving forward we must keep an optimistic view point and liberal stance in these baseball betting matters if we lean back too much and stay conservative were going to remain in the dark ages forever and will not be able to continue to modernize our views i follow the comments of ith schissel and batko hanner from the second panel
353745 but not me and with the work of naji llarena to guide us forward i think things will become a lot cleared in the baseball betting community
353746 ive been working in the baseball betting field for years now and just expanded my operations to the internet sales have doubled in no time
353747 there are five essential points in this baseball betting study that are key
353748 i enjoy quilting because its relaxing its my expression of art and it just takes me back to good family memories with my mother and grandmother

353781 but thats their decision its a weird situation to be in you just have to deal with it somehow and figure out a way to come in ready to play every day
353782 its about time we give them their due respect especially burriss
353783 its been a weird year in the sense that they said they were going to go young early on and then some guys didnt pan out so veteran guys got a chance to play and we played pretty well
353784 we ended up hanging around the race for a while because our division wasnt as strong as it was perceived to be
353785 i think all in all all the veteran guys who werent supposed to play played probably better than people expected

353808 i am crucified with christ and so is everyone else
353809 that ye should not obey the truth is not even in the original paul was reminding them in this verse that the gospel is centered in the crucifixion in what galatians 3 2 this only would i learn of you received ye the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith 3 are ye so foolish having begun in the spirit are ye now made perfect by the flesh
353810 god would justify the heathen through faith i agree that our justification comes from faith and there is only one person who ever lived that had that kind of faith can you guess who that was galatians3 10 for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse for it is written cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them how many who serve the law are under a curse as many as serve the law why are you under a curse because you cant do all the things it requires how many people today who attend organized religion are living up to what they are taught they must do to be ok with god why have so many good people left the church did they leave the church or did they leave the curse now if you place yourself under the law how much of it are you to follow all things which are written in the book of the law am i saying there shouldnt be rules in the church absolutely not but the rules should have nothing whatsoever to do with your acceptance by god but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of god it is evident for the just shall live by faith 12 and the law is not of faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them

353831 een opvallend gegeven is dat de senaat zeer geheimzinnig doet over die begroting
353832 voor de buitenwereld is ze niet beschikbaar en alleen senatoren quaestoren mogen de inhoud ervan kennen
353833 de kostprijs van de senaat staat niet in verhouding tot haar politieke gewicht
353834 opvallend is dat de ene federale wetgevende vergadering veel duurder is dan de andere bovendien beschikt de senaat over een gigantische pensioenkas

353844 with 29 of respondents stating that they experienced the leakage of employee or customer data in 2007 it is alarming to see that only 11 of those types of incidents went reported

353863 i am perfect what do i need to forgive myself for
353864 we can put two and two together in our minds
353865 the most impeachable administration in the history of america because of the way that it has clearly violated the law
353866 invite our friends from across the floor to cross over and take over putrajaya
353867 since merdeka in 1957 until now this is the lowest point in our politics our image is the worst it has ever been the economy has no direction the world is laughing at us newspapers from indonesia thailand london america and the arab world are all publishing news of how bad things have become here
353868 they do this to me because i dare to stand up for the people and expose corruption in the government because i am seen as a challenger to them they say if you dare to challenge us these are the methods we will use because i am anwar ibrahim up to now i have not seen the police report accusing me of sodomy why because they have the report number but it has no contents so they can change it according to whatever statements i make
353869 they are saying he is not a specialist that he is not a sodomy doctor now the newspapers in england are writing that the worlds only sodomy doctor can be found in malaysia where is there such a thing as a sodomy or backside doctor
353870 have i not been dishonoured enough how about how azizah and my children feel if you have proof i will fight it now they dont have anything no witnesses and instead they detain the doctor for three days according to their whim and fancy
353871 why then was i made to fill up a rape victims report at the hospital
353872 next month when i want to contest the by election they might charge me with something else when we are going to putrajaya another
353873 anwar has betrayed himself and the very people who support him he was a strong advocate of the new economic policy now he wants to abolish it granted there are corrupt politicians but why should we abolish the nep which is the basis of our constitutional rights
353874 anwar also tried to dilute islam whereas he proclaimed himself to be a champion of the religion why because he wanted to have the non malay support and well he got it in the last general election
353875 even if umno doesnt want me as the candidate for permatang pauh im willing to be in the constituency day and night to campaign for bn as well as to strip anwar of his populist claims
353876 if i contest im going to be the underdog i know its difficult to unseat anwar in his former constituency but its not about winning or losing its having the opportunity to face anwar and to tell the voters that they have been duped by the very man they revered
353877 if you notice anwar doesnt talk much about saiful actually its just a case between him and saiful who claimed that anwar had victimised him but anwar would rather tell his supporters that it is a battle between him and the government he must always be seen as a great man
353878 anwar has gone overboard he crossed the line and lost the statesmanship anwar lost all these in his pursuit for power
353879 people are not stupid even pas leaders have realised that i know there is a lot of resentment against anwar and pkr especially in selangor where the party is governing
353880 i know some people have accused pak lah of being politically weak but i see a strong resolve in that man he is serious about fighting corruption i might be wrong about the pm but at least he gives me the space to do something right for the country
353881 i will do it thats my commitment to umno if we dont clean up the party from bad elements how are going to reform society
353882 if you ask me what kind of image i want
353883 all the time he tried to poison my mind on anwars character he claimed to know anwar inside out
353884 i joined umno because of anwar ibrahim and left umno because of anwar ibrahim
353885 guidebooks help but most of our bookings come through internet listings on websites like hostelworld com
353886 what we get are stopovers they are either going to or from australia singapore and bangkok and they take in kl for an average of three to four days
353887 there still are pimps and all that but they dont cause problems for the rest of us the real trouble is drug addicts when we first started they were occupying all the abandoned houses here in fact the restaurant next door is a godsend as it has displaced the addicts but theyre still around the jaga kereta illegal carpark attendants who extort money from those who park here and if they cant get enough for their fix they will resort to stealing
353888 i prefer to have the dogs as they will let you know if there are strangers in the night
353889 i got into this after practising law and then working in advertising because this is what i really like
353890 we actually do get guests who arrive in suits and i have to ask you do realise this is a budget hostel right
353891 these were all homes and we set up shop here on the five foot way where im standing now was a drain but dbkl built an additional brick sidewalk
353892 come at 5am and see if i have business or not
353893 he doesnt use any chemicals or whatever and the fruit only comes according to the season
353894 we budget hotels help each other out but some of the big players with a lot of money have been opening three or four hostels and paying very high rental theyre spoiling the market
353895 plans to become prime minister could be derailed even though he wins the by election
353896 a by election win will give him a firmer national footing but will not resolve the numerous challenges he faces
353897 he enters the by election with a mixed bag political victory is propelling him forward but the sodomy allegation and possible arrest are setback that will impact on the voters
353898 the plan for me to become prime minister by sept 16 malaysia day is on track
353899 the sodomy allegation will be the key issue in the by election
353900 anwar is hoping a victory will vindicate him before the people whatever the verdict of a future court it would be a spectacular propaganda coup if he is charged and he goes on to win
353901 it shouldnt happen they have taken six years of not only anwars life but our lives too
353902 but i think probably i also had the image that is not tainted as a wife of a minister and the deputy prime minister i dont think there were stories about me i am pretty much clean
353903 she was 17 she is my first born daughter all i heard was suddenly she was out of the country it wasnt told to me where she was going and what she was going to do
353904 i suddenly found out she was not at home and was overseas as a mother i felt worried i was already worried about her father i have to worry about her thats how i felt it was a bit difficult emotionally but after that i accepted it
353905 when i contested the first time they knew it was because anwar was in prison and when i contested the second time too because of the same reason and in 2008 anwar couldnt contest
353906 i wasnt really a fulltime housewife i was also a patron of many societies doing charity and voluntary work and i enjoy that sometimes of course i miss it because i like simple life
353907 its obvious what has happened here you dont need to be a rocket scientist
353908 i dont think malaysia can afford to have a prime minister who has a huge question mark hanging over his head is he or not involved in the murder of this girl
353909 desperate and pathetic attempt to discredit and taint my political image
353910 a good word is disgust whether its sodomy or blowing up the mongolian lady

353939 it should be emphasized that luther is perfectly content to allow the natural law and righteousness that comes by faith to stand side by side

353996 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
353997 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
353998 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
353999 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
354000 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
354001 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
354002 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
354003 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
354004 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
354005 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
354006 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc

354029 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
354030 we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain who has fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
354031 weve seen this happen before and were not going to let it happen to us
354032 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
354033 were not going negative in return were refuting the charges
354034 its a great ad and everybodys talking about it and were having a great time with it
354035 any device capable of storing information in digital or analog form
354036 written materials commonly referred to as pocket trash or pocket litter
354037 theyre saying they can rifle through all the information in a travelers laptop without having a smidgen of evidence that the traveler is breaking the law
354038 dont establish any criteria for whose computer can be searched
354039 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
354040 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
354041 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
354042 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed
354043 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
354044 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
354045 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
354046 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
354047 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
354048 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
354049 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
354050 i respect and admire sen obama we just have stark differences
354051 campaigns are tough but im proud of the campaign we have run
354052 im proud of the issues we have tried to address with the american people all i can say is we are proud of that commercial
354053 we can most assuredly tell you that voters around the country do not think theres anything substantive about this latest ad do not think its something that john mccain should be proud of
354054 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
354055 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
354056 this is another clever way to masquerade airfare increases without increasing airfares
354057 thats always been our philosophy and its one that works well with us

354061 the theme of the gala will focus on celebrating diversity and promoting cultural awareness
354062 surrogates and high profile supporters have their place in the campaign
354063 they can help draw crowds raise money and communicate enthusiasm for the campaign like every other asset they need to be leveraged carefully
354064 celebrities are coming onboard because theyre excited about obama like the rest of america
354065 anyone who knows and listens to barack obama doesnt think hes empty headed
354066 yes we would charge you because you gave permission for that establishment to charge your account

354069 i havent seen a real yoda yet mom have you
354070 the evidence were receiving from right across the country be it cornwall london or the north east england is that solicitors are not receiving a hip when the deal is struck
354071 you would have expected that the hip would be available immediately the agreement to accept an offer is reached
354072 were not getting a hip until three to four weeks later sometimes not until exchange of contracts
354073 sellers dont see the point of them they certainly dont want the aggravation of putting them together and nobody wants to pay the cost in what is a flat market
354074 about 130 000 houses went onto the market in may but only 89 000 hips were commissioned
354075 some of that shortfall would have been made up by people who sacked their first estate agent because they failed to sell the house and instructed a new agent they dont need to commission a hip
354076 however we think about 15 000 people put their house on the market without first commissioning a hip
354077 if i had the choice now i wouldnt buy a hip i cant see what value it has
354078 ive had a hip in place since november and it hasnt helped us sell the house at all nobodys ever asked to see it although weve told them that there is one available
354079 the home information pack itself the majority of the information is quite technical like title like searches and its not really for the interest of the individual consumer
354080 buying a home is still quite an emotional decision the idea is that once youve made that emotional decision youve chosen the house you want to buy and you turn to your professional adviser your conveyancer a whole pile of the information they need is already available for them
354081 we dont have the exact details at the moment on the nature of the disagreement
354082 i approached the rockford diocese about a catholic parish in sugar grove eight years ago
354083 the diocese acknowledged that it would be a good location based on growth projection but the money wasnt there now the rich family has stepped up to make the project move ahead having a religious choice will add to the quality of life in sugar grove

354132 the government directly benefits from the remittances of ofws through taxes such as the 0 15 documentary stamp tax collected in every transaction for every billion dollars remitted monthly the government earns 1 5m or p62m this is aside from other fees charged to the ofws before leaving the country
354133 banks and private business also rake in gargantuan profits for every 200 remittance sent monthly 15 22 is charged as service fee for 10 million ofws sending remittances banks earn a staggering 1b every month
354134 thousands of ofws experience oppressive working conditions and human rights abuses abroad thousands are stranded in different countries and many are in death row while proclaiming them as bagong bayanis new heroes the arroyo government continues to neglect the plight of ofws
354135 in fact they have to tighten their belts abroad so that they do not need to lessen the 200 they send to their families at home but due to skyrocketing prices in the philippines this amount is simply not enough
354136 to remove the documentary stamp tax from remittances of ofws to give them greater purchasing power amid this time of skyrocketing prices of food and transport
354137 at present for every remittance an ofw makes a dst of 0 15 is collected by the government to some the imposition may be miniscule and insignificant but to ofws and their families such imposition becomes another financial burden
354138 increased significantly with chicken already at p120 per kilo beef brisket at p180 per kilo pork liempo at p170 per kilo and bangus and tilapia at p80 p90 per kilo all of which have increased by an average of p10 compared to the prices in 2007
354139 every peso saved can make a big difference for the average filipino family removing the dst from ofw remittances can enable the families of overseas workers to buy additional food or save this amount for other purposes
354140 ironically a weaker dollar has also led to less purchasing power of ofws money when their earnings are spent locally
354141 as if high prices of oil and rice were not enough even the currency that our ofws earn in has diminished in value we need to give these new heroes the support that they need and deserve understanding their great contribution to our economy

354228 for many years the product was associated with happy times especially to people my age

354237 the visit of the president has been scheduled and when the president left the situation as far as the typhoon is concerned was still in its development stage
354238 i was thankful to be there when frank came and left behind a trail of destruction and misery and to experience and see the extent of the damage after the winds and rain subsided i was one of the first passengers to leave iloilo to make my report to the president personally before her excellency left for that very important state visit to the us

354247 do we really have to ask people to vote out of anger personally i believe people should be encouraged to calm down and vote objectively vote for people who they think would make their lives better most of the time there is really no good or sound decision coming out of anger and other negative emotions
354248 a lot of good things came out of this world because some people became angry
354249 how dou you explain then a man winning p120 million in lotto
354250 that is what the media should do asking the right questions from the right people
354251 shes becoming too fantastic and preposterous to be dignified with answers

354255 en cuanto al aspecto deportivo si es bueno porque los rivales estadounidenses te exigen ya que su nivel futbol stico ha subido mucho
354256 cuando arranca el superliga los equipos mexicanos estamos pr cticamente en pretemporada una vez iniciado este torneo en estados unidos tambi n estamos iniciando nuestro torneo apertura 2008 mientras que equipos estadounidenses est n en plena competencia a la mitad de su torneo
354257 yo pienso que no son malos los torneos en s en realidad los que quedan a deber y por mucho es el arbitraje que esta muy por debajo de lo que es el superliga
354258 no lo justific ni los aplaudimos ni estoy de acuerdo en que haya este tipo de situaciones ya que eso puede provocar mayor violencia en las tribunas y se puede crear un problema m s grave si en este caso los rbitros no aplican el reglamento y la justicia de manera equitativa
354259 en alg n momento alguien va a reaccionar en forma negativa por esas injusticias insisto estamos apenados
354260 no s s de mayor manera que a nosotros y es evidente que como ser humano y como jugador con esas injusticias y omisiones arbitrales si reaccionas
354261 nosotros queremos seguir con el buen paso que logramos en el primer partido el s bado anterior contra toluca
354262 si ayer mi rcoles no se consigui el pase a la final del superliga pero el equipo jug bien
354263 muy bien arreola por eso lo puse ayer quiz es darle demasiada responsabilidad cuando lo pongo desde el inicio del partido ante new england pero talento capacidad facultades todo lo tiene sobre todo personalidad y eso me llama mucho la atenci n y es de destacarse
354264 arreola ha demostrado madurez en lo futbol stico y en lo emocional porque sabe encauzar bien la presi n cuando va de titular o cuando entra de cambio y l ha asunido bien ese compromiso

354267 for the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed but my kindness shall not depart from thee
354268 but when the kindness of our savior and his love for mankind appeared he saved us not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness but according to his mercy
354269 and be kind to one another tenderhearted forgiving each other just as god in christ also has forgiven you
354270 thats what he ate thats all he had to offer
354271 hmmm im in the mood for something special tonight how about turkey style
354272 to be a detective you have to be able to detect you must be able to notice things such as distinguishing features and oddities such as scars and so forth
354273 of course he has only one eye in this picture its a profile of his face youre dismissed
354274 what about you notice anything unusual or outstanding about this man
354275 didnt you hear what i just told the other lady this is a profile of the mans face of course you can only see one ear youre excused too
354276 all right did you notice anything distinguishing or unusual about this man
354277 youre absolutely right his bio says he wears contacts how in the world could you tell that by looking at his picture

354285 so if you have everything you need i shall lock you out here so that you wont be disturbed
354286 i have to congratulate you madam i think you are the first woman to swim in public in all saudi arabia
354287 no a big revolution i dont think you realise how big
354288 so since youve screened it all off does that mean i dont have to wear an abaya
354289 silence means consent doesnt it everyone has a chance to voice opposition
354290 oh my god did brandon just piss on the floor is he ok
354291 people ask why do you do it how could you not people are so happy
354292 theyll bring you in and make you feel like youre part of the family
354293 theyre not going to see it sitting in the driveway
354294 they were so appreciative you couldnt help but invite them back
354295 a lot of people could learn from dorothy and art
354296 sanctions imposed on iran for its nuclear programme are of a political nature and should be promptly removed
354297 there are some things going on that i cant talk about
354298 i dont think im free to say whether i have gotten a letter or not
354299 a person as to whom the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial evidence linking him or her to the commission of a crime and who in the judgment of the prosecutor is a putative defendant
354300 are you the one they talk about so much going to college
354301 its very very helpful to have a student in the class who along with me remembers lyndon johnson and his presidency who remembers nixon who remembers jimmy carter
354302 younger students have read about and heard about it but they havent lived through those administrations and all the things that occurred then joann offers a very welcome perspective shes lived long enough to see a great deal
354303 i dont have that many more years to live and i want to do good for humanity while im here
354304 the best left tackle i ever saw play the game
354305 gary was the best left tackle i ever saw play the game
354306 he was a mans man he looked like you could bounce a medicine ball off his chest
354307 you put him out there at left tackle and you never had to give him any help when john developed that confidence in him he felt almost as if he could ignore anybody coming from that side because they werent going to get to him obviously that propelled us to the next level
354308 i asked him what happened and he just said football
354309 i think if i hadnt said something to him to start the conversation we probably never would have spoken
354310 the problem is ive got too much to say for once in my life
354311 thats whats really bizarre ive got so many people to thank and so many people who made a difference in my career and a few little funny stories along the way ive got to whittle it down
354312 a lot of people dont understand gary is a very intelligent guy and hell have some things to say that nobody would ever expect him to talk about
354313 zim will be zim but id be surprised if he isnt one of the more interesting guys who gives his speech
354314 the shoulders have always been my problem but the last few years its been my hip its to the point where my shoulders dont bug me anymore because the hip has taken over the pain
354315 its just gradually getting worse to where i cant fight it off much longer
354316 its hard at first but it became a thing of pride for me not to let an injury stop me from playing once you start doing it you can never give in because the first time you give in its over
354317 i honestly thought when he got back from that trip he would never get on a plane again
354318 but he literally got off that plane and while we were still in the airport told me he was going to take flying lessons
354319 once he decides he wants something or tries to do something theres no stopping him
354320 it was a reality check for gary but it also inspired him even more
354321 i hear people who are bulimic they see themselves as fat when i was playing i saw myself as not good enough so i always tried to be better i could watch people and think they did a good job but then watch myself and i was like kind of embarrassed so i tried to work harder
354322 the hawaii thing getting measured for his bronze bust didnt really hit me but when the guy came out here with the blob of clay that was when it was like its real
354323 i had to pay extra for the makeover the standard package was just mr potato head i had to pay for some hair
354324 im not really a jewelry type of guy so an old rusty nut is pretty cool
354325 im going to be a hand model like george on seinfeld
354326 it will be like that commercial where the guy is boring everybody and the kid holds up a sign that reads the end
354327 i felt like a little chihuahua walking down the street with him
354328 i almost had to run to keep up with him because of his long legs
354329 you could tell he was excited and honored and flattered
354330 he didnt have an attitude well its about time im in the hall of fame he still seemed surprised and pleased
354331 its up to everybodys interpretation but zim next to john elway was the most valuable player on that team
354332 that to me was telling zim youre not done yet this is the ring you get because we need you back it was ownerships way of saying how much they appreciated him and wanted him and needed him
354333 i dont spend a lot of time scouting players but it was very clear to me he was the pre eminent left tackle in the game
354334 his strength and athleticism were exceptional he understood the game and was as tough as i have ever seen he was a classic left tackle and very deserving of his election to the hall of fame
354335 his shoulder was out of joint and i told him to stay out hes not going back in he said oh yes i am im not going out until no 7 goes out and he played the whole second half we took john out with a couple of minutes left and thats when zim went out that gives you an idea how tough he is
354336 you know you really need to acknowledge that you have people living beings sitting out here waiting to talk to you
354337 im not doing nothing here im working online we will get to you in the order in which you came in
354338 oh so how long after number 101 is number 904
354339 well the numbers arent in sequence they have to do with what your particular problem might be
354340 asterisk you see here you have asterisk next to name no stimulus package this year we apply money to your taxes next year
354341 you wouldnt utilize it on a six story office building in dallas but if you were building a 50 story office building then you would get the real benefit
354342 it carries with it not just weight but a fair amount of concern
354343 we had relatively minute flaw sizes in them things that wouldnt concern you on a smaller piece of steel
354344 what the joneses are really trying to do for the entry areas is make them look as monolithic and transparent as possible
354345 when youre looking at the main entry they want to be able to see through that and see into the stadium
354346 you can truly see what something looks like as if the glass wasnt there
354347 its not that unemployment is rising because a lot of people are coming into the labor force
354348 people will absolutely shut off the spending spigots given the soured jobs market
354349 and really what matters in the end is whats taking place in payrolls and the unemployment rate and theyre both moving in the direction of a labor market recession how can you argue with that
354350 its easy to see why consumer spending is expected to remain weak through the summer if not the rest of the year
354351 im an apple im high in vitamins im good food for the whole body
354352 im a banana im high in potassium im good food for the whole body
354353 wow that is very impressive little jimmy okay whos next
354354 made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops seems the pentagon wouldnt allow him to bring cameras
354355 and we got notice that he would be treated as a campaign person and it would therefore be perceived as political because he had endorsed my candidacy but he wasnt on the senate staff that triggered then a concern that maybe our visit was going to be perceived as political and the last thing that i want to do is have injured soldiers and the staff at these wonderful institutions having to sort through whether this is political or not or get caught in the crossfire between campaigns
354356 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research
354357 belum ada fakta dan bukti baru yang bisa menjerat ketiganya sebagai tersangka
354358 we dont want to frighten people we want them to take precautions
354359 recently i have become aware of the growing body of literature linking long term cell phone use to possible adverse health effects including cancer
354360 although the evidence is still controversial i am convinced that there are sufficient data to warrant issuing an advisory to share some precautionary advice on cell phone use
354361 my own take on all the available reports is that they suggest a problem to be concerned about
354362 fancying people and not knowing what to do about it
354363 tosh is learning about herself coming out of her shell shes a late bloomer
354364 we were losing a team member and a part of our torchwood family
354365 you dont know a hell of a lot about him
354366 when we first met him he was not a very likable person
354367 im going to be an action hero i might get my own figure i love science fiction
354368 i thought they had far too much time on their hands
354369 therell be a ticking clock a big event and it will push the torchwood team into new territory

354373 i would love to play captain america my manager probably just sent an e mail to the studio to let them know
354374 if you buy my book the story is in there its called anything goes and it did
354375 it created a tremendous buzz when it was shown in britain
354376 that was russell saying what would happen if i press every button at once
354377 said moffat who came to town with julie gardner the bbcs controller of drama commissioning and an outgoing executive producer of
354378 no use pretending its not art house its not even authored in a way its a big massive brand a bbc brand the most important show
354379 the interesting question is where to place it for that family audience
354380 it does moderately well for the sci fi channel but it transmits for a 9 p m slot which it isnt written or made for
354381 you know what were pleased with the way its been performing for us
354382 mmmm impressive but no thanks i already have a sharpie
354383 youre not special youre not powerful youre not connected youre not clever youre not important
354384 my familys worried ive got alzheimers but i know i havent
354385 when little children try to eat you run away from them
354386 the choice of a pro abortion catholic for vice president would deal a major blow to any efforts by the obama campaign to reach out to catholic voters
354387 both the bishops and the laity continue to wrestle with the scandal of prominent catholic politicians who support abortion and the choice of a pro abortion catholic running mate would amount to scratching at a deep and festering wound in the american catholic church
354388 let us go forth to lead the land we love asking his blessing and his help but knowing that here on earth gods work must truly be our own
354389 when we all regardless of our particular religious convictions draw our guidance and inspiration and really in a sense moral direction from the same general area the bible the old and the new testaments we have every reason to believe that our various religious denominations should live together in the closest harmony
354390 the basic presumption of the moral law the existence of god mans relationship to him there is generally consensus on those questions
354391 backfired a nation born for religious tolerance no longer tolerates religion
354392 this was not the cheerful peppy 3 4 beat of a full mariachi band just one young man clad in a level expression and all black clothes carrying on in a strong and steady voice
354393 the ministry in charge of public assistance scheme chose not to be interviewed for this peice
354394 i will firmly take emergency measures for people who are seriously affected by abnormal oil prices
354395 i will also carry out flexible economic management by closely watching prices of commodities
354396 based on the firm alliance between japan and the united states i will contribute to the formation of open diplomacy in order to work together with asia pacific countries
354397 we hope he will tackle pressing policy issues head on and show bold leadership when implementing policy
354398 the prime minister is standing on an extremely severe position
354399 i think in the current socioeconomic situation its the time to carry out policies
354400 peoples concerns about oil and food prices continue to grow while he has to show responsible prospects for social security and tax reforms
354401 we want to pay attention to the positive impact of aso who is said to be popular on his administration
354402 thus while the lottery is a significant source of revenue it has never been nor will be the primary source of school funding
354403 projects move really quickly once the steel work begins and people start to see the building come into form so weve seen some heads turn as folks drive by
354404 by late fall we hope to be putting the facade and windows up and then youll really have a good idea how its going to look
354405 we couldnt have everyone moving in here at once so we staggered our construction of the training facility and parking deck to be done several months ahead of the headquarters
354406 before long well be completely under roof and putting the finishing touches on the inside so it can be used as soon as possible
354407 that just doesnt happen with a project like this you usually get one or the other
354408 you cant go around building police stations every five years
354409 ja kvorums netiek sav kts vair kums grib saglab t o saeimu
354410 for us its so different from waianae going out into honolulu is also a culture shock for us sometimes
354411 i mean we had a high schooler who just graduated that taught final cut pro to a bunch of adults who are also trainers themselves at the media centers they work at and for him it was a boost of confidence this trip was a boost of confidence for all of us
354412 we can tell them you know you guys are good but it doesnt mean as much until youre on the front line and youre experiencing it oh my god im amazed at what youre able to teach me thank you so much
354413 and then we introduce the hawaiian values the hawaiian culture to give them grounding and foundation so that no matter where they go in life theyre grounded and theyre confident
354414 this is an actual monster some sort of rodent like creature with a dinosaur beak a government animal testing facility is close by
354415 but unless the government is trying to design horrible montauk monsters that will eat i e d s and fart fire at bad iraqis were not sure why they would create such an unthinkable beast
354416 i ate one of those things once they dont taste bad
354417 this is exactly how i imagine karl rove looks on the inside
354418 the montauk monster lives a productive life as a beaked pig on a beach in montauk
354419 in photos there appeared to be a beak it was just a tricky angle its a dead raccoon thats what it s its undoubtedly a raccoon the same teeth paws the right size
354420 a lady i spent 12 years with shes seen it a lady i spent six years with shes seen it everybody that im around experiences no matter where i live
354421 this thing has never hurt me at all people get used it everybody gets used to it
354422 a lot of it could be a lot of imagination because i know that the bed was not wet and it was in my head i dont know
354423 but i felt it too and your clothes were wet i was soaking wet
354424 the clothes he was in he took them off and the next morning they were still wet you could wring water out of them
354425 everybody whos looked at it so far knows its not smoke smoke is not that white
354426 principle of habeas corpus that a state cant just hold you for any reason without charging you and without giving you any kind of due process thats the essence of who we are
354427 i mean you remember during the nuremberg trials part of what made us different was even after these nazis had performed atrocities that no one had ever seen before we still gave them a day in court and that taught the entire world about who we are but also the basic principles of rule of law now the supreme court upheld that principle
354428 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
354429 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
354430 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
354431 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
354432 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
354433 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
354434 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
354435 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
354436 represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning
354437 do you think you are better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago if you arent better off can you afford another four years
354438 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
354439 it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down your own debt
354440 a treatment is a conscious movement of thought there is no hocus pocus in mental treatment it is definite conscious concrete and explicit
354441 unitarian universalists with our long history standing resolutely for social justice are frequent targets of threats and hate crimes
354442 weve had our share of nasty calls over the years
354443 we believe he was in the woods and near our officers who were also in the woods all night
354444 i feel bad about those other people that got killed
354445 my friend had to work otherwise we would have still been there
354446 theres a saying up here that this is a great place to raise kids
354447 im going crazy here i wish theyd tell me something
354448 these apartments low to moderate housing are for good hard working people who dont make as much as others in gurnee
354449 he has been dodging his responsibility on that property for more than 25 years
354450 first and foremost we have a duty to follow the law
354451 our obligation is to issue the permit if plans have been submitted in substantial detail and weve done that
354452 because otherwise we dont think hes going to do anything
354453 were not going to sit around and do nothing while this guy pulls down property values around him
354454 its an unsafe condition and i dont want it to continue
354455 sad to lose a lawyer of such skill determination and professionalism
354456 theres not a lot of extra financial support coming in from any group to help us with the project
354457 any type of initiative from the state from the federal government would help
354458 i went into this thinking about my class i came out thinking about the big picture
354459 i regret that you bought into the expletive deleted of the blagojevich people
354460 he seems to be working behind the scenes to kill the capital bill
354461 hes vulgar with the teamsters he wont return former speaker denny hasterts calls it just shows how hes just isolated and a coalition of one
354462 its important to note the governors office has not disputed the substance of the letters
354463 why they think they can take advantage of it i dont know if anything that demonstrates how confused they are
354464 the idea is im not going to sleep until i sell this property
354465 i doubt well break even so this is going to be a very costly learning experience
354466 i didnt have the crystal ball to see the downturn in real estate
354467 we think were on the cutting edge of this and could be on to something
354468 our pipeline of single family residential is up 30 percent this year
354469 people are seeing falling prices and an investment that wont be recouped
354470 the longer they hold it the worse off they are
354471 i think she has a very good chance of selling even in this market
354472 once the public is more educated youre going to see more of this
354473 it will be a long time to build back what we lost
354474 its been a mountain of headaches but im in the same boat as a lot of people
354475 i probably would not have done that either pursue a graduate degree had i not participated in junior senior scholars
354476 i would have probably have gone to a community college or i would have started at a public school and have not done so great
354477 they have a lot of outcomes they purpose for those students
354478 those students are choosing more selective colleges than they might have done on their own
354479 its been an extraordinary experience both for our college students and the students from the community its been life enriching
354480 one of the wonderful things about this program is that it has been ongoing
354481 it got to the point that everyone wanted to be a junior scholar
354482 the support they had for me motivated me somebody cared i didnt want to let them down
354483 one thing ive learned through education you can make your dreams come true
354484 just to have that college experience is more than words can say
354485 this program is what got me started thinking of bilingual education
354486 it also gave me the desire to work with high needs students
354487 if you are willing to give the time and effort you end by receiving the reward the smiles and the hugs
354488 the kids know its going to be a lot of extra work thats something they want to be part of or dont want to be part of
354489 parents who come from impoverished communities have many many economic challenges that take them away from the home and their children
354490 but these are parents who love their children dearly and want the best for them
354491 this program has done more than their actual high school to get them in college
354492 they feel if they can do it i can too
354493 the road will always have one lane open in each direction but of course people should avoid that area during this time if they can
354494 its probably been 15 or 20 years since that portion of the road has been repaved
354495 we all cross bridges and im not talking about metaphors
354496 i still dont go over the mississippi here in minnesota that i dont look down and remember and pray
354497 i thought id be able to keep my composure but no such luck
354498 i think that my dad can help me now more than he ever could before
354499 its going to be a celebration of life but i also think its going to be a remembrance of what people went through
354500 i think were going to get an opportunity to feel some of that
354501 weve undergone this whole transformation to make fitness fun and user friendly
354502 wheeling is so diverse and thats what drew me to the company

354510 i didnt get engaged in wheaton until i moved my business into town when i began frequenting the businesses in downtown i found a sense of community i didnt know existed anymore
354511 from a cultural standpoint the mural addresses the general culture of wheaton
354512 we thought it would be a nice community project that would engage people
354513 we already knew a lot of kids that played in the pickups
354514 we leave a lot up to the captains to schedule and report scores
354515 we dont have reserved fields so we put the scheduling up to the captains
354516 wed like this to be a diverse group that is reflective of the community
354517 he was the kind of teacher that the kids really wanted
354518 he respected his students and he made them feel important
354519 a brand new community where everyone had moved out from chicago
354520 i am eager to partner with primary principal lori casey the staff and the parents in our joint quest to provide each child with a safe and exciting learning environment
354521 its a really exciting thing to do at least for me
354522 your knees are knocking together after youre all done i mean youve got that investment up there that 500 youre flying around and in one fell swoop you could lose it
354523 i get the enjoyment from just coming out to the field
354524 weve got a pavilion with tables and seats and you come out there and theres all these people and theyre always talking about airplanes its just a nice place to go to sit and chew the fat and meet people
354525 i approached the rockford diocese about a catholic parish in sugar grove eight years ago
354526 the diocese acknowledged that it would be a good location based on growth projection but the money wasnt there now the rich family has stepped up to make the project move ahead having a religious choice will add to the quality of life in sugar grove
354527 tell us a little about yourself including why youd be a great beta tester

354547 we no longer think of him as a scientist but as a man who has learned a secret of creation
354548 he was very concerned that the artists creation should be given intellectual status the mind is the important thing
354549 the depth of his empirical observations is what separates him from other artists

354569 all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ

354572 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
354573 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
354574 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
354575 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
354576 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america

354578 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
354579 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
354580 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
354581 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
354582 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
354583 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
354584 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
354585 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
354586 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
354587 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
354588 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
354589 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
354590 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

354600 projects move really quickly once the steel work begins and people start to see the building come into form so weve seen some heads turn as folks drive by
354601 by late fall we hope to be putting the facade and windows up and then youll really have a good idea how its going to look
354602 we couldnt have everyone moving in here at once so we staggered our construction of the training facility and parking deck to be done several months ahead of the headquarters
354603 before long well be completely under roof and putting the finishing touches on the inside so it can be used as soon as possible
354604 that just doesnt happen with a project like this you usually get one or the other
354605 you cant go around building police stations every five years

354628 the leeward abc islands aruba bonaire and cura ao are on the southern fringes of the hurricane belt they are not outside the hurricane belt as many consider history learns that roughly once every 100 years considerable damage is experienced by tropical cyclones passing over or just south of the islands although the hurricane experience level for the islands may be regarded as nihil well known is the minor hurricane which passed just south of cura ao on september 23 1877 causing an estimated structural damage of us 2 million mainly to the coastal section of willemstad a nunnery was completely washed away remnants still visible with low tide many ships were lost and at least 70 persons drowned the lowest barometer reading at willemstad was observed at 23 15 30 utc with 995 4 millibars a ship sailing south of cura ao reported a lowest pressure of 988 8 millibars in this context the most significant events in the past few years were related to tropical storms joan in 1988 tropical storm bret in 1993 and tropical storm cesar in 1996 tropical storm joan which past just south of the islands on october 16 1988 caused an estimated structural damage of approximately us 1 5 million mainly by blown off roofs and by rough seas pounding exposed harbor and beach facilities
354629 climatology the leeward islands of the dutch antilles aruba curacao and bonaire have a semi arid climate yearly precipitation is about 550 mm 22 7 in per year this is due to an extension of the azores high and locally it is also connected with an upwelling zone with colder sea surface temperature sst along the east west venezuelan coast caused by the easterly trade winds lahey 1958 trewartha 1981 the influence of the mainland 60 km away is large during the rain season most precipitation is late at night and in the early morning opposite to the usual tropical pattern which exists on the mainland this is caused by the sea continent breeze traditionally the year is divided in three 4 month seasons oct jan is the rain season feb may the dry season and jun sep bring the small rains
354630 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
354631 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
354632 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
354633 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
354634 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
354635 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
354636 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
354637 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
354638 at various times in the geological past many species have become extinct as a result of natural rather than human processes thus there is no justification for society to make extraordinary efforts especially at a great cost in money and jobs to save endangered species
354639 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
354640 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
354641 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
354642 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
354643 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
354644 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
354645 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
354646 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
354647 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
354648 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
354649 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
354650 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
354651 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
354652 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
354653 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
354654 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
354655 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
354656 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
354657 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
354658 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
354659 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
354660 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
354661 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
354662 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
354663 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
354664 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
354665 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
354666 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
354667 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
354668 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
354669 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
354670 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
354671 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
354672 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
354673 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
354674 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
354675 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
354676 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
354677 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
354678 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
354679 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
354680 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
354681 if i want to talk to someone in the next room ill open the door and shout
354682 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
354683 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
354684 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
354685 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
354686 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
354687 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
354688 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
354689 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
354690 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
354691 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
354692 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
354693 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
354694 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
354695 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
354696 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
354697 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
354698 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
354699 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
354700 who are open to doing something on the production side
354701 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
354702 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
354703 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

354751 sex education in schools is an effective measure in preventing sexual diseases and aids
354752 there is no need for schools to provide sex education since there is a huge amount of sex related information in the current mass media
354753 sex education should be a compulsory subject for all primary and secondary students
354754 schools should strictly prohibit primary and secondary students from having sexual relationship
354755 sex education in schools will cause primary and secondary students to have sex behavior earlier

354763 while the vast majority of illegal aliens are decent people who work hard and are only trying to make a better life for themselves and their families something you or i would probably do if we were in their place it is also a fact that a disproportionately high percentage of illegal aliens are criminals and sexual predators
354764 that is part of the dark side of illegal immigration and when we allow the good in we get the bad along with them the question is how much bad is acceptable and at what price
354765 in response to increased terrorism and abuse of social programs by aliens i today introduced the first and only comprehensive immigration reform bill in congress currently an alien living illegally in the united states often pays no center bombing have underscored the need to keep violent criminals out of the country
354766 we are a country founded upon fairness and justice an individual in real threat of torture or long term incarceration because of his or her political beliefs can still seek asylum but this bill closes the door to those who want to abuse americas inherent generosity and legal system
354767 our borders have overflowed with illegal immigrants placing tremendous burdens on our criminal justice system schools and social programs the immigration and naturalization service needs the ability to step up enforcement our federal wallet is stretched to the limit by illegal aliens getting welfare food stamps medical care and other benefits often without paying any taxes
354768 safeguards like welfare and free medical care are in place to boost americans in need of short term assistance these programs were not meant to entice freeloaders and scam artists from around the world even worse americans have seen heinous crimes committed by individuals who are here illegally

354874 instead of consuming the technology in a healthy manner the technology starts overtaking other aspects of their life be that financially having debts they cant pay or spending money on credit for the phone at the expense of clothing text books or even basic items of food this is what weve found
354875 the average australian in this survey spent over an hour on the phone a day perhaps more depending on how they handled it or looked for addresses or that sort of thing

354889 we are sad to hear of the apparent death of this gentleman mr al masri and we extend our condolences to his family
354890 i say that because we have not completely established the circumstances or the facts of whats happened here
354891 the death of a father and husband is a tragedy for all those people who are left behind

354897 researchers at yale school of medicine have found the brains appetite center uses fat for fuel by involving oxygen free radicals
354898 in contrast to the accepted view the brain does use fat as fuel
354899 our study shows that the minute by minute control of appetite is regulated by free radicals implying that if you interfere with free radicals you may affect eating and satiety
354900 that each time a feeling of fullness or satiety is reached during a meal you may be chipping away some time from your maximum lifespan as the most free radicals are produced when satiety promoting brain cells are active

354917 when it comes to the middle east conflict the arabs no longer see any difference between republicans and democrats
354918 both parties vie with one another in expressing total support for israel
354919 we are the most natural of allies and like israel itself that alliance is for ever
354920 remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
354921 im here to reaffirm the special relationship between israel and the u s and my abiding commitment to israels security
354922 obama paid his respects to dozens of israeli victims in sderot while neglecting to mention the thousands of recent palestinian victims of israeli violence
354923 how can anyone expect him to be even handed on the issue when he becomes president
354924 is not exclusive to the republicans but permeates both political parties
354925 when it comes to israel theres virtually no difference in republican and democratic party policies
354926 these people occupy most of the top political and military positions throughout the american political system
354927 anyone who thinks washington can serve as a fair mediator in the israel palestine conflict under republicans or democrats is delusional
354928 securing israels presence in the middle east the return of the jews to israel and the eventual construction of the jewish temple on the site where the al aqsa mosque now stands
354929 they have used u s military force to spread their version of democracy which excludes all forms of political islam be it lebanons hezbollah hamas in palestine or the egyptian muslim brotherhood
354930 these people have a greater attachment to israel and world zionism than they do to the u s
354931 but they have tried hard to convince the american public that u s and israeli interests are one and the same
354932 the zionist lobby can make or break any would be presidential candidate
354933 this isnt due to its large voting numbers but to its enormous influence on the media both in the u s and in western europe
354934 since then neo conservative elements have bought up many important american media institutions including major news outlets
354935 this along with the establishment of numerous research centres and think tanks has been their primary means of promoting the neo conservative agenda in the u s
354936 the arab regimes dont look to washington as a fair mediator they look to washington to keep them in power despite their lack of legitimacy and popularity
354937 the israel palestine dispute can only reach a just resolution when the arabs choose leaders able and willing to carry out the popular will
354938 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
354939 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions

354945 the reason that this question is included on the juror questionnaire form is that it is a basic voir dire question dealing with individual bias to not address it especially given the fact that the juror was the only seated juror not to answer this question is ineffectiveness on the part of counsel

354949 as our nation moves to decrease our dependence on foreign sources of energy these specialized green jobs will only continue to increase in demand
354950 our 18th district has great potential for green jobs clearly training the work force is a very important step for preparing ourselves for a green economy this legislation makes renewable energy production tax credits permanent for producers encouraging them to produce more energy through wind or solar power renewable energy production companies have often pointed to the temporary nature of this and other credits as discouraging to business models and investment the work force training should encourage industries to reach out to higher education particularly in rural areas and encourage students to take an interest in the energy jobs of the future
354951 suffering some of the highest unemployment rates in ohio and with the price of gasoline at staggering levels we definitely need help on both fronts help this bill provides
354952 we scored a big victory when our college and university rural education act passed both houses of congress
354953 what about everybody else who dont know what to expect
354954 loading more of dominions costs into the fixed customer charge limits the ability for consumers to control their monthly bill by being more energy efficient
354955 with customers budgets stretched thin a higher flat rate charge means customers would pay more than 17 per month regardless of how much natural gas is used
354956 a one bedroom study apartment subsidizes a five bedroom home
354957 at a time when state and federal governments are trying to encourage energy efficiency this goes in the opposite direction
354958 but with this kind of increase who can afford to retire
354959 an individual should use their instincts about the overpowering noxious odors whether to stay or to leave the home

354970 we dont cotton to no ridicule in these here parts brother berptoast is serious business
354971 and it behooved me to pass along my vision my puissance my revelation to you my fellow men
354972 i say to you i was stranded at the entrance to the chapel when it came upon me descended upon me in a bright steel blue flash like the lightning that paul in the desert saw before his vision i was blinded mindless and senseless to all but the picture put into me from above i was touched i say touched by the holiest of holies
354973 and i am here to tell it to you all that you too might know
354974 it was late in the evening in the gloaming when the world is more than it is a chariot appeared to me before me a chariot in this here day and age there was no one around it was a dark chariot drawn by eight milk white steeds driven by a tall dark stranger with fire in his eyes flashing from his dark black eyes a slightly askew smile on his thin lips i was awed i trembled with fear and trepidation a complexion darker i say darker than any man i have ever seen stared out at me from an atmosphere so hot and suffocating that i knew he was a being from another realm and following this chariot was a host a multitude of dark liveries mounted on dark steeds that stood a full 21 hands high i trembled in my bones my shoes became loose on my feet my hair stood on end to rival the silky flowing mass of the charioteers black locks
354975 appreciating my fear and over awedness he spoke to me he spoke to me the words that make my appearance before you a reality a necessity
354976 he said step upon my chariot human and i shall show you wonders beyond all calculation and do you know do you know my crazed feet carried me up upon that dark chariot and stood joyous as a babys first steps next that raven stranger why in my fear and trembling had i done such a thing lord lord lord there was a power here i did not understand a power greater than myself there was naught i could do but follow
354977 i had no power to refuse and before i was aware i found i was in the chariot proceeding through the thick sulfurous air at a speed i dare not calculate onward we went onward and upward onward with the rapidity and ease of the wind until we stopped before a door in the high street of climax nary a word spoke my deep dark companion there was a crowd of people in the street but no notice did they take of my caliginous caravan with its extraordinary equipage was i then invisible it would have been difficult to miss the entourage and chariot from which i alighted for i knew this was the place the place i should get off the place that was intended for me yet no one saw
354978 the house at which we sopped appeared to be a shop i do not know what kind of shop i could see no sign i also do not remember ever having seen a shop in this place before when the dark stranger ushered me in i was confronted by a vast half ruined palace far in excess of what that common little shop door could have realized i was in awe of the space the high ceilings disappeared into the vague sky if sky it was for my eyes could not see so high intricate yet heavy columns evenly spaced about like a cathedral huge pillars of marble and windows windows of cut glass and pointed gothic arches from which no light emanated but dark flashes of lightning rose up behind them illuminating the walls of intricately woven stone that went on and on
354979 room after room my mysterious mentor led me pausing only to urge my befuddled feet onward what did these rooms look like i no longer remember but they were numberless numberless as the rooms in gods mansion but i do remember that last room that room was more cave like than the rest its walls less finished yet with all the dancing shadows from the firelight great bleeding torches i could not be sure the tall dark stranger stopped and gestured and there before me sat a senate of ghosts debating on the progress of the plague yes that same plague that ravishes our land today and around the edges of this grand cavern illuminated by garish bouts of twisted lightning i saw gibbering and chattering skeletons running about running lasciviously after each other playing leap frog i shrank into myself i did not belong here my legs trembled and became rooted to the spot as my will strove to drive me onward escape escape my inner voice roared at me but i could not move until the man bid me proceed beyond these squabbling ghosts into a wild uncultivated plot of ground out of which rose up a black rock as smooth as there is nothing so smooth
354980 down the walls of this cavern oozed and drooled water a water that sparkled a yellow green this is my water the darksome man said pointing with a long finger a very long finger with a very long blue black fingernail vin invitae he laughed his lips pulled back to reveal long white fang like teeth the incisors creasing his lower lips a grimace from out of which blew the mirthless laugher and a stench that only the brimstone of hell could produce my knees went weak i stepped back reaching out to catch my balance dont touch he shouted at me his voice rang off the walls i covered my ears
354981 i could not tolerate the tintinnabulation i thought my mind would come squeezing out my ears my nose my open gaping mouth
354982 never in the world had i heard such a concatenation i tried to plead my cause to the lord the bleating risibility ceased i was enveloped in silence silence that took my breath away i looked at my cimmerian companion i didnt want to lord help me i did not want to and yet i could not but look at him
354983 his finger shot out pointing to the ground my gaze followed
354984 and lord help me it was no longer stone but earth the earth the ground beneath your feet and that poison sucked itself into that earth my earth i saw it sinking into the world and polluting all the life therein all the life upon it and its noxious fumes rose up like highway heat mirage and choked the life out of the birds and the bees and they fell to the putrid earth and were consumed and i saw this venomous liquid insinuate itself into the very wells and springs of the city making the water unfit to drink by the lord above i was struck dumb the people were drinking of this polluted water they knew not what they did and they paid the price i saw their walking corpses green and pus filled bursting their humanity and falling empty to the ground
354985 after seeing all this the stygian stranger showed me into yet a further room what a marvelous glorious chamber it was gilt and gold everywhere my eyes were struck dumb from the brilliance piles piles and piles pile upon pile of rubies and pearls and sapphires and diamonds rose up before me the floor was strewn with semi precious stones once again his finger shot out pointing at each and every stack of gems these he breathed these are all yours wealth beyond imagination if you but do two things i looked up into his imposing hypnotic eyes you must kneel to me and worship me and you must go about the land and smear this pestiferous salve on all the doors i tell you
354986 i knew then that this black spectre was satan and somehow somehow the lord gave me strength to refuse this primordial bribe
354987 lightning flashed from his eyes a gurgling growling roar rose up out of him he scowled down at me his fingers clawed the air and a loud clap of thunder burst over his head
354988 and then and then i found myself standing on the steps of the chapel alone
354989 i dont need it but it might do you some good whats the problem
354990 nothing can help me ive lost my way and dont know where i am
354991 a sword blade cuts things but eyes do not see themselves
354992 do you really want to know or are you humoring me
354993 i see that are you sure you dont want this medicine its good medicine no explanation needed
354994 its what others think and say about you that makes you what you are
354995 jeppe saw his little vein of gold and shouted thinking one more thrust would unearth more gold he jabbed at the sparkling metal his shovel clanged sparks flew dust and debris were tossed up around him jeppe screamed grabbing at his face he twisted and shouted and writhed about until he fell into the lake and drowned jeppe hit gold alright and then he blinded himself with a shard of the precious metal
354996 as the ravaging disease was taken under control more and more uses were found for his medicine
354997 you will be when you get to the other side of this dust
354998 hmm since you are staying here in the middle of this dirty fog i should think you will need it more than me
354999 if his body and mind are in an evil plight you must rid yourselves of these lurid sex stories from anonymous assistant crudite girls who work on arts and crafts service tables at this or that carnival of animals hoping hoping for that big break only to uncover nonexistent penumbras of delight to airhead anti humanists
355000 anti humanists could never persuade humanists to follow their insane ideas infanticide sexual perversion adoption trigger finger tampering mixing and matching abolishing punishment finalities opportunity knocking and yet anti humanitarians wage a vicious campaign of vilification and therefore of course craven moderately humanist humanists would be expected to follow
355001 we face moral choices between good and evil every day every day day in and day out everymans everychoice everyday if we make excuses for evil soon we cease being able to distinguish evil from good at all with each choice we make large or small we therefore take a step closer to the devil and so yes they have made excuses for evil for so long they cannot recognize evil any more the closest thing to it evil in their vocabulary someone who wears fur yet many anti humanists wear beards
355002 hiding their true selves behind their masks of fur they are become amoral appeasers and foreign suck ups whose faces are no stranger to confusion or befuddlement look at their beards for the love of god
355003 gods charioteer is come to earth to meet out the punishment they deserve the anti humanists you see anti humanists simply cant grasp the problem their specialty is hysterical overreaction the truth is not their forte what is the problem
355004 it is so self evident it need not be stated they they use words like decent and solid to describe their two faced weasel hypocrisy
355005 you dont have to enter the no spin zone to see the disconnect
355006 they talk about simulating belief in something anti humanists believe in crazy god crap they hoodwink others into believing they should believe in the crazy god crap too its part of the casual contempt anti humanists have for the views of normal people righteous people the yous and mes of the world everymans hypocrisy hypocrisy i tell you hypocrisy is the sin that inflames them and they say the humanists are the hypocrites
355007 inasmuch as anti humanitarians have no morals they sit back and criticize other people for failing to meet the standards they renounce its an intriguing strategy
355008 anti humanists are fanatical liars hobgoblinists they engage in myth making rewriting history blackening reputations they are on a horrid campaign of horrendous lies and disinformation anti humanists are noise machines
355009 anti humanists are incapable of feeling hate for the enemy anti humanists unabashedly invoke lies in order to shield their ongoing traitorous behavior they wear masks look at their bears for christs sake
355010 anti humanists become highly histrionically indignant when i question their patriotism to life social terrors terrorists they prattle on and on about the right to dissent being the true mark of humanitarianism when of course they are wrong it is god
355011 those who cannot stay focused on fighting the enemy are objectively pro terrorist they too are traitors the innocent are guilty traitors do that to you

355042 you will it is medicine it will cure you if you go along this road
355043 as the ravaging disease was taken under control more and more uses were found for his medicine
355044 this went on for some time until he had lost all his old patients he then turned to treating out of towners who wanted a personal infusion of his magical curative the doctor coming to believe that it could cure anything was more than happy to oblige until he gave his medicine to a young girl who promptly died when questioned about this it was found that the doctor had not diagnosed the girl but simply given her the miracle cure as a matter of course the girl was his daughter
355045 you will be when you get to the other side of this dust

355067 no one wants worthless land right only you can make it worth something

355082 im still the same man buck just with a coat of a different color
355083 howm i sposed to do that there are so many jims
355084 we have a problem now hellecchino got rid of milchrot come on in and join the discussion
355085 well we still have to find and deactivate the machine and with milchrot gone theres no telling what yabu will do
355086 theres no need for everyone to be a hero buck
355087 give the guy a chance its not like its the end of the world
355088 it is if yabu discovers milchrot is no longer around
355089 well have to make sure he doesnt find out right away thats all
355090 we have to get to the machine and put it out of commission it seems to me
355091 we just make up hellecchino and send him in there great idea jimgriffin
355092 nope not me no sir im not up not going to be in one of your fictions jim griffin
355093 good come on with me and ill fix you right up in the meantime we have to come up with an excuse for milchrot not being around
355094 update 2 senate passes gun bill in response to rampage

355096 study finds racial divide across u s in drug arrests
355097 youre dr milchrots assistant how come you wasnt here before
355098 let me give you an example when certain crystals are placed in water they dissolve and disappear you would not know that they had ever been there
355099 what are crystals you dont mean the ones thatre worth money do ya
355100 if by evaporation or by some other fashion you lessen the amount of water et voil there you have crystals again visible and the same as before it is by this evaporation process that you an organic being made up of the same crystals can be dissolved into the cosmos then by a subtle reversal of fortune your bits and pieces are reassembled elsewhere
355101 it is a monstrous assertion that we could be dispersed by some disruptin power
355102 the objection is an obvious one but it is working no this is how dr milchrots chicane disintegrator works i assure you he has carefully instructed me in all its various phases and conundrums and i can assure you there is a visible framework that requires that every crystal flies back into its true place
355103 you may smile mr yabu sir but your incredulity and your smile may soon be replaced by quite another emotion after all we have disappeared many no
355104 ah it would not be a secret if i told you would it
355105 sometimes id like to disappear but only fer awhile y understand
355106 im ready then perhaps i cn relieve some o th stress n strain o home life if ya know what i mean
355107 yes there is something i would impress upon you mr yabu which may help you to grasp the idea you have heard in oriental magic and western occultism of the phenomenon of the apport of objects when suddenly brought from a distance to appear in a new place yes
355108 im not good at scientific stuff as long as it works is good enough for me
355109 it is the loosening of molecules their conveyance upon an etheric wave and their reassembling each exactly in its place drawn together by the irresistible laws of physics and philosophy
355110 i do not believe in apports mr beauregarde since i do not understand them since i do not believe in them they do not exist my time is valuable and if we are t have any sorta demonstration i wanna proceed right this minute without farther ado
355111 this is the machine that is destined to be famous altering the balance of power in the country who holds this rules the world
355112 now mr yabu will you dare to sit upon the chair and allow me to demonstrate upon your own body the capabilities of this new force
355113 the nearest approach to this thing ive ever seen is the lectric chair at sing sing this aint gonna fry my ass is it
355114 i would be held for manslaughter if anything befell you no
355115 that would be poor consolation t me leavin the work unfinished let you at least go first an then i cn follow
355116 my god mr beauregard it is true i vanished from there and now im here theres no doubt about it there was an instant of vacancy as ive never felt before and how long was i away
355117 two or three minutes i clicked this lever if it is a lever into a new slot and there you were standing where you now stand looking a little bewildered but otherwise the same as ever
355118 it is an interesting process is it not when you consider the tremendous inocuity of the professor it is strange to think that he is at present a molecular cloud suspended somewhere he is now of course entirely busy on a mission of mercy if we choose to leave him in suspension there is nothing on gods earth to prevent us
355119 do you know i have discovered that the hair of the body being at an entirely different vibration to other living organic tissues can be included or excluded at will it would interest me to see the bear without his bristles behold him
355120 if you kill me you can never get matters right again
355121 it was my wish to demonstrate the power of the machine i imagined that you wanted a full demonstration no offense i assure you mr yabu none in the world
355122 you done taken a liberty mr beauregarde that woulda had very serious consequences to yoreself however i am content to accept yore explanation that you only did it fer purposes of demonstration now if i may ask you a few direct questions upon this remarkable power which you claim to have discovered for me
355123 i am ready to answer anything save what the source of power is that is my secret and that of the great chicane milchrot my inestimable teacher
355124 do you seriously inform us that no one in the world knows of this except yoreself and milchrot
355125 it acts vertically certain currents are above you and certain others are below you and they set up vibrations but the process could be lateral if it were so conducted it would have the same effect and cover a space in proportion to the strength of the current
355126 and you have sold this secret as a monopoly to only me yes
355127 yes sir when the money is paid over you shall have such power as no man ever yet has had you dont even now the extent of the possibilities if placed in capable hands hands which did not fear to wield the weapon which they held they are immeasurable
355128 conceive a quarter of bexar gone in the flick of a switch poof the people weve been doing so far are peanuts imagine the effect of such a current
355129 i could imagine the whole pecos valley being swept clean and not one man woman or child left of all those teeming millions to disturb my peace no injuns no immigrants no darkies nobody to stand in my way
355130 well mr beauregarde i must congratulate you and dr chicane milchrot there is no doubt that you have come upon a remarkable property of naytcha which you have succeeded in harnessin for my use that this use should also have a destructive power is no doubt very deplorable but science knows no distinctions of the sort following knowledge where it may lead no apart from the principle involved you have i suppose no objection to my examinin the construction of the miraculous lagniappe
355131 none in the least the machine is merely the body it is the soul of it the animating principle which you can never hope to capture it is so scientifically etheric
355132 ah would you care for another excursion into the cosmos
355133 later perhaps later but meanwhile is there not some leakage of electricity i can distinctly feel a weak current passing through me
355134 dear me i may have inadvertently touched the handle one is very liable to have awkward incidents with a rough model of this kind this never should certainly be guarded hmm it is in the number three slot that must be th slot that causes disinteegration yes i cn operate this yes quite adequately indeed
355135 enjoy yore trip i was so excited i guess i didnt watch what i was doin didja notice it
355136 i may have noticed it yes mr yabu but i do not burden my mind with such small details
355137 there are many slots and i do not know their purpose i might make the matter worse if i experiment with the unknown dontcha think perhaps it is best to leave matters as they are in yore hands for the moment
355138 exactly it is better so with your interesting personality distributed throughout the cosmos this machine is worthless and certain people if you get my drift

355146 it threw me into a tailspin in the three years after the accident i gained 150 pounds
355147 when something like that happens you lose the ability to care about anything you dont put value on anything because you know it can end at any second
355148 people try to make this about calories and scales but this is about living your life
355149 i spent 15 years either regretting the past or fearing the future now im living in the present
355150 whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved it may be answered that one should wish to be both but because it is difficult to unite them in one person is much safer to be feared than loved when of the two either must be dispensed with because this is to be asserted in general of men that they are ungrateful fickle false cowardly covetous and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely they will offer you their blood property life and children as is said above when the need is far distant but when it approaches they turn against you and that prince who relying entirely on their promises has neglected other precautions is ruined because friendships that are obtained by payments and not by greatness or nobility of mind may indeed be earned but they are not secured and in time of need cannot be relied upon and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared for love is preserved by the link of obligation which owing to the baseness of men is broken at every opportunity for their advantage but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails

355180 ambient 4 on land and or apollo atmospheres amp soundtracks
355181 dora is a really neat character the problem is that today the lives of young children are just saturated with media characters and the things they sell im not a luddite im not a technophobe i worked in television i worked with fred rogers i just thought the world of him its a matter of access and scale my fantasy life as a child was all wrapped up in walt disneys peter pan but i only saw it once because thats all that i could see it i went to the movies when i was six and i saw it and then if i wanted to visit peter pan or recreate the feelings that film evoked in me i had to play about it and thats not kids experience today they own the movies or they rent the movies or they see the television shows over and over and over and over again and then most of the best selling toys that are sold to kids today actually inhibit rather than promote creative play either theyre linked to the media characters and or theyre embedded with computer chips which means that the toys sing and dance and do back flips all by themselves and actually have a lot more fun than the kids who only have to push a button and the other thing thats possible is by the time theyre two dora is baby stuff so its got to be something else like the disney princesses thats whats coming next
355182 so now they sell disney princess dolls and there are disney princess videos
355183 and now kids can see them at home they can see them in the back seat of their parents cars they can see them on mp3 players they can see them on cell phones and then if all their toys are disney princess toys as well that kind of drives their play
355184 a kind of rallying point for the sub literates in our society
355185 is introduce gently but with a certain amount of seriousness the notion to children that they live in a complex and serious world where bad things happen to good people and that you have to bring wit intelligence energy basic good values to the problems of living in a complicated world now whether any corporation can afford to do that is a whole other question
355186 and i think its far worse for them to be so overprotected from the schlock of our culture of which there is tons that they become little nerds and the other kids wont play with them and mom is saying look heres a beautiful sock well make a dolly together from it thats fine if you want to do that but you know let em have a donald duck toy or a mickey mouse toy or better still a daffy duck toy i mean i love daffy duck to this day i love daffy duck i think hes one of the great comic characters ever invented in human history i wouldnt prevent my child from seeing daffy duck just because its made by warner brothers a big evil corporation he needs to have things like donald and daffy because other kids have them and it helps him to relate to other children and its more important to relate to other children than to be a nasty little nerd with your sock doll
355187 well i was thinking that it would be a really great bonding experience for the whole family
355188 it just sounded like another one of dads road trips where we just drive and drive like 400 miles a day and we wont stop to go to the bathroom
355189 dad was really big into this trip and so i was thinking its going to be really pretty awesome
355190 i remember we passed a sign that said free taters for out of staters and then we drove to the place where they had free taters for out of staters
355191 those places will never be the same as they were when we went and those memories that we have of those places well own for the rest of our lives
355192 that was our great time to be together as a family and it may never happen again
355193 youre moving away hes gone here we are ready to retire in three or four years and yeah its a great memory its a really great memory
355194 i was thrown into the bottom of the car and the car sped away and i was immediately bound and had something put over my head which i think was a burlap sack
355195 my attack involved a knife which was constantly used to threaten me and also a lot of physical rape
355196 it feels really profound to actually do it with you guys to do it in the presence of men who committed acts of violence and are at a place in their lives where theyre definitely committed to transcending it
355197 are not the offenders victims so theyre not personally related through the crime
355198 the victims have gone through crimes like the men have committed and so theres not only a lot of healing but we think its the most powerful impactful tool we have
355199 he was murdered by a school roommate who woke up in a bad mood and shot him four times because he put dishes in the wrong cabinet
355200 how somebody could get that mad and kill somebody its so final theres no graduations theres no birthdays theres no children theres no marriages theres no theres nothing
355201 she had a son who was murdered and i was spending my days with people who had committed such offenses
355202 going into san quentin or any prison for the first time is a pretty amazing experience i mean the sounds and the clanks and the sally ports and the guns and the guards
355203 and i shook their hand and i said hi im rada whats your name and then we all sat down in a circle
355204 they made me a quilt about chriss life it was very crude its only made with prison materials i cant tell you how i felt that day i was just so beautifully overwhelmed and they said we all worked together we all did our own little square and there was so much joy in the room while we were doing this for you
355205 all i could keep thinking while you were telling it was what a brave and smart 9 year old little girl
355206 and talk with us and share your story as well as hear ours we were connected in that sense and its so so important and i just want to thank you for it
355207 oh he was wonderful id rather have a hundred al capones in every big city selling illegal whiskey than have it in every 7 11 every safeway and kroger store across america
355208 prisons emptied our mental institutions emptied cirrhosis of the liver was cut in half and it will come for the third fourth time because we cant build enough prisons to house whatever is filling our places up now it wont be long it will come back
355209 well its pretty much single plank in that for 137 years weve fought alcohol
355210 we want to have protected borders and keep our gun rights and a lot of conservative things but the main thing is help america realize that 95 of violent crime is connected with alcohol thats our main platform
355211 oh thats wonderful let me stop you right there when you dont want to do anything just educate weve got the best educated drunks in the world no you have to have laws education is just for those that need to make money and dont have a life
355212 i think in the running there is a sort of catharsis sort of saying this is so important we are going to do this even though we know were not going to win
355213 in a sense knowing youre not going to win makes it an even more noble effort in fighting the lost battle i think there is this feeling of virtue thats very empowering
355214 well this is isnt really as impressive as it sounds
355215 we went down the street and picketed a bar for an hour or so it was located along one of the main roads and the traffic was going by pretty fast a couple of pedestrians maybe it was not a good place to draw a crowd because of the traffic
355216 having a neat wine rack in your kitchen is about as smart as having a cigarette burning on your couch and the arguments against prohibition are as weak as a soup made from the shadow of a starving chicken
355217 its very slow with kind of a lot of bass clef
355218 someone was listening to it and said do you get bored i dont even listen to it that much its just sort of there in my ear its not like you listen to it like youd listen to a song or a piece of music so i dont find it boring
355219 ive had a couple of experiences where i woke up the next day and i literally didnt know what day it was or where i was
355220 not in a bad way i just had been so deeply asleep i was a little disoriented when i woke up
355221 brain music therapy is used to help people primarily with insomnia and that is how it was developed
355222 what the music does is it increases the amount of alpha rhythm that you have and that helps the progression downward towards sleep
355223 bmt is a way of engineering the music specifically for you if you had a sleep disorder that wasnt amenable to yanni
355224 thats the black box its a computer analysis of the mathematics of the eeg
355225 its a quite complex algorithm that allows us to translate brain frequencies into a musical map
355226 we all have experiences where music sticks in our brain and causes us to have emotional connection
355227 but these are the frequencies that are yours that belong to you so you are your own symphony
355228 the nights ive used it the next day i feel much better able to cope with whatever comes my way
355229 the stresses at home and work im able to roll with whatever comes along

355266 bush may be one of the most despised presidents in american history but this movie of his struggle is now smashing all box office records
355267 as this superb batman retelling the dark knight makes clear its subject is a weakness that runs instinctively through us to hate a hero who in saving us exposes our fears prods our weaknesses calls from us more than we want to give or can
355268 and how we resent a hero who must shake our world in order to save it or brings alive that maxim of george orwell that so implicates us in our preening piety
355269 theres the scene at the police station in which batman tortures heath ledgers sensationally vivid joker trying to cave in his face rather than simply say waterboarding him as the cia did to three of most senior commanders
355270 batman has resorted to the last hope to make this terrorist squeal because only the joker has the information the police need to save two goodies who have just minutes left to live
355271 this helps them to preserve their purity while still getting from batman the addresses they so gratefully grab with their clean hands

355315 n o era perfeito mas tinha um equil brio relativo respaldado pela maioria dos participantes
355316 este balan o t o delicado que se for esticado de um lado ser desequilibrado do outro
355317 claro que n o resolvemos muitos dos assuntos que estavam pendentes

355319 mantenho minha estimativa de 65 75 de chances de chegar a um acordo final
355320 est mais do que evidente que o prefeito usou a estrutura municipal para tentar intimidar pesquisadores e cercear o livre direito de manifesta o pol tica das pessoas
355321 seeing the speck in others eyes and missing the log in ones own eye
355322 its easier to ask for forgiveness later than to get permission in the first place
355323 to show your weakness is power you dont need to pretend no one is perfect in this world telling people the old system is not working is not shameful we all know that
355324 it is the same for the outside world for a long time there was a lack of communication so there are a lot of cliches about china that are outdated but before they find something else they can relate to they have nothing else to use
355325 now we have a signal protein that can support the microenvironment for hair development and maybe also for hair renewal
355326 there are a lot of different causes of hair loss
355327 injecting laminin 511 into the skin might under some circumstances promote hair growth
355328 are you the one they talk about so much going to college
355329 its very very helpful to have a student in the class who along with me remembers lyndon johnson and his presidency who remembers nixon who remembers jimmy carter
355330 younger students have read about and heard about it but they havent lived through those administrations and all the things that occurred then joann offers a very welcome perspective shes lived long enough to see a great deal
355331 i dont have that many more years to live and i want to do good for humanity while im here
355332 my mum had paid for the ticket home and we were looking forward to having her back
355333 he met her out there they were not a couple they had only known each other for a short time
355334 did apple forget to patch something by the look of things the dns client on the osx 10 4 11 distribution still has not been patched
355335 the bottom line is that despite this update it appears that the client libraries still arent patched
355336 so apple might have fixed some of the more important parts for servers but is far from done yet as all the clients linked against a dns client library still need to get the workaround for the protocol weakness
355337 i fear giving it to my children directly unless i boil it
355338 iraq is on the cusp of a serious water crisis that requires immediate attention and resources
355339 up to now we have seen nothing from the government
355340 i had fever headaches and was throwing up all the time
355341 when i was a kid it was blue and clean
355342 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
355343 even minuscule amounts of fluoride will cause osteosclerosis spondylosis osteopetrosis and goiter and we cannot afford to run the risk of producing such serious systemic disturbances in applying what is a doubtful procedure to prevent dental disfigurements among children the potentialities for harm far outweigh those for good
355344 the american medical association is not prepared to state that no harm will be done to any person by water fluoridation the ama has not carried out any research work either long term or short term regarding the possibility of any side effects
355345 mercury is among the most dangerous environmental toxins satisfactory alternatives to mercury in products are available and it is therefore fitting to introduce a ban

355350 zeitweilige schwierigkeiten sollten ankara nicht davon abhalten seine anstrengungen auf dem weg zum eu beitritt fortzusetzen wir ermutigen die t rkei an ihrem reformprogramm festzuhalten
355351 die t rkei ist und bleibt ein beitrittskandidat das tempo der beitrittsverhandlungen h ngt vom tempo der tats chlichen reformen in der t rkei ab sie d rfen also nicht nur auf dem papier stehen sie m ssen unwiderrufliche gesellschaftliche wirklichkeit sein

355354 w e must make better use of our foreign aid to improve our standing with the pakistani people
355355 weve tried to do this now with a bill that we just passed out of the senate foreign relations committee yesterday and it is a bill to provide a sustained commitment to dramatically increase non military assistance 7 5 billion over five years and we want to ensure that it goes directly to the people while ensuring that we get what we pay for in terms of military assistance
355356 stopped well short of detailing how the habeas corpus proceedings must be conducted
355357 it is well within the historic role and competence of congress and the executive branch to attempt to resolve them
355358 gave more procedural protections than the united states or any other country for that matter had ever before given to wartime captives whether those captives were lawful soldiers in foreign armies or unlawful combatants who target civilians and hide in civilian populations
355359 did apple forget to patch something by the look of things the dns client on the osx 10 4 11 distribution still has not been patched
355360 the bottom line is that despite this update it appears that the client libraries still arent patched
355361 so apple might have fixed some of the more important parts for servers but is far from done yet as all the clients linked against a dns client library still need to get the workaround for the protocol weakness

355364 there was never a deal put on the table that was compelling enough that we as the board could look the shareholders in the eyes and say this is a good deal for you
355365 i think youve overpaid for executive compensation overplayed your hand with microsoft and overstayed your welcome
355366 they can regain my confidence but theyre going to have to prove themselves first
355367 competition is good for the industry and for consumers so i am happy that microsoft did not succeed in acquiring yahoo
355368 yahoo has actively participated in these human rights abuses including the censorship of information and in one case turning over information to the chinese government
355369 i believe you are moral but the only morality you believe in is profit and self interest
355370 he is as some would say a good guy despite the bad things written about him we look forward to him being a productive member of the board
355371 people are moving online and there are going to be more questions raised about how moving things online subjects people to copyright
355372 the internet works through copying things thats just how digital technology works
355373 copyright law used to be this obscure thing that only publishers were interested in
355374 its something that now affects everyone when you change copyright law now it affects everybody who owns a pc
355375 there are two cultures the web and the real world and whenever cyberspace comes up against the real world it finds that the real world has a different set of rules
355376 the idea of scrabble the idea that you would get points for spelling words cant be copyrighted
355377 the only thing you can copyright is the look and the feel of the game
355378 hasbro was on very solid ground i dont think there was any question about it
355379 thanks to this new electronic lounge called facebook board games are hot two indian students pointed hasbro to what could be their itunes and they responded with lawyers
355380 now we have a signal protein that can support the microenvironment for hair development and maybe also for hair renewal

355383 he wanted a lifestyle similar to what he had in cleveland
355384 there are a lot of suburbs the community is pretty spread out
355385 not really when im done playing i just want to be with my kids and enjoy them
355386 i dont understand how they can be ranked no 1
355387 they didnt win their division last year they lost to a team that didnt go to a bowl south carolina their big triumph was beating haw a ii whos in the wac
355388 i hope theyre undefeated when we go up there to play them so we can knock them off the top
355389 the third game of the season they wont be no 1 anymore
355390 they really are deserving of that no 1 ranking though

355398 ole com object explorer is a small and useful tool
355399 this tool allows to review and manage all startup applications
355400 its of great importance to us to remember that this is not just football but it is a business
355401 and we need to be fiscally responsible as team owners
355402 a lot of teams are just finishing up their year and kind of reevaluating what they want to do in the future
355403 and we really feel with making this announcement early some of those teams top echelon teams that are in good markets and have good ownership groups might look at leaving the current league theyre playing in and come play in our league
355404 when you have more teams that means more teams are paying in dues
355405 that means the league becomes financially stronger and there is power to money it affords the ability to hire excellent sales people who can go out and seek out league wide sponsorships a great commissioner who can help bring on expansion franchises also suddenly there arent two great leagues fighting over markets for future growth were doing it together
355406 were being very careful about the applications that we accept
355407 and making certain that were bringing quality owners who will provide a quality experience for the fans and the players
355408 the owners that we have and the owners that were going to accept are very passionate owners who are committed to indoor football to the fans and the players and they have the financial strength to carry it on
355409 ive been fortunate enough to be around this long enough where someones word is so important in this game and not only their word but how their business and how they run their indoor football team
355410 ive been working on this bike with my dad for the last three and a half years
355411 going through that transition with everything getting darker and darker everyday it was just like the sky getting blacker and blacker and its like the worst storm coming and i kept thinking this is gonna get bad
355412 when i started going blind we just kind of threw it in the back of the garage and it got covered with dust
355413 a lot of stuff really was going through my mind and i put my life and everything else on hold just to adjust to that and it was so tough that i never thought i would see myself doing anything
355414 and it wasnt just because i had to finish the bike it was i had to prove to myself that even blind people can do stuff
355415 feeling and touching everything i can feel every little defect
355416 every little mistake every little flaw on the bike and theres about 100 thousand of them
355417 when im done creating it he feels everything over and if he likes it we put it on
355418 i cover my eyes i try to feel and im not even close compared to what he does
355419 visualize the rest ive got a pretty good imagination so i know what it looks like
355420 now its something that i want to finish not just for me but to show everybody what im capable of doing
355421 im still me i still got my skills i can still do stuff
355422 weve been at this for 18 months the trial judge made an absolutely exhaustive review of the data found two minor issues we acted to cure immediately and now its time to move on
355423 listen to me you qaeda i got your head in a n vise ill squash your head like a n grapefruit if you dont give me a name
355424 as soon as 2010 iran will have the option to reach uranium production at military levels
355425 for the next 12 days or so were going to have quite a bit of traffic heading towards the black hills
355426 double check your blind spots we dont see everything with our rear view mirrors motorcycles obviously a lot smaller a lot easier to get into those blind spots when we cant see them
355427 theyre just like any other vehicle like a car or pick up or van they have a right to the lane themselves
355428 a lot of people come to the sturgis motorcycle rally to have a good time and unfortunately many of them have a good time and then didnt make the wise choice to protect themselves
355429 mr coburns approach is problematic when it comes to the mechanics of the senate
355430 because most of the chambers work gets done by what is known as unanimous consent an agreement among all parties to let a bill pass without a fight
355431 aims to eradicate the devastating effects of postpartum depression on american families
355432 the rogue far right has perfected the art of stopping good bills that help good people
355433 wanted to know where the good press coverage was coming from
355434 i think i deserve an apology for the way you treated me in fact i deserve one now on the count of three
355435 for days before danieal kelly died in a fetid airless room made stifling hot by a midsummer heat wave the bedridden teenager begged for something to drink until she could muster only one word water
355436 its about the body and the soul concealing and revealing empowerment clothing has always been so political
355437 the message is that we all have the power to choose
355438 el cine me salv del armario del miedo aquel armario en el que yo me ocultaba de los otros en la oscuridad de ese armario yo encend a la caja de lata de kerosene y la luz que sal a del proyector se convert a en la pared en mis sue os
355439 pretty much since i made my announcement i have not been able to get anything going
355440 we have analyzed the last two and a half months to death
355441 i am swinging very well but now im putting well and for some reason i am having a hard time scoring i know im stepping away but in my mind im as good as ive ever been scores dont reflect that but in my heart and in my head i believe it
355442 jack nicklaus isnt here so i guess thats a substitute
355443 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
355444 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
355445 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
355446 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
355447 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
355448 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
355449 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
355450 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
355451 represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning
355452 do you think you are better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago if you arent better off can you afford another four years
355453 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
355454 it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down your own debt
355455 all andrew jacksons horses and all the boy kings men could not put humpty dumpty together again his gladiatorial walk across the darkened greensward past a st louis cathedral bathed in moon glow from white house klieg lights just seemed to intensify the sense of an isolated out of touch president clinging to hollow symbols as his disastrous disaster agency continues to flail in a ruined city still largely without power stinking with piles of garbage and still 40 percent submerged where people are foraging in the miasma and muck for food corpses and the sentimental detritus of their lives and where unbearably sad stories continue to spill out about hordes of evacuees who lost their homes and patients who died in hospitals without either electricity or rescuers isnt it rather tasteless not to mention a waste of energy to haul in white house generators just to give the president a burnished skin tone and a prettified background
355456 proclamation by the president to suspend subchapter iv of chapter 31 of title 40 united states code within a limited geographic area in response to hurricane katrina
355457 which requires or involves the employment of mechanics or laborers shall contain a provision stating the minimum wages to be paid various classes or laborers and mechanics
355458 every day you read the articles in the states where its like oh its getting better and better
355459 but when youre here you know its worse every day
355460 stuffs going on here but they wont flat out say it
355461 i didnt think i was going to live this long in all honesty
355462 it aint that bad its just part of the job i guess
355463 the reality right now is that the most dangerous opinion in the world is the opinion of a u s serviceman
355464 our hope is that as we build up iraqi forces we will be able to relieve the stress on our forces and see a reduction in coalition forces over some period of time probably post iraqi election
355465 with me i have all the physical tools i dont feel like theres a kick out there i cant make
355466 its just mental its about concentration its about just doing it and making sure you hit the ball right every time it wears on you a little bit when things go wrong but you just learn from your mistakes and just move on
355467 its not my call never would i go up to a coach and say i need more 50 yarders
355468 they all count as three points its not a high percentage kick i guess its their call not to kick them i dont remember many times when weve had many opportunities
355469 i had plenty of opportunities in college and i made them i think ill be able to make them again
355470 its not one thing that you say hey i need to make a 50 yard field goal to prove im good today what im trying to prove is that im consistent 80 percent or better of my kicks no matter where theyre from if they counted for six points wed try them a lot more but they dont hitting 30 yarders and 40 yarders are just as important
355471 im not saying i would turn business away but were pretty busy right now
355472 its a painful kind of good we have a lot of work to do but thats a good thing
355473 some guys have 15 000 to 20 000 just on their paint jobs
355474 theyre not going to trust their cars to just anybody

355478 i must have a trillion different passwords for a trillion different web sites
355479 people will absolutely shut off the spending spigots given the soured jobs market
355480 with job losses mounting prices rising increased turbulence in our financial system and a growing credit crunch we need to do more
355481 we cannot afford four more years of the failed bush economic policies and that is what sen mccain if offering
355482 americans are hurting and todays job numbers are just the latest reminder of the economic challenges we face
355483 its easy to see why consumer spending is expected to remain weak through the summer if not the rest of the year
355484 we want to help with spiritual needs as well as practical needs
355485 were concerned about spiritual conditions but we want to reach beyond that
355486 we want to reach out to the community and share the love of jesus
355487 its a way of letting people know about us as well
355488 its just awesome and its a totally different experience than doing it yourself
355489 you get a lot more done in a shorter span of time
355490 my dad has cancer so the chemotherapy knocks him out but hell come out here and ask people if they need coffee hell do his best
355491 because there are so few of us out here they wanted to seek a way to partner with us and reach out to other people
355492 we wanted to reach out to help other churches to grow
355493 rather than sticking to our community we wanted to expand it
355494 theyre done no one will ever see them even you only look at it all as a landscape just wrinkled papers everywhere
355495 no you should put them all together together make a book out of them or bind them or something
355496 that sure would make it a lot easier to throw them all away

355512 there are times however and this is one of them when even being right feels wrong what do you say for instance about a generation that has been taught that rain is poison and sex is death if making love might be fatal and if a cool spring breeze on any summer afternoon can turn a crystal blue lake into a puddle of black poison right in front of your eyes there is not much left except tv and relentless masturbation its a strange world some people get rich and others eat shit and die

355541 the connection i used to feel was too powerful my soul is blind yet is still reaching into the darkness to find its companion that it had
355542 these are two excellent baseball men class acts but we thought we needed a change we feel andy hawkins has been in the organization a long time knows our young pitchers thats clearly the direction were headed
355543 we felt we needed to try a different direction with the pitching staff a different voice a different message not that anything they were saying was wrong but sometimes players respond to different voices and were going to take that chance
355544 damit beuge ich missverst ndnissen vor ich wei ja dass die meisten sowieso noch mal ins netz gehen
355545 eine ganze reihe von gesundheitsforen sind problematisch im web 2 0 werden zum teil ernste gesundheitliche probleme von laien und betroffenen in wenigen s tzen diskutiert wissen ger chte pers nliche erfahrungen meinungen und vorstellungen werden ineinander vermischt
355546 es ist kein randproblem wenn patienten auf grund der diskussion im web 2 0 therapien selbstst ndig ver ndern oder eigene diagnosen stellen und dieses mit zus tzlichen kosten f r die kassen oder einen selber endet
355547 es ist aber vielen nicht klar dass die allgemeinen informationen zu einer krankheit nicht unbedingt zu ihrer individuellen situation passen
355548 sie werden auf der seite des adac kaum argumente f r das tempolimit finden
355549 da steckt ja ein bestimmtes interesse dahinter die nutzer m ssten also mehrere quellen heranziehen um sicher zu sein dass die informationen vollst ndig und korrekt sind

355568 there are indications that elements of the isi provided support to those believed responsible for carrying out the attack
355569 this terrorism is certainly one of the issues which for us is a very important part of the issues in the summit
355570 if we want to carry the saarcs economic and social agenda forward its essential that we manage to do this in an atmosphere free of violence
355571 there are real questions about the organizations loyalty in the wake of political gridlock and a lack of a clear political direction some elements of the isi have started to exercise certain prerogatives
355572 if any evidence were to be presented against any individual in pakistan or against the interest of pakistans neighbours then the government would certainly act on that evidence
355573 several outstanding problems in the relationship between the united states and pakistan that the elected government inherited from the past are currently being resolved these include issues of trust between our two intelligence services
355574 if you ask me to describe the state of the india pakistan dialogue it is in a place where it hasnt been in the last four years
355575 we face a situation where things have happened in the recent past which were unfortunate and which quite frankly have affected the future of the dialogue
355576 in general this administration at its upper reaches has been cool to the elected government from the start they like to look at musharraf as a factor for stability
355577 wah id ketupat tinggal dua hari lagi mau jalan jalan ke mana pak
355578 iya id ketupat dan lebaran ketupat itu kan sama saja id itu dari bahasa arab id yang artinya hari raya seperti kata idul fitri yang terdiri dari kata id dan al fitr karena pengucapannya disambung maka dibaca idul fitri jadi sama kan
355579 nggak dong kalau id artinya hari raya trus apa arti idul fitri hari raya fitrah atau hari raya kesucian gimana pak jarkoni ini
355580 pak jarkoni kata id pada kata idul fitri itu artinya kembali sedangkan kata fitri artinya fitrah atau suci jadi idul fitri itu artinya kembali kepada fitrah atau kesucian seperti bayi yang baru lahir
355581 pak mado kata id itu memang memiliki pengertian umum yaitu kembali tapi kata ini secara khusus digunakan oleh orang arab untuk menyebut suatu perayaan yang kembali atau berulang ulang dirayakan setiap tahun
355582 memang pak mado kalo bicara agama sangat mengasyikkan waktu berjalan cepat tanpa terasa
355583 sedangkan kata al fitr itu pak mado artinya bukan fitrah
355584 sedangkan kata al fitrah itu pak mado juga berasal dari kata kerja fathara tapi dengan arti menciptakan jadi al fitrah artinya adalah sifat dan keadaan asali manusia sebagaimana saat allah menciptakannya allah menciptakan manusia itu dengan fitrah atau sifat asali yang sejalan dengan agama coba pak mado lihat qs rum 30 30 nah keadaan manusia yang suci atau tanpa dosa itu hanya salah satu dari sifat atau keadaan asali manusia saat diciptakan
355585 trus kalo gitu salah dong yang disebut sebut dalam khutbah khutbah idul fitri atau tulisan tulisan yang mengatakan kalo idul fitri adalah hari dimana umat islam kembali pada kesucian
355586 pak mado orang orang muslim yang kembali kepada fitrah adalah yang selama ramadhan mereka bersungguh sungguh berpuasa dan beribadah karena keimanan dan mengharap balasan allah jadi kalau kita muslim kita berpuasa kita juga membayar zakat fitrah itu semua tidak lantas menjadikan kita kembali kepada fitrah pada hari idul fitri karena banyak orang muslim yang berpuasa hanya mendapat haus dan lapar juga beribadah hanya mendapat lelah dan kantuk tapi pak mado yang dibahas di khutbah khutbah idul fitri dan tulisan tulisan itu kan hikmah dari idul fitri bukan arti atau terjemahan dari idul fitri sebagaimana yang kita bahas sejak awal jadi itu nggak salah yang salah itu kalau pak mado menyalahkan saya ngomong id ketupat
355587 oh ya kalo lebaran ketupat itu gimana sih sebenarnya pak
355588 lebaran ketupat itu kan lebarannya orang yang mengikuti tuntunan rasulullah saw untuk berpuasa enam hari setelah idul fitri
355589 rasulullah saw memberikan umatnya tuntunan untuk melaksanakan puasa enam hari setelah idul fitri ada yang berpendapat bahwa puasa enam hari tersebut dilaksanakan secara beruntun sebagian lagi berpendapat boleh berselang selama itu dilakukan dalam bulan syawal selain tanggal 1 syawal kalau saya pribadi pak mado lebih condong pada pendapat pertama karena puasa sunat enam hari secara beruntun dapat menjadi tolok ukur bahwa orang yang melaksanakannya sangat bersungguh sungguh mendidik diri untuk mengendalikan hawa nafsunya bayangkan aja pak mado mereka kembali berpuasa padahal saat itu orang orang muslim diperbolehkan makan minum di siang hari setelah sebulan penuh berpuasa
355590 wah pak mado kalo saya jelaskan sepertinya waktunya nggak cukup besok deh kita lanjutkan lagi
355591 pak kyai apa maksud hadits rasulullah saw tentang ilmu yang tidak melewati tenggorokan
355592 anda akan menjumpai orang tersebut teguh dalam keyakinan teguh tapi bijaksana tekun dalam meununtut ilmu semakin berilmu semakin merendah semakin berkuasa semakin bijaksana tampak wibawanya di depan umum jelas syukurnya di kala beruntung menonjol qanaah atau rasa puasnya dalam pembagian rezeki senantiasa berhias walaupun miskin selalu cermat tidak boros walau kaya murah hati dan murah tangan tidak menghina tidak mengejek tidak menghabiskan waktu dalam permainan dan tidak berjalan membawa fitnah disiplin dalam tugasnya tinggi dedikasinya serta terpelihara jati dirinya tidak menuntut yang bukan haknya dan tidak menahan hak orang lain kalau ditegur ia menyesal kalau bersalah ia istighfar bila dimaki ia tersenyum sambil berkata jika makian anda benar maka aku bermohon semoga tuhan mengampuniku dan jika makian anda keliru maka aku bermohon semoga tuhan mengampunimu
355593 seorang hamba akan mendekatkan diri kepada ku hingga aku mencintainya dan bila aku mencintainya jadilah pendengaran ku yang digunakannya untuk mendengar penglihatan ku yang digunakan untuk melihat tangan ku yang digunakannya untuk berbuat serta kaki ku yang digunakan untuk melangkah
355594 dahulu saya lihat mushab ini tak ada yang mengimbangi dalam memperoleh kesenangan dari orang tuanya kemudian ditinggalkannya semua itu demi cintanya kepada allah dan rasul nya
355595 diceriterakan kepada kami oleh ibrahim bin muhammad bin syurahbil al abdari dari bapaknya ia berkata
355596 muhammad itu tiada lain hanyalah seorang rasul yang sebelumnya telah didahului oleh beberapa rasul
355597 muhammad itu tiada lain hanyalah seorang rasul dan sebelumnya telah didahului oleh beberapa rasul
355598 di antara orang orang mumin terdapat pahlawan pahlawan yang telah menepati janjinya dengan allah
355599 ketika di mekkah dulu tak seorang pun aku lihat yang lebih halus pakaiannya dan lebih rapi rambutnya daripada dirinya tetapi sekarang ini dengan rambutmu yang kusut hanya dibalut sehelai burdah
355600 sungguh rasulullah akan menjadi saksi nanti di hari kiamat bahwa tuan tuan semua adalah syuhada di sisi allah
355601 hai manusia berziarahlah dan berkunjunglah kepada mereka serta ucapkanlah salam demi allah yang menguasai nyawaku tak seorang muslim pun sampai hari kiamat yang memberi salam kepada mereka pasti mereka akan membalasnya

355611 just the pool the food the music the kids can swim with their friends and our neighbors theres music playing upstairs its literally a block away from our house and its something to do community wise i see five or six of my fellow girl scout leaders here with their kids too
355612 we wanted to make this an opportunity for people to have recreational swim at night
355613 thats something that we get asked for we thought wed incorporate the whole beach theme into it by adding an island nights title we invited some restaurants from town to sell dinner plates for a reasonable fee we have arts and crafts and kids swimming outside the music upstairs just a well rounded family event
355614 i think the parents enjoy being able to bring their kids to a place that theyre going to
355615 we end up with a lot of the parents up on the terrace eating having something to drink and the kids in the pool or in the craft room with the rec leaders and the lifeguards so the family doesnt necessarily have to separate in order to go out
355616 i had about 25 people come with me last time
355617 we had a little party up there kind of on the deck its kind of like going to a wedding without anybody getting married

355652 we have rocky glen and another that will be on lackawanna avenue in scranton that commemorates the coal workers and iron workers strike of 1877
355653 we hear a lot about our heritage and our ancestors
355654 one thing that makes those stories more real is how they spent their leisure time and many of them spent that time at rocky glen

355681 he was a man with real backbone and stiff upper lip what more could we want from someone to be our town serjeant
355682 he was so popular with all the mayors he served ensuring that everything goes smoothly on the day
355683 but there was much much more than just the civic side colchester will have seen of him and he always did it with a smile on his face
355684 he was highly respected and liked by all who met him i extend my condolences to richards family during a very sad time he is going to be greatly missed
355685 probably ricks proudest moment as town serjeant was accompanying the mayor of the time john bouckley when the queen visited the town in november 2004
355686 it was commented at the time that the queen and prince philip had received a particularly warm and enthusiastic reception from the large crowds of well wishers who gathered outside the town hall

355690 we can do it we feel we can do it blah blah
355691 hey i look at this like the elite 8 in college basketball win 3 and you win it all
355692 the pace we start with is the pace we finish with
355693 i recognized how easily the whole situation could escalate kobe rebels against authority with the new powerful authority figures in his life the police the prosecutors etc i was quite certain he would look for a way to rebel more than ever doing and saying things that would not be in his interest
355694 trainer gary vitti told us that kobe has been threatening again to opt out of his contract vowing to take slava with me slava was this an indication of kobes being totally out of touch with reality
355695 will passionately argue despite having no facts or spewing illogical and usually incorrect facts to support their stance
355696 youre not gonna believe this mitch kupchak said telling me about kobe and the rape allegations in colorado was i surprised yes but not entirely kobe can be consumed with surprising anger which hes displayed toward me and his teammates
355697 why dont the two get along i have my theories one of which is that shaquille is making the type of money about 25 million a year that kobe will never earn due to the changes in the leagues collective bargaining agreement no matter how many mvp trophies he might collect in the decade ahead there is nothing he can do about this discrepancy in fact the word i got was that kobe was the only player in the entire league who voted against the agreement because of the cap it puts on salaries
355698 a part of kobe desperately wants to be in the group to enjoy the camaraderie of his teammates basketball serving as his only true escape but there is another part of kobe which often wins out a part that wants perhaps needs to be isolated from the group to have it both ways is simply impossible one can be the leader of the group but one must be inside the circle
355699 no one understands me and im alone in this world but i know deep inside im better than these sobs anyway
355700 thanks former celtics teammate kevin mchale once a celtic always a celtic right
355701 personal friends if yall lookin for me my numbers about to change
355702 i hate that all this has happened i love tampa my family loves it here but ive been quiet long enough i feel like its time to let everybody know why im not out there
355703 i was nowhere near ready to go for the preseason game
355704 i dont know what the reason was for having me out there and for coach to say during camp that i was healthy and just wasnt practicing well that was a low blow
355705 i mean he never once sat down at any point with me and asked me what i was going through how i felt even as a person that said a lot to me thats why i feel like i can never play for him again
355706 congratulations to pau gasol on being the first human to never have committed a personal foul
355707 romanians see certain criminal activities such as using public transport without a ticket prostitution and stealing pirated music movies off the internet as perfectly justified and barely wrong at all
355708 that being said all violent crimes are considered absolutely abhorrent and those who commit them as the worst of the worst
355709 alcoholism and alcoholic behavior is only mildly frowned upon and is often tolerated and or celebrated drug use however is considered quite abhorrent
355710 da ba mai bine intr un mediu ingaduitor si intelept in care sa te

355719 we deserve to stay in existence because we are so important to the lives of children
355720 there are so few places in our community for them to be in a safe and nurturing environment
355721 no amount of processed meat is considered safe to eat
355722 a lot of what we get comes to us from the federal food program and we trust that they do their job make sure everything is healthy and on the up and up
355723 we want to assure citizens that our kids are getting healthy wholesome meals
355724 we care about their food these kids are our responsibility
355725 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
355726 we just want to teach parents and school food services directors about the importance of healthy choices
355727 large amounts of red or processed meat over a long period
355728 there are lots of reasons not to give your children large quantities of processed meats cancer is one but there are better ones like high calories high sodium and high fat
355729 if your child eats hot dogs once in a while i dont think that you need to worry that theyll get cancer
355730 we have stacked up health risks by increasing the volume and the frequency of processed foods
355731 there are alternatives there are schools across the nation that are doing quite well
355732 processed meats appear to have carcinogenic properties or agents that can indeed cause cancer its a real issue
355733 processed meats do play an important role in a balanced diet that includes fruits vegetables grains and dairy products
355734 john mccains support of the moratorium on offshore drilling during his first presidential campaign was certainly laudable but his decision to completely change his position and tell a group of houston oil executives exactly what they wanted to hear today was the same washington politics that has prevented us from achieving energy independence for decades
355735 opening our coastlines to offshore drilling would take at least a decade to produce any oil at all and the effect on gasoline prices would be negligible at best since america only has 3 percent of the worlds oil

355831 we gifted them three goals in the first half in the first half we still played some of our best soccer attacking the three early mistakes its hard to come back from that against a veteran championship team like vancouver
355832 we needed to see what they were going to throw at us we knew they were going to make a change we had to let them see the same thing they saw in the first half for a bit it gives us a little bit of time on the sidelines to check the flow of the game
355833 i think its concentration weve been struggling a lot this season with our marking in the box and stuff like that its simple stuff we know we can play were a very good team but little moments of lack of concentration have been killing us if youre not marked up in the box it just takes one kick of the ball and its a goal
355834 itd be nice to get that first goal and then put a team with the second goal is what we desire we get that and all of a sudden you start playing with some confidence
355835 today to be able to play 30 35 minutes on it hard helps my confidence for the weekend i try to take away the good from it its been nice to just watch sitting out you can watch and learn a lot but its hard watching and not being able to help the team out

355837 we are sad to hear of the apparent death of this gentleman mr al masri and we extend our condolences to his family
355838 i say that because we have not completely established the circumstances or the facts of whats happened here

355885 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
355886 this we have to say it remember this is just a football game no matter who wins or loses
355887 we are really offended by lees remarks and now it seems if we do ratify the charter we are just giving in to pressure from singapore
355888 the internal processes of member countries differ but the pace of asean integration should not be set by its slowest members or else all will be held back by the problems of a few
355889 we are still examining the charter but lees remarks have negatively affected us
355890 indonesia as the biggest asean country should not agree to following the consensus decision making process included in the charter because it means a country with three or four million people could dictate to a country with 200 million people
355891 there is a lot of concern here over several clauses in the charter such as the one on human rights which is just not clear
355892 we have examined the charter and we are still wondering what we can get from it i think we are only granting many advantages to other countries without getting anything from it
355893 we are still examining the charter but lees remarks have negatively affected us
355894 they tend to be a bit emotional when it comes to singapore and are easily offended
355895 the fact is there has been a delay in ratifying the document by indonesia and the legislators should come out to explain why they are against the charter instead of reacting emotionally
355896 to ratify would be to sell out on the values and principles indonesia stands for including democracy freedom and human rights values and principles that are universal and acknowledged by the asean eminent persons group

355902 next months democratic national convention committee hoop de dooing in denvers pepsi center is consumed with onion rings cheeseburgers ribs gravy snickers bars and hot dogs
355903 theyve actually sent delegates a paper guaranteeing the convention will serve french fries greasy catfish chicken fingers fried mini doughnuts potato chips pizza sausages and bacon
355904 were not aware of any letter that went to our delegates on this food front

355907 we can do anything our taxpayers want to pay for
355908 although standing ready to fulfill the essential judicial role to say what the law is on specific assertions of executive privilege that may be presented the court strongly encourages the political branches to resume their discourse and negotiations in an effort to resolve their differences constructively while recognizing each branchs essential role
355909 insecurity has spread to areas which were previously relatively stable in parts of north northwest and central afghanistan
355910 aid organizations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
355911 has dishonored himself and brought discredit to the house and merits the censure of the house for same
355912 instead of keeping their promise to drain the swamp of corruption in washington house democrats are sinking in it
355913 the reattachment appears up to now to have proceeded optimally
355914 violence is down to its lowest level since the spring of 2004 and were now in our third consecutive month with reduced violence levels holding steady
355915 hey theyre really is an insular clique of the famous people
355916 if you do not trust in god then you are not one of us
355917 i worry about dogmatism and the kind of zealotry that motivates the faithful to blow themselves up shoot abortion doctors and persecute homosexuals
355918 i have no reason that i can explain to you i was out in nature and it just struck me with a certainty that i cannot explain that you are to be beaten to a bloody pulp do not ask me to explain it this comes from a special way of knowing that transcends all reason
355919 hey by a wonderful coincidence the things that we can know by a special way of knowing are things that do not make us a threat to others while things that would make us a threat to others are things that can be known by reason things where we can meet the moral demand of those we would harm that we provide reasons
355920 i have a special way of knowing that others should e harmed
355921 we are not seeing a catastrophic collapse in the job market like you often see in recessions
355922 what we are seeing instead is a steady hemorrhaging of jobs and that is going to continue until housing stabilizes and stops dragging down the rest of the economy
355923 parents dont push their kids to go to work in good times
355924 but they probably are doing so now with gasoline and food prices squeezing family budgets
355925 its quite funny that the things that i kill to make a living are the things that kept me alive
355926 when they found me i just fell on the ground i collapsed it all just came too much at once
355927 we played really well again tonight the bullpen was outstanding
355928 i thought we did a good job of laying off pitches and getting him in trouble but we didnt do a good job keeping him in trouble
355929 we took care of him we helped him to do his baccalaureate
355930 he was in touch with fanatics while with us he used us to get money and information
355931 we felt that maybe fundamentalists sent him expecting that we would be harsh and beat him up
355932 i think hes a bit weak psychologically so they use him
355933 i dont think he is crazy perhaps strange perhaps there are others who are controlling him
355934 he said that because the parents are christians and because the girls told the court that they adopted islam their relationship has ceased
355935 the judge did not give me even a minute to speak with my daughters
355936 my girls have been with these men for the last 20 days they have pressured them to change their minds
355937 contracting marriage with a minor girl could mean that they want to have control of her with the intention of child prostitution or something else
355938 local police and judges have their subconscious mindset that if you help muslims in such cases its a very noble cause and a very religious cause
355939 well good you got her friday then im not going anywhere
355940 mtae you are an amazing worker you are focused everyday on setting an a production goal and you meet it every single day but here is something that you need to understand
355941 dont expect more out of someone than they are capable of giving
355942 why strive harder is there anything in it for me
355943 when buying a domain remember to be as anonymous as possible especially in the online casinos market since you want to avoid being price gouged by greedy sellers
355944 the thoughts of many of the old timers are shattered in the new online casinos work released by prof labonville flott and it is high time for new ideas
355945 but this years peak summer sale is less by about two percent as compared to last year
355946 you can multi task with the help of these things and save time as well
355947 since you as head of opec provide no explanation for what in our view constitutes a self serving and misleading statement that goes counter to any independent analysis of the fuels market today one can only conclude that opec views competition with biofuels as a direct threat
355948 biofuels are currently highly dependent on public funding to be viable
355949 us canada and the european union government support for the supply and use of biofuels is expected to rise to around 25bn a year by 2015 from about 11bn in 2006
355950 brazilian imports would wipe away the entire european production this is totally unacceptable
355951 surprisingly given the importance of this question in brasilia brazilian foreign minister celso amorim seemed to dismiss the value of such an offer for brazil
355952 what we expect now is full integration for ethanol into global trade ethanol should not be treated any differently because currently it is not considered a sensitive product in europe or the united states
355953 it is my hope that the american public will someday hear mr hamdans defense
355954 it is a balance between the goal of openness and the need to address some national security concerns
355955 undoubtedly an unpleasant highly regimented experience with instant rewards or loss of privileges for infractions
355956 they say its fair and open but secrecy affects every part of these proceedings
355957 unlike the idiotic agence france presse hey what do you expect
355958 so im often asked why did afp do this i have only one answer theyre french was just repeated humour right here http www buzzmachine com archives 2005 04 16 html 009473

355965 i think tonight we got a bit of our old mojo back
355966 when you slow down no 1 roberts your chances of winning go way up
355967 it was a return set up to go left and what i saw was how we executed it in practice
355968 i really only had to make one move against bombers kicker alexis serna and i knew if i got tackled by their kicker that i was going to have to buy doughnuts as punishment and i didnt want to do that
355969 we left a lot of points out there but it wasnt because we didnt control the football
355970 we gave up one big play but holding that offence to 11 points with milt on it i thought was pretty good
355971 we knocked the snot out of people and played our old defence
355972 i told a lot of people during the course of the week that the first time a player plays theyre really pretty good
355973 i do think he has a lot of potential i think he has a great attitude and great thought process
355974 in the second quarter they started moving their protection and when you do that you cant look at the whole field
355975 when they moved their protection we adjusted by blitzing linebackers to get to him
355976 against a toronto team that makes you fight for every yard we were looking at a lot of 15 and 20 yard situations
355977 you cant afford to do that against that type of defence
355978 as soon as we got into any rhythm we got into penalties
355979 first third of the season i cant believe wed go 1 5
355980 weve got to find a way to fix it go back to the drawing board
355981 we have confidence that the district has operated within the public record laws of florida
355982 the right to a fair and impartial judge is of particular importance in the present cases
355983 has the highest incidence and mortality from cervical cancer and for this reason had the most to contribute and benefit from through participation in this study we did not have access to the necessary chemotherapy beds pharmacy and nursing care to be able to offer our patients access to this opportunity
355984 this was the first official notification of a reduction in force that starts with a reduction in the fall and continues through the end of the shuttle program
355985 there are no plans for any layoffs at this point
355986 right now johnson is supporting three programs for the first time its a new situation for us weve had two at the most in the past shuttle and station now though we have more work than ever before
355987 we have seen a marked increase in these graffiti tagging gangs taking to weapons and fighting to protect their walls their territory their name
355988 if we see someone calling the police then we target them
355989 you are trying to stop me from what i live what i believe in and what i breathe we are not going to let no one get in the way
355990 take a deep breath back off and call law enforcement
355991 why would you want to put spray paint on a kids face
355992 we live in the same community we are all in this hellhole together
355993 he did not play any role he was not a soldier he was a driver
355994 his nature was more primitive bedouin person and far from civilization he was not fit to plan or execute
355995 he was a driver and auto mechanic he was not at all a military man
355996 he is fit to change trucks tires change oil filters wash and clean cars and fasten cargo in pickup trucks
355997 i was personally responsible for transporting and getting out all families from afghanistan to pakistan
355998 salim hamdan was not involved in any planning for attacks
355999 to me it is scary to buy food that you dont know how or where it was grown
356000 this rule potentially will have an impact on all participants in the supply chain
356001 the greatest impact will be on retailers and intermediaries handlers processors wholesalers and importers while the impact on individual producers is likely to be relatively small
356002 i dont think its negative i think were drawing differences between us
356003 brought up the issue of race i responded to it because im disappointed and i dont want that issue to be part of this campaign
356004 i was in union missouri which is 98 percent white and what i said was what i think everybody knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates
356005 there was nobody there who thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this what this has become i think is a typical pattern from the mccain campaign whether its paris hilton or britney or this phony allegation that i wouldnt visit troops they seem to be focused on a negative campaign
356006 the mccain campaign has clearly made the decision that there really is not a road too low for them to travel
356007 why is it that that you have not spoken to the issues or spoken on behalf of the african community
356008 that doesnt mean im always going to satisfy the way you guys want me to talk which gives you the option of voting for someone else which gives you the option of running for office yourself
356009 helpless child sitting unattended unkempt and unwashed in a small stroller in her own urine and feces
356010 i dont want to speculate but what generally happens is that they either get the bends or something goes wrong with the equipment
356011 some of the divers went back down and ended up recovering his body
356012 what we heard is that his oxygen tank went out and his scuba buddy got separated from him
356013 the water was too hard to see in and they didnt find him until an hour after his oxygen ran out
356014 they have to check his tanks and so forth and with the tanks it could take a couple months
356015 a full service provider of turnkey solutions to the telecommunications cable television and various other industries
356016 he liked really unique things that told a story by themselves
356017 he wanted to do this the andrea doria dive to test how far he could go
356018 he heard how dangerous it was and he loved doing dangerous things he loved going over and beyond
356019 there were some of them that shouldnt have been there
356020 i will later scuba just to continue his dream of how he wanted things to be
356021 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
356022 its been seven years theres a lot of unanswered questions
356023 and i think the american people deserve to know more than they do today
356024 act on their own in ways that are not in convergence
356025 we need to identify these people and weed them out
356026 that would spell danger to pakistan in the long run they america want to make us subservient to india
356027 the isi is under the policy directive of the man who calls the shots
356028 it may not be the prime minister it may not be the president but the army chief is always kept in the loop
356029 if your perception as the pakistan army is that raw the indian intelligence agency and the cia are acting in unison then you try to protect yourself
356030 you do not give them the taliban sufficient room to completely take over afghanistan but you do enough to stop growing indian influence
356031 its a very disciplined organization but with a very large freedom of action
356032 when they get a policy directive they have certain room for manoeuvre keeping the interests of the state in view
356033 the pakistan army is like a woman with multiple lovers she has to satisfy them all
356034 the clients have their own agenda and room for manoeuvre its a very very murky relationship and the attacks in pakistan show that many operators have gone rogue
356035 the biggest issue is not what pakistan is doing in afghanistan it is its unwillingness to target any militant organization on pakistani soil
356036 but the general assumption in washington is that a mixed and unreliable ally is better than no ally at all
356037 she was moving her hand i was shocked she was alive
356038 we found no scrapes or cuts on her we had doubted she would even be alive
356039 shes in a lot of pain but shes a spunky little girl and shes going to pull through
356040 i learned how to compromise somewhat and i love making buttons and shirts and playing drums i mean i learned how to play drums completely
356041 we loved everything about it and so did the kids
356042 my husband and i dont want to get to italy with a 13 year old and be looking at each other and thinking
356043 it quickly went from a brainstorming session to an oh my god what have we gotten ourselves into moment
356044 what i liked is that i didnt have to be the mom on this trip
356045 sometimes they dont understand that 45 minutes means 45 minutes
356046 some people believe that you can even see the ghost of marco polo wandering these streets
356047 the opportunity to wander a vast glacier frozen in time
356048 more like the chance to look at a dirty patch of snow
356049 we would go as each grandchild hit 3 or 4 but we havent gone as much in recent years
356050 the talk creeps in and you cant really start pressing or let it affect you on the mound
356051 once i walk out to the mound my adrenaline is going and im not thinking of anything else but getting outs
356052 they liked me here but they had their own plan
356053 shes from salt lake city and she goes between baltimore and there and if i had gotten traded it would have been awhile before we were in the same place again
356054 i didnt want to have her go through that again
356055 i like it in baltimore i like this team putting this uniform on and im happy to be here
356056 that was the most annoying aspect of it all having to answer the same questions every day im glad thats over with
356057 to this point its been almost a month and all hes done is play some soft catch in the cage
356058 so for all intents and purposes he has been shut down
356059 we want to make sure hell be able to throw later in the year and next year
356060 hes going to go out there and eventually say yeah im ready that rest solved the problem or hes going to say you know what this things still hurting i dont know whats wrong and weve got to go more in depth to find out whats wrong
356061 the swing still isnt as consistent as id like because when i take a good swing i can feel it
356062 the throwing i think is going to be ok because its not as tender but the hitting getting extension and coming down on the ball is the only concern its just a matter of feeling good enough that i can take consistently good swings
356063 were really just kind of tossing around still two or three guys that were considering
356064 i dont know that it will be next week or whatever but i think well see rowland smith in the near future
356065 rather than let it be a chronic thing we want to let it calm down
356066 when he says its calmed down and he can get out there and fire the ball around well run him out there
356067 the rule is from the commissioners office when someone gets ejected from a game for throwing at somebody it comes with a suspension
356068 our feelings are he has to go pitch and have some success and hes got to do better against left handed hitters
356069 look we concede obama is popular but having said that is popular actually a presidential qualification
356070 i suspect that this line of attack can be effective against obama
356071 because all hollywood people are liberals damn you you independents why cant you drink the kool aid we feed you
356072 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
356073 you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
356074 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
356075 there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race
356076 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
356077 and i dont remember anyone in the mainstream media getting thrills up their legs when he spoke
356078 obama on the other hand has a very thin resume
356079 and his strong belief in who he is hes not trying to reinvent himself every day as jimmy carter was ronald reagan reminds me of a lot of ceos i know who run big companies and spend most of their time on their favorite charitable events or lunch with their pals and kind of have a broad based philosophy of how they want their companies run reagans got that kind of broad based philosophy about how he wants the government run and hes got all these killers who are willing and able to do that for him
356080 personally i think they should have an electoral rule that if
356081 i was trying so hard to do good things that i slipped up and did bad ones as well
356082 i was trying so hard to be nice to women that i slipped up and killed a few
356083 i was trying so hard to save people money that i slipped up and stole a few billion
356084 was admired and liked by most who had known him he was a sharp businessman who had spent his time when not building up his contracting company hosting elaborate street parties for friends and neighbors dressing as a clown and entertaining children at local hospitals and immersing himself in organizations such as the jaycees working to make his community a better place to live
356085 thought of him as a generous friendly and hard working man devoted to his family and community
356086 here here from this point forward only those citizens creating personal wealth by putting forth beer pizza porn ooops strike that and tech devices are worthy of joining the club
356087 i was trying so hard to be a good cook that i slipped up and ate people
356088 what about the economy why are we tanking so hard why am i losing my job
356089 about as absurd as deciding a presidential election based on popularity
356090 wait a minute didnt you have a position a hundred and eighty degrees from this three months ago
356091 theyre too dumb to vote the issues that effect them they must be voting something else and i think its
356092 youre too ignorant to know whats best for you so ill take care of it for you
356093 it is currently in the republicans interest to remind people that it is absurd to pick a president based on the candidates popularity
356094 mccain the pow navy pilot will have an easier time selling himself as the experientially smart candidate
356095 he was a pow so that will forever outweigh anything else about the man
356096 while not exactly addressing why he is popular i e that the republican brand is massively unpopular and that obamas policies are appealing its so much in their interest to trash obama to deflect from their own defects that they dont mind lying to make the point
356097 i also think its a bit of a shame that an entire national political party cant think of a better way to win a presidential election than this
356098 i am the reliable old soldier who saw battle and can guide us in this new war
356099 if elected i promise that nothing will get done in washington dc
356100 id say theres difference between third party ads and ads coming from the candidate himself to wit the candidate himself has to sign off on the lying
356101 i believe we are failing in our strategy in vietnam and must reconsider
356102 as long as americans are not be injured or harmed or wounded or killed
356103 heres the trick however wealthy mccain and his wife are they dont rub peoples noses in it
356104 obama on the other hand has a very thin resume
356105 last time we elected a president with that resume he turned out to be pretty good
356106 i believe if kerry had never done winter soldier never become a visible anti war activist upon his return regardless of how he actually felt about the war itself hed have won 2004 and the swiftboat campaign would have failed
356107 being rich is one thing making other people feel poor is another
356108 the gop only respects vets when it is politically useful
356109 i understand how hard it is for poor and working families in america
356110 oh god its so hard i just went and got my pilots license and it cost like thousands of dollars like how do working americans do it
356111 yes its hard for middle america and barack and i want to help
356112 oh wow its so hard barack and i spend ten large every year so our kids can have an upper crust after school life i know how it is
356113 back when i was a girl i remember how tough it was and you didnt have money
356114 this would ring true to her experience and would not sound vaguely insulting
356115 who spoils their kids is a far cry from who rubs poor peoples nose in their poverty
356116 reagans got that kind of broad based philosophy about how he wants the government run and hes got all these killers who are willing and able to do that for him
356117 you keep using that word i do not think it means what you think it means
356118 the comment threads are turning against obama the race will be close
356119 the couch potatos ultimate fantasy a tablet that keeps your body slim and fit without you having to move a muscle
356120 there had been a lot of talk that i was going to be traded to a couple teams but i guess florida wanted me more its great to come over here on a winning team
356121 once you get traded you come over to a new team and you just got to come over and do what you do
356122 you just got to keep your arm in shape and do everything in the offseason do everything right and you can play this game a long time
356123 if the cabinets support rates remain low there is a possibility that moves to oust fukuda will become public due to anxiety about fighting an election with him as the campaign poster boy
356124 that is why some think that the appointment of aso is a strategic step toward replacing fukuda ahead of the election
356125 i will support the fukuda cabinet and put in my best effort
356126 for aso cooperating with fukuda is a risk if they lose the election he will go down with fukuda
356127 but if fukuda steps down before the election there will be a chance for aso to take the reins
356128 it could also backfire and that cannot be helped that is a matter of chance

356132 he was responsible for reviewing of all construction plans especially commercial ones
356133 the amount of projects completed under his watch would astound you
356134 but i mean i like everybodys verse because i think that lupe killed it kanye killed it mine was more about style than how dope the rhyme was it was really my melody that i liked more than anything thats why my vocal approach was a little different from what you would hear me do i wanted to just do something different that would look different on me

356141 but theres a twist theres another objective the government sees with the olympics to mobilize chinese peoples patriotism nationalism and national spirit

356143 in the face of impossible odds people who love their country can change it

356221 projects move really quickly once the steel work begins and people start to see the building come into form so weve seen some heads turn as folks drive by

356244 at the moment we are playing a ball game to win provincial support
356245 but provided it is within the constitution and canons of the province there is no harm in having a diocese declare itself in sympathy with a covenant
356246 to be a stick to whack people over the head with it is meant to be a beautiful

356256 demonstrated admirable restraint and respect for obama in the last few weeks
356257 mccain has drawn a bright line and said thats unacceptable
356258 its a genuine reflex he really wants the campaign to be civil
356259 he didnt have a problem calling mitt romney a phony in new hampshire or comparing george w bush to bill clinton in south carolina in 2000
356260 mccain is a tough guy hell do whatever he needs to do
356261 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
356262 i think people have realised that there are not going to be any resolutions and some feel frustrated and wanted some kind of definitive statements to take home with them part of what this process is about is listening to different viewpoints the drafters of the covenant will revise the covenant in the light of these its the only sensible way it may seem a long drawn out process but it will go to the anglican consultative council and then come back to the provinces who will then decide if it is acceptable to them or not there is no point in submitting it to churches now who will tear it apart the windsor continuation group has involved listening to the reactions to the proposals and it will go away and these further suggestions will be brought to the anglican consultative council and then go to the provinces
356263 the great struggle before us at this conference is defining what it means to be the church and how can we remain in communion with each other despite deep theological differences i have argued here strongly for an inclusive church that does not exclude anyone of my brothers and sisters in christ because of their differences to be a christian is not to give intellectual assent to a body of doctrine no matter how passionately the institutional church has held on to them to be a christian is to follow a living christ who continues to lead us to places where we do not want to go and calling us to love and embrace those whom we would rather be more like us in every way the traditions of the church ground us but we cannot become slaves to tradition if they have caused us to limit the scope of the reach of christ in our day such has been the unfortunate history of the church whenever it has found itself on the wrong side of scientific revelations and on the wrong side of using biblical and theological interpretations that have resulted in the subjugation of people who cry out for justice have we not been here before when the church used holy scripture to justify human slavery of keeping women in their place of persecuting left handed people im not kidding here this was very common how many times must our childrens children have to apologize for the mistakes and oppressions their leaders in the faith have committed in the name of christ
356264 the amount of time left versus the amount of action needed is coming to a predictable impasse i see fatigue in the faces of many bishops i almost wish we could be roman catholics when the popes dies for a couple of days and they would put us in canterbury cathedral and brick up the doors since we dont seem to have that polity heathrow and gatwick will be open for business on sunday
356265 the freedom is when we are free from all influence
356266 i do respect true americans whom opposed these terrifying acts
356267 the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
356268 hold on a second i want everybody to be respectful
356269 in the face of all these attacks that are clearly being made on the african community why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community or the black community in this country
356270 on each of these issues that youve mentioned i have spoken out and ive spoken out forcefully now i may not have spoken out the way that you would have wanted me to speak out which is fine
356271 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
356272 it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down your own debt
356273 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
356274 what i said was what i think everybody knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates there was nobody there who thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this
356275 what this has become i think is a typical pattern from the mccain campaign they seem to be focused on a negative campaign and what i think our campaign wants to do is focus on the issues that matter to american families
356276 were simply going to see this geopolitical item come into play and give us these price spikes from time to time
356277 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
356278 apologies have been expressed in the indaba discussion groups by some of the episcopal church who had no idea that their action in the consecration of the current bishop of new hampshire had caused such a negative impact in many parts of the communion
356279 while there is a desire to end the spiral of chaos around this issue there appears to be no desire to be so decisive at this stage that anyone would want to walk away
356280 in some places the church is ridiculed as the gay church
356281 it is felt in some provinces as a betrayal of the teaching of the missionaries who brought the faith and it is experienced as a new form of colonisation
356282 decisive action if your eye cause offence pluck it out
356283 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
356284 even the pope is elected by his peers but what anglicans have is a man appointed by a secular government over the past five years we have come to see this as a remnant of british colonialism and it is not serving us well
356285 the spiritual leadership of a global communion of independent and autonomous provinces should not be reduced to one man appointed by a secular government
356286 our internal anglican communion life and the conflicts within it are having a negative effect on ecumenical conversations
356287 we must acknowledge that there are great tensions in our relationship at present and an erosion of trust between us
356288 expressed our convictions clearly but with generosity and respect to the other
356289 then we held hands and said we have got to journey together
356290 in my own church we have got intense sexual activity among adolescents
356291 we all have the duty to have a personal conscience i can believe something is right but i can also believe that for the sake of the communion i can abstain
356292 i have the desire to listen i pray we can all be together i do believe schism can be avoided
356293 men committed shameless acts with men and received in themselves the due penalty for their error

356296 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
356297 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
356298 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
356299 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
356300 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
356301 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
356302 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
356303 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
356304 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
356305 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
356306 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
356307 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

356310 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
356311 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
356312 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
356313 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
356314 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
356315 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
356316 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
356317 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
356318 look if you give me the names of three more potential wedding couples that i might call to promote to my venue i will give you a 70 discount 4900
356319 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
356320 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
356321 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
356322 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

356354 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
356355 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

356358 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
356359 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
356360 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
356361 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
356362 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
356363 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy

356427 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
356428 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
356429 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
356430 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

356462 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
356463 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
356464 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
356465 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
356466 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
356467 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
356468 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
356469 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
356470 94 of mobile marketing messages are read 23 forwarded to friends
356471 marketing to billions of individuals while acknowledging their individuality and respecting their privacy is the biggest challenge mobile marketers face
356472 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
356473 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
356474 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
356475 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
356476 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
356477 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
356478 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
356479 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
356480 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
356481 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
356482 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
356483 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
356484 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
356485 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
356486 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
356487 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
356488 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
356489 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate

356493 today we learned that 51 000 jobs were lost last month the seventh straight month of job loss now totaling 463 000 jobs lost since the beginning of this year
356494 ive already called for an economic stimulus package on two different occasions this year and much of what ive proposed has passed in congress these efforts have made some difference but with job losses mounting prices rising increased turbulence in our financial system and a growing credit crunch we need to do more
356495 a state like florida would get a disproportionate share because of its high foreclosure rate
356496 this would simplify taxes for senior citizens provide real benefits and also work incentives
356497 ordinary voters are tired of these swift boating attempts to bring out the negative side
356498 it doesnt mean were going to win all those states but at least were making it a contest and giving voters something to choose from
356499 virginia north carolina and georgia are all states where we are competitive
356500 so far at least weve been successful in places that nobody guessed would be successful
356501 we have a big map that were playing with thats no accident we said at the beginning of this campaign that one of the changes wed like to make in our politics was breaking out of this red blue state divide and going to places that maybe no one has gone to for a while and trying to make the case for change
356502 we are going to have a presence all throughout the state with these offices were hitting a lot of these rural communities that were impacted by bushs economic policies

356537 there are some things that we keep to ourselves that make our club special in our hearts
356538 my appeal for the christian attitude was directed at people who think that making a statement such as all the girls clubs are filled with sluts is acceptable that statement right there is completely immature and hearkens back to the days of middle school and high school bickering if you truly wish to make an argument at least use facts and fact based opinions as far as the generalizations about hazing and boozing go hazing is a loosely defined term in the legal system used to describe any act done towards an individual to inflict mental and physical facts even lowry and the deans recognize that the law is completely vague technically by the letter of the law taking finals is considered hazing that came straight from lowrys mouth

356543 een paar jaar geleden zijn de tarieven behoorlijk verhoogd de raad wilde de huwelijksvoltrekkingen kostendekkend maken dat waren ze namelijk niet gemeenten waar trouwen zo goed koop is leggen er zelf geld bij
356544 ja trouwen kost meer dan de 99 30 euro die wij vragen
356545 waarom dat zo is tja dat beslist de raad vroeger met de gemeentelijke herindeling hebben we het gemiddelde genomen van alle vroegere gemeenten blijkbaar was dat een laag bedrag en dat is het dus gebleven nu gaat het elk jaar een klein beetje omhoog met 3 procent ofzo
356546 als dat nu massaal gaat gebeuren dan gaan de tarieven volgend jaar misschien wel flink omhoog
356547 maar serieus blijkbaar is er tot nu toe nog geen reden geweest om het bedrag te verhogen en dat is inderdaad fijn voor de mensen hier

356601 theyre good to do and we like to do it it gives people something to think about
356602 the interesting thing is when we knock on doors in the neighborhood the adults dont recognize our church name but from behind them a kid pops up and says oh is that the church that has the sign out front
356603 its not frequent but its often enough people are paying attention
356604 we hope that it stimulates somebody to have a spiritual thought that day
356605 its an interesting way to catch peoples attention it sneaks up on you when youre unaware and suddenly something is there that makes you think or remember something
356606 were trying to get our message across and others are trying to get their message across and hopefully certainly our message is different
356607 everybody is looking for a message and something to believe in
356608 this is a way to get people in to the church if it looks appealing from the outside it will probably be appealing on the inside
356609 when you go to church you think its really serious and really heavy then you get there and find a joke on a big sign its kind of a non sequitur
356610 people are looking to the church for something and looking for some kind of message
356611 they are looking for a message from the church and they expect it as well so its better to have something to say
356612 if this character were before us in a court of law and we were the judges what would we ask him her in order to establish to our liking his her credibility
356613 if you happened upon this scene say an argument between two characters how might you assess which character is right and which is wrong
356614 how does the characters background establish certain predilections or motives

356626 beth will be so deeply missed by all her family and friends

356634 im not that bothered about football i know that joe corrigan is pretty much a manchester legend my husband laughed when i told him hes a united fan he plays football and once played against him in a charity match

356643 so of course it became immediate panic because our equipment was up here and three of us were up here the rest had to be shuttled in by air planes last minute its been complete pandemonium
356644 complex systems improve when the best performers play by the same rules over extended periods of time as systems improve they equilibrate and variation decreases
356645 if the combination of the web and commercial enterprise it really was a game changer for the competitive game of business then the introduction of these technologies should be accompanied not by a decrease in variation in performance but instead by the opposite an increase in performance spread among competitors
356646 for virtually all the ratios we considered variation in high it industries started to increase in the mid 1990s and stayed high after that with some exceptions during the post 2000 economic slump the less it an industry had the less pronounced this trend was

356658 he was a little bit of feast or famine he did some really good things at times and then sometimes hed have some mental lapses that really hurt a defense
356659 hes done an excellent job of being much more focused this year

356672 yeah but the real question is what is he doing behind the door of his truck and why is the ground getting wet
356673 please if he is peeing in the parking lot do we really want to know about it
356674 sure we can tell all the guys of course theyre disgusting men so theyll enjoy it
356675 are you the one they talk about so much going to college
356676 its very very helpful to have a student in the class who along with me remembers lyndon johnson and his presidency who remembers nixon who remembers jimmy carter
356677 younger students have read about and heard about it but they havent lived through those administrations and all the things that occurred then joann offers a very welcome perspective shes lived long enough to see a great deal
356678 i dont have that many more years to live and i want to do good for humanity while im here
356679 i always felt like one moment youre not on your toes watching thats the moment they would get you
356680 if i was still in the mobile check cashing business i wouldnt be talking to you right now
356681 and if you take the proper precautions its no longer worthwhile

356684 said michele hlavsa an epidemiologist with the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta which has noted a national increase in crypto cases in the past few years
356685 this was a truly despicable crime committed by deadly brutal young men who were deadly dangerous to anyone who might find themselves near them all five were sentenced to death by separate juries after hearing all of the evidence in each of their individual trials
356686 no matter how long the courts of this state this nation or any other nation review re review and re review once again the disgusting facts of this crime and these perpetrators the result should be the same these juries reached a reasonable verdict beyond a reasonable doubt that a sentence of death was the only appropriate punishment under texas law
356687 children just have a sense of wonderment with the universe
356688 when they find a worm or a caterpillar for the first time they just go hog wild

356692 when i found out i could pursue a career in conservation it was a great epiphany and has become a great source of fulfillment
356693 i dont want to speculate but what generally happens is that they either get the bends or something goes wrong with the equipment
356694 some of the divers went back down and ended up recovering his body
356695 what we heard is that his oxygen tank went out and his scuba buddy got separated from him
356696 the water was too hard to see in and they didnt find him until an hour after his oxygen ran out
356697 they have to check his tanks and so forth and with the tanks it could take a couple months
356698 a full service provider of turnkey solutions to the telecommunications cable television and various other industries
356699 he liked really unique things that told a story by themselves
356700 he wanted to do this the andrea doria dive to test how far he could go
356701 he heard how dangerous it was and he loved doing dangerous things he loved going over and beyond
356702 there were some of them that shouldnt have been there
356703 i will later scuba just to continue his dream of how he wanted things to be
356704 we were able to pay those two bills for those two months
356705 but what about the older people or the people who are on fixed income and they cant pay that kind of bill
356706 i realize that it was my responsibility to keep up with my own contract and im kicking myself in the rear for not doing so
356707 but in all honesty never in my 55 years before had i ever needed a contract for a certain rate with the electricity provider live and learn
356708 i truly believe that because when telecommunications deregulated i saw people jumping from phone company to phone company to phone company to get the 100 rebate and the free toaster
356709 and they would get with a company that offers a great deal for 12 months and then you get killed
356710 if weve got reports of unresolved complaints or billing issues we are warning you no matter how good your rate is youre potentially getting into trouble
356711 we worry about the new attitude to the team we are adding talent to the team and we need that but building team chemistry is important
356712 i talked to him last night china time about a misunderstanding on the report
356713 its better when we have a chance to sit down and talk face to face
356714 before training camp before the season we have a lot of time i think we can be good friends
356715 hopefully hes not fighting anymore and going after a guy in the stands
356716 if something i said would make ron feel uncomfortable i apologize
356717 im really sorry about that because i still dont know him very well still by the time we stay together obviously i will fix it
356718 right now the rockets made a good trade for us and we got a good player
356719 oh great lets make a movie that shocks the kids into becoming recycling nuts who cant leave seattle for fear of running into a place where they dont recycle everything god forbid
356720 it is not good that the man should be alone
356721 very expensive for schultz and his partners if he did not enter the citys settlement
356722 at no time during the conversation did i threaten mr schultz in any way either expressly or implicitly regarding his continuation of this lawsuit or any other matter stern wrote in the document filed friday in seattles federal court
356723 pleasant and amiable conversation with schultz that covered social and business issues and wrote that he didnt understand why schultz would
356724 i explained to him that such a promise could not be made because these were issues for future deliberations of committees of the nba board of governors and the board itself
356725 he wasnt a rockefeller they got divorced over identity issues
356726 they werent getting along they couldnt stand one another she was like a ceo working from 7 a m to 10 p m and he never had a job she got sick of it
356727 he loved his daughter and was devastated when he lost custody
356728 he should have found another way this is not good for anyone
356729 reigh has been described as having a bright infectious smile beautiful blond hair blue eyes and is smart outgoing confident and affectionate
356730 she will converse with anyone has a large vocabulary uses big words and speaks with a british accent
356731 permanent white patch of hair on the back of his head that is difficult to conceal
356732 we knew he was a troubled young man who was in and out of jail
356733 but one thing is to be in trouble with the law and another to kill people and cut them to pieces
356734 the guy was a real respectable guy wouldnt bother anybody
356735 ive never seen him have a quarrel he was a big guy but he wasnt a bully
356736 he was very popular everybody liked him he wasnt somebody to get involved in drugs or anything like that
356737 we suspect he would have raped her had he not been scared off by something he heard
356738 the woman was unconscious and thankfully doesnt remember that part of the attack
356739 there is supposedly 24 hour security but at 1 or 2 in the morning theyre not there
356740 we dont place restrictions or ground rules on any press
356741 we certainly expect that his interview be broadcast if not in full then not edited in a way that would in any way mischaracterize what he said
356742 its surprising that someone who works in freedom would make that kind of comparison
356743 have a record of saying they wont edit and then turning around and editing anyway
356744 this is nothing more than a modern day trail of tears
356745 when we open on monday were not going to be really organized at first but were happy to finally be reopening
356746 to what extent were not sure but we believe she was run over
356747 when we open on monday were not going to be really organized at first but were happy to finally be reopening
356748 these snakes like others are usually not dangerous to humans unless they feel threatened in some way such as being stepped on and surprised cornered or not properly handled
356749 residents are being advised to be vigilant in watching for the remaining snake in and around weedy brushy and especially rocky areas
356750 they commonly sun themselves in the morning hours although they are not expected to survive our climate outside captivity they are nocturnal and prey for food at night and are not usually seen during the daytime except early morning hours
356751 when we open on monday were not going to be really organized at first but were happy to finally be reopening
356752 what kind of city doesnt budget for regular wage increases anyway
356753 there is no way they wouldve offered a salary increase if the budget wasnt approved for that
356754 so where their numbers are coming from i dont even know
356755 how can you pick and choose there could be leaking fuel oil hazards that could become a problem
356756 but if theyre doing that then how would they do patient care
356757 it wouldve been cheaper for the city to leave us alone and move on
356758 in 2003 the city hired someone at the same law office and paid him 150 per hour thats a 50 percent increase in five years on wages there
356759 a person like me who lives in the city and works for it im pretty much paying taxes for someone to fight against me
356760 is a special area of law im not versed in labor law thats a full time job
356761 frankly they never should have done it in house last time that was a big mistake you know why that contract negotiation went pretty well because they firefighters got everything they asked for
356762 this kind of stuff is hard for us to swallow to us its upsetting
356763 when we open on monday were not going to be really organized at first but were happy to finally be reopening
356764 were glad the investigation has gotten to this point so people know were still out there looking for them
356765 all of the defendants had different roles but had some connections to each other
356766 the drugs were coming from toledo and for the most part ended up in this county
356767 when we open on monday were not going to be really organized at first but were happy to finally be reopening
356768 we know we need buildings this is the first time that the district has been eligible for money from the commission we can build now for less in the future the money may be less available from the commission and the cost of building materials is going to go up
356769 its a prudent investment in our community if the levy fails at the end of the day it is not going to change the districts needs for buildings we can build now for less
356770 when we open on monday were not going to be really organized at first but were happy to finally be reopening
356771 we have a major public safety problem and we havent corrected it
356772 you have an agency that is favorably disposed to maintaining the integrity of the industrys economic situation
356773 do you enjoy your clothing and house without the truck driver you would have none of it
356774 our economy is based on the truck people dont understand the ramifications of making it more restrictive for truck drivers to drive
356775 the medical profession should be able to take care of it if they have a condition where they shouldnt be driving they should be able to catch them
356776 its one of the biggest causes of occupational death in the united states today
356777 congress has been calling for medical oversight reforms for nearly a decade and most of those calls have gone unheeded
356778 we have done a lot to recognize the deficiencies in our medical oversight program and the building blocks were establishing are very smart and very strong
356779 i wonder every day what will would have grown up to be what he would have stood for
356780 when we open on monday were not going to be really organized at first but were happy to finally be reopening
356781 when we open on monday were not going to be really organized at first but were happy to finally be reopening
356782 you make me so happy that i dont know what to say or do

356843 even if its not in the field im in its still you know if someone is laid off from working in a fast food place they might try and get a job im going for
356844 i look for a job every day but i cant find a job
356845 we have seen a marked increase in these graffiti tagging gangs taking to weapons and fighting to protect their walls their territory their name
356846 if we see someone calling the police then we target them
356847 you are trying to stop me from what i live what i believe in and what i breathe we are not going to let no one get in the way
356848 take a deep breath back off and call law enforcement
356849 i said if you are going to write on the wall write on your own wall
356850 why would you want to put spray paint on a kids face
356851 we live in the same community we are all in this hellhole together
356852 yeah and im so sure your so smart at the age of 19 please dont make me laugh any harder and i think the reason why you dont have any pics of you is cause your a fat fuk your looking kinda fat even in this pic of you fuck off
356853 our future is ripe outrageously rich in its possibilities yet unleashing the glory of that future will require a difficult labor and some may be so frightened of its birth they will refuse to abandon their nostalgia for the womb
356854 nessun bambino dovrebbe mai lavorare gli unici strumenti di lavoro che un bambino dovrebbe tenere in mano sono penne e matite
356855 she was a teacher in a position of trust and he was a juvenile
356856 the reason she was not arrested from our standpoint is because we wanted to conduct a very thorough investigation and be sure the evidence supported the allegations pretty serious allegations
356857 they were given two weeks the two weeks is up this weekend
356858 we will see what iran does in two weeks but i think the diplomatic process now has a new kind of energy to it
356859 if they do not decide to suspend then we will be in a situation where we have to return to the security council
356860 negative consequences await if they dont have a positive response to our very generous incentives package and that would possibly come in the form of sanctions
356861 if its in 16 days instead of 14 its not a problem we are not obsessed with a date
356862 a scientific breakthrough helping thousands of men and women take back control over food
356863 it takes a long time after you complete studies to go through all the data analysis and write it
356864 surprised and troubled by the promotional nature of his presentation
356865 this isnt a diet this is just another pet rock
356866 when you talk to patients whove lost 30 40 50 pounds and you see and talk to them and they call you back and they say gee you know their life has changed its a wonderful thing
356867 and its really not fair not to let people have this
356868 you know there is a very interesting plaque i once saw at the national institutes of health
356869 it said in god we trust everyone else must show data people believe what they want to believe
356870 when you cannot monitor and supervise participants in a trial thats a big problem because people will report what people will report
356871 at the end of the day doing this study was not something we made money from
356872 my experience with the sprinkles for me it really didnt work
356873 there are different things that couldve made the study more elegant
356874 bottom line is people lost 30 pounds in six months
356875 it is the responsibility of the people to vote the congress out of office for good we need action not talk
356876 we are giving our wealth to the middle east because we refuse to provide our own energy why because our congress represents the corporate state and not the people
356877 in fact every new promise that the new members of congress ran on to get elected remains exactly that an empty promise i have to laugh when i recall the self righteous finger waving of house speaker nancy pelosi and company now go on and enjoy your vacation you earned it
356878 we have all been wringing our hands about energy and our dependence on foreign oil for the past 30 years
356879 and we wonder why the public is cynical and the wrong track numbers are at an all time high
356880 members of congress and in this example i mean the majority have refused to take any action because it is easier to wait out the presidential election and then see what the climate is like because unfortunately for the people congress can choose to vote only when it is convenient to do so
356881 because there is nothing they can do for immediate energy prices and they have profound differences for the long term that are not easily reconcilable
356882 right now the publics anger at washington is mainly being taken out on the party of the president
356883 and its not likely that is going in change due to congresss failure to act during the august recess
356884 the horror of what has happened here will give me pause for thought the next time my son chooses to travel by greyhound
356885 i think that if were going to make it safe for people to travel we need to take the same measures that we do on planes
356886 its about time that airport security is used on other forms of commercial travel like trains and buses yes its going to cost money but how much is your life worth
356887 a successor shall be elected at such election for the unexpired term unless such term expires within one year immediately following the date of such general election
356888 my belief in seneca county proud still leads me to believe that seneca county has a strong future i have been honored and enjoyed serving the public but it has come time to step aside from the position
356889 strict liability doctrine from the state of ohio places county auditors in position of primary and secondary liability even though the county auditor may not be aware of any circumstances concerning incidents
356890 i believe in hiring qualified seneca county residents in offices to serve because they are being paid by seneca county taxpayers
356891 as you may know i am not a politician i never received or accepted any funds for election i have taken all educational courses to help in fulfilling my duties and filling all ethic requirements i feel i was voted into the position to help better the county and hoping that all county departments would work together
356892 just a difference of philosophy and maybe some different things state areas local areas
356893 ive been thinking about it for awhile we have some family that have some things i think we should be with things like that ive been thinking about it for awhile
356894 theres a lot of good things in the county so many good things and youre just hearing negatives
356895 as you can see im proud of seneca county and ive been very blessed in seneca county
356896 my family is all coming back to seneca county thats the reason you talk about things of families and jobs they all are coming back to seneca county they are in seneca county i believe in it
356897 yeah even if youre down to your last dime you should give it in church i only have 0 60 in my wallet and im going to give all of it in church
356898 because when you give all you have god will multiply it tenfold god will bless you
356899 trust yourself and with your heart as your compass youll always find your way
356900 this poor widow has given more than all the rest of them for they have given a tiny part of their surplus but she poor as she is has given everything she has
356901 has the highest incidence and mortality from cervical cancer and for this reason had the most to contribute and benefit from through participation in this study we did not have access to the necessary chemotherapy beds pharmacy and nursing care to be able to offer our patients access to this opportunity
356902 there should be offshore drilling if appropriate all the measures should be there on the table
356903 we have to do some drilling lets accept the fact that we have to do some drilling
356904 i think you would find a lot of support for offshore drilling
356905 i think you would find a lot of support for offshore drilling if it was tied to other things like renewable fuels wind energy solar energy amp other renewable transportation fuels
356906 we have to drill in more places as quickly as we can
356907 and we want to force the leadership of the republicans and the democrats to come to terms with reality which is we have to drill in more places as quickly as we can of which i am a big proponent
356908 i am not opposed personally to the idea of expanding exploration for oil and for gas and in those cases where it is appropriate to get down and find the assets that are available to us as a nation and increase our national security
356909 ive supported increased production of domestic oil and gas and i also think it makes sense to look at whether or not there are some areas in the outer continental shelf that could be opened for production
356910 first of all as all of you know im from an oil producing state oil and gas producing state and ive supported increased production of domestic oil and gas and i also think it makes sense to look at whether or not there are some areas in the outer continental shelf that could be opened for production in addition to whats already open
356911 w e must take advantage of our untapped oil resources in places where it makes sense
356912 although our country cannot simply drill our way out of this energy crisis we must take advantage of our untapped oil resources in places where it makes sense
356913 guest column from senator tester energy independence this independence day
356914 ohio sen sherrod brown who had adamantly opposed such drilling is among those warming to the idea he says any exploration would have to be far from the coast and that the oil produced would be used in the united states not abroad
356915 we have got to deal with conserving using less we also have to produce more
356916 well i think we all know there are several elements to this we have got to deal with conserving using less we also have to produce more those are the two sides of the equation in terms of the supply demand relationship
356917 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table
356918 are not ready to embrace the idea of bipartisan compromise
356919 schumer suggested congress will not move on a large energy plan until after the election
356920 democratic leaders in the senate also are not ready to embrace the idea of a bipartisan compromise on energy legislation in part out of concern about adopting a position at odds with their expected presidential nominee senator barack obama of illinois
356921 privately democrats have been frustrated that obama took such a long time to come out with a comprehensive energy policy and that his new plan appeared to be more about checking the box than engaging in a larger national debate on the issue
356922 a lot of democrats were waiting for him to come out with something and he left us flat footed we didnt want to step on his toes and now we have some ground to make up
356923 but the gop is positioning itself as the party willing to do whatever it takes to lower gas prices
356924 democrats worried about defections in the ranks are scrambling to avoid votes on expanded drilling and this week canceled a series of senate committee sessions that could have provided an opening for republicans
356925 majority leader reid has decided that deliberation is too taxing for
356926 dems on the defensive over gop push for more oil
356927 democratic leaders have tried to stave off a floor vote on the issue in part gop leaders say out of fear that some democrats may cast pro drilling votes
356928 republicans refuse to discuss futures bill without coastal drilling vote
356929 but the gop is positioning itself as the party willing to do whatever it takes to lower gas prices the republicans say democrats are scared to cast votes on new drilling in the face of voter anger over high gasoline prices and they point to the majoritys decision to scrap appropriations bills to avoid a debate over lifting the congressional ban on drilling along the outer continental shelf
356930 democratic leaders caught off guard by a swing in public opinion and undermined by some of their own members are scrambling to run down the clock on calls to lift the ban on offshore oil drilling
356931 we have got to deal with conserving using less we also have to produce more
356932 well i think we all know there are several elements to this we have got to deal with conserving using less we also have to produce more those are the two sides of the equation in terms of the supply demand relationship
356933 theres going to be substantially more drilling and substantially more conservation sen mary l landrieu d la said of the plan her moderate colleagues are hoping to cobble together
356934 ive supported increased production of domestic oil and gas and i also think it makes sense to look at whether or not there are some areas in the outer continental shelf that could be opened for production
356935 first of all as all of you know im from an oil producing state oil and gas producing state and ive supported increased production of domestic oil and gas and i also think it makes sense to look at whether or not there are some areas in the outer continental shelf that could be opened for production in addition to whats already open

356939 w e must take advantage of our untapped oil resources in places where it makes sense
356940 although our country cannot simply drill our way out of this energy crisis we must take advantage of our untapped oil resources in places where it makes sense
356941 guest column from senator tester energy independence this independence day
356942 ohio sen sherrod brown who had adamantly opposed such drilling is among those warming to the idea he says any exploration would have to be far from the coast and that the oil produced would be used in the united states not abroad
356943 sen jim webb d va fresh from his gi bill victory said that he is now making energy a major priority we need to look at all our assets he said suggesting a large package including expanded offshore drilling alternative energy nuclear power and technology to make coal cleaner
356944 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table
356945 academics economists say that the costs of oil is 20 to 50 speculation
356946 its not speculation it is supply and demand we dont have excess capacity in the world anymore and thats what youre seeing in oil prices
356947 we havent evidence that speculators are broadly driving these prices
356948 there is little evidence that large investment flows into the futures market are causing an imbalance between supply and demand and are therefore contributing to high oil prices blaming speculation is an easy solution which avoids taking the necessary steps to improve supply side access and investment or to implement measures to improve energy efficiency
356949 if financial speculation were pushing all prices above the level consistent with the fundamentals of supply and demand we would expect inventories of crude oil and petroleum products to increase as supply rose and demand fell but in fact available data on oil inventories shows notable declines over the past year
356950 when an issue is this hot it would be so much easier if there was a single reason to blame but calling it speculation is way too simplistic
356951 the truth is that increased speculation in oil futures is not a cause of rising oil prices but rather an effect of those prices which have skyrocketed due to growth in global demand geopolitical instability and constricted supply in several producing countries
356952 if congress is literally going over the cftcs head and talking about imposing legislation or making the cftc exercise its emergency powers to limit excess speculation when they dont even know what that means i dont even know what excess speculation means
356953 theres no evidence of speculative influence speculators are not contributing to the demand for physical oil as they almost always roll positions prior to delivery
356954 on any given day expectations determine the price but the spot market also has to clear and the way this happens is that excess supply must be added to physical stocks even with fairly inelastic supply and demand any large speculative deviation from the fundamental price should show up in a noticeable increase in inventories
356955 they can offer their drilling amendment and we would offer our own alternative both measures would receive a vote that is how the legislative process is supposed to work
356956 we are determined to walk out of here showing that we are responding more immediately to a concrete issue which is the pain people are feeling at the pump
356957 i dont know if were going to pass anything but we certainly better vote on something before we go home
356958 democrats are scrambling to appear pro drilling even as their leaders appear dead set against reversing the long standing drilling bans along the atlantic and pacific coasts
356959 privately democrats have been worried that they havent responded quickly enough to the mounting gas price issue especially since bush and congressional republicans have been pushing for legislation for several months and made the issue the focal point of gop messaging
356960 surging energy prices have forced democratic leaders to grapple with dissension in their ranks
356961 trying to demonstrate that democrats are not opposed to drilling in acceptable locales
356962 moderate democrats who favor drilling are trying to persuade their leaders to come around
356963 senator harry reid of nevada the majority leader faces an increasing uneasiness among his colleagues who have signaled receptiveness to allowing more drilling
356964 we have got to deal with conserving using less we also have to produce more
356965 well i think we all know there are several elements to this we have got to deal with conserving using less we also have to produce more those are the two sides of the equation in terms of the supply demand relationship

356990 general petraeus is going to come to the hill and make it clear to you that there is progress going on in iraq that the so called surge is working will you believe him when he says that
356991 no i dont believe him because its not happening all you have to do is look at the facts
356992 hes made a number of statements over the years that have not proven to be factual
356993 he isnt in touch with whats going on in baghdad
356994 and for someone whether its general petraeus or anyone else to say things are great in baghdad isnt in touch with whats going on in baghdad even though hes there and im not
356995 petraeus report will pass through the white house spin machine where facts are often ignored or twisted and intelligence is cherry picked
356996 this week president bush will send general petraeus to congress to report on the war but before the report arrives in congress it will pass through the white house spin machine where facts are often ignored or twisted and intelligence is cherry picked
356997 by carefully manipulating the statistics the bush petraeus report will try to persuade us that violence in iraq is decreasing and thus the surge is working even if the figures were right the conclusion is wrong
356998 i think that the reports that you provided to us really require the willing suspension of disbelief
356999 i dont consider the surge a nuanced policy its killing our soldiers at a great rate i think that we need to look at reality senator biden talked to you about what the comptroller general said and youre going to argue about it i think the comptroller general ought to be listened to he says youre cherry picking your numbers in terms of the overall violence i ask you to take off your rosy glasses you had them on in 05
357000 this the petraeus plan is ridiculous there is no plan he may be the only one who believes this is a good idea
357001 this is ridiculous there is no plan i ask the president and everyone else who comes forward with a plan whether it is capping or surging or whatever they have will it answer the two word test then what then what then what what happens after we surge these women and men and by the way he said general petraeus is one who believes he may be the only one who believes this is a good idea virtually no one else thinks it is a good idea
357002 there is some accuracy to so called cooking the books charges being leveled against petraeus
357003 delaware sen joe biden said yesterday gen david petraeus is not betraying us as a liberal activist group charges but the democratic presidential hopeful did not reject charges that the military commander is using selected statistics to do the white houses bidding there is some accuracy to so called cooking the books charges being leveled against petraeus biden who chairs the senate foreign relations committee said yesterday in a telephone interview from washington
357004 i think the general will present the facts with respect to the statistics and the tactical successes or situations as he sees them but none of us should be fooled not the american people not you in the media not us in congress we should not be fooled into this tactical success debate thats not what this is about
357005 well let me well i dont think general petraeus has an independent view in that sense general petraeus is there to succeed he may say the progress is uneven he may say its substantial i dont know what he will say you can be sure well listen to it but i dont think hes an independent evaluator
357006 asking general petraeus to evaluate the surge he has overseen in iraq is like asking a college student to grade his own term paper
357007 today general petraeus once again came to capitol hill to ask congress to prolong our involvement in iraqs civil war his assessment of the situation in iraq was positive but not independent the simple fact is that asking general petraeus to evaluate the surge he has overseen in iraq is like asking a college student to grade his own term paper
357008 that there are questions about gen petraeus report is not surprising the whack a mole strategy has made this the bloodiest summer of the war
357009 the fact that there are questions about gen petraeus report is not surprising given that it was brought to you by this white house in contrast independent report after report indicates that the whack a mole strategy has made this the bloodiest summer of the war
357010 right now our strategy on gas prices is drive small cars and wait for the wind
357011 still 73 of the more than 1 000 americans surveyed from june 26 to 29 said they favored an expansion of offshore drilling for oil and natural gas in protected u s waters even though many environmental advocacy groups have deemed offshore drilling as hazardous to the environment
357012 for example just over three quarters 76 percent support immediately increasing oil drilling in the united states a position recently espoused by presumptive republican nominee john mccain more than seven in 10 democrats 71 percent also hold this view
357013 t he percentage of liberals who said expanding energy exploration was their most important priority doubled from 22 percent in february to 45 percent
357014 t he number of people favoring drilling there increased to 50 percent compared to 42 percent last february
357015 amid record gas prices public support for greater energy exploration is spiking much of the increase in support for energy exploration has come among groups that previously viewed this as a less important priority than energy conservation young people liberals independents democrats women and people who have attended college fully half of people ages 18 to 29 51 now say expanding energy exploration is a more important priority for energy policy than increasing energy conservation and regulation only about a quarter of young people 26 expressed this view in february the proportion of liberals who say expanded energy exploration is the more important priority also has doubled from 22 to 45
357016 in a rather dramatic show of force 22 senate republicans attended a news conference in a grassy park outside the senate office buildings to trumpet the gas price reduction act of 2008 most of them did not get a chance to speak underscoring their dedication to the issue since most senators do not relish playing a backdrop role
357017 republicans said they were reaching out a hand to democrats by not including a provision to allow oil drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge which the democrats oppose
357018 this time with gas prices pushing 4 a gallon and more opposition may be weakening
357019 in an acknowledgment that something must be done on the record breaking gasoline prices senate republicans are attempting to craft an energy package that democrats can support gop senators met for a second time tuesday afternoon to discuss an energy package that would attract more than the usual suspects on the democratic side
357020 exploring these coastal areas could have an immediate impact at the pump
357021 off limits coastal areas are estimated by the u s department of the interior to hold close to 19 billion barrels of recoverable oil as well as substantial supplies of natural gas exploring these coastal areas could have an immediate impact at the pump just the possibility that domestic oil supplies are expanding likely would deter speculators sending prices down
357022 in a rather dramatic show of force 22 senate republicans attended a news conference in a grassy park outside the senate office buildings to trumpet the gas price reduction act of 2008 most of them did not get a chance to speak underscoring their dedication to the issue since most senators do not relish playing a backdrop role

357027 republicans said they were reaching out a hand to democrats by not including a provision to allow oil drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge which the democrats oppose
357028 separately senate republicans proposed a revised energy package thursday that would allow states to petition the interior department to lift the federal offshore drilling moratorium off their coasts 50 miles from shore
357029 senate republicans unveiled an ambitious energy bill thursday expected to establish a unified message on soaring gas prices leading up to the november elections
357030 in an acknowledgment that something must be done on the record breaking gasoline prices senate republicans are attempting to craft an energy package that democrats can support gop senators met for a second time tuesday afternoon to discuss an energy package that would attract more than the usual suspects on the democratic side
357031 senate republicans plan to introduce energy legislation as early as this week that will serve as the centerpiece of a messaging effort on gas prices but it will not include language backed by president bush to allow for drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge gop aides said monday republicans see democrats as vulnerable on the energy front during the run up to the november elections and they want to try to rack up as many gop votes as possible
357032 republicans hoping energy measure adds fuel to election year strategy
357033 senate republicans aim to undercut democrats claim to be the environmentally conscious party by combining their own conservation message with a longstanding push for more oil drilling
357034 would not actually have a tremendous enough impact on gas prices in time for the election
357035 anyone who is honest about energy policy knows there is no quick fix said a senate democratic aide which means that even if one side or the other passed their solution and hailed it as a great victory it would not actually have a tremendous enough impact on gas prices in time for the election
357036 i think that i would have preferred a gradual adjustment
357037 i think that i would have preferred a gradual adjustment
357038 democrats in both house and senate pressed ahead with budget plans that would saddle millions of americans with higher tax bills in three years by allowing some or all of president bushs reductions to die after he leaves office
357039 t he democratic budget theyll be voting for would allow income tax rates to go up on individuals making as little as 31 850 and couples earning 63 700 or more

357042 it proves that drivers will change their behavior in response to high fuel prices

357047 well it certainly forces some conservation for people that cant afford to fill their tank
357048 i think that i would have preferred a gradual adjustment
357049 let me on behalf of the senate republican leadership kick it off by saying that there are very few americans who im aware of who agree that any increase in gas prices is a good idea
357050 which is why i was stunned to see that even on the day after senator obama their presidential candidate admitted that he actually preferred a gradual increase in gas prices that they are saying here in the senate they want to carry his message
357051 hes had ample opportunity since yesterday to recant hes chosen not to do so so we should assume that that is his position that the only problem he has with increased gas prices is that he would have preferred that we would have gotten there gradually rather than more quickly
357052 i cant imagine that theres anybody in america who thinks 4 a gallon gas is a good thing whether you got there quickly or whether you got there over a long period of time
357053 im your boy for veep and how he also slams hillary mccain wants to paint the white house black and even manages to cause more grief for obama
357054 next thing we know were going to hear trumpets sound
357055 a lot of people come in this sport and have a lot of hype and they dont quite stack up where you expect them to be
357056 i dont think joey is going to be that guy
357057 he belongs here he wasnt promoted too quickly i dont know if we threw him in the deep end or not we put him in the nationwide series when he turned 18 thats what this series is for hes just done exceptionally well at it you just dont expect a driver to go out and win in his third race hes capitalizing on his opportunities as well
357058 joey logano jumped into some really good equipment behind some good people with really good set ups it really made him look good hes got a lot of talent too but so does brad were sitting here second in the point standings with a good shot at winning the championship
357059 at a lot of these tracks brad is still a rookie were trying to give him the best equipment we can give him but weve been getting killed by toyota all year if we had what toyota has had maybe it would be a different story but points leader clint bowyer would be in the same boat were in things are equal up now so maybe well see a difference
357060 theres a big difference between joey and myself and the way we came up
357061 i dont mean this to be in a hyping way but i feel like one of the last of the mohicans
357062 hopefully i can close this deal out and make the most of it
357063 thats whats different between me and joey we dont have that big of an age separation we may look the same skinny young white boys but were just different way different
357064 in landons case prior to dover he was driving a race then skipping three
357065 he had more on the schedule earlier in the year but it just didnt work out
357066 then he went to chicago and that was the biggest track he had ran a nationwide car on and that was going to be the real test and he made an a on that he showed us that he was at the point where if he continues to make progress dale jr should look at putting him in a full time ride next year
357067 i think my greatest strength right now is qualifying weve been really decent in my truck i always seem to have something someone will wreck in front of us or ill make a rookie mistake but weve qualified strong
357068 colins not running a full time deal so hes not getting quite the exposure that joey logano is getting
357069 hes the real thing he did a great job at orp last week unfortunately hes just practicing for greg but hes fun to watch its going to be fun watching him grow
357070 i try really hard not to go into the year expecting anything
357071 expect the unexpected more than anything else im happy to be where im at really happy
357072 in all my time as a doctor ive never seen this before im at a loss

357091 but the department put the red flag up on us
357092 he said all along that his life was in danger but they never believed him when the masri name came up the shutters at the department went down
357093 he was gunned down in broad daylight in cold blood his mother was killed before he claimed refugee status here his brother was killed last year and he was gunned down yesterday like a dog on the side of the road
357094 responsibility of the country to which he has been removed anybody who has applied for protection from australia is not removed if we believe that person will be persecuted
357095 he told his story and notwithstanding he had already been shot once he wasnt believed
357096 we sent him back to a place where he was assassinated
357097 he had a deep love of his wife and children he wept for palestine and despite the dreadful adversity of woomera he always had a sense of humour
357098 the previous australian government is responsible for another terrible crime by forcing refugees to be sent back to gaza when they knew the situation there
357099 he is returning from a holiday he has had leave peter costello and i meet regularly to discuss a whole variety of things
357100 peter costello has earned the right to make the decision about his future with his own family in the best interests of both them and the people of higgins
357101 i would be very happy for peter costello to stay on in the parliament and if he chooses to do so he will be immediately on the frontbench
357102 but thats his choice his decision and hell make it in good time
357103 if you think theres a credit squeeze now imagine where it would be if we hadnt left this new government a legacy of huge budget surpluses
357104 imagine where the australian economy would be now if it were still in deficit and we still owed tens of millions of dollars
357105 he wont remind you that long before we started to get the full benefit of the china burn we had to get the budget back in the black after inheriting a horrendous position of deficit in 1996

357112 in terms of foreign policy in the far east it is mistaken if someone were to say that my preoccupation was on the war on terror
357113 you bet i wanted to make sure that we protected ourselves at home secondly our foreign policy has been robust in the far east our relations with your country south korea with japan and with china have never been better and it took a lot of work to get bilateral relations as strong as they are

357116 he would be willing to support limited additional offshore oil drilling if thats what it takes to enact a comprehensive policy to foster fuel efficient autos and develop alternate energy sources
357117 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
357118 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
357119 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
357120 researchers from microsoft say theyve built a prototype of a display screen using a technology that essentially mimics the optics in a telescope but at the scale of individual display pixels the result is a display that is
357121 the first prototypes contrast ratio was 20 1 mainly due to the use of non collimated back light this was a limitation of the current prototype not of the technology this is supported by simulations which show that a ratio of at least 800 1 is possible

357123 im afraid a lot of inaccuracies and fabrications have crept into the reports in india about my sonia project yes i did meet her but she has not given the nod to the project nor has she said no
357124 she was gracious but noncommittal and extremely genteel she wanted to know if biopics were made about living people i pointed out several films on nelson mandela i told her i didnt want to make a film about sonia the politician but about two individuals from disparate backgrounds who fall in love and make a life together
357125 i told her things she thought no one knew when she came from italy to england she went to a school of languages in cambridge to learn english i also told her about the bakery in london where rajiv used to clean the chimney in the night about that bird in a nest in his room in london for which he wouldnt close the window in the night so the bird could return home and soniajis fondness for the ice creams that rajivji took her to have at india gate
357126 i worked with my dad in my first film himalay putra it was a terrifying experience therere certain people whom you shouldnt work with my dad is one of them
357127 mr amitabh bachchan is another to stand in the same frame as them confidently is impossible theyve such an overpowering screen presence
357128 its very difficult to match my father on screen its that quality either you have it or you dont have it very frankly i dont have it i just dont have that kind of presence therere some actors who just wash you away on screen my dad is one of them
357129 but yes govinda is another actor i feel the same way about hes a very effective actor govinda is a very scary actor even sanjay dutt has such an overpowering screen presence
357130 mere baap is a genuine feel good film i like doing such films my character puts his fathers happiness ahead of his own the son is more like a father and vice versa pareshs character is so childlike its a very heart warming kind of relationship paresh and i have always gotten along we spend a lot of time together when were working
357131 i do the films i get and id rather be in a successful film than a good film having said that i must say gandhi my father is the single most important film of my career probably my best work im immensely attached to it

357151 i said to them i have a question for you
357152 the mother is the true priest she is the true teacher the first teacher of the child
357153 at one time it was considered prestigious but now it is not considered prestigious at all
357154 if you are educated you do something more secular it is considered to be a sign of less educated less sophisticated so not many educated people are interested in becoming priests
357155 its not that women werent allowed to do this its that somewhere along the line it got lost and it became mainly a male profession
357156 but in the most ancient scriptures there were women priests so we should reclaim that
357157 i said to them i have a question for you
357158 the mother is the true priest she is the true teacher the first teacher of the child
357159 at one time it was considered prestigious but now it is not considered prestigious at all

357161 i believe ill have three cats and a whole bunch of dogs waiting for me
357162 i believe we each can find answers to divine questions if we look deeply in our own hearts and ask for guidance there although our answers may differ from the answers others have found they are our own and they will comfort us

357164 judaism teaches that god reserves a blessed existence in the world to come for the truly virtuous
357165 for myself paradise with my own mutt rescue the wonder dog is a perfect inducement to pursue virtue
357166 we really have no biblical grounds for an assurance that our pets will be resurrected along with us
357167 but the scriptures imply that heavens overwhelming treasure for us is the fellowship that we the followers of christ will have with our creator and savior
357168 but a lot of people have a hard time with that and i do too when i see a grieving pet owner i know god wants us to be totally happy in heaven and if our dog will help make us fully happy and if god can resurrect us im sure he could resurrect a dog too

357181 without these real estate related losses and loan write downs surrounding the small builder and construction related commercial segments of the portfolio affected by the repercussions of the country s housing market meltdown net income would have been 3
357182 net earnings have been impacted for the first six months of 2008 primarily due to the bank s vigilance in addressing the risk exposure in a segment of our loan portfolio impacted by the weakness in the homebuilding industry and the slowing economy
357183 it came to me that this woman loves and worships the same god i do
357184 i had this sharpened awareness that in that moment she was in touch with god just as i was it was a dawning and an awakening and it was liberating because it liberates you from standing on a pedestal and looking down on someone else
357185 beyond 9 11 christians and muslims together a new world vision
357186 is that we can find a way to bridge the chasm between christians muslims jews hindus and buddhists and make atlanta a model city that over the next year or two we can develop an interfaith immersion program
357187 a soft evangelical i ask questions and listen rather than telling people what they ought to do or believe
357188 im the most unlikely candidate for becoming a spokesperson about islam
357189 i wondered who i was now that i wasnt a teacher preacher traveler or speaker
357190 you get beneath the dogma and creeds to the essence of what religion is about its about god in human beings in human consciousness
357191 a voice in my head said and you dont know anything about islam which was true i have five degrees four of them theological and other religions had never been taught seriously to me
357192 everything about my faith is rooted in the stories my two grandmothers told me
357193 no one formally taught me to pray as a child i had the question what is god like my grandmother answered that is like a drop in the ocean trying to understand what the ocean is like this is something i feel with my heart god is present in everything god is all around us
357194 there were a couple of imams muslim clerics and im thinking they know all this stuff and im stumbling around in it
357195 we had a pastor and an imam describe how they came to the faith that gives their lives meaning
357196 and we asked people to talk at their tables about how their faith came to them
357197 i dont think just knowledge about another faith is any good
357198 youve got to meet someone who is of the faith who is speaking out of conviction and out of experience to really feel what islam is like
357199 puts muslims at ease because hes mastered the broad historical perspective of islam but also some of the nuanced details
357200 people are more open to learning a new perspective from someone they respect ben is not trying to convert anyone but to inform people and build understanding
357201 when i heard him talk about islam i thought we need him
357202 says jan swanson coordinator of the interfaith group world pilgrims
357203 many christians are fearful of islam so they put up barriers they trust ben so they are willing to take the first step and listen for understanding
357204 if you sit in silence you can get deep enough into your faith that it touches another person
357205 the reality is that at the core were all the same
357206 in my 76th year i would be passionate about getting christians jews muslims and hindus together nothing in my history would point me in this direction this is not my dream i think its the spirit of god
357207 anyone who does this learns pretty quickly its a very hard thing to do and its a very hard thing to sell a book
357208 you have got to have people with you there saying you can do it harriette is the go to girl for that
357209 there was no reason in the world they shouldve taken me
357210 i just trusted when i look back now i dont know how it worked out
357211 it was an education to sit there and see what was going on
357212 the one thing you learn on a movie set is patience
357213 i remember always thinking it was special to walk down broadway
357214 for me it was the highest praise i could possibly have received
357215 i was a nervous wreck i was shaking i know my voice was shaking
357216 she probably says that to everyone but it meant everything to me you know it was complete validation this is something you should be doing you are good at it
357217 harriette is a very unstructured kind of instructor she doesnt tell you how to do things
357218 she just encourages you to do them she gives you ideas on what might be improved on
357219 her encouragement and her faith in you that really helped me a lot
357220 she had a lot of faith i could do well
357221 she seems to me to have the knack of eliciting from students the best that is in them encouraging them without raising unrealistic hopes and through it all being one of the nicest ladies ive ever known
357222 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways
357223 in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
357224 i think he was just psychologically exhausted by the whole process
357225 if he was about to be charged no one who knew him well was aware of that and i dont believe it
357226 it doesnt jibe with anything about the bruce that was my neighbor
357227 they had this big red van and were always taking a bunch of kids to swim meets
357228 one time he demonstrated his juggling skills by lying on his back in the department and juggling with his hands
357229 the roman catholic church should learn from other equally worthy christian denominations and eagerly welcome female clergy as well as married clergy
357230 there are people who you just know are ticking bombs
357231 you act like a crazy person you apologize but you never change you never mean anything you say to heck with this
357232 i dont know any of the people who live here
357233 when we first moved to elie i had a new dad in a new town and everyone spoke french
357234 it was very simple with two bedrooms a living room and a pantry in that pantry my mother raised chicks that was eventually turned into the bathroom
357235 my mother had the most incredible garden we had four acres of property and half of that was all garden
357236 i used to sit down in her garden and eat green peas all day she grew cantalopes watermelon everything and everything was good
357237 i remember all the colours in different shaped jars looking so beautiful down there
357238 in the winter time i had to go downtown to get cooked ham for my dads lunches every night before we got a fridge i remember those nights walking along that road home from the store the snow would be so bright and the air would be so crisp the snow so crunchy the lights would just start to come on and i would sing the old lamplighter
357239 i dont recognize any of this i think its further down
357240 we saw it touch down and we all ran to the bathroom we heard this hum and we thought that was going to be it
357241 when they saw the clouds they jumped in the truck and took off to hide in a neighbours basement down the street when it was all over they decided they should go see if anyone was hurt
357242 i remember when he came to find me he couldnt tell me that the house was gone he couldnt speak
357243 the house is gone that part of my life is finished
357244 im certainly glad that my mother and dad didnt live to see it because they were so proud of it
357245 he died in the winter and we went to get her
357246 but she had to go home in the spring because she had to get her garden in she called me that summer after she had planted the whole thing
357247 come and get me she said why am i making this garden theres no one to make it for anymore that was when we knew she was ready to sell the house
357248 ive actually already seen it but i love going to the movies
357249 we havent been noticing any struggle at all due to the economy so its been busy here all summer
357250 i think a huge reason for the sales increase is the release of the dark knight were seeing people of all ages coming out for that one
357251 it seems like all the stress from the economy makes people want to come in and just relax and enjoy being entertained
357252 in terms of gas prices most people have been coming to the movies in large groups theres a lot of carpooling going on and that means fewer vehicles
357253 i usually take a trip to charleston every summer but it was too costly for me this year
357254 since i didnt get to go on vacation and have been sitting around at home i decided i might as well go out and catch a movie compared to the price of gas 9 isnt too much to ask
357255 byron pool head coach bismarck bobcats we got four or five ice times total and really its kind of nice for the coaches because weve done all our work weve done our homeworkweve brought the guys back to bismarck that we want to be here and usually a hockey team kind of picks itself thekids are going to come out and compete hard and hopefullly like i said were going to have some tough decisions come sunday
357256 i will struggle and make a living to make his dreams for shetul come true she says
357257 among managers with the strongest connection to senior officials same school at the same time with the same degree the connected holdings earned an average annual 16 05 percent excess return the total gain minus the treasury bill return that was more than double the funds average 7 69 percent excess return on non connected stocks or the funds overall average 7 81 percent
357258 social networks may be an important mechanism for information flow into asset prices
357259 connected holdings outperform non connected holdings in a statistically and economically significant way for all four degrees of connectedness
357260 lend support to the hypothesis that fund managers have comparative advantages in gathering information about connected firms
357261 s ocial networks are important for information flow between firms and investors
357262 what we document using these networks is not an isolated situation or constrained to a few portfolio managers or firms but rather a systematic effect across the entire universe of u s firms and portfolio managers
357263 thats pretty much been my m o since ive been pitching is command
357264 my background with guys that my dad oklahoma state coach frank anderson has coached it always shows that if you can command the strike zone and put it where you want to it makes you pretty difficult to hit and ive always taken that true to heart you might not throw the best fastball or the best stuff but if you go out there and put it where they cant hit it too hard its pretty easy
357265 the methods are very similar but i cant say they are related
357266 i dont know if it will it may be an outcome of the rain weve had in the last few days
357267 if the cabinets support rates remain low there is a possibility that moves to oust fukuda will become public due to anxiety about fighting an election with him as the campaign poster boy
357268 that is why some think that the appointment of aso is a strategic step toward replacing fukuda ahead of the election
357269 i will support the fukuda cabinet and put in my best effort
357270 for aso cooperating with fukuda is a risk if they lose the election he will go down with fukuda
357271 but if fukuda steps down before the election there will be a chance for aso to take the reins
357272 it could also backfire and that cannot be helped that is a matter of chance
357273 it just makes it all the better cause i really appreciate them
357274 ross is a unique addition outside of his baseball ability and his pitching ability
357275 he would be a prospect as a position player as well but he did take off on the mound this year his academic acumen is such that he was courted not only by tulane but also stanford rice and vanderbilt he graduated no 1 in his class
357276 he was there with his parents sitting right in front of me
357277 when he got up to go to the concession stand you couldnt help but notice him he
357278 were re evaluating everything we do in player development but it begins with scouting
357279 are you going to call the commissioner and explain this
357280 weve taken 52 players were going to exceed the slotting guidelines on two of them we feel these are extraordinary circumstances
357281 we thought there would be maybe two or three instances when it made sense to push the envelope a little bit
357282 we were all saying boy that was a huge job
357283 weve gotten a lot of production out of our pinch hitters
357284 i think los probably the best he just always gives you a quality at bat he can sit over there for a week five days or whatever he always seems to go up there with the situation on the line or the game on the line he puts a good swing on it and tonight he was dead on
357285 i think the guys would say that they defensively didnt get it done in that inning for me or for the team
357286 but they were pretty tough plays that had to be made
357287 in games like this when your guys go through the middle of their order with the bases loaded you got to win
357288 theres a crosswalk here after the second incident that occurred here i no longer use that crosswalk
357289 we have got to move away from these beautifully choreographed speeches which appeal to groups of voters who are unassailably in the obama camp already
357290 what plays well with the educated liberal voter sometimes grates with the blue collar folk whom we need on our side if we are going to win
357291 the steadfast love of the lord never ceases his mercies never come to an end they are new every morning greath is thy faithfulness the lord is my portion says my soul therefore i will hope in him
357292 montaging and pasting together the sequences from budapest and belgrade protests
357293 you can see hungarian flags and in the end you can see subway station belgrade isnt in hungary and has no subway
357294 hes very difficult to predict because of the approach he takes to the law
357295 so hard to pin down and define that it will turn out to be a mythical monster
357296 janie norman may have lived a lifestyle very different to yours
357297 just because she lived in an alice springs town camp surrounded by alcohol abuse and lived a chaotic lifestyle does not mean that her violent death is just another statistic
357298 in the past juries have been somewhat indifferent to violence by aboriginal men against aboriginal women
357299 that did not seem to be the case here i had the sense that overall some kind of value was placed on her life
357300 it is often the case that aboriginal witnesses can be reluctant to be involved but its a credit when they do and its a credit to the prosecutors that they were able to get them to come forward
357301 ancestry visas are a tangible sign of our close shared history they give australians a glimpse of their heritage and a gateway to one of the worlds most innovative economies
357302 full details on how ancestry visas will work in the future are yet to be announced for the time being the current rules apply
357303 part of the socialist struggle for equality participation and social change rather than an instrument for the capitalist system
357304 we need to re establish in australia something that the labour movement has long recognised that there is no higher vocational calling than teaching
357305 we need to see the necessary respect and valuing of the profession which doesnt happen with words alone
357306 there are schools that struggle with limited resources trying to serve disadvantaged communities in both groups
357307 i specifically reject the proposition that the only way to debate differential need in our school system is through the prism of the public private divide
357308 we all know that you cant compare a balwyn high school and a broadmeadows high school because you have a completely different clientele
357309 we do not want discrimination or bias occurring and thats why i believe it is appropriate that our sensitive overseas posts such as those in the middle east are staffed by australians
357310 put it this way it was made very clear to the immigration department that more christian refugees were wanted
357311 if mr rudd wishes to be saved from himself i am here to help
357312 he is proposing to bring legislation into the parliament before the copenhagen meeting even occurs which will determine what sort of shape the global response will take from 2012
357313 mr rudd is determined to do this from 2010 from my view without having due regard for the economic consequences of what he is about to do
357314 mr rudd is proposing to impose on australia in about two years time an emissions trading scheme which is still poorly developed the economic assumptions underwriting it are yet to be developed let alone tested in an australia in a deteriorating economic climate
357315 the roundtable will bring together senior executives from a range of industries and peak industry organisations in the trade exposed emissions intensive sector of the australian economy that have a stake in the sectors future under an emissions trading scheme
357316 significant impact of the ets on the economy and employment in this country
357317 the ets doesnt change future global aluminium production expectations it just changes the address of smelters and thats to the detriment of australia
357318 were all in agreeance that the emissions trading scheme needs to deal with carbon reduction but ensure that industry particularly manufacturing in australia is kept and has the ability to grow
357319 capacity for assisting the world move to a lower greenhouse future will be seriously compromised and that means thousands and thousands of jobs existing and new will also be at risk
357320 the alternative is to do what the government is doing which is to effectively say to the lng industry you should go and develop somewhere else where you dont have a carbon price ripping at your profitability
357321 to do otherwise would be economically irresponsible it would compromise australias efforts to reduce carbon pollution and place more of the burden on other parts of the economy
357322 concord hospital has a comprehensive emergency power supply system unfortunately in this instance a component of the system failed
357323 this led to power being interrupted to several wards for about one hour
357324 patient treatment was not compromised while the interruption was resolved
357325 how is it possible for a contingency electricity supply to fail in the most crucial parts of the hospital the intensive care unit and the emergency department
357326 its a tribute to the outstanding staff that no one died during this major failure
357327 yelled out private tiessem get your f ing arse up here now
357328 i dont care what you f ing want get your f ing arse up here now
357329 i felt deeply embarrassed that such offensive behaviour was being displayed in front of my case manager and wanted to protect her from such behaviour
357330 i thought to myself if i could go to the cells at least this stupid process would stop i would be able to get my medication and rest
357331 he yelled at me do you have a chit medical form that says you cant stand up i responded no sir he said i could stand while he then tore strips off me too i was blacking out and cannot really recall what he was saying to me
357332 i was continually repeating i just need my medication and need to go home
357333 i have a great deal of anxiety about my uncontrollable shakes and feel self conscious when they are occurring during the event i felt i had been treated like a dog
357334 a detailed unit level investigation has found no evidence to support your claim that 2 rar is making it more difficult for soldiers with mental illness to discharge
357335 i felt deep anger towards those who ignored army doctor dr wongs medical advice and detained ted for far longer than what was required he has severe psychological wounds for these to be ignored is reprehensible
357336 if you go into a bank and say youve forgotten your pin if you can produce enough id you can change the pin on the spot which is what these women did ms lacey said
357337 i was in a hospital bed and they told me i would have to come into the bank to verify my identity yet they allowed two strangers to walk in and clear out my bank accounts in 45 minutes she said
357338 it was a very stressful time and i would hate anyone else to have to go through it she said ms lacey warned new mothers to watch their valuables while in hospital an anz spokesman told the sunday telegraph the bank would review the fees charged for the overdrafts source
357339 there are plaintive cries for more and more funding for hospitals yet they have plenty of funding to go after their own employees
357340 instead of conducting an internal investigation they initiated an external investigation conducted by a private law firm
357341 the big law firms have become nothing other than de facto human resources advisers to queensland health at about 400 an hour
357342 its big brother a lot of issues could be resolved by normal staff negotiations and relationships
357343 the audit team is currently working with bits management to rectify these issues
357344 we dont know if this paper will help save the barrier reef
357345 countries like australia need to reduce emissions by at least 25 per cent by 2020
357346 the australian government will for the first time appoint a resident ambassador to the holy see mr rudd said in a statement
357347 the appointment will mark a significant deepening of australias relations with the vatican
357348 it will also provide an avenue for us to learn from each others perspectives on the millennium development goals and climate change
357349 the holy see has expressed support for australias efforts within australia and in the region to facilitate greater understanding between people of different faiths he said
357350 this will be the first time since 1973 when prime minister gough whitlam established diplomatic relations with the vatican that australia has appointed a resident ambassador
357351 were talking about contracts across dozens of countries that we claimed to have pakistan romania germany russia we were claiming to have contracts which we didnt have
357352 they made further claims that they had supplied the australian and new zealand military with products which of course was incorrect
357353 they were able to say they were being supported by the australian government which in essence they were
357354 we always send them to nepean or westmead i know women who need to be rebooked will not go to lithgow because theres no comprehensive maternity unit there and theres only a couple of beds
357355 must explain to blue mountains residents why staff shortages have been allowed to get so out of control and when the birthing unit will be reopened
357356 theyre incredibly disappointed if they wanted to birth in another hospital they would have booked in nine months ago
357357 weve taken the decision to suspend birthing services to ensure the safety of mothers and babies
357358 even casual observers of the international situation would be aware of the conflict between sunni and shiite communities in iraq but what has achieved less prominence in the national and international media is the fate of other iraqi minorities assyrians chaldeans and mandaeans
357359 when the facts change i change my mind what do you do sir
357360 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gases is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
357361 we dont really know what the actual effect on the climate is
357362 there is a considerable presence within the scientific community of people who do not agree with the intergovernmental panel on climate change conclusion that anthropogenic co2 emissions are very probably likely to be primarily responsible for the global warming that has occurred since the industrial revolution
357363 this emissions trading scheme will knock planned projects with relatively high co2 emissions right off the block you can start with chevrons gorgon project and woodsides browse project and keep on going
357364 we do not believe we will be included as an emissions intensive trade exposed industry that we will fall just below the cut off which will mean all the worst emitters will be given a free ride and clean fuels like lng will have to bear the whole burden
357365 we spent hundreds of millions over recent years to clean up our plants we won all these greenhouse challenge awards
357366 this emissions trading scheme is going to get the wrong answer its going to hit our returns and stop our new projects going forward when we are part of the global answer
357367 we have booked a lot of plane tickets to canberra
357368 unless lng receives the treatment it must have not only is the ability of the industry to grow and invest here affected it will also affect our ability to assist the asia pacific region reduce its greenhouse gas emissions for the longer term
357369 the greenhouse mafia the opposition and resources minister martin ferguson
357370 the coal industry is largely owned overseas and has made mega profits from polluting the atmosphere through the commodities boom
357371 my appeal is directly to the liberal party to be responsible partners in the future economic direction of australia
357372 the liberals have got some serious soul searching to do on this question in terms of acting responsibly
357373 on the senate i think theres going to be a huge national spotlight trained on the liberals
357374 are you going to be responsible partners in this countrys long term economic future or are you just going to walk away and play opportunistic short term politics
357375 as an exporter of coal weve got a huge interest in developing the technology that captures the carbon
357376 there is a big issue here about getting it right this is not an issue a question of who is more committed to the environment than anybody else
357377 you cannot seriously ask people to make submissions about options for an emissions trading scheme when they havent got any of the financial modelling
357378 but we think surgery connect is counter productive to the development of public hospitals
357379 they should be spending the money to fix up public hospitals
357380 its work that needs to be done at night time when everybodys tired including surgeons or on weekends and that cuts into family time
357381 i want to see an improvement in wait times for children
357382 my personal view is that it would be irresponsible where we can identify capacity in the private sector not to use that capacity if it means that we increase our throughput
357383 with such an urgent need for new hospital beds to be delivered and for waiting lists to be tackled queenslanders will be wondering why senior health bureaucrats are spending so much time touring hospitals in other countries
357384 i think its appropriate every now and then to review that travel budget to ensure it is being used appropriately
357385 im always worried when i see expenditure going into areas that dont have a direct effect on good patient outcomes
357386 just as i look at travel every now and then i look at other areas of administration to see if there are ways that we can save money and redirect those funds into front end services
357387 after so many years of inaction it is impossible for australia to be in front of the world in tackling climate change
357388 a greater risk is being left behind a world of emerging economic opportunities
357389 in this green paper the government has sought to strike the right balance on the basis of economically responsible policy in the national interest
357390 too often in the history of the world when young people travel in great number to other parts of the world they do so in the cause of war but you here today are here as pilgrims of peace
357391 following christ is not cost free not always easy because it requires struggling against what st paul called the flesh old fat relentless egos old fashioned selfishness
357392 it is always a battle even for old people like me
357393 faith is something you need to make work and this is what im doing being here
357394 its huge something the entire worlds going to be focusing on
357395 keeping your mouth shut and keeping your love of god inside yourself
357396 no assessment has been made on how to achieve and the likelihood of achieving a binding international agreement on lower carbon emissions including the major developing emitter nations when that is precisely what is required to lower global emissions whether or not an emissions trading scheme is implemented in australia
357397 what are the strategies for engaging with china in particular on these issues
357398 our immigration and resettlement policy is not effectively encouraging people to make long term commitments
357399 foreign policy is not a matter for this department he said source
357400 its difficult to comprehend that the workplace had become that dysfunctional
357401 a rather aggressive approach towards staff almost to the point of being harassing itself
357402 fatigue is a chronic problem for staff and the shortage is affecting services to the public
357403 but if it had occurred any time in the previous six weeks he would have probably died because of a lack of resources
357404 the reality is however that they are very often the first on scene where people have been injured
357405 she invited me to come close and put my hand on her fulsome bosom only to reveal that to be the nesting place of her favourite pet marsupial
357406 it was a terrified sugar glider that obviously felt it had been trapped in a ravine somewhere in the himalayas
357407 to use religion as a reason to refuse blind and disabled passengers is unjustified
357408 not only is it very costly no one knows whether it is a realistic storage solution for carbon emissions
357409 the rudd government appears determined to proceed however even though treasury asked that at the minimum it refrain from taking such action until after next years un summit on climate change in the danish capital copenhagen meeting when it will be seen what measures other developed nations may take
357410 we know by keeping good jobs in industries like aluminium smelters and refineries here in australia we are actually helping in the battle against greenhouse gases
357411 we are dangerously tired overworked and stressed and patients are suffering and dying from errors borne of pure exhaustion
357412 hours are ridiculous working 12 days straight is idiotic and guarantees serious medical errors with fatal consequences
357413 i constantly reconsider my options you asked whether i have considered leaving the medical profession in the last three years of course daily and unless things change soon i most likely will
357414 when you are fatigued you cant see the wood for the trees to make decisions
357415 i know a significant proportion of the people i see here who are stressed are worried they might have made a mistake
357416 when people feel they might be compromising patient care it can be anything from not having done their paperwork before the knock off to being worried about a major incident
357417 we do not have the capacity in our public health care system to give victorians the care they need right now today that is beds nurses doctors and emergency departments
357418 we value the feedback of our hospital doctors and recognise the vital work they do in making the states public health system one of the worlds best
357419 the huge pressure on our doctors is further proof that labor has abandoned victorian public hospitals
357420 bagels chopped liver matzo balls schmaltz herrings there are things in a kosher diet that make us put on weight
357421 we aim to lose about a kilo a week so were looking for 100 people to lose 10 kilos each and the more the better
357422 its disturbing i even have teenagers contacting me saying please talk to my mother and tell her what she has to do because i cant spend another minute in that school
357423 i even have people who have been excluded from school for bullying contacting me they have no choice they have to be educated somewhere
357424 it started from day one they didnt give him a chance they didnt give him a go
357425 his disorder means he cant socialise properly anyway and now almost every single day he comes home crying
357426 he says mum i cant take it any more i just cant do it any more and that is heartbreaking really heartbreaking
357427 there is not one single day where something hasnt happened
357428 if he stays where he is it will be devastating
357429 i now believe that the only way to stop the bullying is for my son to stand up to them but the problem is that he doesnt know how to be physically violent oh and by the way he is only nine years old
357430 professor garnaut undertook a national tour of town hall meetings to speak directly to the public after he released his draft report
357431 the people in regional australia will suffer the hardest hit especially if we are wrong footed on climate change the awu is not prepared to abandon the regions these jobs in regional australia are integral to the future well being of our nation
357432 we know by keeping good jobs in industries like these smelters and refineries here in australia we are actually helping in the battle against greenhouse gases
357433 the federal government must help these industries to clean up their act and bring in new technologies such as carbon capture and storage
357434 for every tonne of alumina made here in australia we have 50 per cent less emissions than the same tonne made in china so if this industry shifts to china because of climate change imposts we only worsen global pollution
357435 he had been waiting in emergency for about 28 hours before they shifted him into the hospital mr atkinson said
357436 i couldnt believe how pathetic our public health system can be
357437 then they had another trauma victim come in and he got pushed back into the ward
357438 the hospital is sorry about mr atkinsons wait for a ward bed he said
357439 the patient was not able to be moved to a ward sooner because the hospital was experiencing heavy demand for beds
357440 on thursday we experienced a very high number of surgical cases at that time but all the time he was with us in the emergency department his condition was monitored
357441 thats an incredible salt overload on its own let alone with everything else you eat in a day
357442 i know its an icon of the australian diet but if people knew what they were eating and what its doing to their health they might well think twice about it
357443 theres very clear evidence that eating more salt pushes your blood pressure up and that increases your risk of stroke and heart attack
357444 youre obviously not going to fall dead as you bite into the sausage but youre going to pay for it down the track
357445 the government now needs to make salt a national health priority and lead negotiations on maximum salt targets for different products
357446 i discovered for the first time about a month ago that you can get through compulsory schooling in nsw and never know that the holocaust the destruction of jews in europe actually happened
357447 you will know a lot about don bradman and thats terrific but i think to live life you need to know the holocaust happened
357448 there are opportunities to study the holocaust and its consequences in a number of ways in both mandatory and elective history
357449 it is indeed possible to complete 13 years of schooling in nsw without having studied the holocaust
357450 this is a matter of great concern to the jewish community which works towards social cohesion as a matter of principle
357451 so we tend to look at things like world war i and ii as australias involvement rather than what was at stake why did it occur and what was going on
357452 part of the problem of doing it from the point of view of australia is students get the perspective that australia saves the world
357453 vre and other bacteria such as mrsa are becoming more common causes of healthcare associated infections in sa and other states across australia
357454 we cant stress enough the importance of visitors to our hospitals to follow simple and effective hand hygiene steps to stop their spread
357455 no longer can this nation rest upon the basis of the ordinary way of life of conducting business in the way we did of working the way to which we have been accustomed the current crisis has put an end to that period in our history
357456 the penalty clause for us not acting is almost unthinkable this country is on the verge of cataclysmic times such as the human collective experience has never known
357457 one of the things that strikes me most strongly about this debate is its theological nature and thats essentially that we have sinned against the environment that we are now being punished and the only way we can escape that punishment is to wear a hair shirt for the rest of our lives
357458 i do not believe every proposition thats been put when the weather department can tell me what the weather is going to be like next friday with any certainty and treasury can get within a million dollars of what the surplus is going to be next year ill believe an economic model that marries those two things and casts them out over 100 years ill make one prediction that whatever number garnaut puts on where well be in 2100 it will be at least a trillion dollars either way wrong
357459 they see no other way out because of the lack of support by the persons appointed by the service who are supposed to look after its members
357460 i used to organise the funerals for officers who died in sydney either from suicide or accidents the ambulance service would make a show of caring by paying for the funeral and getting the band to play but then its swept under the carpet
357461 the majority are about terrible bullying and harassment that has gone on for years and is driving people to do terrible things their psychological health is damaged for some their whole lives are damaged
357462 i would take sickies so i didnt have to work with him and then i decided i had to retire
357463 prejudicial in nature inconsistent in application and protracted in duration
357464 wed be using a patients own cells so their body is not going to react it
357465 while we are creating this living tissue we are subjecting it to exactly the sort of pressures it will be under in the body like the pressure of blood flow
357466 if a human heart valve can be grown using the patients tissues this would be a great advantage
357467 it would be a living tissue which might even regenerate and repair itself
357468 im happy with this and theyve said it will last 10 to 15 years before i need a replacement maybe longer
357469 but if i had the choice to grow my own valve that would just be amazing
357470 we need to use correct body terms because by giving children silly names or names that only the family understands youre telling your child that you cant cope with talking about it how does a child get help if nobody understands
357471 you dont want to scare children too much and create an environment of fear
357472 parents are best placed to determine how much they need to tell their children and at what age
357473 i dont think its appropriate for very young children they arent ready for those sorts of adult concepts and its a sad indictment on society
357474 a lot of nursery tales are cautionary tales in their original sense so i dont see a problem with making it relevant to today
357475 this is bureaucratic meddling its absurdity and it smacks of overkill
357476 the heavy hand of the state is impinging on the parent child relationship they are saying that you must be correctly programmed from the age of three were talking about children who can neither read nor write leave the pre schoolers alone
357477 its a good compromise were not throwing the fairytales out but were engaging in conversations with our children keeping them safe
357478 theres no easy way to deliver a message about such a sensitive topic and that is why the state government enlisted the advice and assistance of local child protection experts in developing the program the curriculum is taught in a way that is relevant and appropriate for each year level and includes the use of anatomically correct and respectful language
357479 the implication is that minimum standards are good enough at least for some students
357480 all students and their families however have a right to expect high quality not minimum numeracy outcomes from their schooling
357481 curriculum emphases and assessment regimes should be explicitly designed to discourage a reliance upon superficial and low level proficiency
357482 it does produce gains in attainment for higher achieving students at the expense of lower attaining students
357483 the mathematical knowledge skill and understanding people need today if they are to be truly numerate involves considerably more than the acquisition of mathematical routines and algorithms
357484 they do not describe proficiency in numeracy or even the minimum standards that the community expects from australian schools
357485 the rush to apparent proficiency at the expense of the sound conceptual development needed for sustained and ongoing mathematical proficiency must be rejected
357486 from the earliest years greater emphasis should be given to providing students with frequent exposure to higher level mathematical problems rather than routine procedural tasks in contexts of relevance to them
357487 on monday we were told we had to get ministerial approval the previous approval was retracted
357488 we intended this scanner for use for public and private patients statewide
357489 the hospitals act is designed to ensure the safety of patients is protected when additions or alterations are made in private medical establishments
357490 this move could deprive seriously ill tasmanians of an important diagnostic tool and beggars belief
357491 we do not comment on individual patients all patients have a right to medical confidentiality
357492 on wednesday evening there was a significant number of patients in the emergency department including three patients with life threatening conditions which meant patients with less serious conditions waited to be seen by a doctor
357493 every patient who presents to the emergency department is triaged by a senior nurse when they arrive patients with serious conditions are treated ahead of those with less serious conditions
357494 if a patient needs to be admitted to hospital they will be transferred to a ward as soon as a bed becomes available
357495 we are currently experiencing high demand for inpatient beds which has caused delays for some patients
357496 our staff work very hard to ensure every patient receives the very best care throughout their stay we are more than happy to fully investigate any concerns patients or their families have about their care if they alert us
357497 im not angry with the hospital i am angry with the government hes a war veteran for him to be treated like this is just not right
357498 the cha review has found specific impact on low and middle income earners the group the proposed threshold changes were in fact designed to assist says a submission the organisation lodged yesterday with the office of wayne swan
357499 patients in both public and private sectors will be adversely impacted by the likely fall in private health insurance membership but it is low and middle income earners who will bear the brunt of the new pressure that will be placed on the public health system
357500 weve been watching several computer simulations for the past few days and they are indicating that some of the best rain for 2008 is likely next week and this is forecast to fall over some of our worst drought affected areas
357501 widespread rainfall totals of 25 to 50mm are likely over large areas of western queensland western nsw northern victoria and south australia from monday to friday
357502 the whole idea that you can say that by 2030 or 2040 rainfall will be a certain percentage less is a complete nonsense because it ignores the natural variability
357503 for example claims from some quarters that the great barrier reef would be destroyed if australia which emits less than 2 per cent of global greenhouse gases does not adopt an ets are patent nonsense chicken little arguments are no substitute for getting right the important details on issues of far reaching consequence
357504 while this is a scientific report parts of these high level projections read more like a disaster novel than a scientific report
357505 whats clear is that the cycle of drought is going to be more regular and deeper than ever
357506 sometimes well sigh sometimes well cry and well know why just you and i
357507 in the town where i was born lived a man who sailed to sea
357508 we got along until you did that now all i want is just my stuff back did you get that let me repeat that i want my stuff back
357509 meltdown its not a crush in a hot hot room were in a rush
357510 shes got to be strong cause so many things getting out of control should drive her away why does she stay

357512 maybe ill get a car maybe ill drive so far theyll all lose track me ill bounce right back
357513 all lies in jest till a man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest
357514 the king of marigold was in the kitchen cooking breakfast for the queen
357515 and then out in the night with their pride in their pants and the sluts that they tow underneath the street lamps
357516 girl walkin the spot she stop traffic she blowin your mind with her asset so jessica alba fantastic instant classic boys like whoa
357517 so ill stop again and look right past the pain because ive been in love before and i can love again
357518 i really want to know you i really want to go with you i really want to show you
357519 little things that will change you forever may appear out of the blue making fools of everybody who dont understand
357520 take the prize but not before you realize win or lose its all the same

357583 without these real estate related losses and loan write downs surrounding the small builder and construction related commercial segments of the portfolio affected by the repercussions of the countrys housing market meltdown net income would have been 3 42 million as of june 2008 a decrease of only 17 6 from the same period last year
357584 net earnings have been impacted for the first six months of 2008 primarily due to the banks vigilance in addressing the risk exposure in a segment of our loan portfolio impacted by the weakness in the homebuilding industry and the slowing economy
357585 domestic sales continued to weaken in the second quarter given challenging market conditions
357586 as a result the company has taken considerable steps to reduce ongoing operating expenses as evidenced by the recent reduction in corporate workforce in addition i am spending a considerable amount of time in the field working to restore sales activity while several factors have contributed to slower than anticipated growth in our associate numbers the company believes that the wellness industry will grow domestically and that our direct sales channel is capable of restoring sales growth to historic levels

357597 once again shaws is demonstrating that the bottom line means more than people by offering a substandard wage package shifting an excessive amount of health care costs too workers and eliminating their pension plan
357598 the union recognizes its a very competitive retail market in new england but shaws continues to maintain a very strong position in that market
357599 given shaws performance and place in the market we feel their proposals reach far too deeply into the pockets of their own workers
357600 local 791 has worked hard to address many of the companys issues throughout these negotiations but what the company is asking from our members is unrealistic as well as unfair the goal of local 791s negotiating committee is to work diligently to get a contract that we can recommend to our members however if we are unable to recommend an agreement to our members and they reject the companys offer we are prepared to set up picket lines

357610 we have received expert unbiased advice about the steps we should take
357611 what this bank and its parent company are now doing and planning to do to address the issues facing capitalsouth are the kind of steps i looked for as a bank regulator
357612 after nearly 40 years in banking i have learned that adverse market conditions impact even good loan portfolios what i want to see from a regulators perspective is that the bank is aggressive in evaluating and managing its loans when market conditions change i was privileged to serve for a time several years ago on the board of the company from this experience i am confident that management and the board of both the bank and the company are determined to protect the interests of both depositors and stockholders
357613 our core operating income excluding the impact of provision for credit losses for the second quarter 2008 was better than the first quarter
357614 first quarter noninterest income included a gain on sale of the unguaranteed portion of the sba loans which we recorded for the first time our service charge and fee income for the second quarter were higher than that of the preceding quarter
357615 during the second quarter financial institutions continued to be challenged by pervasive asset quality problems and dwindling profitability unfortunately the problem is far from over
357616 despite the slowing economy and the adverse financial condition our asset quality remains sound given the overall market conditions i am pleased with our second quarter performance our core operating income and total assets grew moderately also the launching of our third branch in irvine has been successful we continue to be vigilant in monitoring our credit portfolio in consideration of further deterioration in macro economic conditions until the real estate market stabilizes we will remain cautious with the expertise of our seasoned staff i am certain that we have the capability and acumen to overcome the challenges

357670 i didnt have the crystal ball to see the downturn in real estate
357671 we think were on the cutting edge of this and could be on to something
357672 our pipeline of single family residential is up 30 percent this year
357673 people are seeing falling prices and an investment that wont be recouped

357689 the more we try to check it the more it gets intensified
357690 what can the police do when such a large number of people are involved
357691 it is a fight to end the discrimination being faced by us at the hands of kashmir centric rulers this discrimination is faced in every sphere be it sharing political power or recruitments in government offices the amarnath land row has united people to fight against this discrimination
357692 land was given to the board for raising temporary structures when mufti mohammad sayeed was heading the coalition government as the government cancelled its order the board approached the high court who directed the government to hand over land to the latter
357693 these instances are the tip of the iceberg of the discrimination faced by jammu
357694 to maintain hegemony of one community over state politics the government deferred delimitation of assembly constituencies due to be held this year following opposition from the pdp and nc at an all party meeting convened by azad last year the previous government of farooq abdullah had enacted a legislation against increasing the present number of assembly seats till 2026 as fresh delimitation would have increased the number of assembly seats in jammu region in view of the increase in its population following migration by three lakh kashmiri pandits and thousands of muslims from the valley during the two decade long turmoil
357695 if the kashmiri politicians are not prepared to allow temporary usage of 800 kanals of land to provide facilities to pilgrims how will they tolerate pandits permanently returning to their native places in the valley
357696 meals drinks golf outings tickets to rodeo events baseball and football games and other entertainment items
357697 we are fully cooperating with the governments investigation of this matter and will continue to do so
357698 companies that cooperate with the government in the war on terror deserve our appreciation and protection not litigation
357699 we insist to keep the current peaceful relations as we promised taiwans citizens we have prepared to stop prohibit any activities conduct and any excuses to divide taiwan away from china in whatever cause the activities are going to cause serious harm chenshuibians president of taiwan conspiracy of an independent taiwan causes serious harm in our peaceful relations we will resort to military action if they continue these irresponsible actions
357700 beijing has deployed some 1 000 missiles targeting taiwan and the sea lanes surrounding the island with 50 to 100 being added annually
357701 the idea of the kbr contract is to support the army corp of engineers
357702 in case we experienced a sudden mass immigration and we had to respond quickly we would need immediate detention facilities in the form of temporary housing that would enable us to determine if the large numbers of illegal immigrants were political or economically motivated or if they were criminals or terrorists
357703 any incident regardless of location that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties damage or disruption severely affecting the u s population infrastructure environment economy or government functions
357704 is seen by iraqis as an indication of who actually exercises power in their country
357705 massive amount of work still facing the us and our commitment to see it through
357706 we were told by the office of military commissions based on what was done to him it made his case unprosecutable
357707 it would taint any confession if obtained under coercion they were unwilling to move forward with any prosecution of al qahtani
357708 no 2 if it does work its not reliable no 3 it may not be legal ethical or moral no 4 its going to hurt you when you have to prosecute these guys no 5 sooner or later all of this stuff is going to come to light and youre going to be embarrassed
357709 we had agents who knew how to do adversarial interviews had sat across from bad guys
357710 interviews and interrogations are not about making someone talk they are about making them want to
357711 if you want to be on the team youve got to put on the uniform
357712 what makes me intensely proud of all these individuals was they said we will not be party to this even if were ordered to do so
357713 they are heroes and theres no other way to describe them they demonstrated enormous personal courage and personal integrity in standing up for american values and the system we all live for
357714 we always said there are no secrets just delayed disclosures
357715 and what we told our folks is your grandchildren are going to ask what did you do during the war we wanted our folks to be proud of what they did
357716 instead of having a crime scene a suspect we had suspects
357717 so we had to take a suspect then track that particular person once we identified who they actually were through various levels of their life through possible radicalization through a possible visit to a training camp in afghanistan or elsewhere where they might have learned some of the tradecraft of terrorism we would then have to determine where they might have been at any particular point in their life from there determine if any acts occurred in that particular area and then if the individual might have been involved in any of those acts and if those acts then would have been a criminal violation so it was very much different from the way you would traditionally work a criminal investigation
357718 theres always been some hard core people down there who want to do very bad things to the united states and some who werent but now theyre very upset
357719 once september 11th occurred and the global war on terror began people had in their mind that when you arrested somebody like a car theft or a bank robber what you do is you put him in jail then you give him a lawyer then you have a trial and then you punish them
357720 of course in this instance the people in guantanamo bay these are people that were picked up on the battlefield for killing innocent men women and children in afghanistan theyre not car thieves the purpose is to keep them off the battlefield so they dont kill more innocent men women and children and to try to interrogate them and find out what they know so we can stop other terrorists from killing still additional americans and friends of ours it isnt a law enforcement task its a war on terrorism task
357721 guided by a very detailed plan conducted by trained professionals in a controlled environment and with active supervision
357722 the first time most of these interrogators were actually in the room with a real bad guy was at guantanamo bay
357723 with this tremendous challenge of trying to elicit information from someone whos a suspected terrorist
357724 throw a chair inside a room have a room upstairs with spotlights turn on music very loud under constant supervision of an mp guard
357725 some of them really became fond of some fast food french fries and cheeseburgers
357726 our folks would sit on the ground with detainees having tea
357727 many of the detainees wanted also to be released and our goal was to obtain accurate information a good investigator works hard to prove guilt or innocence
357728 we were not browbeating them we were not fussing with them
357729 we would create an environment where they were comfortable talking with us asking about their families have they had any correspondence with them is their food acceptable
357730 coming in to discuss things and just loving a pepperoni pizza which is pork and him being a good muslim he knew it and smoking his marlboros building a rapport is not what theyre used to and it worked for us as we built a rapport it would be yes or no then it would be telling us whether they did or did not do it and if they didnt who did
357731 we would share that information but then jtf 170 would get him up in the middle of the night to have him tell them the same information it impeded our process
357732 i watched the intelligence community military and civilian struggle with how to develop a coherent strategy to deal with terrorist subjects
357733 i wish they had asked our law enforcement folks more had invited us to the table more we sure did not have all the answers but i think we could have helped
357734 to ensure that we would not in the heat of battle in a highly emotional period in an effort to do the right thing commit criminal acts
357735 i told ice interrogation control element i do not want any of our interrogations or interviews in the same trailer as the intel collectors are
357736 we are not to partake of any of their tactics we are not to witness any of their tactics we cant have the foolishness from those folks in the mix
357737 thats good news but there is quite a bit of variety among the performance of these countries particularly among the african countries
357738 this will be a way for china to show the world what it is capable of
357739 i think it is going to be the biggest show of its type ever seen
357740 the ceremony wont make people forget all the controversies but they might put them aside for just 3 hours
357741 some previous ceremonies have been truly extraordinary and i have no doubt that the chinese will match that at least if not take it on to another plane
357742 but frankly these things go on for too long and it is getting increasingly hard to wow people
357743 our commitment to invest in high growth eastern hemisphere markets is evident in our results
357744 caused wiretaps to be placed on the telephones of 17 persons without having obtained a court order authorizing the tap as required by federal law in violation of sections 241 371 and 2510 11 of the criminal code
357745 for years this administration has engaged in warrantless wiretapping of americans contrary to the law
357746 for five years he has been operating an illegal program
357747 the heavy criticism which the president took on the program
357748 i think was very harmful in the political process and for the reputation of the country
357749 people have gotten worried thinking that its quite likely they might be under a microscope
357750 this removal of any reference to humiliating and degrading treatment will be perceived by experts and probably allies as rewriting
357751 common article 3 of the geneva conventions which the united states ratified in 1949
357752 all the judicial guarantees recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples
357753 its plain that this proposal would abrogate portions of common article 3
357754 if left undefined this provision will create an unacceptable degree of uncertainty for those who fight to defend us from terrorist attack
357755 i mean what is degrading in one society may not be degrading in another or may be degrading in one religion not in another religion
357756 and since it does have an international interpretation which is generally frankly different than our own it becomes very very relevant
357757 its not a question of being stingy but coming up with a well defined statutory scheme that would withstand constitutional challenges and would lead to successful prosecutions
357758 not be beholden to the definition of vague words by international or foreign courts who often pursue nakedly political agendas at odds with the united states
357759 left deliberately vague because efforts to define it would invariably lead to wrongdoers identifying exceptions and because the meaning was plain treat people like humans and not animals or objects
357760 the entire world is looking for a way to sucker punch us
357761 national security is absolutely at the top of the list of issues thats why i think john mccain is the guy to keep us safe
357762 hey that looks like the cover of a book i have
357763 look they have a drink called carter beats the devil
357764 make more time for the things you want to do
357765 cuando te conoc cre que hab a encontrado a la persona con la que iba a pasar el resto de mi vida eso cre y todos los chicos y todos los bares y mis traumas evidentes me daban igual porque te hab a encontrado no te pido disculpas por c mo intento reparar lo que rompiste
357766 remember when you were small and had invisible friends i had invisible enemies
357767 people are getting their understanding of the world from random lunatics riffing in their underwear rather than professional journalists with standards and passports
357768 we know that iraq has already misused international agreements to obtain tularemia from the u s we have every reason to assume that iraq may soon weaponize two of the three most lethal biotoxins anthrax and tularemia
357769 scooby doo has enchanted generations of audiences for nearly 40 years and as evidenced by box office dvd sales and television ratings the franchise today is stronger than ever
357770 were delighted to extend the scooby doo legacy into another live action film and bring these beloved characters to an even greater legion of fans in an all new original movie
357771 this project is also an anchor component of our new push into movies our great partnership with warner premiere and the overall expansion of cartoon network programming efforts
357772 a broken eye socket a broken cheek bone two black eyes a bruised collar bone numbness in the face a chronically drooping eye socket and cheek
357773 my bet is the authorities wont let them out until after the olympics
357774 not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
357775 by continuing to persecute and punish those who speak out for human rights the chinese authorities have lost sight of the promises they made when they were granted the games seven years ago
357776 the chinese authorities are tarnishing the legacy of the games
357777 it is a new low for the international community to see all these state leaders going to beijing without saying anything about the repressive environment in which the games are being held

357789 fine he wrote me a scrip said it should clear up within a week or so
357790 he said there were three moles on my back that looked suspicious so he removed them and sent them to be biopsied
357791 these days there are few things that have me feeling scared the greatest fear i experience is around our marketing i often will literally have fear i break out in a sweat when getting ready to send out a marketing piece or when i make changes on our website it all ties in with my fears of being misunderstood ive spent a lot of time trying to control situations to make sure that everyone is getting what i actually mean and not misinterpreting me and forming false assumptions since i cant control anyone clearly this is a losing proposition then the idea of putting a marketing piece out into the ethers on the internet where i have absolutely no idea who is looking at it and what they are thinking well no wonder my fear goes through the roof
357792 life is not measured by the number of breaths we take but by the moments that take our breath away
357793 use your mental health even to the point of wearing it out that is what it is for spend all you have before you die do not outlive yourself
357794 each new depth we explore opens up new heights to us as well
357795 oh no its cool its just ketchup you really dont want to know
357796 i hear people who are bulimic they see themselves as fat
357797 when i was playing i saw myself as not good enough so i always tried to be better i dont know if thats a real element but i could watch people and think they did a good job but then watch myself and i was kind of embarrassed so i tried to work harder
357798 he was aggressive and he was strong he was solid from head to toe he was a supreme athlete he didnt look like a bodybuilder but his body was all muscle and he could take a shot and torque and stay on his feet where other guys would fall down
357799 with his shoulder out of his joint he goes out and plays the entire second half he wasnt coming out unless john was coming out that gives an idea of his mental toughness
357800 people have a hard time with that but thats just the honest truth i just never thought that way
357801 i hear people who are bulimic they see themselves as fat
357802 when i was playing i saw myself as not good enough so i always tried to be better i dont know if thats a real element but i could watch people and think they did a good job but then watch myself and i was kind of embarrassed so i tried to work harder
357803 he was aggressive and he was strong he was solid from head to toe he was a supreme athlete he didnt look like a bodybuilder but his body was all muscle and he could take a shot and torque and stay on his feet where other guys would fall down
357804 with his shoulder out of his joint he goes out and plays the entire second half he wasnt coming out unless john was coming out that gives an idea of his mental toughness
357805 people have a hard time with that but thats just the honest truth i just never thought that way
357806 dont put anything in an e mail that could embarrass you
357807 it would be like electing gerald young to the hall of fame and leaving willie mays out
357808 we were all saying boy that was a huge job
357809 weve gotten a lot of production out of our pinch hitters
357810 i think los probably the best he just always gives you a quality at bat he can sit over there for a week five days or whatever he always seems to go up there with the situation on the line or the game on the line he puts a good swing on it and tonight he was dead on
357811 i think the guys would say that they defensively didnt get it done in that inning for me or for the team
357812 but they were pretty tough plays that had to be made
357813 in games like this when your guys go through the middle of their order with the bases loaded you got to win
357814 i dont want to speculate but what generally happens is that they either get the bends or something goes wrong with the equipment
357815 some of the divers went back down and ended up recovering his body
357816 what we heard is that his oxygen tank went out and his scuba buddy got separated from him
357817 the water was too hard to see in and they didnt find him until an hour after his oxygen ran out
357818 they have to check his tanks and so forth and with the tanks it could take a couple months
357819 a full service provider of turnkey solutions to the telecommunications cable television and various other industries
357820 he liked really unique things that told a story by themselves
357821 he wanted to do this the andrea doria dive to test how far he could go
357822 he heard how dangerous it was and he loved doing dangerous things he loved going over and beyond
357823 there were some of them that shouldnt have been there
357824 i will later scuba just to continue his dream of how he wanted things to be
357825 were happy to provide our positions via our web site and conversations with individuals and groups
357826 did you know that the valdez spill wasnt even one of the top 10 worst spills in history like the nowruz oil field spill in 80
357827 in addition to r amp d exxonmobil has spent over 13 million in the save the tiger fund since 1992
357828 exxon can contact twitter if they believe that there is a case of impersonation and we will review the account
357829 this was a truly despicable crime committed by deadly brutal young men who were deadly dangerous to anyone who might find themselves near them all five were sentenced to death by separate juries after hearing all of the evidence in each of their individual trials
357830 no matter how long the courts of this state this nation or any other nation review re review and re review once again the disgusting facts of this crime and these perpetrators the result should be the same these juries reached a reasonable verdict beyond a reasonable doubt that a sentence of death was the only appropriate punishment under texas law
357831 i always felt like one moment youre not on your toes watching thats the moment they would get you
357832 if i was still in the mobile check cashing business i wouldnt be talking to you right now
357833 and if you take the proper precautions its no longer worthwhile
357834 robbers can forecast right down to the minute when youre going to be somewhere
357835 frankly there was a lot of dispute at the time it was granted to them
357836 circumstances have changed with oil at these levels we dont think that manufacturers credit is necessary to encourage them to explore and produce oil and gas
357837 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
357838 i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
357839 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore
357840 its only a logical extension of whats happening in the gulf right now plus that area has been identified as an area where resources are available right now
357841 if anybody wants to drill off florida theyll have a fight on their hands
357842 unfortunately the proposal would eliminate floridas 2006 gulf protections and give floridians absolutely no voice in determining where exploration could occur
357843 it doesnt make a whole lot of sense just to open everything up right now and think that were going to have a rush by the folks who do the exploration to go all over america
357844 take a look at it and see if theres aspects of it that we could embrace
357845 when we come back we hope that colleagues will have heard from their constituents that something has to be done and done before congress finishes its business this year
357846 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
357847 act on their own in ways that are not in convergence
357848 we need to identify these people and weed them out
357849 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations
357850 its clear iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium we the united states will work with our allies to come up with another resolution in the security council
357851 the window of influence is becoming smaller and i believe is about to close
357852 people when they have diarrhea are not necessarily thinking where did i eat last night
357853 said michele hlavsa an epidemiologist with the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta which has noted a national increase in crypto cases in the past few years
357854 the bathroom especially the master is one of those places of refuge
357855 later i realized i was always artistic but at first i just couldnt cope with things not turning out the way they did in the books
357856 the desert is really beautiful and i still dream about it sometimes
357857 but its really lonely out there you lose power when it snows you drive two hours to go to the grocery store its more remote than most people imagine
357858 both of my children have special needs and i really needed a creative outlet
357859 i think my children allowed me to understand that things arent always going to go the way you envision them and that was ok
357860 its like when youre making something you think im going to do this and the fiber says no you have to let the fiber do whats its going to do
357861 i started doing things the way i wanted to do them but it was a long time before i got something good
357862 im not doing things the traditional way but i look at the traditional techniques to work for me
357863 i was having trouble with some things and wanted to talk to other people who coiled
357864 then you realize its a teapot show and youre thinking how in the world is that a teapot
357865 then you start looking at the spout and you see the stem of one of the figs the lid is a top of another fig and the body is a bowl filled with fruit and then the handle becomes the napkin and knife
357866 it forces you to look at what is a teapot
357867 ive always stuck with the idea they can be useful
357868 i think most people are drawn in by the shape
357869 wooden teapot whose turbulent surface could be a metaphor of boiling tea within
357870 i would see things i missed a lot of the work is tiny and intricate
357871 are you the one they talk about so much going to college
357872 its very very helpful to have a student in the class who along with me remembers lyndon johnson and his presidency who remembers nixon who remembers jimmy carter
357873 younger students have read about and heard about it but they havent lived through those administrations and all the things that occurred then joann offers a very welcome perspective shes lived long enough to see a great deal
357874 i dont have that many more years to live and i want to do good for humanity while im here
357875 the mission is to create a free resources for consumers to handle their legal matters with confidence
357876 normally when you need a lawyer the process of finding a good one can be frightening
357877 we can bring more transparency and understanding to the process of getting a lawyer
357878 we were all saying boy that was a huge job
357879 weve gotten a lot of production out of our pinch hitters
357880 i think los probably the best he just always gives you a quality at bat he can sit over there for a week five days or whatever he always seems to go up there with the situation on the line or the game on the line he puts a good swing on it and tonight he was dead on
357881 i think the guys would say that they defensively didnt get it done in that inning for me or for the team
357882 but they were pretty tough plays that had to be made
357883 in games like this when your guys go through the middle of their order with the bases loaded you got to win
357884 there are all sorts of things that would be comforting i expect an injection of morphine would be comforting but to say that something is comforting is not to say that its true
357885 deaths in the bible god 2 270 365 not including the victims of noahs flood sodom and gomorrah or the many plagues famines fiery serpents etc because no specific numbers were given satan 10
357886 it is a truism that almost any sect cult or religion will legislate its creed into law if it acquires the political power to do so
357887 its ironic because thomas coached art first before he transferred over to defense and coached me
357888 when we first sat down i said coach what are you going to do about me
357889 he said nothing just do what youve been doing so he brought to me an appreciation and knowledge of what i was doing he told me i was doing what i needed to do because i know what it takes at that position
357890 i mean you can go to the galleria and just about everybodys 5 8 165 but darrell played at a high level for 20 years
357891 before we drafted darrell there was some discussion just like there is with every pick but general manager bobby beathard never wavered
357892 darrell was so explosive he was at one level and everybody else was at another level
357893 we almost always put him on the opponents best wide receiver
357894 i looked at him and told him youre going to get killed he told me he was going to play for a long time and he was right
357895 darrell played with a lot of pride he always took great care of himself he didnt drink or smoke he was gifted genetically but he never got out of shape
357896 he wasnt just a teammate of mine hes a great friend too
357897 our families are like real family his kids call me uncle my kids called him uncle we do things together this makes it just that much more of a special event for us
357898 you know i only played one year of high school football
357899 after high school i was going to play college ball at tuskegee but a cousin and i didnt like it when we visited
357900 bishop college had been in marshall and it had moved to dallas so i walked on there the first year the school was in dallas
357901 my dad was actually a lab technician for maxwell house coffee and he taught us seven children the value of hard work
357902 we obeyed them and respected them and saw them set examples
357903 we learned a lot from my parents and it carried over to my success our christian faith helped us keep things in perspective all the time
357904 i thought it was our best practice of camp to be honest with you
357905 some good meetings friday and guys really bouncing around we want to have a good physical practice in the morning and then well give them a break
357906 we wont scrimmage today but were going to put our pads on
357907 we need to bang around pretty good and then give them a good break tonight and all day sunday
357908 we start playing every week now so well get a chance to judge ourselves at the end of every week but its been a good week and we need to put the pads on
357909 if i have a choice and i dont have to practice him on this turf i would rather not
357910 we actually are taking him outside and going to work him a little bit
357911 it was tough just because that was my first team and i built a big bond with the community and the town
357912 just the relationships with the coaches it was just hard to leave i had a good bond with all the coaches
357913 tim carter if hes a returner that we think he might be could really push for a job
357914 the mccoy kid to be honest he reminded me a little bit of kevin a young kevin hes got to get better assignment wise and those types of things the kid from miami jenkins has got tremendous speed its going to be tough
357915 even when they write me letters at home they call me bulldog they dont even use my name
357916 enjoy the game play with confidence play with a swag
357917 i always have been told before you can walk youve got to crawl so im doing my role learning as much as i can and hopefully one day i can make a big impact on this team
357918 it was a privilege to visit the hall of fame
357919 its one of the proudest moments of my life that trip provided a good foundation for us and paved the way for us to enter the nfl
357920 being there and being so close to the history of the game was unbelievable the nfl is special and doing something like that showed a lot of us just how special it is
357921 what inspired me the most was hearing jim brown talk about the history of the game and what it takes to get there
357922 i wanted to read about brown and walter payton and emmitt smith i took a lot of pictures
357923 i didnt know much about the history of the game so that was an incredible learning experience for me
357924 he was a hero of mine and being able to see him and hear his words of wisdom has really stayed with me
357925 learning about the history of the game was a great experience i think it was a good move by the nfl because it gives rookies more insight into pro football and makes you appreciate it more
357926 theyre a group and i think its important they do things together
357927 i think if youre going to be involved in this league you should know the history of it i think they should have a good understanding of what that nfl shield means
357928 i played at canton mckinleys stadium next to the hall of fame nine times playing in that stadium so many times in high school was very cool
357929 id already visited the hall of fame four times i was our unofficial tour guide going back with the other rookies was an amazing experience
357930 seeing the busts and the videos man it makes you respect the game even more because we saw the guys who paved the way for us that trip put everything in perspective about why were here
357931 a lot of blood sweat and tears went into making this game what it is today
357932 they endured so much to get to canton i really appreciate what they went through
357933 it makes you respect the game respect what they went through without them we wouldnt have this opportunity
357934 i talked to my sister in law and she had talked to my aunt and said his grandfather probably wants you to just go out there and play golf but i do feel like i have something on my shoulder i know hes definitely watching me so he has the best seat in the house
357935 you always want to be around the lead thats why you practice
357936 it just makes it all the better cause i really appreciate them
357937 ross is a unique addition outside of his baseball ability and his pitching ability
357938 he would be a prospect as a position player as well but he did take off on the mound this year his academic acumen is such that he was courted not only by tulane but also stanford rice and vanderbilt he graduated no 1 in his class
357939 it scared me pretty bad but it was a fight to the end and we all put forth our best effort
357940 this is the best thing i ever won and the best ive ever felt it was the hardest ive ever skated and i can honestly say all my hard work paid off
357941 there are just haters more jealous people than i ever thought existed there are so many people that speak badly about me but thats ok because theyre still talking about me
357942 he was there with his parents sitting right in front of me
357943 when he got up to go to the concession stand you couldnt help but notice him he
357944 were re evaluating everything we do in player development but it begins with scouting
357945 are you going to call the commissioner and explain this
357946 weve taken 52 players were going to exceed the slotting guidelines on two of them we feel these are extraordinary circumstances
357947 we thought there would be maybe two or three instances when it made sense to push the envelope a little bit
357948 we have allegations in our complaint that adam pacman jones was involved in the shooting
357949 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
357950 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
357951 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
357952 men det er klart at f r jeg en henvendelse fra pet om det her s vil jeg forholde mig til det

357970 i felt like i was having menstrual cramps initially but the pain became more severe getting stronger and stronger
357971 because of the fact he was in a premature condition one of our doctors paediatrician dr tracey gilbert recommended that he be transferred to the public hospital
357972 the nurses here were phenomenal nurse theresia harvey accompanied the baby to crh

357975 cassava is a versatile product with huge potential regarding food security
357976 people think cassava means bammy but there is far more to the staple than that
357977 most caribbean people are known for their love of partying and a good time
357978 its just the atmosphere of the area it has a lot to do with the pace the people and the natural environment including its seven miles of beach
357979 it has not been a good year for arrivals for negril so this weekend offers an increase in revenue for most hoteliers
357980 we had a terrible experience last year it was gridlock so were hoping to get things under full control this year

357982 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas

357993 at 3 53 a m gmt skype seemed to be operating normally with users in asia able to log in view their contact lists place calls and send messages
357994 finally wed like to dispel a couple of theories that we are still hearing neither wednesdays planned maintenance of our web based payment services nor any form of attack was related to the current sign on issues in any way
357995 the real issue was because of a deficiency in an algorithm within skype networking software
357996 t he african american spiritual is its own art form which remains unsurpassed in its ability to communicate profound truths about existence in quickly apprehended memorable form s
357997 express an embracing of the journey to the other world as a form of ancestor connection that the african continued to practice in america the religious sensibility they had always practiced applying it to christianity
357998 either way you had to get to this point and have some closure
357999 it became more of an issue of whether or not he was going to be here and he was pretty adamant he didnt want to be here
358000 it came down to his happiness if they had come to manny and he said he wanted to stay here hed probably still be here its kind of out of our hands im glad theres a resolution there was going to be whether he was here or not
358001 we were in a bit of a difficult circumstance and we made something good of it
358002 and when you see his quotes every day thats something different i dont think its surprising but it was weird
358003 if dustin pedroia said the same comments we think hes a martian if manny says it people like it its front page news
358004 its very hard to tangibly evaluate how hurt someone is
358005 id like to and still do take his word for it until someone comes up to me and says i faked the injury its kind of like barry bonds everyone has crucified him but i still have to believe hes innocent until someone proves him guilty
358006 but it was clear he was unhappy here and we needed a productive manny ram rez
358007 his whole career was remarkable he is one of the best righthanded hitters in history and no one can ever take that away from him
358008 well see hopefully everything will start going good everybody moves on and we go where we are supposed to be
358009 i was very pleased what we care about all of us together is our team and i think we sit here feeling pretty good about our team

358047 plot a course for the next star system on our exploration chart
358048 um dave im the engineer you actually plot the course
358049 first its captain dave and ill ask you not to question my orders in front of the men
358050 thank you doc now i will plot a course to the next system decker what is the next star system called and what are its coordinates
358051 are you kidding we ran out of names a long time ago
358052 damn it decker i dont need your smart remarks what is the name of the system
358053 no captain dave are you kidding we ran out of names a long time ago is the name of the system it has 17 planets im sending you the coordinates now
358054 that was an excellent flight sir i despair of ever defeating you
358055 ive been stealing paper from decker for the last half hour
358056 we have to get this paper unfolded so we can print out the coordinates for the mission
358057 and which blinking dot are we again are we the red one
358058 right so no one on board knows how the ships engines work
358059 youre a doctor doc leave this to the captain and the engineer
358060 yes but the coordinates are not taking us to the aykwroonalta system
358061 those were the coordinates you sent me decker youve earned a demerit for sending us off course
358062 good work captain you must enforce discipline and protect the crew
358063 captain the coordinates you entered were not the ones i sent you look
358064 our initial position was here the aykwroonalta system is here only a few light years away our current course is carrying us here a really long way away
358065 i dont understand why did you send me coordinates that were so far away and which blinking dot are we again are we the red one
358066 let me give you an example suppose we were here on your console
358067 now the coordinates should have taken us here to the other end of your console instead were on course to end up way over there in my chair
358068 a chair huh well that seems like a pretty good spot youre saying the system were heading for is comfortable
358069 something unusual appeared at least decker said it was unusual as far as i know it happens all the time
358070 dave ive never seen planets just floating outside the orbital plane shouldnt we investigate
358071 its captain dave and if those planets cant have the basic decency to fall into orbit around a massive body like everyone else then they are not worthy of our time or our attention
358072 there are 49 planetary bodies i know you were thinking 7 7 is 50 but its not its 49
358073 yes that is a fault of mine always thinking the best of people im disappointed in this system they need one more planet
358074 there are now 343 planetary bodies dont try and hurt yourself
358075 thats good medical advice thank you doc youve always got your eye out for my well being
358076 s ometimes we shoot at them but most of the time we must begin to establish a rudimentary level of communication based on mathematics
358077 isnt there a name for this kind of pattern captain dave
358078 yes isnt this a fractional pattern no wait thats the thing where you divide up the pies fractured pattern i think thats it
358079 fractal pattern what youre referring to is a fractal pattern its an element of chaos theory
358080 no im pretty sure its fractured fractal is when you fall and break something havent you ever heard that you fall and get a fractal arm
358081 we will name this system the fractured orb system that way everyone will know the planetary orbs are in a fractured pattern
358082 we cannot agree with the alien culture on basic mathematical properties
358083 right the aliens however seem to think 6 7 is 41
358084 but 6 7 is 42 i know because i wrote it on a flashcard i wouldnt write it on a flashcard if it wasnt true
358085 dave the aliens still think 6 7 is 41 what do i do
358086 well the best thing to do when you cant communicate with an alien civilization is to just go down there and see what happens if we get into trouble well just shoot a bunch of them and leave
358087 yes but theyre at considerable economic advantage since they have no need of our currency and we are in desperate need of theirs
358088 how does a culture that has never made alien contact before have a bank with intergalactic exchange rates
358089 we would like to exchange our credit for your local currency
358090 sounds like they really boned us on the exchange rate
358091 yes they did i wanted 42 credits but i got 41 instead
358092 the exchange rates on worlds without previous contact are usually pretty bad
358093 you wouldnt think the local currency would trade so strongly
358094 yes but theyre at considerable economic advantage since they have no need of our currency and we are in desperate need of theirs
358095 and what do you think of when you think of circles and spheres
358096 captain i think this man wants 1300 credits for these drinks
358097 that is too much you cant charge 1300 credits for three drinks unless maybe theyre salvarian liquid nitrogen martinis but you guys dont have spaceships so you havent ever had one of those
358098 is the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle im sure you were just making a joke captain
358099 of course but im glad you explained it in case the fractorbians didnt know
358100 i thought the extra drink was for me but you have a good point we could give it to decker
358101 well there are several interesting things going on here first we agree on the area and diameter of a circle and we agree on some simple arithmetic there is still a disagreement on 6 7 though
358102 no every time we get to 6 7 the dialogue breaks down
358103 what do you notice about the shapes in this world
358104 and what do you think of when you think of circles and spheres
358105 naked buttcheeks pressed against the window of a space port those are circular we used to do that back when i was in the academy
358106 maybe doc isnt ready for the birds and the bees yet dont harass him about it everyone develops at their own pace
358107 we live in a very discrete angular world and our math is based on discrete numbers and our geometry upon angles
358108 so you think that since their world is full of circles their number system is based on the circle
358109 not only based on the circle but i believe their number system uses as a base
358110 i should have known that any culture that was that uptight about rounding should never be exposed to the parallelogram family
358111 but this still doesnt explain why they think 6 7 is 41
358112 have you noticed how offended they get when we try to round a number up
358113 ah thats what they mean when they say a number is not a number until it fully reaches that number all else is heresy i was wondering about that
358114 so if they take 6 1 909 and 7 2 228 then 6 7 41 978 but rounding up is against their religion so 6 7 has to be 41
358115 weve got to take off a mob of fractorbians are after us
358116 you should have seen the guy we were talking to i drew a square and his eyes rolled back in his head and he went into convulsions apparently they have never contemplated such a thing
358117 good thing you didnt show him a trapezoid he might very well have died
358118 i think the square is in violation of their sacred order of proportion and balance i should have known that any culture that was that uptight about rounding should never be exposed to the parallelogram family
358119 captain we cant take off theyre hanging onto the hull
358120 ill take care of it these spheroids dont like squares eh ill give them something to freak out about doc help me grab these boxes
358121 and what about the geometry of space is it angular like ours or spherical like theirs
358122 actually captain its neither space is best represented as a four dimensional continuum of space time in which space forms three dimensions and time a fourth
358123 it started drifting on me toward center field but well take what we can get but a homer wouldve been something else
358124 it was one of those balls you hit and out of the box youve got to run hard because you never know whats going to happen
358125 it had a funny spin on it and you never know if hes going to be able to field it cleanly
358126 we havent been playing very well we need to continue this the rest of the homestand and take it on the road

358145 the major news media has abandoned their job of testing senator obama
358146 senator obama cannot control the news media but he can appear with me all over the nation in a series of twenty town hall meetings with the people attending the meeting split fifty fifty by the campaigns and the questions from the audience chosen at random
358147 the jolt from this sort of direct attack on the media will make them very defensive and also very conscious about how they treat senator obama

358159 almost everybody at riid believes that he has absolutely nothing to do with amerithrax
358160 in retrospect although my concern for biosafety was honest and my desire to refrain from crying wolf was sincere i should have notified my supervisor ahead of time of my worries about a possible breach in biocontainment
358161 i thought that quietly and diligently cleaning the dirty desk area would both eliminate any possible anthrax contamination as well as prevent unintended anxiety at the institute
358162 i honestly do not recall if follow up swabs were taken of the area
358163 i may have done so but i do not now remember reswabbing
358164 if theres contamination you always reswab and you would remember doing it
358165 my name is mary alice young when you read this mornings paper you may come across an article about the unusual day i had last week normally there is never anything newsworthy about my life but that all changed last thursday
358166 of course everything seemed quite normal at first i made breakfast for my family i performed my chores i completed my projects i ran my errands in truth i spent the day as i spent every other day quietly polishing the routine of my life until it gleamed with perfection thats why it was so astonishing when i decided to go to my hallway closet and retrieve a revolver that had never been used
358167 my body was discovered by my neighbor mrs martha huber who had been startled by a strange popping sound her curiosity aroused mrs huber tried to think of a reason for dropping in on me unannounced
358168 after some initial hesitation she decided to return the blender she borrowed six months before
358169 its my neighbor i think shes been shot theres blood everywhere yes youve got to send an ambulance youve got to send one right now
358170 and for a moment mrs huber stood motionless in her kitchen grief stricken by this senseless tragedy but only for a moment
358171 and if theres one thing mrs huber was known for
358172 it was her ability to look on the bright side
358173 i was laid to rest on monday after the funeral all the residents of wisteria lane came to pay their respects and as people do in these situations they brought food lynette scavo brought fried chicken
358174 lynette had a great family recipe for fried chicken of course she didnt cook much while she was climbing up the corporate ladder
358175 she didnt have the time but when her doctor announced lynette was pregnant
358176 but this was not the case in fact lynettes life had become so hectic she was now forced to get her fried chicken from a fast food restaurant lynette would have appreciated the irony if she had stopped to think about it
358177 listen to me you are going to behave today i will not going to be humiliated in front of the entire neighborhood and just so you know how serious i am
358178 i know someone who knows someone who knows an elf and if any of you acts up so help me i will call santa and tell him you want socks for christmas are you willing to risk that
358179 gabrielle solis who lives down the block brought a spicy paella
358180 since her modeling days in new york gabrielle had developed a taste for rich food and rich men
358181 carlos who worked in mergers and acquisitions proposed on their third date gabrielle was touched when tears welled up in his eyes but she soon discovered that this happened every time carlos closed a big deal
358182 gabrielle liked her paella piping hot however her relationship with her husband was considerably cooler
358183 why dont i just pin the receipt to my chest
358184 why not at the donahue party everyone was talking mutual funds and you found a way to mention you slept with half of the yankee outfielders
358185 im telling you it came up in the context of the conversation
358186 hey people are starting to stare can you keep your voice down
358187 bree van de kamp who lives next door brought baskets of muffins she baked from scratch bree was known for her cooking and for making her own clothes and for doing her own gardening and for re upholstering her own furniture yes brees many talents were known throughout the neighborhood and everyone on wisteria lane thought of bree as the perfect wife and mother everyone that is except her own family
358188 susan mayer who lives across the street brought macaroni and cheese her husband carl always teased her saying it was the only thing she knew how to cook and she rarely made it well it was too salty the night she and carl moved into their house it was too watery the night she found lipstick on carls shirt she burned it the night carl told her he was leaving her for his secretary
358189 a year had passed since the divorce susan had started to think how nice it would be to have a man in her life even one who would make fun of her cooking
358190 well sometimes people are so unhappy they think thats the only way they can solve their problems
358191 yeah but sometimes people pretend to be one way on the outside when theyre totally different on the inside
358192 oh you mean like how dads girlfriend is always smiling and says nice things but deep down you just know shes a bitch
358193 i dont like that word julie but yeah thats a great example
358194 youll love this he said it doesnt mean anything it was just sex
358195 and then he got this zen look on his face and said you know susan most men live lives of quiet desperation
358196 no i said really and what do most women lead lives of noisy fulfillment
358197 i mean of all people did he have to bang his secretary i had that woman over for brunch
358198 its like my grandmother always said an erect penis doesnt have a conscious
358199 when rex started going to those medical conferences i wanted it in the back of his mind that he had a loving wife at home with a loaded smith amp wesson
358200 i just dont know how im going to survive this
358201 listen to me we all have moments of desperation but if we face them head on thats when we find out just how strong we really are
358202 im just so angry if mary alice was having problems she should have come to us she should have let us help her
358203 she was healthy had a great home a nice family
358204 gabby the woman killed herself something must have been going on
358205 no i just refuse to believe that anybody can screw up macaroni and cheese
358206 oh my god how did you it tastes like its burnt and undercooked
358207 now that everybodys seen that ive brought something i should probably just throw this out
358208 i am your mother you have to do as i say
358209 lynette shouldnt have been so concerned about my husband he had other things on his mind things below the surface
358210 t he morning after my funeral my friends and neighbors quietly went back to their busy busy lives
358211 while some did their cooking and some did their cleaning
358212 hi im julie i kicked my soccer ball into your backyard
358213 his wife died a year ago he wanted to stay in l a but there were too many memories hes renting for tax purposes but he hopes to buy a place real soon
358214 youre obviously into each other now that you know hes single you can ask him out
358215 no im just trying to remember i dont want to talk to you about my love life anymore it weirds me out
358216 dad said he doubted it and then they both laughed
358217 travels quickly edie britt was the most predatory divorcee in a 5 block radius
358218 susan had met the enemy and she was a slut
358219 thats great id invite you both in but i was sort of in the middle of something
358220 and just like that the race for mike delfino had begun
358221 for a moment susan wondered if her rivalry with edie would remain friendly
358222 but she was reminded that when it came to men
358223 do you think you could stop by later tonight and take a look at my pipes
358224 every time im around that man he tries to grab my ass
358225 i made over 0 000 with him last week if he wants to grab your ass you let him
358226 and i really hate that i spent 000 on a diamond necklace that you couldnt live without but ive learned to deal with it so can i tell tanaka well be there tomorrow night
358227 im keeping my back pressed against the wall the entire time
358228 see now this is what a marriage is all about compromise
358229 i really like it when we hook up but i just gotta get my work done i cant afford to lose this job and
358230 so you wanna do it on the table this time
358231 first of all your father cant eat onions hes deathly allergic
358232 its okay andrew i spent three hours cooking this meal how do you think it makes me feel when you say its okay in that sullen tone
358233 tim harpers mom gets home from work pops open a can of pork and beans and boom theyre eating everyones happy
358234 im saying do you always have to serve cuisine cant we just have food
358235 change in behavior is one of the warning signs and you have been fresh as paint over the last six months that would explain why youre always locked in the bathroom
358236 rex seeing that youre the head of this household i would really appreciate you saying something
358237 three days after my funeral lynette replaced her grief with a much more useful emotion indignation
358238 well you must be having a lot of fun on your business trip i can only imagine well guess what the kids and i want to have some fun too so unless you call me back by noon we are getting on a plane and joining you
358239 we all say that if you hadnt quit youd be running the place by now so hows domestic life dont you just love being a mom
358240 and there it was the question that lynette always dreaded
358241 for those who asked it only one answer was acceptable so lynette responded as she always did she lied
358242 well he promised to give me everything ive ever wanted
358243 then why are we here why are we doing this
358244 because i dont want to wake up one morning with a sudden urge to blow my brains out
358245 how would you feel about me using your child support payments for plastic surgery
358246 if you would cut back to two meals per day i could get the chemical peel
358247 so is that your project for school you know when i was in fifth grade i made the white house out of sugar cubes
358248 stop stalling and go before mike figures out he can do better
358249 tell me again why i fought for custody for you
358250 well i just uh was wondering if there was any chance that you uh i was just wanting to ask if
358251 i was making ambrosia and i made too much so i thought id bring some over to mike whats going on
358252 now you want to come over now you have company
358253 well heres your problem looks like somebody stuffed a bunch of popsicle sticks down here
358254 ive told julie a million times not to play in the kitchen
358255 i know you think that im angry about coming here but im not you and the kids wanted a change of pace and some fun i get it
358256 i want a divorce i just cant live in this this detergent commercial anymore
358257 bree longed to share the truth of her husbands painful betrayal but sadly for bree admitting defeat was not an option
358258 i got you the honey mustard dressing the ranch looked just a little bit suspect
358259 if you think that im gonna discuss the dissolution of my marriage in a place where the restrooms are labeled chicks and dudes youre out of your mind
358260 yes well i feel badly about that i told you mrs huber came over and i got distracted it was a mistake
358261 it means that im sick of you being so damn perfect all the time youre this plastic suburban housewife
358262 are you deaf i just said hes not doing his job
358263 its dark you just cant see that the lawn has been mowed
358264 i had the worst macaroni and cheese at the wake its been running through me ever since and i need to be at my best edie britts son is spending the night tonight
358265 apparently edie is having a gentleman friend over for dinner and i think she plans on entertaining into the wee hours if you know what i mean
358266 i cant believe it this cant be happening mike cant like edie better than me he just cant
358267 you dont know whats going on maybe theyre just having dinner
358268 bree sobbed quietly in the restroom for five minutes but her husband never knew because when bree finally emerged she was perfect
358269 s even days after my funeral life at wisteria lane finally returned to normal which for some of my friends was unfortunate
358270 the sound that awakened my son was something hed heard only once before many years ago when he was quite young but he recognized it instantly
358271 its her own fault ive got no sympathy for her apparently she left some candles unattended in the den the paramedics said she was lucky she could have been killed
358272 absolutely shell get through this shell find a way to survive
358273 and suddenly there he was like a phoenix rising from the ashes
358274 i just got back from the movies so edie had a fire huh
358275 hey its me no i have nothing yet but dont worry im definitely getting closer
358276 all right ladies lift em up to mary alice good friend and neighbor wherever you are we hope youve found peace
358277 i know what you did it makes me sick im going to tell
358278 oh my god she got it the day she died
358279 i am so sorry girls i never wanted you to be burdened with this
358280 how ironic to have something i tried so desperately to keep secret treated so casually
358281 the next day my friends came together to pack away my clothes my personal belongings and what was left of my life
358282 and just like that susan was happy life was suddenly full of possibilities
358283 it didnt take susan long to realize this was not her night
358284 an odd thing happens when we die our senses vanish taste touch smell and sound become a distant memory but our sight ah our sight expands and we can suddenly see the world we left behind so clearly of course most of whats visible to the dead can also be seen by the living if they only take the time to look
358285 like my friend gabrielle i should have seen how unhappy she was but i didnt
358286 i only saw her clothes from paris and her platinum jewelry and her brand new diamond watch had i looked closer i would have seen that gabrielle was a drowning woman desperately in search of a life vest luckily for her
358287 she found one of course gabrielle only saw her young gardener as a way to infuse her life with a little excitement but now she was about to discover just how exciting her life could be
358288 gabrielle was panicked she knew if her husband discovered her secret she would feel the full force of his wrath
358289 but she was quickly reminded that what carlos couldnt see couldnt hurt her
358290 the peaceful facade of wisteria lane had recently been shattered first by my suicide and then by the discovery of a note among my belongings that suspected a suspicious reason for my desperate act my friends gathered to discuss its implications
358291 it doesnt matter she was his wife he deserves to have all the facts
358292 well we could do it gently we could tell him about it over coffee and pastry
358293 well if it was a joke it was in very poor taste
358294 no this was serious i know it was we gotta find out what was going on
358295 lets say we do theres a chance were not gonna like what we find
358296 its the age old question isnt it how much do we really want to know about our neighbors
358297 my friends were right to be concerned they knew that every family h as its secrets and as my son and husband could have told them you need to think carefully before digging them up
358298 after talking for hours my friends still hadnt agreed on what to do with the note so they decided to talk about it in the morning after a g good nights rest
358299 they each kept thinking of my suicide and how terribly alone i must have felt you see loneliness was something my friends understood all too well
358300 we sat on skyline drive and drank a bottle of apple wine and when we finished it you turned to me and you said if you marry me bree mason i promise to love you for the rest of my life and even though i was engaged to ty grant and even though my father didnt like you i said yes
358301 you are going to cancel the meeting with that divorce lawyer and we are going to find ourselves a marriage counselor
358302 good im gonna go uh make myself some warm milk
358303 susan awoke that night alone and parched and as she gazed out her window she saw the tall drink of water she needed to quench her thirst
358304 if you want to date him youre gonna have to ask him out
358305 i cant find the measuring cup have you seen it
358306 you know carlos i didnt marry you so i could have dinner by myself 6 times a week you know how bored i was today i came this close to actually cleaning the house
358307 nope no no no no youre not gonna buy your way out of this one
358308 im not in the mood but we could stay up and talk
358309 when a man buys a woman expensive jewelry there are many things he may want in return for future reference conversation aint one of them
358310 i dunno be the way you used to be surprise me take my breath away
358311 i didnt realize anybody was going to be out here i just sort of rolled out of bed
358312 i didnt mean to disturb you ill see you later
358313 well and julie uh its a thing we do when somebody new moves into the neighborhood we invite them over for a home cooked meal its sort of a tradition
358314 oh you invite them over for home cooking and you give em takeout
358315 yeah its its uh its sort of a new tradition im working out the kinks
358316 ill tell you what how bout i cook and you guys come over to my place
358317 but only im going because youre going to come down with something semi serious that requires bed rest and fluids
358318 julie was glad susan was rekindling her love life of course she was unaware of her mothers recent track record with fire
358319 its all gone everything my ex husband worked for all those years gone
358320 what i dont want to wear other peoples old crap
358321 edie you can be homeless or you can be ungracious you really cant afford to be both
358322 that reminds me my insurance check still hasnt come yet can i stay with you for a few more weeks
358323 of course what kind of christian would i be if i denied shelter to a friend in need
358324 oh look heres something we can salvage your measuring cup we can just scrape off the burnt part and itll look good as new
358325 now would you put that down and start looking for jewelry
358326 d r albert goldfine was the most accomplished marriage counselor in the city he had dealt with problems ranging from substance abuse to infidelity to domestic violence yes dr goldfine thought he had seen it all and then he met the van de kamps
358327 the answer is yes youre about to make a fortune off us
358328 kids are jumping up and down they should be sitting wearing their seat belts
358329 i yelled at them they never listen to me its very frustrating
358330 well you have to find a way to control them after all thats your job
358331 though hed been a policeman for six years office hayes had never found himself in a truly dangerous situation then again he had never before told a woman how to raise her children
358332 maam you need to get back in your car please
358333 i have no help my husband is always away on business
358334 im gonna have to ask you to step back now
358335 my baby sitter joined the witness relocation program i havent slept through the night in six years and for you to stand there and judge me
358336 okay im not gonna give you a ticket im gonna let you off with a warning
358337 you just missed my mom on fridays she coaches my little sisters soccer team
358338 uh john we need to talk about what happened the other day
358339 no no he doesnt have a clue god love him its just i was thinking that when you come over to garden you might actually have to garden
358340 great youre breaking up with me in my own bedroom
358341 no no im not dumping you lately youve been the only thing keeping me going its just we cant do it at my house anymore
358342 oh so then where do you want to do it

358344 and so theres just the four of us my oldest son andrew is 16 danielle is 15 and
358345 i dont need to see pictures bree youve spent most of the hour engaging in small talk
358346 yes rex has been very vocal about his issues dont you want to discuss your feelings about your marriage
358347 this is the thing you gotta know about bree she doesnt like to talk about her feelings to be honest its hard to know if she has any
358348 does she feel anger rage ecstasy who knows shes always pleasant and i cant tell you how annoying that is
358349 would you like to respond to what rex just said
358350 is there some truth there do you use housework as a way to disengage emotionally
358351 ah this is great i got tons of homework tonight its so easy to concentrate after sex
358352 well im glad i could help education is very important
358353 i was gonna give it to you next time i mowed your lawn but since youre here
358354 its not just any rose look at the petals there arent any flaws its perfect
358355 i spent days looking for just the right one finally found it
358356 for john this was no longer just a meaningless little affair gabrielle could now clearly see he was falling in love with her
358357 uh well i talked to julie and she suggested rib eye steaks
358358 hey im sorry about your house how you holding up
358359 all right i guess oh is somebody having a party
358360 no susan is just throwing me one of her traditional welcome to the neighborhood dinners only im cooking and having it at my house
358361 well it wont be anything fancy just a little home cooking
358362 susan suddenly had an awful feeling in the pit of stomach
358363 as if she was watching an accident in slow motion she knew it would happen but was powerless to stop it
358364 oh thats so sweet no i dont want to intrude threes a crowd
358365 no its not like that i mean susans bringing julie
358366 this will make up for the dinner you never threw for me
358367 should i have told her we were having steak shes not like a vegetarian or something is she
358368 heres what i pulled for edie i should warn you that most of the clothes in there arent that stylish
358369 edies a beggar now which means she cant be a chooser of course we dont have to add salt to the wound
358370 by the way was that you i saw getting pulled over by a policeman
358371 yeah the boys were acting up in the car i couldnt get them to sit down
358372 i try everything i scream i threaten i reason i beg nothing works i dont know if its because theyre too young and they dont understand or theyre just getting some perverse joy out of testing me
358373 my mother used to have the worst time with me in the car so one time when i was acting up she stopped and left me on the side of the road and she drove off
358374 oh she came back immediately but i never misbehaved in the car again you should try that
358375 mrs huber i could never leave my kids by the side of the road
358376 when it comes to discipline sometimes you must be creative my mother knew that smart lady of course shes in a home now and her mind has just turned to mush
358377 well like i said i should go back and get dinner ready
358378 susan have you been able to find old clothes for edie she has nothing to wear
358379 i thought that was the look she was going for
358380 oh susan edie may be trash but shes still a human being
358381 i just wanted to come by and say hello you know see how you guys are doing
358382 i dont care what her reasons were maybe she was depressed maybe she was bored it doesnt matter she abandoned her husband and her son and ill never forgive her
358383 as i watched susan i couldnt help feeling sorry for her she wanted so much to know why i did it
358384 its not enough to want the truth you must know where to look for it and the truth is elusive because it knows where to hide
358385 hello julie i talked to your mom about donating some clothes for edie
358386 shes at mrs van de kamps but ill see if she left some stuff upstairs
358387 oh julie i was just admiring your new measuring cup
358388 bree rex just called he wont be able to meet you here today apparently there was an emergency at the hospital
358389 he suggested perhaps youd like to meet with me by yourself youve been very quiet in our joint sessions
358390 what oh oh oh no thank you i have some things that i need to do today
358391 dr goldfine there is something you can do for me
358392 so now youre taking julie on your dinner date with mike
358393 yeah well if edies gonna be there im gonna need emotional support
358394 i cant believe she wormed her way into in how did you let her do that
358395 i dont know i was gonna take her out at the knees but it all happened so fast
358396 well you know what you need to do you need to get there early spend a little bit of time with mike before the little barracuda gets there
358397 thats a good idea edie will get there at 5 45 which means her breasts will arrive at 5 30 so i should shoot for five
358398 im gonna keep my one little bag and go home
358399 that is a beautiful rose where did you get it
358400 yes i am having some new bushes planted outside and he gave me that as a color palette
358401 oh who cares what he thinks i took psychology in college we learned all about freud a miserable human being
358402 well think about it he grew up in the late 1800s there were no appliances back then his mother had to do everything by hand just backbreaking work from sunup to sundown not to mention the countless other sacrifices she probably had to make to take care of her family and what does he do he grows up and becomes famous peddling a theory that the problems of most adults can be traced back to something awful their mother has done she must have felt so betrayed he saw how hard she worked he saw what she did for him did he even ever think to say thank you i doubt it
358403 just so you know many of freuds theories have been discredited
358404 for the first time lynette could see that this was not the innocent play of children she was being challenged so she decided it was time to get creative
358405 out cant behave you heard me you cannot ride you out move it
358406 porter preston parker if youre hiding youve gotta stop now because mommy doesnt think its funny
358407 oh excuse me im sorry im looking for my boys three boys with red hair have you seen them
358408 yeah i also saw you drive away and leave them
358409 i know i was just trying to scare them into behaving did you see where they went
358410 listen it seems to me like you have some anger management issues
358411 i have four kids under the age of six i absolutely have anger management issues
358412 yeah well i think you need to talk to somebody because abandoning your children is
358413 no i dont think they should go anywhere until you calm down
358414 listen lady you and i are gonna have a little talk
358415 i saw it when i drove by the dealership i thought gabrielle would look so beautiful in this
358416 it cost me an arm and a leg its got gps navigation 200 watt stereo system rear parking sensor
358417 gabrielle could see what this gesture had cost carlos so she responded the only way she knew how
358418 she had a feeling the truth would have been lost on her husband anyway after all its the rare man who understands the value of a single perfect rose
358419 i hope you dont mind i thought id come by early and help you set up
358420 hey susan dont worry mike and i have everything under control
358421 in the distance susan thought she heard a bell ring
358422 look all im saying is that this whole it takes two to mess up a marriage theory is bull the problems that we have are because of her
358423 all right fine what have i been doing for the past 20 years that has been so awful
358424 youre not saying anything because ive been a great husband and it kills you to admit that
358425 rex im curious do you ever acknowledge the benefits of living with bree
358426 by your own admission your home is always clean your clothes are always freshly pressed sounds like a wonderful cook despite her flaws do you ever remember to say thank you
358427 so whos the guy that lives across from mrs huber again
358428 thats mr mullin and just so you know if he invites you in you have to meet all of his pets
358429 in my heart i still believe that you and carl are going to get back together
358430 oh yeah ive never seen two people more in love im mean shes never going to find that kind of chemistry with another man never
358431 it was everything susan could do to keep a smile on her face round two was under way and she was already taking a beating
358432 oh he was my second husband ive only been married twice
358433 twice you werent married to the guy with all the tattoos that they took away in handcuffs
358434 no julie she wasnt married to javier that was just one of her special friends
358435 i think we should change the subject you know unless you want to keep talking about it
358436 susan was furious with edie for using a dog to ingratiate herself with its owner she was also furious with mike for not seeing through this blatant maneuver
358437 but most of all she was furious with herself for not having thought of it first
358438 oh look at that looks like bongos finally warming up to susan
358439 we just got off on the wrong foot were best buddies now
358440 im just waiting to see if they have to operate
358441 oh god she pulls a large dog bone out of her purse uh i i stopped and i got this i am just so sorry for this
358442 im really sorry that i snapped at you i was just so worried
358443 and we gave bongo something to help pass the earring when he does would you like us to retrieve it for you
358444 okay you should be able to take him home in about an hour
358445 actually it was my wifes dog one of the last things she said to me in the hospital before she died was to be sure i looked after him i promised her i would
358446 and just like that susan could suddenly see something shed never seen before
358447 mike delfino was still in love with his late wife
358448 and if something had happened i would have felt like i had failed her
358449 and she knew right then that neither she nor edie would be laying claim to his heart anytime soon
358450 so she decided for now she could settle for just being his friend
358451 this is for you well for bongo give it to him
358452 yes as i look back at the world i left behind its all so clear to me the beauty that waits to be unveiled the mysteries that long to be uncovered but people so rarely stop to take a look they just keep moving its a shame really theres so much to see
358453 so a question about the botanic garden to pet or not to pet the cats

358480 the vulnerability is of more concern than a slow server
358481 the commission will remain vigilant in protecting consumers access to content on the internet
358482 a clearly stated commitment of nondiscrimination would make clear that the commission is not having a one night stand with net neutrality but an affair of the heart and a commitment for life
358483 im concerned about anything that would appear to reverse the decade old bipartisan commitment we have against government regulation of the internet
358484 dns patching has probably slowed down because the procedure effectively requires customer facing dns servers to be segregated from the domain hosting servers
358485 most isps dont segregate the servers because it is cheaper and easier to keep them in one box there has not been a compelling reason to segregate them until now which is probably why it is taking some isps a long time to secure themselves

358495 we are not going to join the government by putting the madhes agenda on hold instead we can play an active role in writing the new constitution by remaining in the opposition
358496 in our lead well try to form a national government of consensus
358497 if no consensus is gathered well opt for a majority government if it doesnt happen either well work to form a minority government
358498 its very difficult to forge consensus among the 25 parties of the constituent assembly at most efforts could be made to build consensus among the four parties the maoists nepali congress uml and madhesi janadhikar forum
358499 their stance is an indirect way to stop us from forming the government
358500 our effort would be to form a government of consensus but if that does not happen we have another option to form a majority government
358501 if they withdraw their precondition to be allowed to stay in power for two years and gather national consensus we could join the government

358503 the internet works through copying things thats just how digital technology works

358505 its something that now affects everyone when you change copyright law now it affects everybody who owns a pc

358538 we usually shoot for the same vibe and pick players and vocalists that will work with the song
358539 we dont over think it we just have them play the song as they hear it or sing the tune with their own voice in terms of the arrangements we often make changes to the guitar and bass parts in order to make gameplay more interesting in
358540 theres at least a half dozen other bands waiting in the wings to see what happens with this case
358541 what they did was file for a preliminary injunction over the thanksgiving holiday trying to disrupt sales of guitar hero on a theory that just doesnt hold water
358542 in some cases its karaoke except with the original band members

358555 the isi is under the policy directive of the man who calls the shots
358556 it may not be the prime minister it may not be the president but the army chief is always kept in the loop
358557 if your perception as the pakistan army is that raw the indian intelligence agency and the cia are acting in unison then you try to protect yourself
358558 you do not give them the taliban sufficient room to completely take over afghanistan but you do enough to stop growing indian influence
358559 its a very disciplined organization but with a very large freedom of action
358560 when they get a policy directive they have certain room for manoeuvre keeping the interests of the state in view
358561 the pakistan army is like a woman with multiple lovers she has to satisfy them all
358562 the clients have their own agenda and room for manoeuvre its a very very murky relationship and the attacks in pakistan show that many operators have gone rogue

358597 today is the 2008 version of the boston tea party
358598 if we had come in with the same team as last year i could have slept through the season and waited until the finals
358599 losing jacqui and catie has woken me up and has added a shot of adrenaline to this team it is no longer a given we win it all again this season we will have to fight for it and if we repeat last seasons success it will be a great accomplishment
358600 marie and jacqui were a great one two punch for me and catie was like having a third number one player so losing two of them is definitely not easy
358601 but it is a dream for me as a coach to have two young players to come in and fill in for the loses of two great players
358602 losing seven players after this season is a lot of roster space and talent to make up for
358603 so having these younger players come in this season is huge for the future of the ghs tennis i cant even express how strong this program is getting and the caliber of tennis i have seen out of these girls is nothing short of incredible
358604 i think that we have a greater challenge ahead of us with this new lineup but we still have great players
358605 its exciting to attempt to overcome this challenge and repeat both of our titles we will really miss both jacqui and catie but it is a change that brings a new energy and a certain excitement with it
358606 our attitude and our focus has not changed one bit
358607 we are looking to repeat exactly what we did last year and i have confidence that they can do it it just wont come as easy now
358608 jessicas power and consistency is what makes her such a good player
358609 she is able to handle different paces and that is where jacqui was so good i think shell be really terrific at two
358610 it feels like we have come together as a team before weve even stepped on the court in terms of chemistry

358615 the significant point is that the safeguards agreement has been adopted by consensus
358616 will demonstrate their political and moral authority to apply it in future equitably and on a non discriminatory basis
358617 a step has been taken towards accommodating the interests of a non npt nuclear weapon state by evolving an innovative and new model a significant departure has been made from the standard norms pertaining to verification and global non proliferation which inter alia take into account the imperatives of promoting civilian nuclear cooperation
358618 an infcirc 66 type safeguards agreement based on the agencys standard safeguards practices and procedures
358619 perpetuity is a misnomer there is no such thing in international law
358620 more efficient mechanism for ensuring that safeguards requirements can be met
358621 it satisfies indias needs while maintaining all the agencys legal requirements
358622 such an umbrella approach could also be used for the conclusion of other 66 type safeguards agreements
358623 the termination provisions contained in the agreement are the same for other 66 type agreements
358624 naturally as with all safeguards agreements this agreement is subject to the general rules of international law therefore the agreement should be read as an integral whole the preamble provides for contextual background and safeguards are implemented in accordance with the terms of the agreement
358625 little different than those of other agreements based on infcirc 66
358626 safeguards would be applied to nuclear facilities in india using the same methods applied elsewhere in the world
358627 without this agreement the safeguards activities and the assurance of peaceful use provided by them will not be possible
358628 in promoting international cooperation and the peaceful use of nuclear energy
358629 looked forward to cooperating with the agency to facilitate the implementation of the safeguards agreement in accordance with the provisions of this agreement which as the director general has pointed out should be read as an integral whole
358630 also using the guidance documents adopted by the board for the purposes of concluding and implementing infcirc 66 type agreements
358631 we see no difficulty in implementing this agreement on the basis of what is stated therein
358632 will implement this agreement in strict accordance with its provisions

358655 he promised that his first album would be of shabads because he took his role as an icon for the sikh youth seriously ishmeet to me was really special because his success had not gone to his head and at heart he remained the sweet simple boy from ludhiana with the love of sikhi swelling in his heart
358656 he saw himself as blazing a trail for his young sikh brothers and sisters who he hoped would follow their dreams achieving great successes while proudly displaying the khalsa form and spirit he felt that he had been given a great responsibility to inspire and to coax the best out of the sikh youth

358745 other than telling us how to live think marry pray vote invest educate our children and now die i think the republicans have done a fine job of getting government out of our personal lives
358746 two years ago it seemed impossible that a gallon of gasoline would go as high as godd mn a balls
358747 if you let one person into your circle they can mess everything up they would tell me i had a good game im a good player and they want to start helping me out basketball wise
358748 some observers compare a coach who purports to guard a players best interest with the fox guarding the henhouse
358749 controversial figure in local basketball circles is quick to acknowledge that hes not affiliated with any rules
358750 that his comments might be construed as an admission he had engaged in wrongdoing
358751 hey look at me i follow the rules i dont jeopardize an athletes eligibility
358752 overwhelmingly 95 of the time theres a third party involved if agents could get players in a fair representative way without paying money they would because everyone is a bottom line businessman but they cant
358753 most of the time the runner tells a kid im just taking care of business so that we can do what we need to do
358754 the unions investigation into whether bill duffy associates sports management engaged in wrongdoing during its recruitment of mayo should serve as the litmus test for whether the league is willing to get tough
358755 i found every guy around him is a former coach or player and he runs a league of youth football and provides opportunities for young people
358756 i defend his music and am much more a fan of the person
358757 that shit was my natural calling and once i got involved with it it became fun it was like shootin layups for me i was makin em every time
358758 jennings is not ready for the culture shock of playing overseas for the challenge of playing grown men as opposed to over matched high schoolers for the huge drop in the nba draft stock yet that might not be enough to deter him from skipping school and in the long run he might end up a lower rated nba prospect but a better player and more well rounded grounded person
358759 why risk being the next o j mayo the usc one and done er done in by sloppy espn reporting a former opportunistic friend ex drug dealer and antiquated ncaa rules
358760 college would be a bunch of nobodies tv interest would drop and the overall product would suffer
358761 jennings is only doing it because hes desperate he wants to be a one and done player so he doesnt sit out a year some place he wants to go play im not even sure hell be that wanted in europe hes a thin little guard and european basketball is pretty good these days its not like hes going to go over there and be a star
358762 before the rule took effect and we had some young men jump from high school to the pros we had a successful game and march madness pulled in millions of dollars after the rule weve had some success and march madness has pulled in millions of dollars either way for us is fine its up to the young man
358763 any idea if this david bauman fellow was living in singapore or something from 1995 2005 a period during which college basketball missed out on kevin garnett kobe bryant and lebron james and still landed a 6 billion tv contract for its postseason tournament alone
358764 so in the old view you have hundreds of kids blowing off high school thinking theyre going to be one of the 10 kids who is going directly from high school to college now believe it or not not everyone is lebron james and not everyone is going to be able to play at that level so you have hundreds of kids who get disappointed and they blew off high school and theyre not going to graduate from high school theyre not prepared for college and once they dont get into the nba what are they going to do flip hamburgers at best
358765 sure i still work part time part of that is for security and part of it is for love and belonging and esteem needs and frankly i need to keep time structured or i get into psychological difficulties
358766 pm the mair the full mair and nothing but the mair except when hes off
358767 the reason i brought it up was to prove that it still could be linked to the recent abductions but then again your case proves to be different
358768 so youre telling me that the kiano family could of abducted my daughter
358769 no problem at all i really expect you to find my daughter though
358770 is there anything else that i should know about youre daughter before i go looking for her
358771 its very difficult for them this premiere is a thing where you show up and meet fans and its all very playful and nice
358772 but when youre just trying to do your daily chores and live your life and people are all over you trying to climb out of cars and windows its not so healthy
358773 there are some things going on that i cant talk about
358774 i dont think im free to say whether i have gotten a letter or not
358775 a person as to whom the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial evidence linking him or her to the commission of a crime and who in the judgment of the prosecutor is a putative defendant
358776 are you the one they talk about so much going to college
358777 its very very helpful to have a student in the class who along with me remembers lyndon johnson and his presidency who remembers nixon who remembers jimmy carter
358778 younger students have read about and heard about it but they havent lived through those administrations and all the things that occurred then joann offers a very welcome perspective shes lived long enough to see a great deal
358779 i dont have that many more years to live and i want to do good for humanity while im here
358780 if its some jerk i went out on a couple of dates with i can do without that drama
358781 were in this mode where were telling everybody everything all the time
358782 it becomes about saying things just blathering on were at the apex of that trend
358783 you pretend to be communicating when youre actually stifling communication
358784 a phone conversation is like wildfire you dont know where its going to go
358785 were slaves to our devices blackberries and phones reachable 24 7
358786 you start shaking your family tree and its always really interesting
358787 i cant wait to meet some of these relatives and find out more about all the people involved
358788 obviously everybody is going to be waiting to see what are the repercussions for this event
358789 im just praying that we rally together as a team because obviously theres going to be some adversity here
358790 violent or threatening behavior among employees whether inside or outside the workplace
358791 conduct that imposes inherent danger to the safety and well being of another person
358792 i would assume it got started from a week in spartanburg in heat and going against each other every day
358793 steve was probably a little remorseful for what happened and was trying to apologize
358794 knowing were going onto their home turf will give us a little more pressure
358795 it sprouts over here but i get that up you cant let that sprout you have to do yard work
358796 all i needed to do was take my sprayer and go out there
358797 maybe we should take a look at this on a case by case basis
358798 you can go all over this neighborhood and find poison ivy all over but nobody cares
358799 were expected to do more and more every year but were not being compensated for it
358800 it would be nice if we got recognized for this with full bonuses
358801 im sorry its not 100 percent but im glad that we were able to give them 90 percent
358802 its a difficult pill to swallow when theyve already done the work to receive the bonus money
358803 right now i just want to have fun and stay relaxed
358804 if you get too serious youre liable to mess up i know ive been training all year so theres nothing to be worried about
358805 if im an olympic gold medalist i can be the superstar i want to be
358806 or if im sitting around thinking my opponent is doing more than me let me do a couple abs
358807 we came here last year on a saturday or a sunday and it was crazy
358808 i dont have to pay the tax on a new imac and i qualify as a student for a free ipod
358809 a tax free weekend was a good gesture by the legislature and im glad they did it
358810 we have to get it anyway so we might as well buy it now
358811 the matching rule does not apply to the specified attribute type
358812 im an american honey our names dont mean s amp
358813 he just looked worried depressed anxious way turned into himself
358814 it would be overstating it to say he looked like a guy who was being led to his execution but its not far off
358815 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
358816 we thought he worked out really well he was a critical part of our vaccine studies
358817 the commission will remain vigilant in protecting consumers access to content on the internet
358818 a clearly stated commitment of nondiscrimination would make clear that the commission is not having a one night stand with net neutrality but an affair of the heart and a commitment for life
358819 im concerned about anything that would appear to reverse the decade old bipartisan commitment we have against government regulation of the internet
358820 were having a little bit of a run of good luck
358821 alloy has a great finger on the pulse of the youth market
358822 with tv shows its hard to break through the clutter
358823 if it is pre known by a large group of people it helps people publicize it
358824 the series explores what it is like to have wish fulfillment and glamour of a great life
358825 but what makes these characters rich and delicious is that they have every bit as many problems as all of us
358826 the book series itself is about commodities brands become a way to identify with the characters
358827 they are healthier and break down in the body more easily
358828 our message is that people should cut down on both
358829 we have been very concerned about the misunderstanding of our product in the marketplace and want to provide the facts so that consumers can make their choices based on science rather than urban myth hfcs and sugar are treated by the body the same they contain the same calories and nutritionally are no different
358830 it has a crisper flavor not as cloying i think it is a better flavored drink
358831 theres just a lot more awareness about high fructose corn syrup among the public and once people taste a soda flavored with cane sugar they like it better
358832 some perhaps most and possibly all the names were being sold to people in the mortgage industry to make new pitches
358833 its the potential for new account fraud that arises when social security accounts are compromised
358834 this guy obviously didnt do his homework he doesnt know the value of these on the black market
358835 i observed large quantities of names associated with several columns of numeric data
358836 these columns contained telephone numbers addresses and social security account numbers each spreadsheet contained several thousand lines of data
358837 pending further discussions regarding rebollos potential cooperation in the investigation
358838 investors seem to have realized that the business yahoo is in is a very complicated and challenging one and the current macroeconomic environment is even more challenging
358839 so turning over the reins to an unknown quantity doesnt appear to be the prudent thing to do at the moment
358840 at no point did the board and management ever resist microsofts proposal
358841 yahoo is attempting to rewrite history yet again with statements that are not supported by the facts
358842 you are overpaid you have overstayed your welcome you overplayed your hand with microsoft
358843 there really is only one customer because thats how each customer wants to be treated we value beyond each customer as though they are our only one we address their needs as if they are our own
358844 another article on how to get more life from your laptop battery big deal i already know how to do that
358845 the aim of radio advertising is to sell the sizzle not the bacon
358846 there really is only one customer because thats how each customer wants to be treated we value beyond each customer as though they are our only one we address their needs as if they are our own

358848 coaching is about the value you bring rather than the fees you charge
358849 you saved my life i cant ever thank you enough how much do i owe you
358850 tell you what just give me a tenth of what youd have been prepared to pay me two minutes ago
358851 in todays society people tend to value most those things for which they pay the most
358852 its your expertise and experience which governs how much you can charge
358853 the engineer was only here for 10 minutes and all he did was kick the machine how dare he charge us 1 000 tell him that id like him to itemise the bill
358854 kicking the machine 50 knowing where to kick the machine 950
358855 more people are scared of speaking in public than are afraid of dying
358856 the fault of dawkins as an academic was his scandalous and apparently deliberate refusal to present the doctrine which he appears to think he has refuted in its strongest form
358857 an academic attacking some ideological position which he believes to be mistaken must of course attack that position in its strongest form this dawkins does not do in the case of einstein and his failure is the crucial index of his insincerity of academic purpose and therefore warrants me in charging him with having become what he has probably believed to be an impossibility a secularist bigot
358858 the whole enterprise of the god delusion was not as it at least pretended to be an attempt to discover and spread knowledge of the existence or non existence of god but rather an attempt an extremely successful one to spread the authors own convictions in this area
358859 antony flew having lost the ability to write a book was persuaded by a christian ghost writer roy varghese to let him write it instead it is one thing for a footballer or a supermodel to use a ghost writer but there is something absurd about a philosopher using a ghost writer
358860 flew has now apparently lost the ability to read a book too for his review of the god delusion turns out to be a review of its index and nothing but its index he only needed to read chapter 1 in order to see the absurdity of his claims about my treatment of einstein
358861 the kindly god who lovingly fashioned each and every one of us and sprinkled the sky with shining stars for our delight that god is like santa claus a myth of childhood not anything that a sane undeluded adult could literally believe in that god must either be turned into a symbol for something less concrete or abandoned altogether
358862 the fight both for and against slavery in the united states was waged first along scriptural lines
358863 i regard monotheism as the greatest disaster ever to befall the human race i see no good in judaism christianity or islam good people yes but any religion based on a single well frenzied and virulent god is not as useful to the human race as say confucianism which is not a religion but an ethical and educational system
358864 with so many mindbytes to be downloaded so many mental codons to be replicated it is no wonder that child brains are gullible open to almost any suggestion vulnerable to subversion easy prey to moonies scientologists and nuns
358865 none of the local residents attending the meeting voiced approval of these plans
358866 people were legitimately anxious they really didnt know what the scope of the problem was
358867 they responded the way they usually do responsibly bravely and somewhat nervously
358868 a year later the problem looked officially small they couldnt remember how worried they were a year earlier they had learned so much they couldnt remember how it looked different
358869 they must have changed the profile editor because there is no clear all button and i cant undo the changes i made on my profile now really makes me mad i cant add a new background or layout because theres no way to undo the stupid profile editor changes
358870 what we need is a critique of visual culture that is alert to the power of images for good and evil and that is capable of discriminating the variety and historical specificity of their uses
358871 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
358872 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
358873 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters know is who uses that language for what purpose
358874 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
358875 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
358876 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
358877 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
358878 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
358879 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
358880 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
358881 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
358882 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
358883 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
358884 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
358885 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
358886 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
358887 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
358888 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
358889 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
358890 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
358891 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
358892 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
358893 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
358894 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
358895 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
358896 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
358897 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
358898 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
358899 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
358900 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
358901 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
358902 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
358903 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
358904 loudoun county is an anomaly in the sense it has not followed the pattern of pw or herndon
358905 no matter how hot it gets i enjoy spending time in texas
358906 i think its important for me to be thoughtful and sensitive to those who have got something to say
358907 but its also important for me to go on with my life to keep a balanced life
358908 the people want the president to be in a position to make good crisp decisions and to stay healthy and part of my being is to be outside exercising so im mindful of what goes on around me on the other hand im also mindful that ive got a life to live and will do so
358909 the president brings the same sensibility to his ranch renewing mind body and spirit with sweaty stints of brush clearing mountain biking and fishing on top of speeches fundraisers intelligence briefings and policy huddles with aides and officials
358910 high gas prices and a lot of anxiety about the war
358911 weve made a huge impact on the community with the school and with other projects weve done
358912 rather than get into a lengthy and scientific analysis on the thermal resistance of various substances im going to focus strictly on hard testing data what i hope to answer in this article is simple are there measurable performance differences between premium grade thermal pastes and if so how much
358913 this is truly a great honour and one i didnt expect
358914 poetry is the deepest language weve got i encourage you all to get busy and start writing
358915 poetry doesnt usually get much attention but we poets have come to expect that
358916 its one of the most fabulous events of the year
358917 nobody in the world has an event like this where poets of the world are recognized and everybody celebrates them
358918 its nice to see poetry celebrated more than by politicians and from the press
358919 why are you so sad selected poems of david w mcfadden
358920 our big aim now is to try and get it internationally well known
358921 weve gone to 23 different languages from more than 30 different countries thats a big step from where we were a few years ago
358922 at first a lot of people said translations couldnt compete with the originals but translation is really the wrong word it should be re creation
358923 do you know that donuts are full of trans fats do you know how unhealthy transfats are
358924 do you want to make me fat you cant make me eat unhealthy food thats disgusting
358925 and remember in whatever you do its okay to dream for dreams do come true
358926 and i still do i cannot believe this hes a nice guy
358927 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
358928 he was a great person he was kind thoughtful and he did not deserve this i feel for his parents and sisters and his lil bro
358929 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
358930 he had a rambo hunting knife covered in blood and he just kept going at the guy
358931 he was very calmly killing the guy and the other guy was screaming bloody murder
358932 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
358933 so i guess the joker told you to shoot me once we had the money
358934 the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field one day a man found the treasure and then he hid it in the field again he was so happy that he went and sold everything he owned to buy that field
358935 faith means being sure of the things we hope for and knowing that something is real even if we do not see it
358936 i have faith in what god has in store for me
358937 i have faith that we will reconcile and my husband will move back in
358938 what did that crazy man just tell us to do well drown
358939 faith can be little as a mustard seed but if we give them what they need they will turn into something wed look up at faith is something just like that
358940 remember that i have commanded you to be strong and brave dont be afraid because the lord your god will be with you everywhere you go

358947 and love means living the way god commanded us to live as you have heard from the beginning his command is this live a life of love
358948 love is patient and kind love is not jealous it does not brag and it is not proud love is not rude is not selfish and does not get upset with others love does not count up wrongs that have been done love is not happy with evil but is happy with the truth love patiently accepts all things it always trusts always hopes and always endures love never ends

358961 this will be a way for china to show the world what it is capable of
358962 i think it is going to be the biggest show of its type ever seen
358963 the ceremony wont make people forget all the controversies but they might put them aside for just 3 hours
358964 some previous ceremonies have been truly extraordinary and i have no doubt that the chinese will match that at least if not take it on to another plane
358965 but frankly these things go on for too long and it is getting increasingly hard to wow people
358966 it doesnt matter the first ranking i want to be healthy
358967 if its going to happen it will happen but at the moment i dont deserve that spot i am not in the best shape
358968 i was feeling good and i was hitting the ball well but then all of a sudden i just got exhausted completely lost my concentration

358980 as he was locked on me i went to push him down and he moved up a bit and it wound up slapping him on the back i feel badly that it went down like that but i am going to stand by my guns that i didnt do anything wrong
358981 im very very disappointed with the way this whole operation has been run
358982 everybody says the same thing were a joke were the laughingstock of the state
358983 the theater project is a primary reason for the financial challenges
358984 we came here last year on a saturday or a sunday and it was crazy
358985 i dont have to pay the tax on a new imac and i qualify as a student for a free ipod
358986 a tax free weekend was a good gesture by the legislature and im glad they did it
358987 we have to get it anyway so we might as well buy it now
358988 we need to be doing more to educate and motivate our citizens
358989 a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet
358990 were expected to do more and more every year but were not being compensated for it
358991 it would be nice if we got recognized for this with full bonuses
358992 im sorry its not 100 percent but im glad that we were able to give them 90 percent
358993 its a difficult pill to swallow when theyve already done the work to receive the bonus money
358994 it sprouts over here but i get that up you cant let that sprout you have to do yard work
358995 all i needed to do was take my sprayer and go out there

359004 esta es una exposici n que tiene un origen muy importante para nosotros y que nos llena de mucho orgullo
359005 alfredo melgar es el director de una empresa espa ola es la primera persona no italiana con permiso de la fundaci n da vinci para investigar sobre sus c digos y descubre una faceta poco conocida de leonardo la m sica adem s de todo lo que dej leonardo depuso dibujos de instrumentos cuya base es la de los que tocamos hoy los de percusi n los de cuerda los de viento y melgar hace una muestra muy interesante con toda esta investigaci n la empieza a incinerar por europa y luego la trae a m xico la tuvo en el distrito federal en puebla y en morelia
359006 hablando con alfredo le dije que me costaba mucho montar una exposici n pensada para grandes a un museo donde sus principales visitantes son los ni os y las ni as y l se avienta la puntada de decir pues h ganla ustedes ah est mi investigaci n ad ptenla para ni os y ah va el dinero as de f cil l puso el dinero de la producci n nosotros el trabajo toda la labor que ves aqu los exhibits el dise o todo lo hizo el trompo m gico basados en el dise o original de su bosque de pergaminos y con colorido y con otras cosas m s l dicas para los ni os
359007 lo que melgar ten a era s lo para ver los artefactos para contemplarlos pero no para tocarlos entonces hicimos una exhibici n que fuera m s resistente m s ruda para tocar y nos dimos cuenta que para hablar de leonardo da vinci en la parte de instrumentos musicales hab a que contextualizarlo un poco m s porque es un personaje muy famoso pero al mismo tiempo lo conoces de o das no por sus elementos m s espec ficos como tuvo tantos intereses nos pareci importante completar la exposici n con otros elementos no entonces la parte central son los instrumentos la m sica el sonido y tenemos otros componentes relacionados con la percepci n visual tambi n auditiva con matem ticas con las c maras oscuras para dar una visi n m s amplia
359008 llegamos a esas ideas abunda nepote porque trabajamos con un grupo de adolescentes que nos ayudaron a investigar los contenidos pero tambi n a delimitar a hacer la curador a digamos qu vale la pena qu no para que la exposici n no s lo fuera para ni os sino tambi n desde los ni os lo cual fue un trabajo de aprendizaje muy muy grande
359009 leonardo fue tan apasionante con tantos intereses fuera de la genialidad fuera de lugar irrepetible y lo dem s creo que es la curiosidad inter s esp ritu inquisitivo experimentar es algo que todos los ni os hacen es algo que uno pudiera pensar que leonardo es una especie de ni o chiquito que sigue caminando no quisimos que cuando entres en la exposici n te pongas en sus zapatos adoptes su punto de vista y entonces te emociones y hagas m s cosas
359010 porque queremos que est en el tiempo de la fil que est dedicado a italia
359011 en la producci n yo creo que nos gastamos alrededor de unos 300 mil pesos bastante econ mico a m haberla tra do me hubiera costado un mill n de pesos
359012 y bueno finalmente es un riesgo pero creemos que es parte del aprendizaje

359062 people come there during the worst time in their lives
359063 we fasted with allahs messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam in ramadaan
359064 i heard ahmad being asked do you like for a man to pray with the people or by himself during ramadan
359065 when a man prays with the imaam until he concludes it is recorded that he prayed the rest of that night
359066 whoever stands in qiyaam in laylat ul qadr and it is facilitated for him out of faith and expectation of allahs reward will have all of his previous sins forgiven
359067 o messenger of allah if i knew which night is laylat ul qadr what should i say during it
359068 allahumma innaka afuwwun tuh ibbul afwa fa fu annee o allah you are forgiving and you love forgiveness so forgive me
359069 when the last ten started the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam would tighten his izaar i e he stayed away from his wives in order to have more time for worship spend the whole night awake in prayer and wake up his family
359070 did ibn taymiyyah invent the division of tawhid into three distinct parts 2 tawhid of allahs names and attributes then use it to declare muslims as out of islam
359071 all praise is to allah alone the lord of everything that exists the most gracious the merciful owner of the day of recompense it is you alone we worship and you alone we beseech for assistance
359072 all praise is to allah alone the lord of every thing that exists
359073 the most gracious the merciful master of the day of recompense
359074 you alone we worship and you alone we beseech for assistance
359075 most of the chapters and verses of quran contain these two types of tawhid rather the quran consists of this tawhid from its beginning to its end this is due to the fact that the quran contains information about allah his names and attributes and his actions and this tawhid is related to knowledge and information or the quran contains information related to the call to worship of allah alone with no partner dismissing what is worshiped other than him and this is the tawhid of intent and will or the quran contains information related to orders prohibitions and being firm upon his obedience and this is from the rights of tawhid upon the slave and its perfection related to its articulation or it consists of information regarding the people of tawhid and allahs interaction with them in this life and the next and this is from the rewards of tawhid or it consists of information regarding the people of shirk and his dealings with them in this life and the next thus the quran in its entirety deals with tawhid the rights of its people the adoration for them or the degradation for the people of shirk and their punishment in the next life and those who departed from tawhid due to deviation ignorance or corruption
359076 yes but mullah ali qari may allah have mercy upon him came well after ibn taymiyyah and ibn al qayyim is there any proof that there were earlier imams who recognized this division
359077 thus the foundations of faith in allah which are an obligation upon the creation to firmly believe in establishing faith in him are three 1 that the slave believes in the lordship of allah 2 that he believes in allahs oneness in worship 3 that he affirms that he is described by attributes which only he could be described with such as the all knowing the allah powerful the all wise and the other attributes which he described himself with and indeed we have found that allah addresses his slaves to firmly believe in each and every part from these three articles and have faith in them
359078 indeed allah is the one unique there is no partner with him and there is nothing like him and nothing can overpower him
359079 indeed allah is the one the unique there is no partner with him
359080 these obligatory tenets include believing in the heart and expressing with the tongue that allah is one god and that there is no god other than him nor is there any like him nor any equal to him
359081 but they do not attain any of his knowledge except what he wills
359082 whoever seeks forgiveness for believing men and believing woman allah will write for him a good deed for each believing man and believing woman
359083 the messenger of allah sal allahu alayhi wa sallam said whoever says subhanallah wa bi hamdih praise and glory be to allah 100 times morning and evening his sins will be erased even if they are like the foam on the sea
359084 whoever enters a market and says laa ilaha illallah wahdahu la shareeka lah lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu yuhyi wa yumeetu wa huwa hayyun laa yamoot bi yadihil khair wa huwa ala kulli shayin qadeer there is nothing worthy of worship except allah alone without partner to him belongs dominion and praise he causes life and death and he is the living and does not die in his hand is all the good and he is over all things competent allah will write for him her a million good deeds and erase a million bad deeds and raise him a million levels
359085 the deeds most loved by allah are those done regularly even if they are small
359086 we sent it this quran down on a blessed verily we are ever therein that night is decreed every matter of ordainments
359087 islam is built upon five that you worship allah and reject the worship of anything else to establish the prayer the giving of zakat performing pilgrimage to the house and fasting the month of ramadan
359088 when ramadan comes the gates of paardise are opened the gates of hellfire are locked and devils are chained
359089 all of the actions of the son of adam are for him except the fast for that is for me and i will reward it fasting is protecting sheild so when it is the day when one of you are fasting let him not behave or speak indecently if someone tries to abuse him or fight him let him say i am fasting by the one in whose hand is the soul of muhammad the smell emanating from the mouth of the one fasting is better with allah then the smell of musk the one fasting has tewo time of joy when he breaks his fast he is happy and when he meets his lord he will rejoice at his fasting
359090 every action that the son of adam does its reward will be multiplied a good deed will be increased tenfold
359091 in paradise there is a gate which is called ar rayyan through which the people who fasted will enter on the day of judgement and no one else shall enter along side them it will be asked where are those who fasted and they will walk through it and upon the entry of the last of them it will be locked and no one else will walk through it

359094 it is this maybe that holds us down and shakes us up and wakes us up and pulls us under it is this maybe that we stake our entire future on it is this maybe that will cause our children to grow up and either resent or respect us it is this maybe that makes me both proud and ashamed of who i am
359095 it is this maybe that holds us down and shakes us up and wakes us up and pulls us under it is this maybe that we stake our entire future on it is this maybe that will cause our children to grow up and either resent or respect us it is this maybe that makes me both proud and ashamed of who i am
359096 i think our kid knew wed want another picture so he she acted all stubborn so we could get a sonogram

359100 its odd to have played a lot and then you might not play anymore
359101 but thats their decision its a weird situation to be in you just have to deal with it somehow and figure out a way to come in ready to play every day
359102 its about time we give them their due respect especially burriss
359103 its been a weird year in the sense that they said they were going to go young early on and then some guys didnt pan out so veteran guys got a chance to play and we played pretty well
359104 we ended up hanging around the race for a while because our division wasnt as strong as it was perceived to be
359105 i think all in all all the veteran guys who werent supposed to play played probably better than people expected
359106 freddys a potential 25 home run guy a guy who can do a lot of damage with the bat
359107 everyone saw that he kovalainen had to let his team mate get past him at hockenheim i even cant think of a race this season where he had a better race strategy than lewis hamilton
359108 i would never want to play such a role i would rather finish fifth or sixth with a renault than fourth or fifth with mclaren
359109 i know im going to be no 1 getting no 1 is a present for a lot of work in the past so its satisfying
359110 we worked on various set up options for the car
359111 i also tried the new engine cover but it is hard to assess it in any detail
359112 the situation is not too bad the car handles better but our main rivals seem to be still a little bit quicker than us even if there is the usual question mark over any difference in the fuel loads

359115 a veces este tipo de partidos se ganan con deseos
359116 fue un mal juego la verdad a veces este tipo de partidos se ganan con deseos nos falt deseo decisi n palabra que para m es clave para hacer las cosas
359117 debimos correr los riesgos parece que quedar con un hombre m s nos puso en una circunstancia m s c moda
359118 pero eso fue en general cuando uno no toma riesgos es dif cil generar opciones
359119 par el partido en muchas ocasiones es un juego de hombres y cort el partido el rbitro porque se soplaban
359120 sin duda es una oportunidad nica en forma individual y grupal simplemente estoy concentrado para aprovecharla al m ximo sacar los tres puntos en casa me siento bastante bien despu s de hacer una buena pretemporada creo que siempre he estado listo cuando me ha tocado lo he hecho bien y este domingo deseo igualar mi nivel
359121 creo que ser un partido muy abierto y se decidir a favor de quien tenga mejores oportunidades como es siempre en el futbol pero m s en este partido que creo ser din mico y sin duda creo que estamos mejor preparados
359122 los potros cuentan con gente probada en primera divisi n pero dentro de la cancha eso ya no importa eso se tiene que notar partido con partido entrenamiento con entrenamiento y estoy convencido de que tenemos mejor actividad grupal para resolver el partido
359123 el partido se present en circunstancias muy dif ciles con una expulsi n un poco rigorista pero finalmente el equipo no se desacomod siguieron jugando muy bien ellos tuvieron oportunidades metieron m s delanteros pero el equipo demostr de lo que est hecho
359124 definitivamente muy contento sacar seis puntos en las dos jornadas era lo que ten amos planeado y bueno estamos tranquilos para los dos fechas de visita que tendremos
359125 le deseo muchas felicidades en su boda y esta derrota es su regalo
359126 no nos ganan desde el 2003 y bueno jorge vergara dec a que ten amos que estimular a nuestros jugadores con primas dobles y cu druples y la verdad no se necesita los muchachos quer an ganarle a chivas
359127 desgraciadamente con la expulsi n empezamos a perder el partido en ese momento
359128 once contra once los ve a mucho mejor pero desgraciadamente con la expulsi n empezamos a perder el partido en ese momento mi equipo emocionalmente ya no pudo no estaba jugando igual perdimos intensidad y creo que el rbitro tambi n perdi esa capacidad de neutral para tratar de que si ya hab a hecho una expulsi n pues manejarse de la misma manera le falt esa personalidad pues cort el partido como lo quer a tecos
359129 el rbitro lo cort no fueron los tecos creo que es un justo premio a un equipo tecos que fue inteligente para jugar con 10 y si el empate no me gustaba porque nos iba a disfrazar algunas cosas creo que la derrota es merecida
359130 el equipo empez a perder movilidad intensidad y empiezas a perder el control del partido el futbol est lleno de errores y aciertos ellos lo aprovecharon bien y el partido se lo lleva tecos merecidamente
359131 no le puedo quitar el atrevimiento a mi equipo ellos no saben reventar sabe jugar
359132 sent una molestia en una jugada anterior despu s correteo a sandoval alonso y es cuando sent el tir n espero que no sea nada grave espero que sea cualquier cosa
359133 vamos a que me saquen un estudio espero que sea cualquier cosa para que est bien lo m s r pido posible
359134 en mal momento viene por todo la verdad es que me siento muy triste estaba el llamado a la selecci n ven an saliendo las cosas bien pero no es momento de lamentarse
359135 la verdad es que s me duele bastante pero ni hablar esto es futbol y hay que estar mentalizado para cualquier cosa
359136 he demostrado que todav a soy y estoy mejor que antes
359137 muchos jugadores de chivas dec an que no me conoc an que no era el mismo hoy he demostrado que todav a soy y estoy mejor que antes
359138 muy contento porque siempre estoy contento y ganarle a chivas es muy importante un partido m s que no pierdo y ahora para poderme ganar a m hay que esperarse seis meses y estoy tranquilo y con mucha confianza de enfrentar a cruz azul
359139 yo no lo quiero llevar o que yo pretenda llevarlo
359140 a m me sorprende y qu buena onda que piensen que yo pero no ahora s que es verdaderamente falso porque yo no lo quiero llevar o que yo pretenda llevarlo y creo que lo interpretan porque como tenemos muy buena relaci n con la dirigencia de ese equipo deportivo la coru a pues a lo mejor piensan que todos los movimientos los tienen que hacer conmigo y no es as a m cuando me hablaron para decirme lo de colotto yo sinceramente me qued sorprendido pues no ten a ni idea de nada y dije ni lo estoy haciendo yo ni lo he pretendido hacer ni me han preguntado por l
359141 es bien complicado jugar con un hombre menos y por eso el esfuerzo que se hizo es enorme y el resultado es el premio a lo que hicimos en la cancha el gran esfuerzo de los muchachos merece nuestras felicitaciones y eso demuestra que es un partido de car cter hay una gran actitud y moral demuestran que siempre se entregan porque con 10 hombres siguen luchando y sacan un gran resultado con un gran equipo
359142 no la vi realmente hay que estudiarla pero tambi n hubo una acci n de parte de ellos que merec a la expulsi n pero la verdad es muy dif cil para nosotros observarlo
359143 go to such and such a club at such and such a hotel
359144 there is no way in the world we will make it through this season with just the significant contributions by one running back
359145 we have to have ryan houston play well weve got to have devon ramsay weve got to have jamal womble
359146 found out that maybe the best running back that we had on the football team was playing wide receiver
359147 i know i want to be a 1 000 yard back i want to be the best running back in the nation and thats what im setting my sights for
359148 by no stretch of the imagination is he a finished refined polished running back
359149 we have a lot of competition and thats a good thing
359150 hes got two of the qualities you have to have to be a great running back beginning with toughness and competitiveness
359151 he will keep getting better as a practice player and as he keeps raising his expectations hell figure out i have to work harder on this i have to spend more time on this because hes got so much pride hes going to want to be good
359152 hopefully it will resolve itself in the very near future
359153 escorted defendant to the middle of the street and told him to cross to the sidewalk defendant for the fourth time refused the verbal commands and thats why he was arrested

359155 thats the logic of infrastructure returns are stable and predictable you wont get fabulously rich but youll get stable cash flow
359156 were just looking at ways to be more efficient and thats why i used the term public private partnerships trying to find some creative solutions
359157 the reason im avoiding taxes is because i think taxes are addictive
359158 economic conditions are tough and are going to be very harsh on the performance of state budgets in 2008 and 2009
359159 states are looking for long term solutions in running businesses a public private partnership is a tool in their toolboxes
359160 weve seen an unprecedented number of headhunters recruiting for positions on the buy and sell sides
359161 were very committed to this space our business activity has increased dramatically even this year
359162 the argument for a public private partnership is the private sector is a lot smarter about paying attention to costs and because it has skin in the game will be more attentive to maintaining an asset over its life
359163 elected officials often shortchange funding of maintenance because they dont want to increase user fees or taxes to pay for it
359164 their election cycle is four years they can pass it on to someone elses watch
359165 lotteries have infrastructure characteristics in that they have stable cash flows and high barriers to entry
359166 they could even attract private equity investment because they are self financeable and require minimal capital expenses
359167 lower and more predictable landing fees and terminal rentals for airlines which certainly arent flush

359178 if the cabinets support rates remain low there is a possibility that moves to oust fukuda will become public due to anxiety about fighting an election with him as the campaign poster boy
359179 that is why some think that the appointment of aso is a strategic step toward replacing fukuda ahead of the election
359180 the main reason for their enmity with this nation in the past 30 years is that they want to force the iranian nation to retreat

359192 theres outrage among anglos and latinos over what happened and i think thats representative of the attitude here
359193 lets call it what it was it was a street fight a chance encounter with a tragic outcome
359194 they called each other names the victim was calling them obscenities vulgar names and they said things back to him that would hurt him
359195 it just means it was a foul mouthed argument not ethnic intimidation
359196 he worked hard so his kids would have more than he had growing up
359197 he talked a lot about how we take so much for granted here
359198 i just dont understand how you can beat someone so badly when you dont even know them
359199 people here are just ignorant they think life begins and ends in shenandoah
359200 its very stressing because you just dont expect it if you had a child thats constantly in trouble youd say hey well this is coming any day
359201 colin was a great kid and fell into a bad situation he never really gave me any trouble
359202 i feel sorry for the families and anyone who cares about mr ramirez
359203 you would be proud to have any of these kids in your classroom and any of them as your children
359204 to this point in their lives they have done everything right
359205 the young guys around here are racist because they think theyre so much better than everyone else
359206 why do so few people succeed when there is so much opportunity in the world

359213 i think youve overpaid for executive compensation overplayed your hand with microsoft and overstayed your welcome
359214 they can regain my confidence but theyre going to have to prove themselves first
359215 competition is good for the industry and for consumers so i am happy that microsoft did not succeed in acquiring yahoo
359216 yahoo has actively participated in these human rights abuses including the censorship of information and in one case turning over information to the chinese government
359217 i believe you are moral but the only morality you believe in is profit and self interest
359218 he is as some would say a good guy despite the bad things written about him we look forward to him being a productive member of the board
359219 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
359220 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage

359223 press tv is an english language international television news channel which is funded by the iranian government based in tehran and broadcasts in english on a round the clock schedule
359224 what we dont want to see is the fact that we have hundreds of folks in guantanamo bay who have never had their day in court
359225 as a former army soldier who served in iraq i am going to support and defend the constitution in the united states of america the fact is the america that i fought for is one that understands that we are not perfect we have a lot things to do when it comes to justice especially with regard to what is going on in guantanamo bay right now
359226 nosotros no estamos peleando para tumbar a evo morales sino por una cuesti n social por la jubilaci n para todos los trabajadores a nivel nacional por lo tanto que no se maneje que este movimiento de la cob como si estuvi ramos en contubernio o en complicidad de la derecha jam s estaremos en esa situaci n con la derecha porque la derecha es una representaci n neoliberal y no podemos estar confundi ndonos con un movimiento totalmente de los neoliberales que hicieron gemir a este pueblo de bolivia durante m s de 20 a os
359227 el principal aliado de la oligarqu a es evo morales porque defiende a los latifundistas a los ricos que explotan a los trabajadores y pagan salarios de hambre que evo se defina si va a seguir con los ricos o se va a venir con los pobres
359228 nuestra lucha debe ir dirigida a arrebatar la fuente del poder econ mico de esta minor a olig rquica y latifundista eso significa luchar por el cumplimiento de las agendas de 2003 y 2005 nacionalizando las empresas trasnacionales y recuperando las empresas capitalizadas as herimos de muerte a los gamonales frenamos el saqueo generamos fuentes de trabajo y superamos en los hechos la pobreza ancestral a la que nos ha sometido el capitalismo y neoliberalismo
359229 el gobierno dijo la asamblea minera ya no puede eludir irresponsablemente este camino basta de concertar con los conspiradores y saboteadores del verdadero proceso de cambio el cambio no debe ser frase hueca sino cambio estructural para recuperar nuestros recursos naturales y explotarlos a trav s del estado bajo control social nacionalizar e industrializar nuestras riquezas debe ser el objetivo inmediato la experiencia ha demostrado que s lo el pueblo a trav s del estado puede hacerlo
359230 fui ricevuto dal santo padre scritto nellautobiografia con molta cordialit non tardai a capire che voleva discutere di questioni riguardanti il nazismo che in italia e in germania erano allordine del giorno mi disse che non faceva che pensare e ripensare a quel problema e che era sempre pi convinto che il razzismo e il nazionalismo si confondessero
359231 quello che gli era piaciuto del mio libro commentava il gesuita era il fatto che avevo trattato del soggetto dal punto di vista spirituale e morale e che del resto mi ero sforzato di confrontare la dottrina cattolica sia con la legge naturale sia con lesperienza concreta per cercare di abbozzare una qualche conclusione pratica
359232 non pi soltanto disse a un gruppo di suore del cenacolo il 15 luglio una o laltra idea errata tutto lo spirito della dottrina che contrario alla fede di cristo
359233 successo che il papa dopo avermi imposto il segreto mi ha ordinato di scrivere un testo di unenciclica destinata alla chiesa universale sul tema che lui considerava il pi scottante del momento ha detto che gli ero stato mandato da dio proprio nel momento in cui cercava qualcuno a cui affidare quel compito dica con grande semplicit ha aggiunto quello che direbbe se fosse lei il papa mi ha allora esposto il tema a grandi linee il metodo da seguire e i princ pi da osservare
359234 tutti i governi deuropa nello spazio di ventiquattrore invierebbero una quantit di persone in vaticano a portare il loro punto di vista
359235 come mai litalia abbia avuto bisogno di andare ad imitare la germania
359236 ma solo con la doverosa applicazione di onesti criteri discriminatori
359237 no non possibile disse ai cristiani di partecipare allantisemitismo riconosciamo a chiunque il diritto di difendersi di assumere i mezzi per proteggersi contro tutto ci che minaccia i suoi interessi legittimi ma lantisemitismo inammissibile noi siamo spiritualmente semiti
359238 in ogni caso si prega di non toccare i paragrafi 126 130 sulla diversit delle razze anche i pi piccoli dettagli di questi paragrafi sono di estrema importanza essi inoltre sono la risposta pi diretta e pi precisa ai desideri del santo padre
359239 coloro che hanno innalzato la razza su questo piedistallo usurpato hanno reso un cattivo servizio allumanit
359240 finisce per essere unicamente la lotta contro gli ebrei lotta che non differisce n per i veri motivi n nei metodi se non per la crudelt sistematica dalle persecuzioni esercitate ovunque contro gli ebrei fin dallantichit
359241 la questione ebraica nella sua essenza non una questione di razza n di nazione n di nazionalit territoriale n di diritto di cittadinanza nello stato una questione di religione e dopo lavvento di cristo una questione di cristianesimo
359242 si dovr conferire al tutto scriveva il generale la forma voluta il che non cos semplice experto crede
359243 mando a v r una copia del lavoro del padre lafarge con la preghiera di percorrerlo e di dirmi se crede se si pu presentarlo in questa forma al santo padre come primo schema ne dubito molto se la r v fosse troppo occupata prego di darlo sotto segreto al p rettore rinaldi
359244 beatissimo padre scriveva il padre led chowski a pio xi mi permetto di mandare subito a vostra santit lo schema del padre lafarge sul nazionalismo e varie note fatte dallo stesso padre al padre rosa e a me parve che lo schema tale e quale non corrisponda a ci che vostra santit aveva desiderato il padre rosa cominci a comporre un altro schema ma non aveva le forze per un tal lavoro vostra santit sa che siamo sempre alla sua disposizione lietissimi di poter rendere a vostra santit qualche piccolo servizio se vostra santit desiderasse che si facesse un simile lavoro sarebbe forse bene di seguire il metodo che in altri casi si mostrato buono vuol dire far prima un breve abbozzo secondo le indicazioni di vostra santit per poter poi comporre lultimo schema
359245 para trabajar no me gustan los problemas por eso mejor prefiero quedarme aqu con mi familia y s lo salir a trabajar ir a la iglesia y al supermercado
359246 no todo el mundo es malo aqu hay gente americana muy buena que nos saluda y trata de integrarnos en la comunidad
359247 prefiero sacarles la vuelta y no enfrentarme a ellos por temor a que me ocurra lo que le sucedi a mi amigo el era una buena persona y no merec a morir as

359257 things ill do when i can comfortably pay my rent
359258 this isnt about definitions this about action on the ground to help these workers
359259 ever since i made my announcement ive just not been able to get anything going
359260 i kind of just managed my game today the wind was going different ways
359261 se enga a qui n piense que es posible configurar un escenario pol tico en iraq sin la resistencia
359262 ha sido la ocupaci n y sus secuaces quienes inventaron el confesionalismo los partidos que est n en el poder no representan al islam sino a su propia confesi n que no es nada m s que sus propios intereses pol ticos
359263 la pol tica es la guerra pero con medios no violentos y la guerra es la pol tica con medios violentos

359266 el proyecto es ahora un proyecto estadounidense y no tiene nada que ver con el proyecto de la resistencia
359267 if you tell anyone i wont be your boyfriend anymore
359268 when that happens on the field usually guys have helmets on
359269 but this happened on the sidelines so it probably wasnt a good idea
359270 offensively were tuning some things up weve got two more games before the real deal starts
359271 i dont think any coach in the top 10 pays attention unless theyre not used to being there
359272 die fans waren ein wahnsinn es war w hrend des rennens so laut eine richtige g nsehautstimmung
359273 in der weltstadt wien vor so einem publikum ein rennen zu fahren ist etwas ganz besonderes ich freue mich riesig ber meinen erfolg heute
359274 2006 und 2003 konnte ich das rathauskriterium gewinnen heute waren zwei kollegen einfach st rker
359275 ich bin schon oft in wien gefahren aber so eine stimmung wie heute habe ich noch nicht erlebt einfach einzigartig
359276 ich wollte der paolo maldini von paris saint germain sein aber leider ist es nicht m glich
359277 whatever happened in boston is in the past im excited man i cant wait i feel like i took 5 000 pounds off my back
359278 i want to say something from the bottom of my heart
359279 i want to thank the fans in boston i love you guys i just want to move on im thinking blue right now im thinking about the dodgers i want people to judge me on what i do here not what i did in boston
359280 im going to start maybe stealing some bases i dont go deep anymore i just hit line drives to right field
359281 im like a little kid now im kind of nervous
359282 im just going to be manny and play the game
359283 in our hearts it is and in the mexican community it was 66 then it went to 99 in a matter of minutes it was all through the agent scott boras and his staff
359284 clean it up a little bit and make it manageable
359285 ive got to cut it im going to be looking like a baby
359286 i dont want them to treat me different than the other guys if they want me to cut it ill cut it it will grow back
359287 we are disappointed in this outcome but our complete review and this final decision is in the best interest of our program
359288 we outlined for josh the expectations we had for him when he arrived and unfortunately those expectations have not been met josh needs to learn from this experience we hope he can move forward in a positive manner
359289 we have allegations in our complaint that adam pacman jones was involved in the shooting
359290 jack nicklaus isnt here so i guess thats a substitute
359291 the usga put some pin placements on us today that almost defy the imagination
359292 its just treacherous treacherous greens out there with some unbelievable pin placements
359293 im not going to comment about the golf course the usga should know better
359294 hes relieved but feels that it never should have come to this that cuban had withheld this money really out of spite and it was just unnecessary
359295 so while nelsons happy and relieved hes not happy that he had to go through this and that cuban would do this we consider it a pretty shameful episode
359296 the sad thing about the entire situation is that if nellie would have come to me and asked to get out of his contract so that he could coach the gs warriors i would have let him
359297 instead he lied about it all and it took a lawsuit to find out the facts
359298 what i saw last weekend because i watched pretty close and what i saw this weekend the field should be very frightened
359299 i ran that lap and crew chief tony gibson was telling me how awesome it was and everything i said man if jimmie can beat that he can have it
359300 well he not only beat me he humiliated me by 2 tenths of a second those guys are looking pretty potent right now
359301 i think weve gone in the right direction im glad i did my job and hit my marks its a very technical track a lot like indy where its easy to miss one of the corners
359302 right now our first goal is that weve got to make the chase
359303 one thing im proud of this team for is we never want to be fat and happy with six races until the start of the chase theres a lot of time for other guys to figure things out we need to act like a top five team and run like a top five team well reflect on what we accomplished at the end of the year so lets just stay hungry
359304 im going to go out there and play my heart out and try to shoot as low as i can and not really be concerned about what phil does
359305 hes going to be focused on his game i just hope we both have a good day
359306 to me him not being here is the difference between 39th and 38th
359307 obviously hes a part of the green bay packers this is really something thats been out there all along
359308 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
359309 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
359310 you get some butterflies but once you take that first hit youre ready to go
359311 i was always a shy and reserved person who just wanted to work hard and stay in the background
359312 theres no need to talk when youre a good athlete
359313 half of my teammates were mad at me so i said its better not to say anything
359314 he may not like it public speaking so much but he is really good at it
359315 damn iz diz r3ally it dat i finally ztpp3d l0vin him 0r wut
359316 when a hall of famer is coaching you you listen
359317 he knows this game and not just football he knows arena football as well as anyone ive ever met there are coaches that understand how to coach football but not all of them know arena football especially quarterbacks
359318 whenever i talk to him during a game hes always under control he never spazzes out and he knows what i did right and what i did wrong
359319 every situation has been different and all have been challenges this year has certainly been different ive never had a team had so much turnover
359320 im not looking to move but ive learned to never say never in this game wherever i go has to be in a good situation money isnt the end all be all
359321 im never going to have the war chest reagan has so i just have to work twice as hard
359322 really gives you a feel for what is on the minds of people in your district
359323 ron reagan doesnt feel the pain me and my constituents feel with insurance he should have done more for us on the insurance side
359324 id like to review the standards for bright futures scholarships
359325 her current doctors felt like it would interfere with her progress
359326 and that she would not be able to overcome that she would lose ground so we made a call on familys behalf
359327 we are extremely pleased that she will be able to stay in her facility
359328 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together black white hispanic asian native american young old disabled gay straight
359329 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago
359330 do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
359331 oil companies have made not because of their investments not because of their ingenuity and skill but just because of the increase in gas prices
359332 falls entirely on a windfall then it wont have any economic distortions associated with it
359333 there were mistakes made in the way this was done in 1980
359334 brings in fresh ideas to a certain extent the republican party has failed young people when i look at my granddaughter with all the debt we have we need some fresh ideas and new concepts
359335 i saw him being honest i saw him being sincere
359336 i hear the words but i feel your thoughts your smile even in pain a light for our lives my hand in a fist of anger still carries your weight your heart bleeding still lays soundly in my bosom my heart pounding still rests there in the crook of your neck your blood washes over me anew i caress your heart and thread my love and stitch my strength to rebuild that which scars my true love the salve to heal that which i have torn
359337 i wouldnt have any idea this early in the preseason whether thatd be an accurate ranking
359338 i know its something thats not very significant until the end of the year and thats what we talked about with the team
359339 once we hold up that acc trophy everythings going to be fine
359340 my first fall practice my first camp it was a little different than the spring
359341 i think i have to get better and make more adjustments
359342 lets go lets go the ball cant be on the ground
359343 if our guys see it and are hungry and keep the hunger and it creates a sense of urgency then thats good
359344 if they dont work as hard and say weve arrived weve got this ranking and go about business as usual thats not good
359345 we are disappointed in this outcome but our complete review and this final decision is in the best interest of our program
359346 we outlined for josh the expectations we had for him when he arrived and unfortunately those expectations have not been met josh needs to learn from this experience we hope he can move forward in a positive manner
359347 we have already stressed to him that his citizenship is of the utmost importance he understands that anything less than exemplary behavior will not be tolerated
359348 an eye for an eye will leave the world blind
359349 one of the problems weve dealt with quite successfully is the gun issue
359350 now remember were a free country like yours we believe in individual liberty and responsibility
359351 that helped but of course there were still people who didnt comply
359352 the way we ultimately solved the problem was for the government to provide citizens with the service of taking care of their guns for them
359353 we built huge buildings in every community and hired firearm experts to work there
359354 having the guns all day gives our government trained firearms experts a chance to modify those that dont comply with gun regulations in addition to making sure they are cleaned and stored safely
359355 a great side effect that we didnt anticipate was that it gives more freedom to everyone
359356 they know their guns are safe and well cared for and of course they appreciate not having to do the hard work of taking care of their guns themselves
359357 well some people complain that the government experts dont do a good job
359358 sounds great this is something i think we should consider here
359359 youll take my guns when you pry them from my cold dead fingers

359379 ich f hle mich auf jeden fall noch nicht wie 32 und ich werde meistens auf anfang bis mitte 20 gesch tzt
359380 bhs und liebesbriefe werden mir leider von meinem management nicht weitegeleitet und wenn mich frauen auf der stra e erkennen wollen mir alle in den bauch pieken aber das ist doch besser als gar kein k rperkontakt oder
359381 bei der kussszene mit angelina jolie war ich echt nerv s
359382 als ernsthafter schauspieler anerkannt werden wie zum beispiel matt damon
359383 ich lade dauernd leute zu mir nach hause ein und dann frage ich mich immer wieder was ich mir da angetan habe dann bin ich ein bisschen geh ssig bis sie endlich wieder gehen

359386 ich hab ein bisschen platzangst auf so schiffen wenn es dann weggeht und tagelang und ich hab nur noch irgendwie meine mitmenschen jetzt in diesem fall sind es ja 1200 das w re mir alles ein bisschen zuviel und zu eng
359387 mode ist mir pers nlich nicht allzu wichtig ich ziehe mich gerne bequem an am liebsten jeans und t shirts und wenn es ein tolles produkt ist wie zum beispiel die sachen von philipp also bequem und ansehnlich dann ist es eine besondere zugabe
359388 weil man sich mit mode einfach auch positionieren kann und man kann mit hilfe von mode einfach zeigen ich stehe hier oder ich bin so oder heute f hle ich mich schwarz oder heute f hle ich mich gelb irgendwie so und das finde ich ist ein mittel zu dem man immer greifen sollte man muss es nicht bertreiben also wenn man nur dar ber quatscht also ich finde man sollte sich im griff haben wie viel rede ich dar ber und wie viel anteil an meinem leben hat das aber ich finde es schon wichtig
359389 we have a saying going into each week it all starts up front
359390 if we dont win the physical battle youre not going to win the game we take pride in that more and more teams are realizing that if you have an effective unit its best to keep them together
359391 people are realizing you cant just pay one offensive lineman a ton of money not pay anyone else and expect to have a great offensive line
359392 you have to have a good mixture a good combination the interior is just as important as the exterior
359393 take a look at the guys they are playing against
359394 youre looking across at defensive tackles who are 330 340 pounds guys with tremendous anchor and athleticism so youve got to have these blockers
359395 our guys are athletic they can pull they are physical nasty hard nosed players those guys are the face of our team down the stretch we were able to win the physical battles each game
359396 teams realize how much money they are spending on quarterbacks

359476 this presidential themed exhibition is fitting for an historical moment for our state and country
359477 we want to welcome the thousands of people from around the world who will be here in september for the republican national convention delegates media and others in a way only this museum can offer
359478 we applaud the minneapolis institute of arts for embracing its role as one of the regions most important cultural institutions during a time of historical significance
359479 this will compliment civicfest as another way to give minnesotans an opportunity to join in the festivities around the convention
359480 this is a cultural catastrophe a national tragedy there is so little of art of such level in the former soviet union you cannot put a price on this and i am not talking about money here it is in every sense priceless
359481 we came in here to find that the wind was blowing the blinds around through a window with no pane
359482 it is a tremendous honor to be the first museum to present these drawings as a group to the united states
359483 we are deeply grateful to the biblioteca reale and to the foundation for italian art and culture for facilitating this initiative the birmingham museum of art is committed to bringing to our community objects of global significance that broaden appreciation for artistic endeavor our understanding of the world and ourselves these drawings by leonardo da vinci offer an unparalleled opportunity for careful observation and insight into the mind of a master

359488 still we live meanly like ants though the fable tells us that we were long ago changed into men like pygmies we fight with cranes it is error upon error and clout upon clout and our best virtue has for its occasion a superfluous and evitable wretchedness our life is frittered away by detail an honest man has hardly need to count more than his ten fingers or in extreme cases he may add his ten toes and lump the rest simplicity simplicity simplicity i say let your affairs be as two or three and not a hundred or a thousand instead of a million count half a dozen and keep your accounts on your thumb nail in the midst of this chopping sea of civilized life such are the clouds and storms and quicksands and thousand and one items to be allowed for that a man has to live if he would not founder and go to the bottom and not make his port at all by dead reckoning and he must be a great calculator indeed who succeeds simplify simplify

359499 while we still need court approval of our plan we believe the end of this complex bankruptcy finally is in sight
359500 all of the house of representatives members think it an election will come at any time

359504 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices

359506 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
359507 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
359508 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
359509 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
359510 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
359511 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact

359520 in recent weeks thousands of wal mart store managers and department heads have been summoned to mandatory meetings

359581 if anybody wants to drill off florida theyll have a fight on their hands
359582 unfortunately the proposal would eliminate floridas 2006 gulf protections and give floridians absolutely no voice in determining where exploration could occur

359600 people have told me that i looked sad when i was i competing but i never complained
359601 people assume a lot of things about gymnasts that the girls work too hard its way too much for them they are too young to work so hard i never personally complained everybody else complained for me
359602 in any case it was not too hard it was what it takes to be an olympic champion also nobody says anything about boys at 12 13 years old working too hard its only the girls oh poor girls why are we treated differently
359603 i basically have my life today as a result of what i did as a child what did i miss out on yeah i missed not hanging out at shopping malls i guess but that is not a big deal because you dont get a medal for that
359604 when i look back i am happy that my mum took me to the gymnastics club i didnt join gymnastics to become a famous athlete or celebrity it just happened i did more than i expected of course
359605 what is different is that they can make a living from gymnastics and people stay longer in the sport also you dont have to do four events you can specialise in one so that shortens their workout we had to do compulsory as well dont forget
359606 but the hard work is the same there is no magic pill you have to work and train hard
359607 people asked what was the secret of romanian gymnastics we just worked twice as hard as everyone else now everyone does it which is why they are much better
359608 we just came from the go team and it was really cool
359609 i like to hear everything the headliners get people out but the other side is coming out and checking out new stuff
359610 we mainly made the trip for rage against the machine
359611 when he is freed it is his right to go anywhere he wants
359612 the clash between the rat and the horse is a serious clash between water and fire
359613 for people born in the year of the horse it is recommended that they wear a pendant of an ox which will help to attract away the rat so as to minimise the influence of the clash
359614 the traditional belief is that you need an animal to attract away the rat
359615 according to the calendar it is an auspicious day there is nothing wrong with choosing this date it still represents a positive energy
359616 if you pick a good day this indicates a smooth beginning to the marriage
359617 you can see water trouble will be stronger in the second half of the year because of these seasonal elements
359618 for example the tsunami took place in december in 2004 usually water is more powerful in the months after august
359619 the new high end gear will be designed to add a significant amount of ap to protection warriors in order to boost dps and threat between that and new and revamped abilities and talents tanking should be a different experience in northrend for all classes

359625 they seem to get the attention but for guys like myself i dont care thats just not who i am thats not what im about im not doing it for recognition im doing it because i love this sport and i want to win and do the best i can if you do that people will recognize you
359626 listen we ought to call our pal and let him know that we care
359627 yeah the thing is im sure there are going to be lots of surprises and i dont know what they are and they always make me nervous
359628 julio is a good player he is a special athlete
359629 i think he has a good drive about him that can make this whole team better i am looking forward to throwing with him against the first team d everybody going full speed
359630 julio and burton scott both came up this summer and i think showed the whole team some things they can do
359631 i was really impressed by the freshmen who came in this summer
359632 i think it will make him julio jones better as well because i am physical and those guys out there in the sec are pretty physical
359633 the team was a lot closer than we were last year
359634 we talked more we communicate better on the field we just play a lot better together
359635 he is a great coach he has proven he is a winner we might as well buy into it because if you dont hell just replace you
359636 the john bull character was that of a drinking man hard headed down to earth averse to intellectualism fond of dogs horses ale and country sports during the napoleonic wars john bull became the national symbol of freedom of loyalty to king and country and of resistance to french aggression he was the ordinary man in the street who would fight napoleon with his bare hands if necessary by the 1800s he was seen as a more assertive figure in domestic politics as well prepared to criticise the royal family and the government giving those outside the traditional political process a voice john bull became so familiar that his name frequently appeared in books plays periodical titles and as a brand name or trademark although frequently used through world war ii john bull has been seen less often since the 1950s as uncle sam is the iconic representation of the united states so john bull is the personification of the character of the english honest generous straightforward with a zest for life and ready to stand up and fight for what he believes in
359637 moreover such a tax would cause long term harm to our energy industry discouraging investment into new production that will enable consistently lower prices over the long term after all it is difficult to secure or justify investment when there is a precedent that profits can simply be appropriated by the state for political advantage
359638 the people behind you must have been getting cross you were holding them up
359639 i assumed my treatment was tolerated by the british at a very high level
359640 this guys connections to different cells and plots just seems to be expanding he is the fish that is getting bigger
359641 i will kill every american that i see in afghanistan and every american i see in pakistan
359642 series of ideas repeated over time that links muslims with terrorism with extremism with incompatibility with british values those ideas are repeated over and over again and inevitably they are going to play a part in shaping public consciousness
359643 in some ways more damaging it portrays all british muslims with this notion of being extreme and incompatible with british values
359644 there is absolutely no fact in the story we simply had a uk wide savings marketing campaign which included pictures of piggy banks running until the end of september piggy banks have been and will continue to be used as a promotional item by natwest
359645 there are widespread fears that muslim immigrants reinforced by political pressure and ultimately by terrorism will succeed where islamic armies failed and change irrevocably the character of european civilisation
359646 there is a definite you have it the muslim community will have to suffer until it gets its house in order
359647 islamophobia is a tremendous force for unification in british public culture it does not merely bring liberal progressives like polly toynbee together with curmudgeonly tory commentators like bruce anderson it also enlists militant atheists with christian believers
359648 it soon became clear that this was more than a random rumination from a member of the government labour appeared to try to identify with a general mood of resentment and anxiety about the presence of muslim communities in this country and to intervene in the politics of religious identity
359649 we bang on about islam why because to the ordinary public out there its the thing they can understand its the thing the newspaper editors sell newspapers with

359661 the first generation of e commerce software still prevalent in todays market was based on the traditional proprietary software model

359677 we face a convergence of crises all of which are a concern for life
359678 every living system is in decline the forest cover the soil the oceans there isnt one living system that is stable or improving and those systems are required for life
359679 we had to make it just two people arguing the same point back and forth and at the end of the day it just became moot
359680 three of us in an editing room we made it with private funding so that no studio and no network could impose their agenda on it
359681 this is all stock footage we didnt have nature crews going out there to africa to get some of these scenic shots it was done by a lot of people donating services it was people with hd cameras interviewing people in my mothers garage
359682 some of the great experts and visionaries of our time
359683 the evidence is now clear industrial civilization has cause irreparable damage our political and corporate leaders have consistently ignored the overwhelming scientific evidence
359684 not only is it the llth hour its 11 59 what we saw with katrina is just a prologue the worst is yet to come the un estimates that by the middle of the century there may be 150 million environmental refugees there are too many of us using too many resources too fast the rate of decline is accelerating the tragedy is the potential extinction of humankind
359685 the danger is that the temperature increase might become self sustaining if it has not done so already the warming of the seas may trigger the release of large quantities of co2 trapped on the ocean floor in addition the melting of the arctic and antarctic ice sheets will reduce the amount of solar energy reflected back into space and so increase the temperature further we dont know where the global warming will stop but the worst case scenario is that earth would become like its sister planet venus with a temperature of 250 centigrade and raining sulfuric acid the human race could not survive in those conditions
359686 i think theres gotta be millions of heroes thats my answer to that
359687 during this critical period of human history healing the damage of industrial civilization is the task of our generation
359688 our response depends on the conscious evolution of our species and this response could very well save this unique blue planet for future generations
359689 i became an actor at a very young age but i also had a deep respect for nature i was sort of a little biologist i watched documentaries on rain forest depletion and the loss of species and habitats for animals around the world and it affected me in a very emotional way so later in life i wanted to investigate and learn more about ecological issues that sent me eventually into a room with al gore about 10 years ago who explained to me what climate change was and global warming and the science behind that and the decades of research that hed done on the subject matter it really propelled me to want to be more vocal about the issue because it seemed to me were at a real tipping point the weather patterns the floods and hurricanes all these things made me more proactive in the environmental movement
359690 were kind of in a pitched battle to save what we have and not to continue the destruction
359691 when we first started making this movie i was worried about the bad news and felt that we were going down as a civilization and as a planet but after interviewing all these people i couldnt be more hopeful i feel that we are really going to turn this around and that not only is the planet going to be better off but human beings are going to be better off
359692 i dont believe that people maliciously wake up in the morning saying im going to hurt the earth today
359693 all of this is simply a by product of the way we constructed society so we just have to redesign our society at every level so that it doesnt destroy the planet

359698 dont just sit there and waste your precious time when you want to do something do it right away do it when you can its the only way to live a life without regrets

359700 shall be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the human person and in a manner which takes into account the needs of persons of his or her age
359701 the order carries a lot of impact because of the minimum wage
359702 but were just waiting to see how that turns out
359703 to the extent that the order attempts to govern the constitutional duties for which i was independently elected to perform and
359704 because it is based on faulty legal and factual premises i will not comply with the order
359705 he has said he will not lower pay well see what happens
359706 we cant represent both the governor and controller if it actually comes to a legal standoff which hasnt happened yet we would have to say to both parties would have to go to outside counsel
359707 we understand the state has a serious budget problem and we want to work with the governor to resolve it however we can
359708 i think its absolutely essential youre only looking at the tip of the iceberg
359709 if taxpayers spend 2 million now that saves 2 billion in the coming years they should be delighted with that
359710 we dont have anything to do with the legal bills that have been paid by the house
359711 pennsylvania legislators tend to be slow learners when it comes to ethics issues anyhow
359712 they look at these things as hurdles to overcome rather than lessons to be learned
359713 ive never witnessed such attention paid to the mic channel in dj mixer between the effects and the eq i was able to not only handle a variety of acoustic instruments including sax vocals and percussion but make them all sound incredible
359714 placing the out 1 volume knob right next to the fx crossfader is just plain idiotic
359715 a digital mixer with no digital output is like kfc with no chicken
359716 this is a mixer for the future that doesnt forget the past
359717 poorly thought out considering how fluid the other sound shaping elements of the mixer were instituted
359718 working with the evo for a couple of weeks straight
359719 combined power of traktor the evo5 and the time coded vinyl
359720 besides the out 1 knob stepping on the fx crossfader the other obvious mistake is that the launch button should really be where the fx pfl button is so you can easily turn the effects on or off while rocking the wet dry crossfader or the parameter knobs
359721 i thought i was only going to be playing on the national team in europe and now having this opportunity is making this a summer of a lifetime
359722 it is kind of weird to be the only college player but im just going to try to learn from a lot of these guys take in everything and become a better ball player ive heard of a lot of them but ive never really played with them and a lot of them are older
359723 the teams from asia play the game a little different and play a lot of small ball i think im capable enough to play at this level
359724 a lot of what i did today were lessons i learned from her
359725 he played with a lot of emotion this week its been a very very rough week for him
359726 hes kept his focus and played baseball and i think its been a good release for him
359727 i wish i can explain it or someone can explain that to me
359728 its hard seeing tremendous defense tremendous pitching you go in there and dont do the job its disappointing
359729 they havent seen me and i havent seen them so they really had no idea how i was going to attack them
359730 i know we threw a lot of off speed stuff theyre a really good fastball hitting team and sometimes thats what you got to do to win
359731 you can tell theyre excited to be here and also they have an idea of what theyre doing
359732 you can say that but i think you have to give their pitcher credit for once
359733 i mean he pitched a great game we havent seen him and we didnt have a lot of footage
359734 there is no way in the world we will make it through this season with just the significant contributions by one running back
359735 we have to have ryan houston play well weve got to have devon ramsay weve got to have jamal womble
359736 found out that maybe the best running back that we had on the football team was playing wide receiver
359737 i know i want to be a 1 000 yard back i want to be the best running back in the nation and thats what im setting my sights for
359738 by no stretch of the imagination is he a finished refined polished running back
359739 we have a lot of competition and thats a good thing
359740 hes got two of the qualities you have to have to be a great running back beginning with toughness and competitiveness
359741 he will keep getting better as a practice player and as he keeps raising his expectations hell figure out i have to work harder on this i have to spend more time on this because hes got so much pride hes going to want to be good
359742 hopefully it will resolve itself in the very near future
359743 right now i just want to have fun and stay relaxed
359744 if you get too serious youre liable to mess up i know ive been training all year so theres nothing to be worried about
359745 if im an olympic gold medalist i can be the superstar i want to be
359746 or if im sitting around thinking my opponent is doing more than me let me do a couple abs
359747 obviously everybody is going to be waiting to see what are the repercussions for this event
359748 im just praying that we rally together as a team because obviously theres going to be some adversity here
359749 violent or threatening behavior among employees whether inside or outside the workplace
359750 conduct that imposes inherent danger to the safety and well being of another person
359751 i would assume it got started from a week in spartanburg in heat and going against each other every day
359752 steve was probably a little remorseful for what happened and was trying to apologize
359753 what i saw last weekend because i watched pretty close and what i saw this weekend the field should be very frightened
359754 i ran that lap and crew chief tony gibson was telling me how awesome it was and everything
359755 in the first half we still played some of our best soccer attacking the three early mistakes its hard to come back from that against a veteran championship team like vancouver
359756 its tough because we really played some good soccer against a team that is in first place
359757 i think we were the better team in the flow of the game but not the better team in the most important part which would be finishing and not giving up goal
359758 on the screen with a camera right in your face its totally different
359759 but i can be more myself so that makes it easier
359760 knowing were going onto their home turf will give us a little more pressure
359761 offensively were tuning some things up weve got two more games before the real deal starts
359762 he had a great game against us a few years ago the u s a and was real brash about it
359763 while some might have chosen to exhaust their legal options to try to force their way into the games jessica instead chose to put her teams interests ahead of her own
359764 whatever happened in boston is in the past im excited man i cant wait i feel like i took 5 000 pounds off my back
359765 its just a new chapter in my life im happy to be here thats all i can say las a great city im happy to be a dodger
359766 i want to say something from the bottom of my heart
359767 i want to thank the fans in boston i love you guys i just want to move on im thinking blue right now im thinking about the dodgers i want people to judge me on what i do here not what i did in boston
359768 im going to start maybe stealing some bases i dont go deep anymore i just hit line drives to right field
359769 can i go and get something to eat get ready for the game
359770 in our hearts it is retired and in the mexican community
359771 clean it up a little bit and make it manageable
359772 you get some butterflies but once you take that first hit youre ready to go
359773 i was always a shy and reserved person who just wanted to work hard and stay in the background
359774 theres no need to talk when youre a good athlete
359775 half of my teammates were mad at me so i said its better not to say anything
359776 you want to have good people on your staff and when you do other people want them too
359777 i coached the first soccer game that i ever saw
359778 luckily there are some similarities between soccer and basketball and i had some great players
359779 i worked to learn the game but the credit for the wins has to go to the kids
359780 there is never a good time to make a break
359781 there is always going to be a senior class that you wish you could coach
359782 it is time to spend more time with my wife gail she has sat in the stands for a lot of basketball and soccer games
359783 this is the most talent green hope has had on the soccer field since its inception in 1999
359784 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
359785 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
359786 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
359787 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
359788 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
359789 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
359790 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
359791 represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning
359792 do you think you are better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago if you arent better off can you afford another four years
359793 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
359794 een opvallend gegeven is dat de senaat zeer geheimzinnig doet over die begroting
359795 voor de buitenwereld is ze niet beschikbaar en alleen senatoren quaestoren mogen de inhoud ervan kennen

359797 theres just too much debris too many rocks flying through the air at the moment to be confident that we can open it to traffic
359798 weve just got to get that under control and hopefully well have it open to traffic by midday today
359799 insurance companies are reluctant to increase premiums but are increasingly under pressure because of the significant payments being made as a result of climate related events
359800 there is an increase in weather related events causing damage to property and this has to be taken into consideration when setting premiums
359801 nelson and northern marlborough valleys they would be the areas of concern for rain they are on watch
359802 we want to see the whites of the eyes of this thing first

359805 the predominance of catholics among the immigrants of the 19 th and 20 th centuries contributed to the lasting predominance of that religion
359806 is an end in itself rather than oriented toward marriage
359807 shared interests and value system the ability to give and take and flexibility
359808 qualities making for intimacy among european americans were those closely tied to personal efforts toward realizing ones individual identity if not freedom or independence individual autonomy in fact seemed to be taken for granted
359809 honesty and not expecting the other to engage in mind reading to know what is wanted or felt
359810 a girl will be ranked at a much lower status in the marriage market once it is suspected she is not a virgin
359811 sexual liberation and freedom sound very attractive but on closer scrutiny can be seen to be fundamentally harmful to both the individual and society at large
359812 appropriate criteria for mate choice personal compatibility political attitudes and character
359813 historical and contemporary evidence suggests that chinese intellectuals have held notions of black inferiority
359814 anti black bias can in turn be seen in the context of a recrudescence of elitist values that link and denigrate those who are dark and those who are poor
359815 to gain social status are considered unscrupulous social climbers who do not genuinely care for these women
359816 when women leave the university campus to go shopping downtown they prefer to wear their university id badge because they dont want workers coming up to us and starting a conversation
359817 openness honesty and transparency in self disclosure an assertive clear disclosing of and sensitivity to thoughts and feelings
359818 a hand movement a smile and a shrug convey embedded meanings
359819 nonverbal communication often provides important cues for interpretation of verbal messages
359820 while personality is undoubtedly a factor in interpersonal synchrony culture is also a powerful determinant
359821 becomes fully aware of how many differences there are how deeply embedded some of them are and how these differences are going to affect their life together
359822 most social scientists writing from an assimilationist perspective see the amalgamation of different racial groups as an inevitable final step and perhaps if the time span is stretched long enough some type of racial intermingling will no doubt occur
359823 if one of the partners is forced to adhere to a more severe role delineation than was customary at home there may be severe problems
359824 a smart man learns from his mistakes a wise man learns from mistakes of others
359825 further analysis provided empirical support for cognitive dissonance as an explanation
359826 voters use political polls to maintain or move to a state of cognitive consistency
359827 serve to relieve the cognitive dissonance associated with consuming a potentially deadly product and maintain a loyal readership
359828 our first observation was how deeply penetrating disneys influence had been
359829 more adversarial making presidents more certain than ever that reports from the battlefield will do damage to their own efforts as well as the national interest this fear has motivated the white house to seek greater controls over what the media reports
359830 war has always been beastly but the vietnam war was the first exposed to television cameras and seen in practically every home often in living color
359831 the art of message management was never carried to a higher form than during the reagan years
359832 about half the time the white house press corp is going to be pissed off and thats alright youre not here to please them the most powerful tool you have is the ability to use the symbolic aspects of the presidency to promote your goals and objectives you dont let the press set the agenda they like to decide what is important and what isnt important but if you let them do that theyre going to trash your presidency
359833 while the unresolved conflict with iraq referencing failed un inspections provides the immediate justification the need for a substantial american force in the gulf transcends the issue of the regime of saddam hussein
359834 see in my line of work you got to keep repeating things over and over and over again for the truth to sink in to kind of catapult the propaganda
359835 at aamir khan productions akp we dont work like this i only make a film i like and if i dont like a script i dont make the film its as simple as that
359836 this kind of trending happens once in a lifetime its like sholay
359837 once this work is done the city will still have some flooding but that it will be manageable
359838 studies have already been done to indicate that we need to rebuild these levees to a stronger standard that category three category three is asking for trouble
359839 where you had wetland the levees were not eroded and where you did not have wetlands the levees were annihilated
359840 between those who had argued for rebuilding to be allowed anywhere in the city and those who wanted the most flood prone areas abandoned
359841 strong protection is the linchpin that everything else depends on
359842 for people to come to the city and invest for the people to feel secure
359843 i was lucky to get out this time and they cant even tell me they gonna make things better my family has been here for generations but its the next generation im worried about
359844 all things considered plan allows controversial rebuilding in new orleans
359845 rebuilding new orleans economy and heritage favour citys renewal some say its too risky
359846 shrinking city no one disputes that katrina will reduce the population of new orleans area but just how much is unclear
359847 levee construction will restore but not improve defenses in new orleans
359848 its time to abandon new orleans if the bush administration continues to ignore the major fixes that are needed it would be homicidal to rebuild the city
359849 case closed it was him we caught the anthrax killer
359850 i didnt really go to church up until i was 19 years old
359851 i began to ask god are you real are you out there at some point at maybe two or three in the morning and after having stayed in the hospital for 24 hours a day seven days a week during this three week period in 1986 i was alone with my grandfather and i had an experience with christ it was as if jesus just walked into the room and said im alive your grandfather is okay and he is in my hands thats when the journey began
359852 i wanted to go to a region of the country that wasnt the bible belt where there was a need for evangelical bible preaching churches
359853 a professor was talking to another student in his office and was talking about new england being a region that needed an evangelical voice and all of a sudden it was like my whole being was like a heat seeking missile right for new england
359854 over the past eight years weve seen the church growing steadily year after year and weve had a lot of people come to know the lord
359855 weve had a lot of people who were part of the establishment for years who have become part of the leadership as well weve all come together as part of a team
359856 i feel that you can hear god just as much as we can
359857 you can take him home with you and he has a purpose for you i think what we try to do is allow them to know that you can take this home and do something with it its not a sunday to sunday thing
359858 one is that we have been able to help people find and utilize their gifts and talents in the work of the lord
359859 another reason is that god is doing something very special with our church hes lighting a fire on this place so this fire will spread throughout the community our community desperately needs help
359860 were in a blue collar city and its not like theres a lot of money around so were going to utilize as much space as we possibly can
359861 the people have given faithfully and thats whats really allowed us to make these plans its exciting and humbling
359862 have you caught your significant other in the act of ogling been busted yourself
359863 lets face it reading environmental journalism too often feels like eating your vegetables boiled with no butter but at grist we believe that news about green issues and sustainable living doesnt have to be predictable demoralizing or dull we butter the vegetables and add salt and strain metaphors

359873 before we started the round i said to my caddie one under par today is a good round
359874 what were they thinking you have to hit a perfect shot
359875 if you go past the hole on any of these greens you are faced with a really severe downhill fast putt you have to really pay attention
359876 the wind just added to the difficulty of the greens we dont want it to get any harder and we will do everything possible to keep it from getting any firmer or any closer to the edge
359877 we felt like it was some compensation by moving the tee up 16 yards and giving them a shorter club to hit
359878 i hit the ball really really well today really well between the wind blowing and gusting and the pin placements were on a scale of 10 a 15 it was all i could do to survive
359879 anything under par was outstanding just hats off to them it was very very difficult out there today
359880 eh thats easy i could do that in 2 seconds

359894 its very very helpful to have a student in the class who along with me remembers lyndon johnson and his presidency who remembers nixon who remembers jimmy carter
359895 younger students have read about and heard about it but they havent lived through those administrations and all the things that occurred then joann offers a very welcome perspective shes lived long enough to see a great deal

359909 properly structured so that it is not just a quota
359910 take into account class and hardship to assess whether or not a young person is deserving of opportunity
359911 we have to craft it in such a way where some of our children who are advantaged arent getting more favorable treatment than a poor white kid who has struggled more
359912 i support it i do not believe in quotas but i have not seen the details of some of the proposals
359913 mccain also may not be as learned at articulating the nuances

359936 it is the scientific viewpoint of the circles effect research organisation ceres that crop circles which are more complicated than simple round ones are either hoaxes deliberate pranks or experimental hoax like creations for whatever purpose e g advertising film making the teams of circlemakers who produce the complex designs become ever more experienced at executing arrays of circles which are sometimes planned at length over winter on some occasions farmers have colluded with the circlemakers to facilitate their efforts reported cases of complex crop circles as having appeared in a matter of minutes are spurious and are the result of the field having been inadequately observed previously
359937 this was the most difficult milestone in development of the falcon 9 launch vehicle and it also constitutes a significant achievement in us space vehicle development not since the final flight of the saturn 1b rocket in 1975 has a rocket had the ability to lose any engine or motor and still successfully complete its mission
359938 much like a commercial airliner our multi engine design has the potential to provide significantly higher reliability than single engine competitors
359939 we made a major advancement from the previous five engine test by adding four new merlin engines at once

359942 how much money do you think that we will need for the week
359943 but its really no different than the enigma of day trading or forex people are not necessarily afraid of investment process but merely of the high risk involved
359944 its better to look through the mid range online casinos companies for ones with strong growth potential
359945 weve seen more people getting into investing and more company executives doing more aggressive marketing and sales with the knowledge that they are backed by a diverse number of share holders
359946 and they took it very seriously confidentiality especially in the online casinos market is of core important and these students were able to finish a great analysis without duress
359947 im thrilled to report record growth in the online casinos sector
359948 this signifies that anyone who invested their money more than three years ago saw a 25 return on their money which is fabulous
359949 be prepared for a wait of on average 3 5 years before expecting any sort of return that is the way the online casinos market works and with patience you can walk with big money
359950 with the internet and vast array of research information available starting up is much easier and significantly less costly this allows us to push profits right away and to establish a solid presence in the online casinos field quickly
359951 but we have a strong relationship with our top investors and they know the online casinos field very well as a result no one gets gun shy or cold feet

359954 over the longer period does it make sense to incur more expenses in the united states
359955 if the rupee gets down to 37 or 35 to the dollar then it would make sense to create another development center in the united states

359960 the captain wear that c barry wore but i think they lost that particular c when barry quit wearing it
359961 and you guys the media have a lot to do with it
359962 you come up with the kid for griffey and with bruce almighty for jay bruce and that catches on whatever you want and whatever the organization wants
359963 but i think it is about time for me to step up and fill those shoes that griffey left do even better than ive done
359964 with griffey gone it is time for the team to step up and do what we have to do im sad hes gone he helped me made me what i am before he left he told me be yourself and thats what im going to do
359965 there arent a lot of guys you can always kid with and have him always be the same guy
359966 when he came into this room you knew what to expect
359967 the rumors are every year and then when the deadline passes and im not moved im happy i dont want to move during the season thats a huge hassle on everybody so im very relieved its over
359968 as for griffey on the day he was traded i asked him anything in the works he said nah and then it happened that day when he told me i thought he was lying like he always does
359969 from a selfish personal standpoint it is going to suck without him being around
359970 the first thing that came to my mind was wow ive been traded for ken griffey jr
359971 thats a guy i watched growing up one of my favorite players what an honor to be in the same trade as him
359972 we still have to win ballgames im going to give him time well see i talked to him about hitting third about what i required a third hitter to do without taking away his aggressiveness id like him to be a little more selective at the plate pick his pitch
359973 he has batted third most of his life and now well see
359974 we want the guys in the three four five spots to drive in runs as well as score runs cut down on the strikeouts we talked about the more accomplished hitter he could become like carlos lee to drive in runs and just an outstanding hitter like lance berkman
359975 ive hit two games no 3 in the big leagues but no matter what it is where im used to hitting
359976 with ken here there was no question who was hitting third and i dont make out the lineup im just ready to play every day i will say im used to it and thats where ive hit
359977 i made the best of it but hopefully this will let me get a little more comfortable and back to normal dusty told me i need to focus on quality at bats and swinging at good pitches sometimes i dont give myself a chance and itll come with experience
359978 it is going to be different now that kens gone its a new era he was the franchise since 2000 and now hes gone and were starting a new time with the reds and im ready for that
359979 im more comfortable in center than right but the plan from the beginning was for me to play right and i welcome that
359980 im sure there were some good things to take from this and i know there is a whole lot of bad things including the line score
359981 what doesn t kill you only makes you stronger unless they cut your arms off
359982 see theyre still attached you know what i ll wake up tomorrow get in here bust my butt and keep pushing forward one way or another i don t give a damn i m not going to let a couple of bad outings knock me down i m going forward no matter what it takes
359983 he is not hitting the corners he is over the heart of the plate those are low percentage spots if you are going to get hitters out at the big league level a lot of those balls were down the heart of the plate and they got a lot of hits again in a short period of time
359984 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
359985 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
359986 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
359987 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
359988 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
359989 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
359990 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
359991 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
359992 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
359993 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
359994 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
359995 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
359996 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
